rating,review
bad,Not a very good place to work. Horrible management team. The management of the company is the reason for its bankruptcy. Pay is horrible and not conclusive.
bad,Put in over 30 years with this company only for it to go out of business leaving thousands of people without jobs.  We were not kept up to date a about status of employment.
bad,"Great place to work when they were open , always enjoyed my work there but again they closed and filled chapter 11 , it will be missed Business  is close"
bad,"Terrible management, horrible Regional manager who was dating a store manager on the side while cheating on his wife. Yet somehow that manager had preferencial treatment, I am glad it went down in flames"
bad,You won't likely find employment with this company any longer. Was a fun job however. They spread themselves too thin in my opinion and got too far away from what they had become known for.
bad,"it was a nightmare to work for them. They didn't pay you for overtime, they didn't provide your store with necessary equipment, they requested you to spend personal finances traveling all over with no form of reimbursement except a lengthy and complicated paper filing form. it was disgusting"
bad,Although i did not like the environment of radio shack if the company was still around i would have recommended that job for anyone who was really into technology
bad,The last year I worked there it was all about damage control for liquidation. Nothing made sense for employees. District managers were leaving like wild fire.
bad,Working with Radio Shack was well worth experience. It focus me on which taking a management role and understanding the product knowledge of different gadgets within the company. I really didn't like my location where I was at because I always had to fear for my life sometimes. But on good side I love working with co-workers I had and all
bad,"Poor management and business structure was the demise. "
bad,This business is almost extinct.  Very few physical locations exist and I believe those are all franchises.  It was a low paying job with no expectation of paying you much unless you sold literally everything people didn't want or need.
bad,co-workers were amazing. Company in its self was not the best. Expected the most for so little in return. Had me running a store with no compensation. Was upset because i put in over time as we had no coverage on the floor. did not feel appriciated.
bad,"The company ran itself into the ground, and it deserves it. many wouldve described it as a revolving door where careers go to whither. please never reopen."
bad,"Contratos temporales no renovados"
bad,"My direct manager was great, but the corporation as a whole was horrible. Upper management was all about themselves and didn't care for the people that worked under them. They were very cold and uncaring during the layoff. It was a very dark and sad place to work for."
bad,"It was a miserable experience, where I was routinely lied to by my bosses, treated poorly because of my gender, and belittled by my district manager. Putting in my two weeks notice was one of the most satisfying moments of my life."
bad,"I'm not sure that Radioshack is still in business. I loved working there, was always at the top of the comissions list for the district. Completed management training, then the kingdom started to fall. Salary structures crumbled, and I got out while I was still able to get a decent sales job elsewhere."
bad,"There was no communication between upper management to store level. The intensive programs were never completed, meaning that when you reached the goal that was put before you for the compensation promised, they never gave it to you."
bad,all of the radio shacks have closed due to company closing. It was a nice place to work for a short time but then got to be strict on pay. Left to find something more
bad,If you are looking for a job in sales dont go here the manger i had took my sales and cut my hours and let me go since my sale were 0. on black friday i would have had like 20 sales and my boss took all of them and told me to go clean.
bad,They went out of business because they lost touch with the core customers and instead focused solely on cellular. It wound up killing them from the inside out. My store was one of the highest rated in the region for general sales and cellular because I was able to teach my team that cellular is great but that's not what the customer is always coming in to look for and to open a broader conversation with them.
bad,"Radio shack was a good place to work. Laid back atmosphere and setting. Too bad the place closed down, which forced me to get another job at a different place."
bad,Radio Shack was great to work for. They are now closed. but if they came back I would love to work there again. This was my first retail job and the training was well done.
bad,"I was laid-off, it was awful working there. Your supervisors/managers are messing with your times in regards to lunches and breaks you don't have the opportunity to take. Your schedule can change at the drop of a hat and you get threatening phone calls from your manager that you'll be fired if you don't show up because someone working there longer didn't appear today. To many times to count I spent waiting onsite, outside of the store for a couple hours ( I was paid for it-- minimum wage, no commission) in the freezing cold for a key-holder to show up. To leave without waiting would have put my job at risk."
bad,"Radio Shacks are closing all over the country, if they all havent closed already.  I wouldnt send any to get a job there.  But if you get an opportunity,make the best of it."
bad,"I honestly wish I had anything helpful to say in this section. The company does not exist anymore. Which is a shame, given that our district was one of the best out there."
bad,"My experience at RadioShack a few years ago was awful because it didn't let me grow or learn new things, the manager wasn't nice because he would not let me make any cellphones sales without giving the sales to other co workers."
bad,Working at Radio Shack made me feel like a snake oil salesman. I was forced to make swales quotas for Cell phone and satellite dish sales rather than just helping the customer.
bad,The boss i had was the worst. The people i worked with were fun. Gained some electronic knowledge and learned alot about toys and cell phones. Pay was terrible
bad,I would not ever work for this company again as the hours were all over the place and they kept moving me from store to store to fix the problems with each store.
bad,This company have fallen to pieces. It was never a very organized company and their prices rose so high no one really wanted to shop there. Other stores offered better deals on almost everything.
bad,Doesn't matter as all corporate locations are closed. Was a decent work eviorment if you had a good DM. If you had a bad one it was the worst place in the world for pressure to perform.
bad,"Terrible compensation models combined with attrocious product endorsement lead to Radio Shack's ultimate demise. Where the world thought ""cool toys and electronics!"" Radio Shack thought ""Cell Phone Plans!"". They had a tendency to not listen to their employees, and listened less to their customers."
bad,Pay sucks. Upper management sucks. Complete liars and do not follow through with what they say. Liars. Evil. Promised to stay open and to give according bonuses based on performance and did not follow through.
bad,This was my least favorite places. We were robbed 4 times while I was there. The quotas we had to meet were unreasonable. The company was eventually bought out due to poor management.
bad,They closed why do you need a review they closed because they went under and sprint bailed them out the reps were underpaid Ed for what was expcected and left for better opportunity
bad,they treat their employees as trash and all they care about is hitting numbers monthly. i would not recommend working here to anyone even if it was a last resort
bad,This was the worst job ever. Underpaid and overworked with an impossible bonus at risk. No wonder they went out of business. They really were terrible.
bad,Radio shack was one of the worst places I ever worked. They manager above me was pretty incompetent and I did most of his work for him and then never got compensated.
bad,"This company is out of business.  No one can work here.  Why are you making me review a company that doesn't exist.  They are gone.  Disappeared.  Poof, no more Radioshack."
bad,"Mostly dealing with people that cant work there product."
bad,they are no longer in business not sure why im even doing this. poor management led to there down fall and they screwed over loyal employees on there way out.
bad,"I enjoyed working with some of my employees but over all the job was not my favorite. If the pay was better it would have been worth it, but with small minded people working there it was hard."
bad,The company is bankrupt and doesn't have a working platform any more. This is poor implementation on Indeeds part to force a review on former work employment. Shameless data mining
bad,"I don't really know what to say about RadioShack. My time spent there wasn't all bad, but the oversight, and management was terrible. its no wonder that they went bankrupt. honestly it was good experience for me as for a period of time i was one of only two employees, and the acting manager despite being 19, and RadioSHack Being my first customer service Job. Gave me good experience on how to be a manager, and i learned a lot about what being responsible for a store is about."
bad,"company just booted everyone out. and management was terrible consistently berating employees, not monitoring poor staff, poor working conditions filthy break rooms demanding and demining"
bad,"the company's management drove the bus into the ground. pay was horrid and even though I acted as manager for 3 months, they gave the manager position to a 'problem child' from a different location"
bad,none of the manager have clue whats going on it was difficult and not very entertaining. I pray for the others. If everyone were on the same page the business would make sense.
bad,it no longer exists. this place was a sweat shop. You couldn't do anything but stand around and pretend to do something productive like vacuum the store a thousand times
bad,this company never had a chance with the poor excuse for management and willingness to train new employee's in the proper manor of sales and paper work for managerial postions
bad,"The companies management was horrible, some stores were stocked with employees. while others like the one i worked at had two. No job training to make commission, had no licence to sell  cell phones, no benefits. this company is trash and i don't think they even exist anymore"
bad,Almost immediately after hire I started looking for another job. Sales were important but not recognized unless it was a phone sale. Upper management were always micromanaging to the point of insanity.
bad,"RadioShack has closed.  I learned a lot about interacting in a corporate environment while there.  However, I was paid more as a part time cashier at my next job than 5 years of employment earned at RadioShack."
bad,I did not enjoy working for this company although I had to continue working here in order to better provide for me family and loved ones at the time ;
bad,not a good company no good pay they want u to work like a slave and not worry about your pay at all and treat the staff like trash didnt like it dont work for me.
bad,"It was not organized and poorly conducted"
bad,it was a poor place to work.  Radio Shack made some poor choices that drove it into the ground.  Relying on mobile phones to keep you a float is a poor choice because it means that you are never looking for the next thing that the company can use to prosper.
bad,a very boring place and not paid well at all. cut throat as far as sells go and is now out of business had to go into bankruptcy i would not recommend working here.
bad,"Sales Floor, Assisting customers that walked in and answered any questions they had.  Running the money to the bank and closing down the store.  Sales Spiffs"
bad,"Radio Shack was a starting place for me AFTER I left the MArine Corps. I had just married. My wife was an immigrant and spoke very little English and did not drive. When I worked at Radio Shack, I was 3 miles away and was able to leave when needed."
bad,Radioshack was a great place to work but during my time there it increasingly became more difficult to succeed due to micromanagement from DM and little interaction with GM about opportunities for individual site needs. Not each store had the same clients and needed more specific influence from different categories to succeed and there was little to no ability for the Store Manger to do so. They got in trouble if things were not setup exactly according to planograms.
bad,Company went bankrupt and left us to believe everything was good till the day of shutting over a thousand stores down. then left to close the store down with no benefits or a plan
bad,It was place to work very stressful place to work. I work their twice which a better place back in the 1991. I was top sales men of the year. My manager was great.
bad,all the stores were under staffed and the staff that was there was over worked and had their jobs threatened if they didn't work over time or go way beyond their job description.
bad,"The wireless carriers located within the stores was alot of businesses revenue. When the carriers would choose to, or are forced to leave a store, the store would soon suffer and eventually close."
bad,"The place went out of business, so I don't know why i have to waste my time. This place was joke. At one time it was a great company with fresh ideas, but know they are gone."
bad,"Very low pay, lots of pushed quotas and objectives by higher ups with virtually no instruction or direct coaching on how to achieve goals, also mandatory 6 day weeks and over 50 hour work weeks"
bad,"This was perhaps the worst job I had ever had. I was supposed to only work a maximum of 30 hours a week but due to only having two employees, My self and my manager, I had to work so many more hours."
bad,Management was awful as well as regulations. The pay was way to low for the job requirements and the tasks to learn and complete were useless. Training was a joke and moral was always extremely low.
bad,Very slow day at work.  I have learned a lot about electronics.  Managers are real hard on you some times.  Hardest part of the job is finding your manager to ask a question and get an approval or denial.  It is very stressful sometimes because the manager doesn't want to deal with any problems here.
bad,"Whatever you do, do NOT accept a job as a store manager for this company. The pay is terrible and the hours are worse. This business no longer exists for a reason."
bad,"come in and help customers find what they were looking for and upselling cell phones, pay you miminum wage with comission but everything price wise is so high people would go to walmart instead leaving the employess with no commision"
bad,"This was a terrible place to work."
bad,"company out of business , mandatory 54 hour work week, sales gains were most important aspect, long hours and little respect for employees f you struggled.  very high turnover rate for managers ."
bad,Why would you work for a company that is closing? Don't even think of applying unless you want to make less than you would at McDonalds. The only thing they actually sell is wall phones.
bad,"It was an okay job but due to radioshack going bankrupt they ended up closing most of there stores, they pay was okay and they also offered ot which was good I wouldn't recommend this job"
bad,"I was really excited to work at RadioShack when I first got hired. I wanted to gain Sales experience & learn new things, since it was a tech store. Things weren't going so well at the time & everything seemed like it was falling apart."
bad,If this company had not filed bankruptcy twice in 2 yeas I would have loved for them to have kept me. They however closed all stores. Overall This was one of my favorite jobs ever.
bad,Just can't seem to get the RadioShack brand doing well in the market place. Now their are filing bankruptcy.  Wouldn't recommend working there because of the company's instability.
bad,"It was a standard retail job in the electronics field.  You would help customers with finding the parts, or products that they needed.  Take payments on prepaid phone plans.  Do display resets. The hardest part was having to close the store."
bad,"I was promoted from ASM to Store Manager in a matter of less than 6 months. Business was great, but then RadioShack took a turn for the worse, and so did business."
bad,They have gone bankrupt only franchises left. I am not sure of any of the possibilities of Radio Shack returning nationaly. Maybe as an online retailer.
bad,Not a good place to work for.  All the independent stores are closing or closed.  NO room for advancement then in the company so I don't know why you would want to work there.
bad,"The company has filed for bankruptcy, is closing stores, and many hard working people are losing their jobs and careers due to poor decisions made by upper management and the inefficient utilization of company assets."
bad,It was too long ago since I remember working here. I do not remember it being a bad place to work for but I think they are gone now but I suppose it must have given me a decent start
bad,This company is no longer in business. I left before they went bankrupt and it is a matter of public record as to why they are no longer a company. There are no jobs here.
bad,"Management was terrible, employees were nothing to them. A typical day of work involved arguing with other sales associates about possible theft of sales or customers. Frequently watching other employees lie to customers to help guarantee a sale. Dealing with the angry customers who were lied to later."
bad,"Im glad I had the experience, but it was a very poor place to work. The store that I worked at is not even around any more. The managing was sub par and the associates were treated to be competitive with each other and there was not a lot of opportunity to grow."
bad,They did not have their life together or their businesses. They had to file for bankruptcy then closed many stores. They closed the store I worked at with no notice.
bad,"Not only was the company in complete disarray, they made so many decisions that caused not only their best employees to quit. They also drove their whole company into the ground."
bad,Nothing should keep you here long. If you happen to work at a RadioShack that's not closing go ahead and leave. No proper benefits or incentive to work.
bad,"Radio Shack is a non-existent company, but here goes."
bad,Radio Shack gave me the opportunity to get started but it definitely has been failing for a long time now. Sprints largest stock holder/investor purchased what remained of RS.
bad,Not around anymore they closed down already. It was going down hill when I was there and not it is not there at all at least not in my area. Wouldn't recommend
bad,"For you to be able to advance if you want to make it a career, you have to kiss up to the managers or you'll be overlooked, it also helps if you're related to the manager."
bad,i worked for almost three years. while it was a good job during schooling it also had its downs. If youre a good sales person then it will be no problem.
bad,I didn't like working here at all. Not enough business to keep up with the numbers they expected you to hit a day and a month. I hated pushing the phones on every customer that came in per management. Every conversation had to be tied into wireless. We had to be too pushy with 65 year old customers who had stopped by for a capacitor from the parts bins.
bad,"I learned allot about people from my time at radio shack. when i was "
bad,The pay is not so great and commission is a joke.  The company filed for bankruptcy and closed all the stores.  RadioShack didn't pay their managers seperation bonus as promised.
bad,I worked as a sales associate on the sales floor also was a cashier. One of the hardest parts of my job was sometimes dealing with rude customers but I always kept a positive uplifting attitude. What I enjoyed about my job was enjoying engaging conversation with some customers and putting smiles on there faces
bad,"Very low pay and abusive management.  I've been gone from there for almost 30 years, but I doubt much changed in that time.  Adding characters to meet the minimum requriement."
bad,There is nothing nice that I can say about this company. they are so cold and uncaring about their employees and they force this crazy way of sales upon you.
bad,Terrible Terrible Terrible. I no longer support this company or their way of profitability. Continued to sell products knowing the longevity. I was offered many higher positions of this company including running stores. I couldn't bring myself to work for a company that cared nothing about their customers other then selling them contract cell phones
bad,"I right this later in life and this is grim and depressing, there are almost none left. i worked at one in a bad neighborhood, it was allot of topping up prepaid burner phones and helping people that wanted no trace of there activities being monitored or recorded."
bad,Obviously everyone knows how horrible Radio Shack was. It was ranked in the Top of worst companies to work for. It was outdated and never changed with the years in retail as competitive as it got.
bad,Not sure what to write. This was a great company back in the 90s. They started to lose money and started to treat the employees like trash. Customers made the rules. Probably why its bankrupt.
bad,"Radio Shake attracted a lot of high school kids, because of the science projects they did. It was also a place for elderly people when it came to Tracfone amd Cricket."
bad,"I didn't like it very much, maybe you will, good out of highschool job or while in highschool job, overall not good though, but hey its a job at least"
bad,"Never again! Horrible morale! Boss stealing sales, or making you stay while she dealt with personal business that was none of my concern. Treating customers with disrespect. Never again!"
bad,Company is bankrupt. Stores are closing. Obviously not a place you would be trying to get a position. Poor decisions were made by upper management which doomed the company.
bad,The company is going under and trying everything they can to stay afloat by going online but that isn't even working. The job pays horrible and the commission is even worse.
bad,"there is not much that can be said about Radioshack now, it was once a great company but through bad leadership it lost its footing and is not a very great place to work, due to there struggling environment the work load at all store level position is taxing and requires more than what the brand can offer or promote to even be up to pare with there competitors."
bad,The manager was good and understanding they didn't give enough hours the pay rate was not good the commissions were very low most of the products you could find cheaper at Walmart or online.
bad,"Greet customers, help them find what they are looking for. Explain functions of particular products and what they are looking for or in need of. Learned a lot about electronics."
bad,"no room for growth and the company shut down without telling us they were closing. Pay would have been ok if they actually sold modern products, since majority of pay is based on commission you didnt make any money selling casette cleaners in 2016"
bad,"they are corrupt all the way up to the CEO of the company. i wish i can say his name. they steal money from you. their discriminatory, i got so angry i even had to file a complaint with the EEOC with them in february thats why their out of business. The store supervisor is allowed to take anything he/she wants from his/her store and walk out. you ask questions and you get fired or written up. Nothing is fun about this place. Even if money is short in the cash register it comes out of your pocket."
bad,"There is an alternate reality, not too dissimilar from our own, where Radio Shack still exists as a viable retail corporation.  But the decision to emphasize cell phones above all other areas of business and to rid themselves of their older, more technically inclined sales associates, led to The Shack's downfall.  Radio Shack could have been a true leader in the maker movement but they wanted the residual scraps from the cell phone carriers (who every year expanded their own retail footprint while strangling both commissions and residuals)."
bad,"It's work. We all need money to live. This is a job that will pay you money for services. That's all anyone wants from a company, but this company no longer exists."
bad,"Radio Shack,company no longer as large as its once was."
bad,"Too much inventory."
bad,The owner of the local store I managed was awful but that is beside the point here. The Corporate RS structure was deeply flawed which lead to the company filing for Bankruptcy twice which is why they are now practically 100% out of business. I don't recommend working with this company at all.
bad,Worked seven days a week an hour before opening an hour after closing to make sure that the store was at the best operational method. Never noticed and underappreciated the manager was very rude and he never acknowledged anyone.
bad,"I worked 70 hours a week, open to close shifts 6 days a week. i would be stuck in the store by myself all the time and never was given support by DM's There was no quality of life and the pay was horrible"
bad,"When I first started, it was a great place to work. With new ownership and deals, the company has gone down hill completely. Bad organization, communication, and pay."
bad,The company is failing and failing fast.  The problems started when RadioShack began to expand their operations in to areas that they were not experienced in.
bad,i did not enjoy working here my manger was a cun* who liked to talk about me behind my back and then the company declared bankrupcy idk why anyone would like to work here
bad,They set these outragious expectations and goals. One day you may  have a job the next day you have a sign on the door saying pay rent and you are locked out. STAY AWAY
bad,I only worked here for 3 weeks so I can't really give a well in depth opinion. All I did was stock & when I tried to help a customer another employee would take my sale.
bad,"Very skillful job you do have to take in a lot of information, not a lot of room to grow in this job, meet a lot of people as well, coworkers don't help out a lot"
bad,I worked there 20 years ago and retail is a dying business model so I would not recommend this career.  The company is almost bankrupt
bad,There's nothing good about radioshack left. If you're a manager with radioshack prepare to kiss your work life balance goodbye.
bad,"They treated their employees horrible pay for the amount of work and hours managers had to put in, horrible work home life balance. management don't understand the type of customers we had and expected unrealistic expectations out of their employees. the hardest part of the job was having to do inventory then work the next day and deal with customers that had an old gift card and tell the it wasn't worth anything"
bad,"Worst company i have ever worked for"
bad,This place is probably the worst place that I have ever worked for. The corporate BS that goes on in this company is not worth minimum wage.
bad,"They are currently out of business. I had to work every day, which was not a problem because  that meant more money in my pocket. The company was micromanaged, in-which I did not care for. My co-workers were great. Every one worked well as a team."
bad,The pageant in a row and I'm not going on and I will be in the morning and then one day it will be in the morning and won't see mine till you take ibuprofen you can tell me anything in the morning on the loop after I'm evicted and and then no worries who wants it was a fling I'm
bad,Upper management not employee friendly. All they want you to do is sell cell phones. Benefits are non existant.  Very stressfull work enviroment.
bad,"Radioshack isn't what it used to be.  A Radioshack salary can barely support one person, so imagine a family. My biggest check averaged $400 while working full time. Radioshack sees nothing wrong with how they pay their employees."
bad,"I did the overall running of the store. I would open and close the store. I did sales, cashier, stocker, hiring. I set sales plans for the store and the employees."
bad,I honestly dont remember working here too much. I overlapped a lot with another employer. The perks were cool. I hope this is twenty words already.
bad,I wish I had accepted the job offer for the Sprint half of the store. The manager was rude to staff and customers.
bad,Working for Radio Shack was the worst retail experience I have ever had. The District Managers were always the most out-of-touch morons they could find. At one point we had a District Manager who was using a stolen identity to get the job. They clearly don't care and are doing anything to make a buck at the cost of screwing over their employees. Since working for them I refuse to shop there and tell people they should do the same. They shouldn't get away with how they treat their employees and they deserve to go the way of Circuit City.
bad,Worked in the Janesville WI location in the mall. My manager was all around a terrible person alone much less a poor manager. 7.50 an hour and then they expect you to bleed for the company while treating you like garbage for not doing there bidding. Toxic work environment filled with yelling and disrespect. All around it comes down to the difference between a leader and a boss. THIS RadioShack has a boss. She won't lead just make you feel like trash for not doing her bidding.
bad,"I honestly didn't like the work here. Slow stores, company bankrupt, pay is not worth the job. Not for me. Commission based plus hourly."
bad,"The company filed for bankruptcy. This is not the problem. The problem is that they focus on sales while preaching customer service. "
bad,"Sales & cashier"
bad,It is clear why they went out of business. you were a slave to the company. the pay was low and they expected you to do a lot for as little as you were paid.
bad,"This was one of the greatest opportunities I had to grow as a manager. I learned so much with the Shack... Hiring, merchandising, managing..."
bad,management expected a lot from us in a slow store. they wanted us to meet our sales goal but there was no customers. the district manager was always rude
bad,"Radioshack only paid me back for my stolen iPhone that I bought at the store when I was employed, but not the case or insurance that was on the phone which was the same amount as my pay check was at the time. HOPE THEY ARE HAVING FUN WITH BANKRUPTCY!!!"
bad,They expect you you have an engineering degree and 10 years of experience to work part time for minimum wage. Management cuts hours and pay and tells you it for your own good.
bad,"If you are brand new to retail, or just graduated, this is a nice company to cut your teeth for a very short term.  Poor pay and benefits will keep most away."
bad,a careless company that will milk their employees for nothing in return. false hopes or raises and job advancements. its a joke simply.  they have their employees for dirt cheap.
bad,"Great, personable place to work. Learned to manage retail. The most enjoyable part of the job was the ability to profesionaly assist customers."
bad,If you like working with the public and working long hours than this is the job for you. They don't really tell you what to do but they do tell you what they don't like.
bad,"The only reason I stayed at this job as long as I did was because my manager and coworkers were amazing. Terrible pay, the higher ups  didn't care about anyone at the stores, horrible hours, and pretty much no benefits."
bad,"The co-workers were great to work with but due to the location I worked at, customers weren't easy to work with. The few regular customers were excellent though."
bad,High pressure sales they micromanage conference calls several times a day to update your number or sales for the day. Although now I heard sprint has their reps selling phones there now and the radioshack employees are just pushing batteries and transistors ect.
bad,Having difficulty finding its way under the new management structure.  It will be interesting if this company under its current structure survives.  I have serious doubts.
bad,"I worked there for 9 months. 0 advancement, poor ethics and methods for employee customer relations. Would not shop there or recommend"
bad,It is a waste of time for terrible pay and even worse hours. Whatever you do please find a different company to work for. I dont want to type anything else.
bad,"I have personally witnessed people being fired because they were due for a promotion or pay raise. They also took away my full time pay because minimum wage was raised that year. They said that because minimum wage went up, that counted as my raise so I no longer qualified for full time even though I worked 40 hours or more for three months straight. I am shocked at how they are allowed to treat some of their employees and how they get away with firing cashiers because of how much money they get paid. unethical, and just flat out wrong."
bad,when i worked there i enjoyed my job. i learned how to be a salesperson i got along with my co-workers. the hardest part of my job was learning how to be a salesperson. the most enjoyable part of the job is working with people
bad,"Radioshack was run extremely poorly, with seemingly little attention to the Store Managers. The most difficult part of the job was planning for sales growth. Prices and specials were constantly changing and left no room for a Store Manager to manage his business effectively to his clientele. That combined with frequent inventories at all store locations made the work life balance very one sided. Not conducive to a family life."
bad,"Horrible pay, no benefits, stores closing down one after the other due to bankruptcy just a terrible dead end job. i enjoyed my co workers but that's about it."
bad,"company had a poor structure. over inflated prices and a very poor support system. Upper management communicated very poorly to a store level. When they closed my store no one even came to tell us. It was a email to my store manager. No jobs were offered no compensation, just clean up and get out."
bad,no it was a disgusting place with a bad location and people tried taking your sales while management did nothing but laugh
bad,"we went through 5 employees until the manager finally quit, huge fiasco. store went under when we could have been a powerhouse if we were supplied with the right amount of inventory"
bad,They were a rough company to work for. Consent hour changes. No clear focus and micro management to a point that you want to scream.
bad,"This company is closed for good reasons. Was constantly known as a ""showrooming Company"". very high pressure sales, nothing positive about it. horrible upper management, terrible communication skills in every way. little to know training on new/current products."
bad,poor pay and management. gave me a raise and then took it away. waste of time. almost no management. ask too much of you but don't pay you enough for what they ask. changes too much.unorganized
bad,"dirty work which is ok but the pay is low and the supervisors were not very nice, plus they were corrupt and looked out for their own."
bad,this company was once this highlight to my life and is now the cancer to my life and feel like its sucking the life out of me.
bad,"This corporation has been in decline for years and the senior staff member have no clue as to where Radioshack is, or is headed in the future. within resigning this 75 year old company filed chapter 11. Unfortunately the pressure was put on district and store managers to deliver a product and brand no one wanted.."
bad,"typical day consists of troubleshooting peoples tech problems and getting them the right parts to solve or complete their project. working here taught me how to deal with stupidity, lack of resources,and incompetent management as well as working around it. By far the hardest part was having to find ways to work around this self-destructive corporation while still trying to help people."
bad,I spent too much time in a company who does not respect their employees. there is absolutely nothing good i can say about RadioShack
bad,this was an ok job and i did not make too much money. they are all goinbg out of bussiness and stuff so do not work there. there were times it was fun. i like cell phones. i like cake too.
bad,low wages cut hours poor management. Lack of leadership declining paychecks the hardest part of the job is dealing with annoying customers
bad,"terrible place to work "
bad,Worst job that I have ever had. Management was horrible and never listen to you. If you wasn't part of the so called management crew then you didn't exist to them. Wouldn't recommend anyone to work there.
bad,"This place has a lot of room for improvement, period, point, blank.  The culture, if there is any, is downright horrible in every shape, form or fashion."
bad,Company was busy not very much room to grow. So many rules that were broken by management very unorganized and never enough staff members.
bad,I hated every second that I worked for this company with exception to most of my co-workers. They just kept reducing the commission and talking to you like you were slow in the head. They would cut your commission and try to convince you it was going to help you get more money!
bad,"Management is sloppy, ranging from not ordering enough supplies in the back office, the bathroom, the main floor, etc. The foot traffic that goes by on the boulevard is the absolute worst; in that location, cars drive by on Ventura on their way to Hollywood and usually don't stop. They only have two parking spots out in front, and our customers are constantly getting parking tickets. Shipments of merchandise we receive aren't even what we asked for, or even need, as the only way to truly make good commission is to sell high priced samsung and apple phones. "
bad,"Way over worked for what they pay. They change focus and policies almost weekly and pay structure about once a year, always changing it so you make less. They keep cutting budgeted hours so that you're almost always running the store on single coverage yet are still expected to compete the numerous menial tasks they throw at you last minute everyday as well as provide a GREAT customer experience for all customers. Corporate just doesn't have a clue, it is no wonder why they are going under. They do not value their employees at all. They're advertisement for this job is completely false, run as fast as you can."
bad,Working at radio shack was an experience in its self. but i learned alot there
bad,No Comment because it wasn't a good plays to work at. No comment
bad,"I worked for Radioshack for nearly two years, at multiple locations, with many managers and in all cases it was horrible.  At a large scale Radioshack has no idea what their business model looks like, what their future looks like, who shops their or what they want to be.  At a management level pressure is put on managers daily by their supervisors to hit illogical goals or else.  At an individual retail employee level the directives coming from corporate or even a store manager change every day so that no one is able to build consistent success in any one area.  It has transitioned to a cell phone retailer but not offered the proper amount of support and training to employees to ensure the customer has a positive experience.  Time not spent selling cell phones is spent accepting returns for inferior electronic products or replacing signage from botched marketing ideas.  I'm not one to be so negative (worked their for 1.5 years without demerit) but this company is a hot mess and treats their employees poorly from pay, to benefits, to scheduling."
bad,"little pay, long hours working away"
bad,"Over working due to lack of staffing, with no attempts to promote up. Plenty of vacant leadership spots but no signs of trying to move people in them nor to hire qualified people. Districts have stores being ran by assistant managers instead of actual managers."
bad,"The management, compensation, sales goals, and culture was terrible. This was the worse job I ever had"
bad,"The schedule is all over the place and doesn't come out until the day before."
bad,"Long hours, low pay, management was non-existent, co workers were nice, friendly, quotas were unrealistic and changes to commission scale kept wages low."
bad,no hours for employees to actually make some real money and short pay
bad,Retail is always interesting and can be good or bad. I would never work for this company again
bad,"Micro management and company was not strong,woorked long weeks and no family time"
bad,"at the time the manager that i had made the job a living down below, sorry but she didnt give me a nice experience for my 1st job"
bad,easy work days. customer interactions. sales. cleaning. learned about electrical components. jobs very easy.
bad,"Spent one day in unheated back room training on the computer, one day training in heated back room with manager yelling at me that I was not completing the training fast enough. He asked me to give up the desk as he had an emergency situation and spent my last day at the register training and shadowing him. Very low respect for older, highly educated and experienced employee. Felt there was resentment on his part and fear of competition and no clear expectations nor understanding of  the RS training program. Very poor management attitude toward training program and older employees. They never paid me for three days work! No wonder they are almost broke."
bad,Nice place. Great environment co workers were a blast. Long days.
bad,DO NOT work for Radio Shack if you plan on getting screwed over.
bad,I briefly worked at Radioshack. The management was unfair in scheduling employees and it was subjected to a robbery. I thus did not return.
bad,"During my three years with Radio Shack, our district went through 7 different district managers, each one wanting to completely overhaul and change everything just for the sake of changing something.  To add to the stress of the lack of managerial stability, I was personally shuffled around to 6 different retail stores due to a lack of replacement managers being hired to replace the 8-10 managers who were either terminated or quit during that period.  "
bad,"Horrible Regional and District managers"
bad,As a manager expect to work 60 hr weeks. You will be criticized for everything. If you hit sales plan the dm will complain about how you hit plan. Completely thankless job with low compensation.
bad,"Underpaid associates. Bad management, and compensation. Have young kids running stores that has been with the company for 3 months."
bad,"Don't expect to make any money here, not fun at all , lots of standing around doing nothing, not very good at revi"
bad,"Radio Shack is not a company i would suggest anybody looking for career advancement, decent compensation or even to simply be respected as an employee apply to work for.  I have honestly never in my life witnessed a company organized as poorly and operated as unethically and unprofessionally as Radio Shack."
bad,"The pay is laughable. After nearly four years and a promotion into management, I barely broke 20K this year. Managers make very aggressive, gendered remarks about job performance. Men who are half as qualified get promoted above me. I get texted on a Thursday telling me I'm expected to be in at 6:30 AM on a Sunday, even though policy requires them to schedule at least a week and preferably two weeks in advance. There is no attempt to make the workplace safe, and I've had customers try to physically attack me more than once. I've even been physically assaulted by coworkers. This is by far the worst job I've ever had in my life, and I wouldn't recommend this company to my worst enemy."
bad,N/a; I didn't really like this job; It was very tiring coming in that job every day without someone getting in trouble.
bad,"A typical day at work is being told how poor you are doing and that you can be replaced easily.  You learn how to mentally zone out at this job, especially with the co-workers being on jail birds or untrustworthy people that Radio Shack trusts with consumer info such as social security numbers.  The enjoyable parts of the job were NONE - this was the worst place I have ever worked.  I had better jobs in high school cleaning up peoples garbage than I did here.  They also made employees dress as elves around Christmas and if you did not wear what they had it was a write up..."
bad,I worked at a radio shack in 2008 hadto quit due to moving qwrqwdrqwfr
bad,The problems with this company are mainly at the corporate level and not the store level. Lack of direction and poor management have ruined what was a quality company. Four CEO's in Three years....
bad,"Horrible structure top to bottom.  No room for advancement within the company.  Compensation was extremely low.  Managers are pushed beyond limits with extremely limited guidance and/or assistance."
bad,"I would never wish this work environment on anyone. This was the most unorganized job I've ever worked, with no room for advancement at all."
bad,Promises never fulfilled. Only care about dollars per hour in sales and not anything else.
bad,"My review does not accurately depict my work at one particular store, but my evaluation of the company itself."
bad,"prepare for hell this company pays minimum wage and pushes you like your an animal. there are so much better places to work than this. however you can make some commissions if you sell a lot of phones, but that is the only way to make any money at this company"
bad,The worst company I ever worked for. Very high turnover. worked there for 3 1/2 years and had 13 managers
bad,"Working at Radio Shack was a good experiences but a really BAD one. Theirs a lot of favoritism in that company. If you decide to work there, i would only recommend to only work there for just extra cash. not a good company. From what me and my grandfather read on the web it is the #5 top worst retail job to work at, so i wouldn't recommend it."
bad,overwork underpay. no clear vision. win at any cost atmosphere
bad,"OK for Sales Associates, except that full time employees cannot expect more than 32 hours/week. "
bad,Had a manager who worked bankers hours while the rest of my staff and I picked up his slack! District manager thought nothing was wrong with him working bankers hours and stealing sales and he still continues to work for the company even after he got caught editing his time sheet! Sales associates get paid min wage plus commission  which is not much and as an assistant manager 8.70 per hour plus commission. They company is so busy trying to revamp their image that the pay is garbarge.
bad,"Way to much pressure for inadequate compensation, all upper management cares about is the ability to produce metrics, they promote people to be store managers based only on their sales numbers even if they are operationally horrible and then wonder why the store looks a mess and nothing is being done properly."
bad,radioshack was very unorganixed and the managment sucked real bad. there was no athority at all.
bad,"The metrics are set to high for employees."
bad,"Radio Shack (in Thomasville atleast)  was a terrible place to work! But it was due to the manager or more appropriate dictator, but she is no longer there so feel free to apply. I hear since she has been fired it is a great place to work though :)"
bad,"okay , nothing much to say except your pay was based on how much you sold"
bad,"If you have to work at RadioShack for whatever reason, I suggest you do whatever you have to, to make ends meet, but  this is one of those jobs you will either quit or get fired from within a year or so if you can make it that long. The second worst occupational experience of my life, no pay, no hours, terrible sales and commissions plans, useless mindless arbitrary work requirements and goals that change sometimes daily, horribly un or undereducated management, just a company on it's way out of business and aware of it. Run, run far and run fast,  fast food work would be better..."
bad,"The management changed and he began to cut my hours even though I had the highest sales in store,. "
bad,"The Manager at this store was very rude and did not understand anything involved with family nor did he have any sort of respect for employees after a period of time. He favored the employees who had been with the company before he arrived yet after recruiting me, he felt the need to belittle me everyday as well as make crude and sexual preferences towards me and other members of staff. My mother was on Life Support and I ended up quitting my job as he could not understand how my Mother had so many health issues and would not allow me to take the day off to be with her in her horrible condition, yet it was okay for him to take a week off when his mother had cancer. "
bad,I would never work for that company again for the simple fact that the people I worked under did not care about being a leader or their employees growing. 
bad,In the five years I've worked for Radio Shack it's gone down hill fast. I've lost almost 15k because of them restructuring pay plans.
bad,The pay was horrible and the requirements were way to high for the pay
bad,Another place where its a paycheck and that about it. Unless you like batteries great discount on those
bad,i would sell phones all day. i would help customers pick out their electronic devices
bad,learned that there is alot of favortism and threating your job daily
bad,"I went into this company expecting one rate of pay, got one completely different. I was to be trained to be a store manager, the individual training me was the worst possible person in the company. They lie to customers, treat employees like garbage, and expect you to ditch your family to tend to their personal needs. Upper management does not want to help with customer issues if they aren't there, but expect you to drop what you are doing whenever they call."
bad,"Do not work for this company, they do not stick behind there employees. compensation is very unpleasurable."
bad,Lack of Customers. Slow Slow Slow. Worked Alone. Not enough training.
bad,"A typical day at work is standing on your feet for a 10-12 hour shift while you make minimum wage with no benefits, no paid vacation, and no real breaks. You work all holidays except for christmas day and thanksgiving day, which they are trying to take away for sales gains. Management will abuse and slander you on conference calls and then not have the dignity to speak to you personally. There is no enjoyable part of this job and there is no perk to working here. Run in the other direction as fast as you possibly can. Working at mcdonalds or walmart would be preferable to this hell hole."
bad,Wasn't an enjoyable place to work. Management wasn't helpful or considerate of they're employees!
bad,"Small minded, Micro-managers, wasn't being paid for all the off site work that was completed as overtime."
bad,On a busy day work is great! When it's slow it drags. the co-workers were awesome but the management wasn't so much. A lot of favoritism was shown. The most enjoyable part was making sure my customers left happy.
bad,"paid by commission, It was a part time job. Co-workers had to work for their paycheck"
bad,"The job at Radio Shack was far from rewarding. When I had worked there they told us that managers were to work 6 days a week, and 50+ hours. It did not leave you with much of a home life. Then to top that with the meager pay it really didn't sit well for me. The upper management wasn't helpful at all, and frankly seemed like they didn't want to be bothered. I received training for about a week and was sent into my new store that was... well.... destroyed. Rough company to work for. I was looking for a new job as soon as I started."
bad,"Store manager for several years. I believe each store/district/region is a reflection of its respective management - some are pleasant, others are not. My experience was that ""fear of job loss"" was a strategy used to coerce employees into separating customers from as much of their money as possible. The corporation has high sales expectations and generates a high degree of competition between stores, districts, etc. All sales results are measured constantly and the consistent message from district and regional management was something like, ""None of you are good enough and we will fire you if you don't get better"". The atmosphere was high pressure, high stress and mostly negative. I eventually came to believe that this was a strategy starting at the top - the basic tool used to scare everyone into 'selling' as much product and/or service as possible, by any means necessary. I did my best to protect those on my team from the negativity that I dealt with as a manager, but eventually the culture wore me out and I had to leave."
bad,"Assistant manager, this was the job I didn't enjoy. I didn't have fun at all. Bad benefits etc"
bad,The manager did not care about the workers and he felt that their whole life should be that store. Not for minimum wage. It was not that great of a job.
bad,"Radio Shack has adopted a 'born and raised' mentality, so unless you start literally at the very bottom, you have no hope of any type of management position."
bad,"the job was a fairly typical retail store job, however, the pressure to deliver top results was the number one focus. Customer service was low priority. The direction was always do what's best for the company, not the customer."
bad,"if your good at sales, this could be a good job since its only minimum wage plus commission. the manager was applying for jobs instead of working. there was not enough training or leadership."
bad,My store was constantly getting robbed at gunpoint. The benefits were horrible and you weren't eligible for benefits until after a year. You can make $10 - 18 hour if you are highly motivated to sell contracted cell phone plans. You are pressured too much for such little pay.
bad,There is no recognition for a job well done. There is little to no support for new employees. There are unrealistic expectations. Work life balance is impossible.
bad,"I was here for a short time because although the job itself was easy, the owners were hard to work for. The easiest part of the job was assisting customers with their pawns and checking them out. The hardest part was dealing with management. On more than one occasion when I would arrive at work, I was told that my boss ""forgot"" to tell me not to work that day. I didn't know when I was to work or not. There was no schedule. My boss also constantly made comments regarding religion. They had a tendency to bad mouth my co-workers behind their back. It made me wonder what they said about me. I was not familiar with most of the items in RadioShack, so I would have to ask my boss for help when a customer needed assistance. When I would do so, I was laughed at and mocked. For every one year of employment you got one day of paid vacation. When my co-worker asked off for her surgery, our boss told her that if she knew that she was going to need time off she, ""wouldn't have hired her in the first place."". It was unbearable. I did not see a future with this employer."
bad,"This place cares only for money and not it's employees. Everyday we were threatened. We had armed robbery, burglary, homeless and drug addicts threatening us. Police were called on regular basis. Bosses would not listen nor care... Only response was that it hadn't happened enough for them to put in security. My store had no camera's, no panic buttons, no security of any kind. While other stores who did not need them, did. When repeatedly asked why, upper management refused to listen or care. Homeless people slept outside the door, stole repeatedly and I was left to deal with it on my own."
bad,"Working at Radioshack is a joke. Im a store manager and all the company wants to know is what you can do for it or what you have done lately. The Regionals could care less about any employee and only set goals and Unreasonable expectations that will benifit them. You will never be givin a raise and will never do enough to make your job feel secure. The salary itself for store management starts at $23,000 a year and thats working 51 hours a week 6 days a week. They will make you feel as though you can make so much more and then when you dont and question it or request a raise they will belittle you and make you feel like the only reason your not making good money is because you are not putting forth any effort. Sorry Iv gone on and on but its all true and just the way they conduct business."
bad,"A co-worker made derogatory remarks about my race and instead of RadioShacl firing him, because of there 0 tolerance stance, the transferred him. The horrible thing was he was already being transferred, they just pushed up the date."
bad,"Product knowledge a liability. Promotion based on selling cutomer things they didn't need or want, i.e. warranties, overpriced accessories."
bad,"Bad management, horrible expectations, poor pay, unless your a good con man to make customers buy products they don't need. I've worked retail for 10 years and never hated a job that badly."
bad,"management was not trained whatsoever it was very unprofessional and co-workers would bring personal guest in to keep company during shift i have been reprimanded for clocking out on scheduled time instead of staying longer with only three minute notice the hardest part of the job was to conform to the unprofessional structure rather than anything else it was honestly as if ""high school cattiness"" the most enjoyable part of the job was working with people"
bad,Almost a complete waste of near 5 years of my life. Upper management has no clue what they are doing and they put too much pressure to achieve goals that have little impact on the productivity of the work place. Employees are just numbers that are easily replaced.
bad,"If you want work/life balance and do not want to be micromanaged, do not apply for this company."
bad,"Low pay. Do not abide by their own written policies. Managers may be able to know their store and products but have no people skills. Constant pressure to sell more even though the Mall and the store do not have the traffic. Deceptive sale practices, and I have documentation. The list could go on"
bad,This company is dying off due to poor management and poorer marketing. they like to blame it on the internet but the fact is they are just behind the times is so many facets.
bad,"What killed Radio Shack is management, or the lack there of. They did said one thing and did another. They were too many shady reps who were shown to be great reps until they were fired."
bad,"It started out good but as the years went by they started to change the pay rate, so every year you worked you were paid less."
bad,The work hours were horrible. The pay was horrible. Only thing I oved was my manager he tried to help with more hours but couldn't do but so much. I wouldn't work here at all.
bad,Management is awful and disorganized. You are expected to be a great sales associate without necessarily getting the proper training. No benefits unless you are a manager or higher.
bad,Manager not very engaging with staff only with certain ones and not very trustworthy. Store was not kept clean specially the office. There was favoritism specially when it was regarding commision.
bad,"Sale of electronics."
bad,"The management expects you to do a lot and not get compensated for it.  I had to work through some breaks.  I was asked to do things that I was not supposed to be doing, such as making staff schedules and doing bank deposits."
bad,"General Wireless was a terrible company that lied to employees about their pay rates, position titles, commission payouts and more, just so they would work happily, upper management would frequently dodge employees who called out the pay or position mistakes."
bad,Many instances upper management never supported you. Constantly under pressure with no support. Company never approved extra staffing which many times its just one person working for 4+ hours with little time to take breaks.
bad,"I hated working for RadioShack. My coworkers were cool enough, but the company was absolutely toxic and horrible. Their SOP was stupid and drove customers away with pointless persistence, I was personally singled out and harassed by my last district manager, and their idea of goal standards was unreasonable. I was absolutely thrilled when they went bankrupt, and I hope they never come back."
bad,No room for advancement. Great job for student. Partime only. Managers are required to work long hours without being compensated. Very little assistance from Corporate.
bad,"They change their minds on everything at the last minute I worked there for a year and a half and the store branded merchandise changed their whole packaging 4 times. "
bad,"I am thankful to Radioshack for giving me a job during a difficult time in my life, but I would never choose to work there. They are a numbers driven company that treats customers and employees as just means to an end."
bad,"A typical day includes troubleshooting customer questions, while on single coverage.  Most managerial tasks are passed down to me, with no compensation.  These tasks take up the time I have to complete sales, the only way I can make commission.  Then I get told I'm not working hard enough.  All of this after two employees got let go with 3 days notice."
bad,Policy and procedures changed weekly. Decision makers flew by the seat of their pants. You did not know what was happening from one day to the next.
bad,They went out of business. That place was always about selling. Working there is like working at a car lot continuously hound the customer to buy everything.
bad,I worked 60 hours a week to get a promotion. I got promoted in 2 months. Then it was 70 hours a week for the next promotion. It was the endless hamster on the wheel routine.
bad,Working almost 7 days a week alone a company that doesn't  allows the store manager to hire the associate that'll work directly with you as the store manager. I train all associates to proper company guidelines and procedures. hardest part is having the district manger not helping you succeed. helping customers
bad,You have to go there and really just focus and your job and not the drama with the employees and managers because if you let them you will always be surrounded by drama and gossip. If they hired honest managers they would not be going out of business.
bad,it's a good place to start for a first job. the hardest part of the job was everything to be honest. it is a fast paced job and not for the weak souls
bad,Company and culture do not equate for the position requirements.
bad,"Good Store, Excellent products, but very bad choice in managers ""I've meet a few good ones"" and co workers are like life. It's all on how you take them."
bad,Long hours and no raises. Hard workers get picked on when needing a break while non workers get told nothing
bad,"Lack empathy towards their employees. The pay bad, however, I did enjoy some of the customers. Nonetheless, it was a learning experience."
bad,"The worst job I've ever had. The day I started normally would consist of training, learning how to use the system expected and product knowledge needed by Radio Shack staff. Due to the lack of employees, training was not an option and was never completed while I was working with Radio Shack. I was actually told that I was hired for the assistant manager position available after putting my hard work into a company that I honestly had no clue what I was doing even months down the road, thanks to never being able to complete training, working double shifts and over night ""redo"" shifts and also covering other employee shifts when that is a manager's responsibility, Radio Shack thanked me by hiring someone outside of the company with less experience. Even after the associate was hired I was asked to traiin the employee and continue to do the duties assigned to the new employee. Thanks for the recognition, waisted time and hard work. "
bad,"driving wireless to all customers working with sprint att and verizon systems creating 2 year contracts and prepaid for customers. I learned a great deal from working here my manager is great, co workers are cool the hardest part is productivity as a store in whole and working hard for no advancement in pay but i enjoy my job."
bad,"Very low wages. They want your maximum in exchange for the minimum...wage, that is."
bad,"They show favortisim to the people they like no matter if they are bad at their job or not, also they do not pay their employees what they are worth."
bad,I worked here for two and a half years and i watched the company go from being about the associate to not careing about them I feel my best quality is loyalty so thats why i stayed as long as I did I swear this company goes through store managers every 5-6 months If your goal is to move up in this company be prepared to be looked over or be told you have the job and watch them change their mind the next day I would not wish this job on anyone. Co-workers start off being good people but bad habbits fall down from the top so if managers or tlaking behind your back and not being honest then it just seems to rub off.
bad,The environment was very unprofessional and unorganized. There was internal theft and was not set for a productive work place. I did however learn quite a bit about parts and even more about wireless. The best part about the job was meeting and helping the customers.
bad,"Working at Radio Shack for me was very fun and exciting and a job that I loved going to on a daily basis in the beginning. The pay was great, I was learning a lot, and my manager at the time was very involved and hands on. Then we got a new district manager. Everything changed after that. Work was no longer fun and the Pay scale had been switched up which caused us to make less money. I was at a different store with a manager that was very lazy and only liked his employees when they did things to his advantage. I ended up being fired because I didn't tell a lie on behalf of him. He's no longer with the company either."
bad,a typical day at work is standing around doing nothing. your first day they sit you on a computer to train about the company. Then throw you on the sales floor by yourself with no one to guide you.
bad,You are better off remaining hourly as opposed to aspiring to being a Manager. But wait. You are better of working anywhere else. Do a stellar job and they will punish you for it.
bad,"Poor management, bad business practice, bad inventory management. There's a ton a fraud that happens that are blamed on sales associates. I wouldn't recommend this job to anyone. They're all gone mostly."
bad,"RadioShack is not a full life job, but it was a good first real job in the real world.No retail job is all sunshine and rainbows, some customers are super difficult, but there will always be difficult people you need to work with/for/please."
bad,This company is out of business.  This company closed.  Don't work for a closed company.  Why do I have to review a closed company.  they are old school and closed for that reason.
bad,Most of pay was based off commission.  Unfortunately I could sell something and then they would return it the next day without a reason.  That happend a lot..   Also the training was terrible..  Manager did not like to answer questions.   There was almost no training on register and the manager did not like helping.
bad,No longer a company but I still would not recommend this to anyone. Want you to sell phones to everyone who came in and do a “upgrade check” too keep your numbers up
bad,I do not have anything to say about this company. I did my best. but they are out of business and I fill I west my years in this. I am just glad about the experience I build in Reado shack.
bad,"there really is no review for what i had done."
bad,uppermanagement was a bunch of morons who though overcharging by 45% for sub par pruoducts was going to fix everything. obviously this did not work. they all annouced going out of buisness a few years ago and refused to advertise that they were still open
bad,"Honestly, Radioshack had nothing going for it. If you were a representative you didn't even have hope of becoming a store manager. They always hired outside the company for that sort of thing, they pay was a joke, and the knowledge required to be helpful to customers was all encompassing."
bad,"Company now closed. When open the company proved heavy competition for the employees. Pay was based on performance. Company wanted managers to work ""55"" hours a week but to complete assigned task required up to 90-100 hours a week."
bad,Brush up on the next latest and greatest techs and tools speakers as cards anything electronic. Working with your crew is great however the management was horrible.
bad,Nothing more can be said about radioshack. It went bankrupt twice in two years. It was possibly the worst company i have ever worked for in my short life.
bad,Very high expectations for little pay and does not care about the well being of its employee. I would not recommend working for this company. You will regret it.
bad,a typical day at radioshack was all about suggestive selling n getting add on sells. i learned how to go after the sell.i learned how to start setup and execute a transaction. the hardest part of working there was there was not any stability in the company. the best part of the company was the workers
bad,"Radio shack does not have job securuty. My location closed and i wasnt able to transfer. Associates did most of the work, pay was minimum wage with 1% commission. Ok job for teenagers."
bad,The company if closing.  They have been bought out at all their locations.  Everything they sold someone sold it cheaper and there wasn't anything particular someone would go to radioshack for anymore.
bad,"Very negative, poor standards, lack of leadership, Manager's work exceeding hours for poor salaries. One or two people's on hand at a time. Terrible."
bad,"Radioshack prides itself on not giving a single iota of thought to its customer base or its employees. Most new employees can only get part time, as they've been cutting the hours at stores nationwide. The benefit of so many part time hires is that they don't have to spend as much money on you, as if giving you minimum wage wasn't enough. It was announced today that store hours were cut once again, so now managers either have to fire part-time/full time associates, or the aforementioned associates will have to seek new employment due to the massive cut in hours."
bad,The environment in the last year was very difficult. RadioShack went bankrupt. General Wireless bought the company. The new executives came in with the concept to out source IT. I participated in the requirements with new software vendors to take over my responsibilities.
bad,I am surprised how they are still surviving? No job security or advancement opportunities. Employee moral are low and upper management don't seem to care.
bad,"never had a life was always at work, manager was very rude didn't understand how he was working there for that long... very unorganized"
bad,I have nothing good to say about Radio Shack or their lack of vision and passion for their own company. I would not advise employment.
bad,Not very busy to make commission. management doesn't do a good job at promoting and encouraging. not a very exciting job and benefits suck
bad,RadioShack laid me off in Dec. 2014 and my boss got a promotion.  they are waiting to file for Bankruptcy until the executives get their bonuses.
bad,"The pay was ridiculously low for associates and managers, especially considering responsibilities. The company constantly focused on the wrong things and made poor decisions. It's no wonder they are on the verge of collapse."
bad,The management everything there is really bad. You get paid only 8$ hourly and you would have to compete with other coworkers to make commission. Which is only 10 extra dollars to your paycheck if only you sell phones. and commission is only 2%. You do not gain anything from working in here.
bad,I Signed for full time and im still at part time. Every one gets paid Minimum wage I cant save with that and no bonuses or anything a typical day at work you have to be constantly rearranging the store every week. We take out products that need to be sold but stick them in the back.
bad,"management  micro managed you.  no work/life balance.  worse place to work,  no room for advancement if you are a woman or a minority."
bad,"it used to be a nice job, but they losing lots of money and unstable, job for a first timer recommended"
bad,"This is the 3rd worst company to work for, in the USA, for 3 years in a row."
bad,"Had a bad manager in an understaffed store. He discouraged taking 15 minute breaks, never had a set schedule,always took a week off every month(when I worked there), overall store tasks were unevenly distributed. For example, my coworker and I did the majority of planograms that were due all the time and even did RMAC duties, while the other workers did sales.I wish we could have switched throughout the shift, so I can make some sales since my pay is basically based on that. And inventory was a grueling 14.5 hours Sunday shift(came in at 10am was suppose to have an hour break but only got a 30 minute break with no 15 minute breaks. Often, manager would leave (without clocking out) for hours at a time in the middle of the day, leaving me to fend off the afternoon crowd. My coworker finally tried contacting DM trying to speak with the issues on the store, but the DM contacted manager and told him to deal with ""insubordination"". Since upper management didn't help and talking to my manager made things worse, we learned to be self sufficient. I learned to solve different customer problems on my own, check returned merchandise so it could be placed out on the floor again, how to order supplies for the store(office/cleaning), and anything I couldn't figure out I would call other store managers for help."
bad,"first sale job and it was horrible, so many things you have to learn with barely min wage pay."
bad,do not work here! very bad place to work they do not hire temps at all
bad,"While at the store level managers typically aren't too bad, the district and regional managers are awful almost every time. They push unrealistic sales goals on team members and are constantly adding to your list of responsibilities. I was with them for over 5 years and watched every bit of additional compensation evaporate until my pay was nothing more than minimum wage. They are constantly changing dress code without providing the uniform and expect you to pay 40$ out of pocket for one shirt (this isn't including the fact that you'll need probably 3 and pants to go with it, which have also changed with every uniform update). They might as well rename this place Wal-Mart."
bad,"For starters, Taking care of rediculous customers all day isnt flattering, especially when all they want is something for FREE. Wireless saturation rates are through the roof, yet if we dont sell phones we are worthless to the company. For the most part, *Save for 2* the general consensious of employees are generally mentally snuffed, They have little to no knowledge of the product they peddle. The company will not listen to its people, no wonder its sinking fast. There is no enjoyment here,"
bad,"Horrible company to work for! District manager is passive aggressive idiot and played favorites as did store manager, I am"
bad,They dont value their employees. the work and life balance is far from none. they are a dying company.
bad,Most Enjoyable Part: Working with the customers
bad,Low pay....miss you numbers one time in the week and you lose that entire week's commissions. Not worth the hard work put into it.
bad,its all about mirco management and they dont care about the person only the numbers
bad,The local electronics store has turned into a cell phone store. If you could not sell phones then you would get written up and then let go. It's a shame that it has come to it!
bad,"I enjoy working and i have no compliants about fellow employees, but management from the top down is the worst I have seen."
bad,"This company will suck the life out of you and only care about what you can do for them. They do not promote from within but will tell you they do and if you dont agree with them you will never get promoted, you may just get fired."
bad,The company did not care for their employees. They required us to basically harass costumers. Little training in anything other then selling phones. Didnt let employees know they were closing  stores until the last minute.
bad,"The job was extremely difficult as we had to work at least 70+ hours a week.  The culture on the other hand was great, because we all really felt like we were in this together.  It wasn't a great job,  but I owe my current success and work ethic to Radioshack.  I miss that place."
bad,"Was a part time job (35 hours a week) I held while the company was in its death throes. I don't have many pleasant memories of my employment here, the management was terrible and totally misunderstood the core issues the company was facing in exchange for attempts at short term money grabs."
bad,"Tandy built his company on profit margins, product selection, and customer service. Then, a long line of CEO's changed to big ticket, low profit and quick sale culture that led to its downfall. Management was promoted based on ability to push a cell phone at the expense of knowing how to treat employees or order inventory to meet customer needs."
bad,"Radio Shack closed all locations a few years ago, I believe they had to file for bankruptcy. I learned a lot about sales there and how to sell items. The hardest part was that you went ever appreciated there."
bad,Did not seem to have any advancement opportunities and disagreed with business model. Enjoyed most co-workers but Management was weak. Would not recommend any friend to work there.
bad,They lie and manipulate at the corporate level then Expect the local managers to take the blame. They cut hours before making the schedule and take away hours right before your paid for them.
bad,"It's like if the captain and sailors aboard the Titanic saw the iceberg coming and did nothing to stop it."
bad,"Radio Shake liked to say that they were all about their employees, but that would be a lie.  They were all about making money at the cost of their employees."
bad,"my day work was begin in 9 to 5 or from 4 to 12 we start have customer at 10 am till 12 am ,day and Thursday we have warehouse sales all our proud act receive maintenance proud act from customer,give customer all answer they need"
bad,The focus area and upper leadership of the corporation lead to the company declaring bankruptcy.  Most of the employees did see that writing on the wall several years before they filed.  It was difficult to retain quality sales personnel due to many of the issues.
bad,"Radio Shack, i thought would be a great place to work, how wrong i was. Upper Management was a joke and Store Managers didn't help much. a few gems here and there but to few and far between. Wages were a joke, especially since it was commission based (cell phone specifically). It really sucked if you worked at a slow location."
bad,"My normal week seems to be corporate sending messages and then middle to upper management sends out contradiction emails. I have been with them for 5 years now have received 4 pay cuts during this time due to changes in compensation.  I pay my employees minimum wage but require them to have more knowledge and ability than most consumer cellular stores, where the average employee makes as much as I do as management for RadioShack. I'm done."
bad,"Store closed abruptly. Company filed for bankrupcy. It did NOT take care of employees. Severance pay, vacation, owed overtime disappeared...36 years of faithful service. That's why the LOW ratings. Enjoyed the first 35.9 years."
bad,"working side by side with the same people everyday they all become your family. this was the best job I ever had. That being said, the company is horrible. I regret ever applying and wasting 3 years here."
bad,"While working at Radioshack I have learned a lot about electronics and technology. We constantly take training on new programs and technologies that come out. I really enjoy keeping up with technology as it constantly changes. If I draw a blank on certain information, I can always count on my coworkers to help out. My coworkers help keep my job enjoyable because we try to keep a fun and friendly work environment. However with all the good and fun that comes with my job, it has no security. I am constantly in fear of losing my job."
bad,"Es bueno trabajar en Radio Shack, tiene una buena propuesta, le da mucha oportunidad a la gente, eso en cuestión de políticas."
bad,"always paid minimum wage."
bad,"A typical day at work would be going 30 minutes early to open store. Greet customers and meet their needs. Exceed sales goal, leaving 30 minutes to an hour late. My store manager is awesome! I've learned a lot from her and she reminds me all time how great of an employee I am and how lucky she is to have me on her team."
bad,Radioshack has never been known for treating people all that great.  My experience was no different.  Not a good company from corporate on down.
bad,"Saftey is low on the concern list in terms of employee saftey. Expect minimal wages, low to no compensation, Poor upper managment. Throw logic out the window if you decide to work at this company."
bad,"The hardest part of working at Radio Shack was the lack of security from outside individuals, and the lack of productive management."
bad,"No pay raises, Entire check is based on commission, some stores have awful locations for selling"
bad,"unrealistic goals, bad work enviroment. Horrible regional manager. to much employee turn over."
bad,Too much pressure and they terminated me without any reason so tht says a lot about the company
bad,It really is not a bad place to work if you have no commitments outside of their world.
bad,Radioshack was a great company however they failed the marketplace by not being competitive enough in means of movinf forward. While working for this company I learned a lot of technicalogical skills as well as how to be an efficient salesman
bad,Consistently in a meeting to Discuss new promos but never enough time in the field in order to reach the goals that we were given. 25% of the time realistic goals.
bad,"Well the company is no longer in business, for many of reasons. Driving overpriced product out the door with little to no warranty killed business. Literally almost forcing us to drag customers in the door to buy high margin items."
bad,"The company had big issues within upper management.  And they would try to solve them, but they would constantly miss the mark.  Old 1970s pressure tactics and antiquated philosophies led to very bad leaders and terrible decisions."
bad,"None. I have no comment!"
bad,"Even though the manager or management is exelent they pay is too low compared to all the things that it is required for you to do! You had to move to other stores, do inventory, make deposits at the bank etc.. It was too much for so little."
bad,Started with salary and bonus with spiffs on a daily basis took away bonuses spiffs and my salary went down. Extremely long hours with no over time. As manager opened to close 6 days a week.
bad,"The company has closed most of its stores. They didnt change with the times and it was costly. Training programs were not that good as most of it was videos, Not enough people to show you what you need to know"
bad,"Pay is based on amount of products you can upsale or you make minimum wage, also this was 10 years ago when minimum wage was 5.15 and I’m not sure what the company pays now."
bad,"This company is closing down. It was a good experience, but not worth the low pay rate. The cell phone sales helped, but not enough for all the work associated with being and Assistant Manager."
bad,Rather nightmare of an experience for me. I was there for less than a year but experienced 2 of the worst managers I have ever had. Took way too long for them to be punished for their actions.
bad,Management was awful. Luckily RadioShack is closed now and other people don't have to deal with the sexism and such in this work place. It's a shame. Maybe they wouldnt have had such a huge turnover rate if there was actually structure and decent management
bad,"Basically the entire time you worked for RadioShack you wondered if you would have a job the next day. I survived 4 layoffs before I decided to take control and find myself a new job."
bad,Great Management however the company was falling into wrong direction since the CEO was not focusing on profit. I always worked 12 + hours a day. It was stressful.
bad,"Im greatful with what I learn working with RS, the experience I acquired opened so many windows but they did not threat they employees with respect. In the end they were not honest with employees."
bad,made offers for pay and never followed through with it. company did not appreciate employees and wanted everything done right now but did not allow hours to get completed
bad,The job is awful you get paid very low and when I was there you could get written up if you didn't sell enough cell phones which was not to me at least our main point.
bad,This job was alright. The managers was cool but they were unprofessional and they had us do dumb stuff. We had to sale expensive items to customers and explain why this electronic is more expensive then the store down the street.
bad,"I needed a job badly and was hired as a manager in training (MIT). The hours aren't the best because you have to work when you customers are off work which means nights and weekends. "
bad,"If you can't say anything nice about someone you shouldn't say anything at all.  That's how I feel about the management in this company.  That being said, I worked in three different locations throughout Texas, and Corpus Christi was by far the biggest contributor to that."
bad,Poor customer Service.Any  returned or defective item returned to shelf and re sold to next person regardless of the reason.
bad,If you like having time with your family this is not the place wont work around your schedule and if you need time off for doctors appointments for your kids make sure it is a big advance and have a good reason to want to have the whole day off for an appointment
bad,The worst company to work for. Management is horrible. Hours aren't guarenteed and the pay rate is just shockingly low. There is no such thing is working honestly to advance in this company.
bad,I learned a lot through this company specially concerning cell phones and different networks.
bad,"No commission, only team leader, 54 hours minimum a week to hit starting salary cap of $19,000. No help from district, training not intensive for success."
bad,i was only christmas help
bad,While I tried to work my way up from part time to full time to Assistant manager they treated me poorly. my district manager transferred me store to store to help with inventories and clean house. (I organized and merchandised while training employees) to be moved to the next store while he hired managers to take over. He soon after demoted me which was the reason I quit. he claimed to demote me to train some more after cleaning house for 5 different store
bad,Sucked but I had to get money. I would of loved to get paid vacations and get a lot more than commission and some percentage off some items for the employees.
bad,I learned a great deal watching this business bury themselves into a state of Bankruptcy.  The judge did good ordering them to liquidate their assets and close up shop.
bad,"it would have been better if everyone worked together instead of a competitive environment, teamwork would have made it a greatplace but competing for sales made it cutthroat"
bad,"Very rarely actually able to take a break.  ""Raises are nonexistent. If you want more money, sell more stuff."""
bad,Great company when i was hired on.. upper management didnt have vision of future and where the market was heading. Did have a good manager program before the company started going down hill
bad,"The company is bankrupt and down to a few stores. My experience was before they closed 1,000 stores and I think they are now down to about 30. Everyone in California was laid off."
bad,"Back 25-30 years ago, the Radio Shack culture and compensation was wonderful. At around 1990, they started reducing commissions, limiting commissions on multi unit sales, hiring at lower salaries & getting what they paid for and so many other negative things that it was no longer an enjoyable place to be."
bad,Advancement in he company was very limited along with the company having zero regard to family life. Employees often worked 55+ hours a week and did not receive proper pay.
bad,"RadioShack is a very poor run company. full of misleading promises and corruption in middle management. They Promote with in and that is a very promising and uplifting feeling in this economy, but in doing so they promote people with out proper management skills and give no formal training to new management. This Company has turned in to a work place full of excessive egos and people who abuse power, all because it was how they were treated before they were promoted in to management. this slight taste of power and abuse they dish out leads to high turn over rates and often worker are asked to go completely above and beyond what is required of them. RadioShack rules with an iron fist and is not afraid to let their sales associates know it, with fear of losing their jobs or looked over when it came time for a promotion. Not to mention that upper management has no idea what they are doing as well, always reforming always changing the commission pay outs to their employees. this company is in a downward spiral and can't be saved, if you own stock sell them and take the loss for soon they will be worth nothing. if anything i have said has offended anyone or is in major disbelief they are welcome to seach the internet and look at their earning reports, there are multiple sites were current employees can write about their experiences and last look in to where they're rated in companies to work for."
bad,Nice job to have while in school.  Uneducated Management.  Would note recommend.  This is a revolving door of employees.
bad,"you dont want this job. benefits package makes it appear appealing..whoever speaks to the client first gets the commission, NOT the one who does the work to close the sale.."
bad,A typical day at work was ignoring gossip and making sure your sales didn't get taken from you by other employees. Management was loosely run and the culture needs lots of improvement.
bad,RS was a stepping stone to a better retail sales job. It's OK for a high schooler for something temporary but I couldn't see making a career out of it. Their business model is what caused them to go out of business.
bad,"Radioshack is dead."
bad,"They're bankrupt and that should tell you everything you need to know, so not sure what the point is to filling this out. My worst job ever. I worked a ton of hours and got paid less than many associates as a store manager."
bad,"When I first started working there back in 2002, we got hourly pay plus commissions. By the time I left them in late 2008, the hourly pay was pretty much all we got, unless we were lucky enough to sell a mobile phone. By that time, we were expected to work twice as hard for what amounted to less pay."
bad,Planned on being a temp job. Was very unhappy in this position. Terrible pay and too much stress and work for very little appreciation. I would not recommend this closed company to anyone.
bad,"Once purchased by Standard General,the hedge fund never invested in the company. NO updated training, no store remodel, no replenishment plan. There was no direction for long term success."
bad,"In my early time of working at RadioShack before being sold to a different corporate entity it was a smooth experience, I worked with some of the best management and staff at that current moment."
bad,"Making sure entire store is up to date on price tags, planograms, and merchandise. Scanning entire store, as well as adding and removing shelving units. Working at RadioShack my knowledge in consumer electronics grew to a level i never had. From the smallest circuits, and DIY components to Laptops, TVs and of course the latest mobile phones my expertise knew no bounds, My co-workers provide a colorful blend of personalities who were all willing to help and aid me in my position. We became close and intertwined our loyalties to one and other. The toughest part about working at RadioShack was definitely the quotas that we had to keep up on. There was little incentive to move up, but regardless I fulfilled the tasks the job challenged me with. Of course what I enjoyed the most, and I have said this numerous times, was genuinely helping people. Being thanked for being a lifesaver, or a hero of electronics really did make it all the worth while. I hope to find not a job, but a career where I can truly help people that need the most help."
bad,"Upper management has no idea what is happening in their local stores, they spend all of their time reviewing their flagship stores and little time in the stores that their largest customer base visit.  Managers are paid based on base salary, 1.5% commission based on personal sales (approx. $80/paycheck), and finally on monthly and yearly bonuses (20% of salary total 10% to yearly bonus 10% divided up over 12 months for monthly bonuses) the problem with bonuses is that they are based upon arbitrarily set sales goals for example, the store I managed was making profit year to date and was up over last year on profit and the sales goal was set around $5,000 above what a reasonable number would be for that store whereas a neighboring store is negative in profit year to date and their sales goals were being hit monthly.  Upper management does not see this as a problem and still states that goals are set to pay the bills, well they need to pull their heads out of their butts and see that the goals at certain stores are not set to pay the bills and managers at other stores are missing out on money because someone decided that they needed to sell more than was reasonably acceptable.  On a positive there are very fast opportunities for advancement because there is such high turnover that there are always new management positions opening up."
bad,This is really dumb that Indeed forces you to do reviews for jobs that don't even exist anymore........................................................
bad,It was a great place to work until the company began to fail. The pressure from upper management was intolerable.  The resources to fix problems faded away and our store (as many) closed and the company went bankrupt.
bad,"unrealistic quotas. "
bad,"Lots of busy work. Low pay. No advancement. Constant cuts in pay, position and hours. Pointless changes with no hope of changing the business for the better."
bad,You work 60-70 hours a week and they tell you 52 plus but then cut your payroll hours so you end up working tons and really have NO LIFE. The company cares about the attached and bottom line and could really care less about the customers no matter what they say.
bad,Boring place. can be good sometimes but being bored makes the days long. not enough people come in to make commission.
bad,"A great company that became obsolete as tech gadgets advanced. The mobile market is where they decided to put all there eggs, and they were not able to compete in that market."
bad,Radio Shack was a good job that helped immensely with teaching the fundamentals of sales and how to deal with customer interactions. good place to work at.
bad,"Seeing as they're bankrupt, I'm not sure that this is really necessary, but yeah, I really wouldn't work for RadioShack nowadays... :-P Maybe ten years ago."
bad,"Since Radioshack no longer exists, I do not recommend working there. It was not a bad environment, but many customers talked down to me because I am female."
bad,Stressful environment due to the company filing bankruptcy and then General Wireless purchased them and is now filing bankruptcy. Wouldn't want to work there again.
bad,"Radio Shack was managed correctly in the 70s, 80s, and early 90s. After that point, the company began to crash. Upper management mismanaged grossly, overpaying themselves from District managers all the way to the CEO with six figure incomes for middle management, while employees worked for minimum wage and could only make a commission on cell phones.."
bad,"el ambiente de trabajo es muy cómodo, ya que tanto gerentes como asesores te brindan confianza"
bad,"Typical day was started with fronting store putting out sales tags for at-time current promotions. Coworkers were fun to be with made the days better, hardest part of the job was trying to close on time. most enjoyable part was being able to be successful and top 2 in the store. I hate the new compensation plan, micromanagement, lack leadership, revolving door upper management, consistency"
bad,"Working at Radioshack was very easy. I liked how you did not have your manager breathing down your neck. It was all about doing your job and keeping your sales up. Working there I can say I have learned a lot about old school technology. Although the job was easy, when it came down to a problem and we had to get in touch with a manager, she was no where to be found. She was never available to call after 4 o'clock pm. The co-workers was very nice and we all was able to have one on one communication because we would work two at a time, which gave us time to get to know each other better. The hardest part of the job was Printing out shipping labels to ship items to other stores. The most enjoyable part of the job was the one on one action we got to give to our customers."
bad,"I loved working at Radio Shack for quite some time, but I began to realize that when I opened my eyes the company was dated and heading downhill fast. There was zero communication with the recent events of bankruptcy, and they even cheated tenured veteran employees out of severance pay before they closed their stores. They have lost all integrity."
bad,"Managed 5 + employees "
bad,Again I worked here a long time ago and management could have changed it was a terrible place then and I’m sure over time it has approved. My review is pointless
bad,"Due to poor business decisions and misuse of resources, the company has closed their doors forever. In the beginning, the upper management cared about the employees, but this changed when the CEO retired in 2012."
bad,"stopped customers in sams club, upgraded phones and contracts, sold tv, sold pre paid phones, made deposits, open close store. opened closed store. Made deposits. My manager taught me a lot, I was shy at first going up to people by 3 weeks I was hitting our sale goals and selling everything like crazy."
bad,Working for RadioShack was amazing I mean there was never a dull moment from learning about all kind of different electronics to setting up services for people friends and family I was learning about Iphones to Androids from Blackberry to HTC's theres many more etc. Hardest part I would say is just really making sure I did everything right because I tend to beat my self up if I don't mean my targeted goal. Most enjoyable part is being able to be know a lot about electronics the experience and the knowledge I gain is amazing and a lifetime usage.
bad,"In the brief time I spent with the company, I was lead to believe that I would eventually become a store manager and other career opportunities would be available. I soon found out that RadioShack was closing the majority of their stores nationwide which prompted me to find work elsewhere."
bad,Got my start at work there after finishing school.  It was no place to hope for a long-term career.  I was able to strengthen my customer service skills.
bad,"The environment there was very toxic and competitive. Very limited space for moving up in position there, when I worked there. I only was allowed to work there a short time before I was unfairly let go."
bad,Working here was so bad that the slowly closed stores so people would just quick until the got sues and had to pay the lawsuits. I was wrongfully terminated because I reported thief and they were the top selling associates and it didn't look good so I was terminated
bad,they closed my store and promised me severance then filed chapter 11 before midnight the same day to avoid paying mine and many other employees severance. never. again.
bad,"Sales jobs are not for me , I don't like feeling as if I'm forcing someone to order something they do not want . I felt like the manager at the time purposely taunted me"
bad,Well they are no longer in business so it would be hard to recommend anyone trying to pursue a job with them going forward. Now there may be some privately owned stores but I don't know.
bad,terrible company to work for. poor salary and benefits. No room for advancement. the hours are good 9-5. Workplace culture was ok. I learned how to process payroll that was the only pro.
bad,Then upper management changed and completely changed the layout of the company.The best part of the job was when I got to go to other stores and help other store managers (new or senior) and help them organize and make their store look better.
bad,This company is no longer around so it would be extremely hard for anyone to get a job there. this is the dumbest thing that have to fill out this website is killing me
bad,No answers. Store closed and that is all I have to say about the situation.  Work was as interesting as the people who shopped there.  Since it no longer exists the way the job had me on my toes constantly.
bad,I should not have to review a company that practically does not exist. It has filed bankruptcy twice and closed almost all stores for a reason. Work here only if it is a temporary job.
bad,I really did not care for this job. The amount of work that they request for you to do compared to the pay is trash. They almost work you like a slave.
bad,"Not going to make myself smaller by saying bad things. I was with this company for a long time and saw it go from one of the top 100 companies to work for, to a company no one wants to get into."
bad,"Radio shack is no longer in business. I work there for some time and it ws great. Only issue is, I was not taught abut the thing i was selling. Was kind of a sink or swim deal"
bad,"This company is the most horrible company to work for. The way upper management treats the employees is horrible. If an employee decides to quit, upper management always tries to find a way to slander the employee with future employers."
bad,Radio shack lost sight of who they were and become obsessed with numbers instead of their customers and employees. I was not surprised at all when they went under.
bad,Day to day it's just a normal retail job. The company however makes it very difficult to want to go in. They've since close A LOT of stores and I could have told you that was going to happen 3 months in to working there. They completely got away from the products that made them relevant as a company. Other than 3 cabinets we didn't carry anything as far as fuses and things of that nature. All about cell phones and it killed the company in my opinion.
bad,I help with the customer needs. Accept all incoming inventory and stocking the store and back room. Count down the drawer making sure we break even every night.
bad,"This company does not care about their employees at all... they will tell you that they care about you over and over, but in the end they will take everything from you and not give anything in return. The pay is not beneficial for what you have to do to work they, they run their employees into the ground and dont care if they do."
bad,"There was nothing enjoyable about working for Radio Shack. You were treated terribly by upper management, your pay was horrible it was below company standard. They wanted you to meet unrealistic goals then would yell at you when you didn't. I went to work unhappy and came home unhappy. I had to leave soon after stores starting closing because of bankrupt."
bad,"Due to mismanagement, this organization crashed and burned.  It was a decent place to work with a supporting staff.  However, the poor management team caused this company to meet its demise."
bad,but the company was going down hill they closed a bunch of stores in the area because they stopped carrying certain products and lost business to walmart and other competitors..
bad,its about what you would expect a bunch of unhapy people that come in and an organization that doesnt truly value the people that spend all of their time there.
bad,"good job to work, but bad upper mgt. enjoyed running the store sorry to see it leave. better mgt. we might  still be here. the most enjoyable time, helping customers."
bad,Radioshack tried so hard to be like others and lost their way sadly. I hope the ones who are laid-off will find work soon. Hopefully the new owners will bring it back to it's roots.
bad,"During my employment at RadioShack, I worked for multiple DM's at different.  The hardest part of working for multiple DM's is their work ethic, or lack there of.  It is a company that is slowly closing and they don't treat their employees as people."
bad,Terrible company to work for. Managers are treated like they are work horses working 50+ hours a week 5-6 days a week sometimes 7 days a week. Pay is very low as a manager.
bad,"A typical day at work includes providing customer service to customers. I learned a lot about patience and how to communicate with others. I also learned how to maintain the upkeep of a store. Management is interesting. I learned a lot about managing and the upkeep of the store; however, if you are looking for a place where your manager will be hands on, Radio Shack is not the place for you. The company sets unrealistic goals for the employees. They do not pay well. The cons outweigh the pros. your coworkers are amazing and are the most enjoyable part of the job."
bad,It wasnt the best experience of my life but it was good working in retail and sales.
bad,Handled inbound and outbound calls from Spirit customers and other affiliates.
bad,My part time job. Didnt really get the help or guidance I needed and the employees/management were unprofessional.
bad,Horrible job that never learns about understanding people
bad,-Fast paced job
bad,"Frequent manager's meetings and conference calls, repetative paperwork, unreasonable management unless you are able to stand up for yourself."
bad,"Fun place to work,  All kinds of electronics for those who like that type of stuff, grat place to learn new things, especially about robotic, learned how to fly a drone"
bad,"Radioshack has been a failing business model company for many years now. General wireless bought them and drive the company into the floor. "
bad,They closed where i lived so i don't know how they would be if they were to be opened. I don't know what else to say to fill the 150 minimum word review
bad,The shack was a starting point for learning how to deal with people from many cultures. If you want to learn then the shack is the place to be. Keeping your eyes open for everything
bad,No reason to really write a view. Most store are closed. The might all be closed. The company became to focused on cell phone sales and forgot their core customers
bad,I worked here for 4 years and after finally getting my store up go where it  needed to be they closed it with out severance pay. It's barely radioshack anymore it's sprint.
bad,"fun to learn new gadgets that would come out and to learn new technologies, it was very competitive to see who would sell more and the commission being made and what stores were ahead in the radius"
bad,This company will work your tail off with little $$$$. Always concentrated on the negatives and never any positive feed back from upper management. Constantly on conference calls even on your days off.
bad,The job sucked.  Growing up RadioShack seemed like a great place to work until I started working there. The manager didn't know anything about the products besides the names posted on the packages.
bad,The people I had the chance work with were some of the nicest and most positive people. The company speaks for itself based on its unrealistic expectations and business decisions that leave even district managers confused as to why they made that decision.
bad,"RadioShack is a company that only believe the corporate big heads know what to do and despite their promises, they never listen to anyone below them. The work to life balance is awful and the pay is too low for what they expect you to do. Overall, it's great for a young person to get accumulated to the retail manage environment - kind of like a boot camp. If you get a change to work for them before they shut their doors, just use them as a stepping stone for another management job, because a store manager is as high as you will go."
bad,I learned everything I know about electronics and learned about all the wireless carriers and their competitive offers.
bad,"This company is absolute trash, the management on ALL levels is completely terrible. "
bad,This is not a place to work if you are looking for solid pay or being able to see your family
bad,"I was hired by Radio Shack as a Store Manager in Training. So I was placed in a store to pick the brains of a Store Manager shadow him and also was given some responsibilities where it can gave me a chance to show my skill set and my potential as a leader. Prior to my interview they showed those who were waiting a video of the benefits and the opportunity that radio shack gave to their managers. Keep in mind all these interviews were only for management positions, hence why this particular video was showed. As I watched this video I was impressed of the things they did for their managers. Such as benefits for the managers and their families, tuition reimbursements, which stood out to me the most because I wanted to go back to school and finish.  Had my interview, got hired and was assigned to a store where I can train and shadow the store manager. However, after I mentioned that I was going back to school and I also told them I wanted to work around the work schedule, they kindly declined my request and demoted me to Sales Associate and told me they need their managers on call at all times, Which is fine but they shouldn't show that video of how they are full supporters on their managers continuing education. That's a flat out lie. Also, their values as an organization is horrible. They only focus on how to sell cellphones and transition to wireless. All their training involves in transitioning to wireless one way or another. They also make sure that the associates or mangers do no take cell phones back by lying to customers and saying the return system is down or the phone"
bad,You can't really compare a conpany like Radioshack to AT&T. By comparison AT&T is an amazing opportunity and a great place to work. The pay starts at minimum wage plus commision. So even if you max out your commision you are only making $12-$14 per hour. No sick days or real medical plan to speak of. Extremely huge work load and even smaller pay than AT&T. Does not train its employees properly.
bad,"All they worry about is numbers, no consideration for others."
bad,"Working for radioshack was not the best experience. Management is horrible. I didn't get any benefits. Working there for a year and was never able to get at least one weekend off they would always make a big deal out of it. They were really shady while i was working there, one day they send someone to replace me and i wasnt even aware of it. I had not been written up or anything. They apologized but after that everything went down hill. They never appreciate what you do they always expect more and there is no motivation."
bad,I used to work for the wireless retail side at Target stores and management at Radio Shack doesn't care how you get sales (selling cell phones) even if it's crooked and against the law. Management lies to you about job security and the company pays very little on big ticket stuff
bad,"High pressure, micro-management, chicanery, and constant threats pertaining to job security."
bad,I liked working at Radioshack when i had the opportunity.There were a lot of cons to working there but i rather not speak ill of the company. There were some things i really liked about being there. I was able to get customer experience and work on my people skills while being there. I was able to improve on my time management. i was able to work on my problem solving skills. I really appreciated the chance working there and glad i got a chance to gain work experience.
bad,"Terrible management, very political, nothing is fair and what you earned is not necessarily equal. You get promotions by stepping on peoples toes and who you know within the company."
bad,"A typical day at Radio-shack consisted of helping customers to chose the correct purchases for their individual needs. You also need to do the average basic things like keeping a clean healthy workstation, maintaining the store, carrying in shipping items, and making phone calls to alert customers that their purchase came in. "
bad,"This company expects you to hit sales quotas perfectly every month, even when our foot traffic was at an all-time low. At one point the District Manager literally told my employees and I to go out and lure people into our store. The products we were expected to push were overpriced, therefore hard to sell to anyone on a budget. lets face it, we're all on a budget!"
bad,"A typical work day would have you standing around for hours before a customer would come in. The company had strict return and exchange policies and one day when business started getting sparse, threw any policy away and told us employees that the customer is to always leave the store getting what they came in for. This led to a high turnover rate for employees. Management above the store manager was unheard of. Hardest part of the job was putting up with whatever made up rules were thrown your way for lack of management. The most enjoyable part of the day was when a customer would come in an kill time with you."
bad,"When I started working at Radioshack I was taking over stores where the previous manager robbed the place blind and didn't care. I easily have counted at minimum 25,000 dollars in stolen product just from the 3 stores I took over from managers."
bad,Radio Shack Distribution is no longer in business. The beginning of my employment was great. As new managers took over things changed and it wasn't for the better. We never knew what time we were getting off work. This was one of the easiest jobs I have ever had. We did receive lunches once in a while. The hardest part of my job with Radio Shack was walking out the door for the very last time saying goodbye to my co-workers that I had worked with for seven years.
bad,"Great place, good team members. I know a lot about electronics only because I was older then my employees. They were great selling phones. Example: I could help a customer find a 5watt capacitor"
bad,"start the day off with no customers until 1 in the afternoon, and having to solve their problem that no other place could solve, so they come to radioshack as their last option, usually does not work out.  co-workers would help if you ask."
bad,"Since the company is going out of business, the morale is horrible. All employees are required to sell salt to snails. Very impossible to meet goals."
bad,"The store I worked at was run like a tight ship, however other stores in the same district were run as if money grew on trees."
bad,"Radio Shack Management consistently changed metrics that "
bad,Didnt like the scattered item from shelf to shelf didnt learn nothing i didnt kno it was more of a refresher
bad,You can be stripped of your hours at any giving moment putting you in a position to wonder how you are going to pay your bills for the month.
bad,I was fully trained bye my previous employer before this job. It has its rush Hr every once in a while. You learn about the latest technology and are always getting training on the newest electronics. You have to have a good head on you shoulders to make it. The employee turn around is not good. It is sales based job so performance is mandatory so if you do not figure this job out within your 90 days expect to be unemployed. The best part is helping customers if that's what you like & if you know what you are even talking about.
bad,if you didnt sell many thing you would get wrote up so i would say the overall hardest thing about the job was i was not fond of trying to sell customers things they did not want or need
bad,"If you can sell great money."
bad,"Comission isn't for everyone, and this is a place that thrives on that. They push cell phones even in a flooded market and provide customers half the product for twice the price, making a loyal customer base almost impossible. Management gets rolled through rapidly as no one wants to work the 60+ hours a week for barley any pay."
bad,"I am a so called ""core associate"" I handled the electronics. which I have no problem with. I spent 25 years in the Army learning electronics."
bad,"Being a manager for radio shack is tough, especially when you are under staffed. I worked 12 hour days for 7 to 8 days in a row and when i would interview, telling the people i was interviewing that it was only 7.25 an hour was tough. You are expected to keep your selling numbers up or eventually they let you go. i was in a very slow store and i could get numbers up so i was let go. and the store left without a manager again."
bad,"this job was simply not for me, not bad for retail experience"
bad,You will start at about $8 per hour with little commission compared to the corporate stores for the products and services you sales. No bonus for meeting or exceeding goals
bad,"I have worked at RadioShack for two years now. I just moved to the LA area from Chicago about a month ago, so I was able to get a transfer. Because we are comission based, it is important that we stay on our sales. I feel as if sales come naturally to me but the bad thing about Radio Shack is that they are constantly changing our pay rate. Plus, if you work in a slow store you have fewer opps than a higher volume store to make the most money possible."
bad,Selling products and good of different manufactures;
bad,"The pay is slightly above minimum wage, hours fluctuate, and too much politics to stay for a career."
bad,"Bottom of the barrel retail job. Minimum wage, with no benefits to start. The managers have no management degrees, or any degree as a matter of fact. Absolutely chaotic situation -- service reps are expected to manage the store, alone, after only several days working there, while the managers are off at another branch or at home attending to personal business. Both of my manages were fired during my 5 month tenure there. Turnover rate is extremely high. Promotion is possible, which is a good thing, but is based solely on how many cell phone contracts you are able to get people to buy. This is a SALES JOB. Heed my warning. You will not get anywhere, you will stagnate at minimum wage forever unless you manage to sell, sell, sell -- may god be with you if you get stuck in a slow branch in a poor neighborhood."
bad,Unprofessional in every level of management specifically in store. Easy work but not organized. Lacked a lot of basic management and store keeping. Training was non-existent.
bad,"There is a reason they are closed and out of business, poorly run and managed.  As a store Manager  you were expected there everyday from open until close."
bad,Paid less then a fast food restaurant and expected to be an expert in all things from phone service to every technology known.  They expect you to milk the customer of every penny they have and forget interacting with them like a human being.
bad,Seemed like a dying company from the start. Their business practices seem to be just around cellphone sales. Peers were decent but upper management past store manager did not seem to have any idea what to do.
bad,"You clock in on the register, find out what your assignments are, maintain your register, and greet customers. Stock, up sale everything you can, and try to sell cellphones. Answer the phone, put away merchandise, send merchandise  back, paperwork, count your drawer. Open or close the store."
bad,"No need to bother with a dying company, a dying culture of sales and spiffs, and a false expectation of all of its employees. Company refused to listen to store management"
bad,"first job out of college so I never planned to stay. First manager was great but the second manager was terrible. Didn't like me so he had me transferred which was fine. New store was closer to my house. Glad i left the company when i did, because went bankrupt not long after i did."
bad,Working for radio shack was a good experience. I learned quite a bit of information pertaining to electronics and sales. I advanced quickly in positions and earned management trust
bad,"felt with mainly older folks whom didn't know how to use their electronics. "
bad,"This company went under for a reason, and in my opinion its when they decided cell phones and cell phone accessories along with cheap merchandise became more important than selling quality electronics and electronic hobby based merchandise."
bad,"assisted customers 20% of the time and the remaining 80 was spent on the phone either addressing tech issues, billing issues or starting service. we rarely had any phones in stock so we had to order them, which made some customers pretty upset and some would walk out and there goes commission and a sale. sometimes theyd have a phone at a close location and I would go pick it up. customers should expect to wait at least an hour for service to be set up and if we were alone in the store and theres more then 1 customer, well, Ive witnessed many walk outs. The most enjoyable part was you get your phone service half off while working there."
bad,"Company had its ups n downs. Unfortunately, I joined the company when they had just filled for chapter 11. A few managers I had were very pleasant, but when it came to higher management there were a lot of flaws. Overall, I give Radioshack 2 stars for lack of care for employees and no paid overtime."
bad,"no advancements, management was fickle, and one can only do as much as one is trained to do within their ob concentrations"
bad,It sucked working for Radioshack. I worked 100+ hours a week running all aspects of the store. I also had to beat last years numbers for sales every year.
bad,Helping customers find solutions to their needs.  That is why I am still here is because I like helping people.  I have had some great people work for me and I have also worked under some great people.  I like seeing others succeed and I love helping them succeed.  The hardest pill to swallow is with all my time and dedication to this company is that in March 2016 they cut my pay by 16k a year and then in July 2016 took my vacation away from me because the company switched to a PTO system.  All I can say is for those of us that stuck it out got screwed the worse.
bad,Bad hours. Management was all over the place. Was hired as a part-time worker and was never given consistent hours. Phone activation was difficult at times.
bad,"You never feel safe there, literally, not just in employment terms. There is no protection for you if you are robbed, LP hasn't made any advancements. Pay is ridiculous and compensation tends to get ""lost"" and you never receive it. I will never go back to a company like this."
bad,Place was ran into the ground.  Management expected you to work all day everyday and would make you feel guilty for wanting to take an afternoon or day to spend time with your family.
bad,"There were not many positives about this company as is apparent by most retail locations closing and the company filing bankruptcy. It was an easy job that did not pay well. The best part were the customers and how I was able to help them with all types of situations. It was definitely a ""think on your feet type of environment""."
bad,I only worked here on weekends during college. The manager at the time was impossible to work with and was let go after I left.
bad,A typical day working there was like answering the same question over and over and the customer still doesn't understand.  There was no thinking for this job and I got bored way to easily
bad,"NO advancement, no benefits for part-time really (or full time at that matter) you have to do so much extra in order to gain commission and there is no room for advancement"
bad,"I had some good experiences at Radio Shack .I was also able to learn some new skills there as a forklift driver.The management there was a mixed bunch.Some of management was more involved than others.I met some some really great people there and will miss them a lot.The hardest part of my job was at the holidays when we would be very busy,but I like being busy.The most enjoyable part of my job was having 3 day weekends,I loved the 4 ten hour days."
bad,"A usual day consists of helping customers find products, helping customers with questions, or stocking and tagging product with prices. I enjoyed the general environment and became more knowledgeable on electronics, however that quickly passed. I feel I have learned all I can here and that it is time for me to move on."
bad,"Poor training and management. Last minute work schedule so you can't plan out your life. The pay is poor, with match the poor and out date training they give you."
bad,I work 40 hours a week. I have learned a lot in my time as a sales associate. Generally a laid back job as the customer base is lacking. I am worried about job stability. I do enjoy making relationships with customers.
bad,my co workers are great to work with but as far as the company they make unreasonable sales goals that cant be met they want us to take advantage of people if we can we do so much and get paid so little with poor commission and poor benefits
bad,"I can go on and on about the horrible things that go on at this job but this company is on the rocks and so my complaints about working for the company will eventually hit the wind. But anyways, if you are a college student just looking for somewhere to work so you can get some change to buy gas and such then this is an Okay place to work how ever do not get sucked in to being a Key holder or any manager type, it is not worth the stress. And, depending on what manager you have, they will or will not be happy with your availability. Some will work with you but others will complain and do other under handed things to devalue you as a worker and even do other things to retaliate against you, such as, cut hours, make you only work nights and never get an opening shift or claim that the ""system"" only gave you one day to work. Your fate at radio shack rests on the type of manager you get. I've been working there 2 plus years and I have seen horrible management from the district down. I wouldn't recommend this to be your first job but if it must be, you must have tough skin and speak up for yourself, also call 1866 Radio-99 if there are any sort of unfair treatment happening to you."
bad,Radio Shack has a bad reputation inside and out of the company. I went there for a job and ended up managing a store. I was thankful for the opportunity and I learned a lot about what it takes to lead a team and run a store. I value the lessons I learned there but at the end of the day one recognizes when a company is in trouble by the drastic measures it takes to stay afloat. I began to worry about my job security. I never had confidence that the company would be around much longer so I felt I had to leave. I did really enjoy being able to make decisions that made my store better.
bad,"Great place to be if you want an endless stream of seemingly busy-work that accomplishes nothing, and a murky set of procedures that leaves both you and your superiors questioning most decisions that come from above."
bad,"I liked most of my co-workers but did not like our GM much. Too much stress is placed on individuals whether it be managers or associates that often resulted in breaking the law to make an extra buck or achieve recognition and ensure your GM didn't call you and embarrass the heck out of you. This was the worst kind of peer pressure that I have ever experienced or witnessed in my life. It's a cutthroat world in The Shack and only those that are in did it know the true ins and outs of it all."
bad,Most advances in the company are judged by the amount and profit percentage. Along with any employee who sells the most cell phones.
bad,"Helping customer that want things that we don't have, Paid below the industry average, bad leadership,"
bad,"This job started off as a good paying job, the experince was great in the beginning but upper managment is not to interested in pleasing their employees, every year or 6 months there are new rules and silly policies. They seriously set up their staff for failure, they give you high goals that you will bearly reach by the end of month.A lot of micro managing is done in this company. If you do not feel comfortable asking customer for their private information. This is not a job for you. You will get a write up if you do not call customers and advice them that they might be eligible for an upgrade. Learning everything that you have to learn and dealing with the everyday task is not worth 7.93. You will make more money at a fast food place then at radioshack."
bad,A typical day involves assisting customers with their needs in electronics and mobile devices.  Compensation with this commission-based employment was less in relation to the work required.  Healthcare available did not suit my needs.  The most enjoyable part of the job was leaving after my shift had ended.
bad,"load and unload trucks , pull orders, and rewarehouse"
bad,They just need to work on the DM Management. Right now we only have three peoples working in the store cause everyday someone walking out or not showing up.
bad,"it is good not bad, good to learn how to deal with customers. but alot of work to do. with low wages"
bad,Standard sales assoiciate duties. I was eventually promoted to Assistant manager and learned how to schedule employees.
bad,"As an educated professional this job doesn't give what you would expect from a fortune 500 company. poor salary (even for management), training and job security, no worklife balence. Typical day is waiting for customers to come in and store cleaning. Most enjoyable part of job was relaxed environment hardest part was staying motivated. Great as a secondpart time job but do not depend of this company as your means to live."
bad,Company is going through corporate restructuring. Commission has dropped drastically in the past 2 years. Heavily micro-managed. Feel like a used car salesman...
bad,"I was at RadioShack for just shy of 10 years. During that time I went from being excited to finally be working to dreading seeing the store. When I started I was just a lowly sales associate. My manager saw that I was able to get results. I was promoted to store manager within a year. My first store was pretty nice. Good neighborhood, decent staff, and a bump in pay. But the hours got LONG. I nearly double the number of hours I was working. This was not a good thing for the wife."
bad,12-14 Hour work days ... 6 days a week. Always on call 24 hours a day. Short hours for payroll to staff store as it should be. High turn over due to low pay grade of hires.
bad,"as long as corporate let the store be run successfully, long hours and no incentive or encouragement from the front office. I do not like to be negative, but the majority of contact was negative, but the store itself was great. too much micromanaging, My store brought in 1.5 million in profit last year. Not good enough."
bad,"A crash course entry into the work force. There is no clearly defined business plan. They bait and switch customers, promote employees to their highest level of incompetence and blame the front line work force for the lack of sales caused by upper ""management's"" inability to honestly bring customers to the table."
bad,"Originally a fun place to work. Opportunity to make a pretty good living. Not so the second time around. I realize the economy is down, but the extremes the company has gone to are beyond belief."
bad,"go in. count your drawer. count inventory. then stand around for hours trying to get people to talk to you or interested in phones. were located inside target so there is a stigma against sales in this manner. there is alot of down time. when target is slow, you dont have anything to do. i learned alot about phones but thats on my own accord. i have had 3 different managers in less than a year. its ridiculous. that happens alot. the hardest part of my job is not having things to do and people avoiding you. i like customer service but people arent interested. i do enjoy interacting with people. when people give me a chance to help them its a fun experience but you have to get there guard down. im probably just not good at sales."
bad,"I learned a ton of valuable information about the wireless and electronic worlds,also was able to use my college background in Buisness management as all stores were run like sole propriorties so managing profits and losses as well as staff was critical,some workers would be solid then there were those who just wanted a check and with such a small staff it would hurt the team if one person slacked,the hardest part was keeping up with the rules as upper management was never steady and seemed to be a company with no long term commitment to it's workers a we were extremely overworked and underappreciated,the best part was the interactions with customers and knowing I had not only helped them but in most cases taught them something!"
bad,"In a million dollar store you pretty much worked open to close, the work force program short staffed you. Inventory was to be done once store was closed 8 or 9pm depending on your location and you were there until 2-3 am and had to be back to work at 8am. If there was a break in at your location you had to go in, when it happened and wait for the repair service to come and fix - window / door. Being robbed at gun point is not a fun!!!"
bad,A job. The in-store management is good but I could see where they are often flying by the seat of their pants.
bad,"I was hired in May of 2011 and I didn't receive a paycheck or a day off until Mid July. District Manager was tremendously unprofessional. I had to go over his head to get something done. As a result, he asked me to step down as Manager for someone who could ""better do the job"" and my hours were cut from 50 to 8 a week soon after forcing me to resign in December of 2011."
bad,This job is for people who consider themselves to be awesome salesmen. This job offers little to no opportunity for advancement and I would consider it to be a temp. job.
bad,A company that views people as disposable and manages through intimidation.
bad,Was a franchise owner. No support from the franchise managers. All they wanted was for you to buy more of their product even if it didn’t move or wasn’t right for your demographic.
bad,"...you could make it anywhere. I’d be all night complaining about this place. But hardships build character and I had the pleasure of working for some of the best leaders I’ve ever met. Working for them, I was unaware how bad things truly were. This instilled the “people work for people” management style in me while the environment enforced the exact opposite. It taught me how to tread a very thin line with business & people management. All this, plus full P&L report responsibility..."
bad,"working here was great in terms of the customers one came across. but the work environment itself left no room for expanding your career. Great job for intro to sales, goals are laid out with complete transparency, as a sales assoc, it is simply your job to up-sell and keep up with you daily, weekly, and monthly goals. Unfortunately in doing so, only mangers got bonuses, no raises were given, commission was extremely low. As soon as Radioshack stopped providing phones as a service, potential employee earnings have crashed for all."
bad,"This company failed to stay in business reasons being repeated turnover  chaos of upper management team, no one seemed to know what was going on, no direction given. Final bonus and commission  pay was not given for staying on with company until store was completely closed."
bad,"This was one of the worst places I've worked at due to management mostly.  The first manager was very strange just lurky and never really upfront or straight about what he was trying to say, and my second boss was just very pushy and had a strange sense of humor.  Always being forced to talk about things people don't want like phone plan checks, warranties, battery sales, phone sales, and we got blamed when people don't want to buy the overpriced garbage on their shelves."
bad,"Past two years has been nothing but a clearance sale that only the top management has benefited from.  Pay cut, benefits slashed, all while upper management reap huge bonuses"
bad,"Not sure about now but it used to be fun, not relevant anymore I believe ...sad , hopefully they can emerge out of the ashes."
bad,They dont really care about you. They closed down my store 3 different times and im on my fourth now. And not one time did they offer to move me to another store or give me severance pay. Im so sick and tired of this company. They only care about themselves and they use us the workers to benefit them with their money and numbers.
bad,"They are closing all the stores and have declared bankruptcy, so if you'd like to try and apply for a business that is literally bankrupt, be my guest."
bad,As of late things at RadioShack have taken a turn for the worst. I feel that I am overworked and underpaid. They threaten their employees with termination when battery sales are low. Management refuses to give employees an weekend days off. Trying to take a vacation is a complete joke.
bad,The job itself was pretty good.I Iearned a lot about electronics and cell phones which I've used on a few jobs since. However the management of the company kept changing things around in the company and the people couldn't keep up with all of the changes to try to stay relevant.
bad,"Hours were horrendous, upper management expected too much, not a stable company to work for at all. There was always a fear that the whole entire chain will go out of business and that was very annoying."
bad,"if you can sale you will excel "
bad,"the rating is due to the current state of the company"
bad,Standard practices as far as a retail job. Very poor upper management and business practices. Most stores are closing or merging with other stores
bad,"RadioShack has been shutdown since I worked there. My work experience there was one of the worse. Management did nothing to help his salesmen and women. The products we were pushed to sale where overpriced leaving us with no commission for minimum wage. Co-workers, including myself, were hard workers. Most of us took on managerial work with the lack of leadership we had. The most enjoyable part of the job would be learning about new electronics we got and minor repairs we where allowed to do."
bad,"The time i started RadioShack was a good time but as I progressed with the company, they just went rock bottom. The other workers are rude and very unprofessional. There's a reason why they are going bankrupt."
bad,Radioshack was a decent company to work for. They did not have strong leaders and it was a huge reason for their downfall. The lack of pay and motivation was also a huge reason that most employees quit.
bad,the one thing I can say about my time is Radio Shack is for a first time manager they had a decent training program where they actually flew you out to Fort Worth for a weeks worth of training at there headquarters.
bad,Disappointed in my experience there.  They pay managers for 40 hours but require them to work 51.  The extra 1 hours is paid at half pay.  Not time and a half.  Just half!  I dont know how they get away with that.  The rest of the employees get no pay raises.  Ever.  The only way you get a raise is if you get a promotion.  I had to bring a chair from home to be able to sit at my desk in my office.  None was provided.  No break room.  I bought a fridge and microwave with my own money so that my team could have those amenities.
bad,Learn a lot about electronics and get to work with clients in a low key setting to find solutions to their needs. Long hours required with no work life balance.
bad,"Management work rude they didn't have much to offer. Although I did learn a few sells pitches. I felt good as a worker communicating to consumers, building a one on one bond."
bad,"There is no job stability in the remaining Radio Shack Company. The company is currently laying of people. I would not recommend anyone taking a position with this company. "
bad,It started off good until a couple months in. I was not getting any hours and the management was horrible. Some of my co workers were also very selfish and only cared about commission.
bad,"Radioshack was a great place to work. The pay was good and the pace was slow. Radioshack is having huge financial problems as a company, and because of that changes have been extremely quick with no warning from upper management. What used to be a stable job has now become an extremely unstable job."
bad,I personally loved the company but no benefits to working with the company I was moved around from store to store miles away from my home for only 7.25 an hour to never be offered an advancement with the company 3 years I worked for them doing manager duties and never got offered a manager position they are focused on cell phones because that's where the money is at they will hire any girls even if they know nothing about electronics resistors omh etc just to sell to customers would not recommend company to any one other than a student trying to get a part time job
bad,"Radio Shack can't figure out what to do with itself.  Is it a general purpose Electronics store?  Is it all about the cell phones?  Corporate can't decide and the retail location employees are the ones who have to deal with the mess.  The company executives set goals and guidelines, only to have regional and/or district managers set contradictory goals/guidelines.  Stores are told to make the shelves look full of product, but then they do not receive the products that are expected to be stocked on said shelves.  Additionally, key holders take on far greater responsibilities and associated risks, yet are not compensated with pay that is any higher than a retail associate."
bad,"Typical retail in that I would open the kiosk, perform daily activities as manager: daily register setup, company emails, inventory counts, schedules, monitor employee training, assist customers with plans and services with multiple carriers. "
bad,"The management was supportive to a mild degree. The coworkers were friendly. The customers could sense the tension to make quota for the daily sales, and this deterred them from wanting to shop at the store. "
bad,"Salary for a 64hr work week. You are constantly threatened with your job and the jobs of your underlings regarding sales, and number of tickets."
bad,I like radioshack but i don't like the pay.You can not survive on the pay here.it is not a career job
bad,Well structured. You knew what you had to be doing at all times. You knew your place well.
bad,management adjusted clock in hours to eliminate overtime. poor leadership and dishonest sales practices promoted.
bad,Management were kind people but did expect their associates to sell an almost impossible amount monthly.
bad,"after being promoted to a Ast manager position and holding that position for 2 years, meeting goals constantly, i was demoted and pay cut because our district manager said""the company is cutting your position and we feel strongly that you will continue to do the same amount of work if you would one day like a store manager position."" meaning they felt the could cut my pay and demote me and I'm still required to do twice the work! also was awarded to 100 in the company for 2013"
bad,"I was hired as a manager for store that's been riddled with theft and awful employees. Assistant manager was an idiot and was only there to help himself. With a few exceptions the rest of the staff were laughable at best. To be fair paying just above minimum wage doesn't really attract the best of the best. "
bad,RadioShack is great for persons new to working. It gives you great interaction with customers and learning the one on one experience. The work environment is excellent with support from the co-workers.
bad,"I was very thankful for this company to hire me, but i do look to move up and make more money when I start working for a company. I feel that there is a stalemate once you become assistant manager. I also seen assistant managers pushed aside for a manager from an outside company, and I never understood that, but it happens with Radioshack a lot. I started off as a bottom tear employee making min. wage and working 18hours a week. I did well with sales and proved I can be a leader and I was placed in a Manager in training program (MIT) but that program was later removed. I emailed a top boss for Radioshack and asked if I could switch from Radioshack to Target Mobile. I was approved and asked to cover the Victor-ville store. I did very well at that store so I was promoted to a Managers position in Diamond Bar inside of the Target, (Radioshack and Target had started a business called Bulls-eye Mobile), that side of Radioshack was not doing well and Radioshack decided to pull out and I was offered a severance package. I did not accept and my wife and I were moving to Oregon, and in order for me to stay with the company I had to take a demotion and become an assistant manager again, I did this as it was better than not holding a job. I worked in Oregon for a year and was never looked at to be promoted even though I was previously a manager. After our one year lease we moved back to California and I almost had to do a ""voluntary quit' because there were no openings in California. Two days before I moved I received a call from the District Manager in the Inland Empire and was told that"
bad,"While RadioShack helped mold my career by bringing me into a management position, but unfortunately once entering that position, my eyes were opened to what this company is really like. Incredible amounts on pressure are put on managers and associates on a regular basis. Your job is constantly in jeopardy if you aren't making their metrics, which at times at +23% to LY which is hard when you're working for a dying brand. Constantly having to write up employees and fire people. An insane amount of work is required for store managers who have no assistants to help or only one full time employee. Was asked to work off the clock. Overtime withheld though salary coefficient for managers running stores that bring in less than $750,000 a year, which is all of the locations in my city. The upside: my district manager, my employees and my coworkers. The downside: pretty much all the rest. "
bad,"my day starts by review emails and then sending emails to all my employees, setting the daily sales goals for my employees, counting the drawer in the morning. training and developing current and new employees. daily weekly and monthly reviews. giving recognition and accountablity to all employees."
bad,was unorganized and there was little to no training. as a manager there you had to work 60 plus hours a week so the employees had to have their hours cut to accommodate. 
bad,Did not like working here due to having to pressure people into buying phones and accessories they did not need. Not to mention the 15 sales metrics you have to hit every month or lose your job.
bad,"Perform daily operations to run the business such as schedule making, overseeing employees, ordering supplies, and making sure our company sees a profit.  Also I am a trainer for new employees and new managers.  The hardest part of the job is the long hours upon one shift due to lack of employees.  The most enjoyable part of the job is knowing that one has provided excellent customer service.  "
bad,Don't expect a raise! They consider your commissions a raise. Constantly have your job threatened. Lousy work ethic with employees.
bad,"A typical day involved customer service with up saleing stocking shelves cleaning up store, coworkers were very competitive as we worked for commision"
bad,Radio Shack was a largely commission sales job. It was difficult to make an income. There were many customer problems and returns.
bad,"A typical day at RadioShack is very steady and fairly simple. Daily duties include: fronting and facing all product, putting up sale tags and replacing those that are missing, implementing new planograms, greeting all customers and guiding them to the right section, and transitioning all customers to a wireless sale."
bad,"....Unfortunately tenured employees jump ship or are forced to walk the plank. The company culture has changed quite a bit over the last 5 years. Tenure and experience are no longer rewarded and in many cases used against you. Long-term, high paid managers are being replaced with ""off the street"", much lower paid hires. Many of those new hires rarely last more than a few months due to lack of support and broken promises from upper management."
bad,"The day consisted of doing anything that the manager of the store would not do, the management and the higher management was rude and demeaning to all employees, pay is terrible for the amount of hours and work done."
bad,"to much presure, organization in trouble, administration is bad, lost prevention is a joke, salaries are in the ground"
bad,"-During the summer, the day can be slow until the weekend. During the fall semester, each workday can be busy."
bad,overall work environment was average at best but best practices were lacking and being a commissioned sales person we were directed to just SELL at all cost even if that meant giving false information.
bad,almost seven years with the company. management on the corporate side are very aggressive on certain aspects of the business and not the full spectrum. the knowledge gained on electronics and on how to run a store have trained me better than any other company i've seen. overall the company is okay but the upper management needs to be more assertive on realistic goals rather than an unachievable goal.
bad,"if so this job could be for you, yeah the spiffs sound nice but when you see all that they come out to it's not worth the time, this is not your pops favorite hobby shop any more they only want you to push contract phones."
bad,"Be prepared to work 6-7 days a week, 10+ hours a day with little to no time off."
bad,this was one of the worst companies i have worked for in a long time. the managerial staff is uncooperative as well as the district manager staff. daily goals and plans are almost impossible to complete and your job is almost always on the line.
bad,"The management has no idea what they're doing. Along with the fact that they care little about most of the inventory beyond a small handful of items, just resulted in most sales being ignored even if you sold nearly a $1000 worth of merchandise. A retail chain and management style that has lost its way. If you get in, get what you want quickly and get out fast."
bad,Good job if you like a  slow paced place. Nothing happens. Manager is not helpful. My store closed down because of low sales. When I worked there the hours were low and the pay low too.
bad,Radioshack was perhaps one of the most unprofessional places I have ever worked. I don't think it was necessarily the company but more so the people I worked with
bad,The job was ok. Didn't do much there. It was going out of business so the manager didn't care enough about the place to keep it well running. People only bought cell phones.
bad,"This is a sales job, though not advertised as such. Heavy emphasis was placed on adding to customers purchases. Pressure selling wireless phones, accessories, and protection plan. All employees were judged based on that performance and not actual customer service."
bad,while I was at radio shack it was a great job but the company went out of business when I decided to leave. The company taught me a lot about retail and sales .
bad,"Radioshack was a nice place to work for in the beginning. My direct manager was kind, worked with you, and gave you the encouragement and praise needed. Higher ups not so much. They did not appreciate their employees, nor their customers. Then they shut down all together."
bad,Radio Shack was not a company for just anybody. best place to work for hustlers. it trained its employees well in becoming aggressive sales person. i was fortunate to have a very good manager.
bad,The manager was sometimes rude to customers. The pay was good. Customers were nice (for the most part). I received great discounts especially when they were going out of business.
bad,"No one cared what was going on. Not the CEO, not the people who call the shots on what derection the company goes in. No one. Not even my immediate boss. He actually brought in his xbox one day"
bad,"The best part about working at Radioshack (other than some toys here and there) is that due to high turnover, you can advance fairly quickly. They give the perfectly horrible mix of micromanagement and discretion that makes it very difficult to succeed, yet still presents plenty of opportunities for criticism. A company whose business plan is to sell a 57 cent cord, available on amazon for $2, for $10, then try and get the customer to purchase a $2 warranty is justifiably not doing well."
bad,Una empresa que comenso bien pero los cambios en la administracion fueron deteriorando al ambiente laboral
bad,"Radio Shack used to pay well and do well. I managed the wireless sales team, and we weren't aggressive enough to grow market share. They entered the wireless game too late."
bad,Poor upper management that didnt leave much for retail locations to offer to the public. Communication and sale approached varied too much from location to location
bad,I can't say much about RadioShack because I was a seasonal employee hired during the Christmas season. The work was easy and pretty boring at times. The only thing that mattered was how much you sold to customers.
bad,Radioshack has employees making little salary but wants them to make commission. When I worked there you would get 1.5% commission on each sale. This did not bring anyone's wage to a satisfactory level.
bad,"Typical work day consisted of customer service, cold calling, cleaning and busy work. I learned beginner management skills that carried on to future jobs, hardest part of the job was memorizing all the small DIY parts and what they were used for. Best part was helping an upset customer leave feeling satisfied."
bad,Monitor cash and inventory. You must sell cellular phones! Laid back but keeping up with the inventory can be stressful there are so many parts. Learned to be detailed
bad,superiors were hard on us to do sales. radio shack is dying though. we worked off selling phones and accessories for commission. My store location was not a good one. the people there were awful.
bad,The owner did not know how to run the business that his parents bought for him.  He replaced qualified personnel with incompetent friends. The business went under.
bad,decent stepping stone. would recommend for someone in going to school. no real advancement in his place. wouldn't stay here very long
bad,"I was hired on here a few years back only as seasonal help during the holidays. I was hired on as a part time sales associate. The pay and hours were fine. The manager I had at the time was very nice and helpful to me."
bad,"You will get paid a lot less than promised. Expected to work more for the same pay. The customers vary, from nice and loyal customers to the occasional rude customer belittling  you due to you working there. Management stands behind customers even when the Associate is right."
bad,Was a good place to work until the company went bankrupt. The new company took over and cut all positions to part time and having some of us like myself drive 45 miles to work.
bad,"manager talks down on associates like they've never had a job! Rude!"
bad,Good place to start selling.  Don’t recommend staying longer than a couple years. Organization is not stable and may not last the next 10 years.
bad,"Easy Job to handle. "
bad,It was a great work enviroment. It was inside Pearlridge Mall in Hawaii. Until the manager got rude with me. Which caused me to surrender my position.
bad,"I worked at RadioShack three years ago, and even then I could tell the company was going to bust. At the time that I am writing this, the company has had to shut down many stores, and is slowly going out of business. Not the best place to be seeking employment."
bad,comapany employees gossip and don't focus. didn't like the management going on again alot of gossip. very deadbeat unless you know your stuff.
bad,before radio shack was sold by the Tandy corp. it was an amazing company! now the company lost touch with what maters just as much as the product the customers!
bad,"complete chaos, "
bad,"I was hired, received very little training and was thrown into the fire. I worked hard and long hours trying to pick up everything I'd need to be successful. However while going through this process I was dropped a bomb on the spur of the moment....you will work crazy schedule, which will affect your pay, fire employees, blind side your loyal full timer, and you must decide 'now' if you're willing to do this. Regardless of the decision the result would have been the same, a surprise closing of the location and loss of employment within a few weeks, regardless. Not exactly the best way to handle your employees.I give credit to my immediate supervisor for doing what they could to mitigate the situation but their hands were tied."
bad,"Lots of ongoing training, multitasking, strict customer service expectations, high standards. Lots of opportunities for training and learning/performing new tasks, without compensation or opportunities for further advancement. The most enjoyable part of this job was the customer service, and building rapport amongst the customers. Working with a team and developing the team was by far the easiest way to enjoy a typical workday involving the stress from upper management. The hardest part of the job was that sometimes there was a lack of communication between upper management and field level management. This made important tasks very difficult to complete. There were lots of responsibilities, with little time to completion or balance. Responsibilities included: Hiring, inventory, high pressure sales, training and developing a team, writing monthly and weekly reviews for all associates, multiple conference calls, attending monthly manager meetings, filing lots of paperwork, diffusing unsatisfied customers, cash management, daily reports, maintaining high standards of cleanliness of the entire store, planograms bi weekly, studying profit and loss reports for store expectations, and working about 6 days a week."
bad,Paperwork from the printer on productivity and sales from the previous day every morning at work. Best part of the job was learning the different electronic devices as well as their parts and detail of the electronic devices. Most of the customers who come into the store knew exactly what they wanted but they just needed help finding it and we would ask questions to further our knowledge and to find the product that they needed. My co-workers were outstanding and we always helped each other through the difficulties or if we were confused about a product but called me on my vacation days when they needed help. There were days when I would have to work at a different location because they didn't have a manager on duty or an associate called out.
bad,Radioshack as a company seems to make premature decisions on the executive level. They change policies almost on a daily basis and expect employees to do more than their payroll and job description are concerned. They seem to lost in what the company is and should have stuck to the idea of the do it yourselfers instead of pushing cellphones down everyones throats.
bad,My typical day was on conference calls and selling items to costumers. I learned how to run a business and manage a P&L around sales. Management wanted to help develop your skills on one hand but on another hand if something was wrong they never helped show you the correct way for the future. The hardest part of the job is that you had to work fifty two hours away  only got a day and half off the week. The most enjoyable part was my employees.
bad,Management is laid back as far as in store. It's a decent job with minimum wage pay. You make 2 percent commission off of everything you sale which usually bumps you up to about 9 or 10 an hour. I was the top salesman in my district for one year straight. I became an assistant manager and then they got rid of all asm's and bumped us down to part time and I started getting like 5 - 15 hours a week from 40 plus they reduced our pay down to base pay so I quit. Not worth working for company is going out of business and hundreds are shutting down every year.
bad,"I've only seen the company degrade and treat it's employees worse. With a constant change of direction every six months, just keeping track of what you are responsible for is a task in and of itself."
bad,"RadioShack has been in decline, financially, for some time. At least, I hope this was the fault that made my experience so distasteful. It seems hard to believe that they remained tasteless before their economic crisis. The combination of encouragement of immoral sales tactics and lack of proper incentive leaves the company populated by vain, opportunistic employees that feed more on successful swindles, rather than commission or financial sustainability."
bad,Scheduling was always a challenge and employee turnover was sometimes out of control. Work atmosphere was good but theft was a never ending worry. Too many hours with poor pay structure for managers.
bad,"I left on good terms, however, this was most certainly not an ideal workplace. The management over the IT were for the most part, very inconsistent. I did learn a lot working here as my first IT job, but as the company's state continues to decline, so does the the morale of the management, which in turn brings down the morale of those under them."
bad,"The Radioshack Corporation has been declining ever since they introduced cellphone into the mix of electronics that they sold and were already receiving prosperous returns off. Now 15-20 years later,  and number of different store/image reset that failed one after another-like the live strong theme from the lance Armstrong foundation- Radioshack has found that the only way to keep the doors open is to take money back from the people that were keeping the doors open for everyone in the company. The district managers on down to the part-time sales associate have had more pay cuts in one fashion or another, and if you ever wondered why there always pushing some sales, or WARRANTY especially down your throat to buy, is because they will eventually get reprimanded, written up, and eventually fired if they don't sell those items. Even if there doing awesome in other places, that's Radioshack's bread and butter. Which now means that I have to somehow make you purchase something that you probably don't want to keep the paychecks coming in that feeds my family. That's why batteries, and warranties, and add-on accessories for major purchases are thrown in your face. They don't really care what you ""need"" or what you "" just came to buy,"" they're going to keep asking and asking and asking. On occasion, if there really desperate, they'll throw a warranty on without telling you to help meet that quota. This is all stemmed from poor planning, poor leadership, and a poor vision. Follow your original mission statement and you'll eventually get on the right track."
bad,I always learned something new every day at radio shack.  A typical day would be opening the store making sure the store was clean and ready to open. If there’s any stock in the back bring it to the sales floor stock and zone. The store manager was constant an entertainer he has his way to improve the morale in the store making it fun to work. However he also had a serious side he always challenged us to be top performers. The hardest part about working there was the pay was not enough for my living cost.
bad,"Six day work week"
bad,"I wouldn't recommend working here to anyone, unless you are very desperate for a job."
bad,"The commission structure at RadioShack is an embarrassment to mankind. While the company expects unreasonable sales goals for the pay, you are always under strict scrutiny. Very high turnover in management adds unwanted burden to sales staff having to do inventory with each change. Furthermore, sales associates are required to know far more about mobile phone products than core retail stores (but get paid a fraction of their salary). I wouldn't recommend working for this company unless you're in high school or college summer work."
bad,The typical day at work is slow except if there is a shipment. The upper management was great but unfortunately the store manager wan't very understanding about school or family situations.
bad,"RadioShack is a good company to work for.. Provided you are part time and you don't really need the cash."
bad,Would only recommend to teenagers getting out of high school
bad,"Very little vision for the future for the bulk of stores not in NY metro markets.  Chaotic management structure, rapidly rotating priorities, and outdated strategies left little hope for success or advancement."
bad,Working there was not a good experience. The manager was very rude and inconsiderate and the job was not what was described.
bad,"I love working with the product and being able to fix customers' devices. I enjoy seeing the new things as they come out. However, $8.70 an hour is NOT a living, particularly not for a bilingual member of management who's been with the company nearly four years. There was a time when we made decent money on commissions, but that's been slashed in the past year to the point that even managers are barely surviving. Men who are less experienced, less educated, and less qualified than I am, and who perform at a lower level, are getting store manager positions while I'm not even being approved for store manager training. I can't comment that I'm hungry on my way out the door to lunch without my store manager and the male sales associates cracking jokes about whether I'm pregnant. I left tampons in the employee bathroom, and the manager threw them away. Then people wonder why so few women work for this company."
bad,The best part of working at the shack was the discount given to employees.
bad,"This company is not people friendly, and is a mess. They continue to make desperate changes, one after another, none working, and have chased off the most successful people one after another. Of course blaming each for the companies failure in their store or market. Highly recommend not jumping on a sinking ship."
bad,"My most enjoyable part of this job was helping someone who knew nothing about technology(computers/cell phones/assorted electrical devices) find the right product. "
bad,"As many of you have seen Radio Shack is trying to make a comeback, I enjoyed working there but the low salary and managers breathing down your neck for sales are exhausting. I would recommend working there for experience with customer service since you get some very difficult customers from time to time; trust me this experience helps no matter what field you decide to go in."
bad,"Manager 17 stores and 110 employees, Responsible for all sales, operations and merchandising."
bad,Training for the job is minimal. Sort of a big learning curve. But you can work hard and meet the unreasonable sales goals and still wont be appreciated. Commisions get lower as time passes. Management is terrible and often incompetent. Semi criminal too. I would say stay away because you can easily find better.
bad,The difficulty is holding people accountable that were tenured.
bad,commission based sales all day everyday sale sale sale.  if you have time put up shipment
bad,While working for their company I found that the managers that I came across had no regard for their employees personal life along with their well being. The latest manager that I worked with would not give time off for sickness or for family funerals that a co-worker had to deal with. The managers were only interested in making more money and less on the customer satisfaction. I had numerous calls throughout the day from irate customers who complained about the horrible experiences they had from the workers.
bad,The job itself isn't bad but the culture and values of this company are questionable. Upper management makes it a very stressful environment. I did not have some of the health issues that I am dealing with before I started this job
bad,"way to much micro management, not competitive compensation."
bad,"RadioShack used to be a great place to work. New products coming in all the time, customer traffic flow was continous, I really enjoyed my position as the manger, I was in control of the store and it's day to day operations. I saw to it that the store was always 100% customer ready."
bad,"Started off great, and as the years went on the management staff got worse and disorganized."
bad,"The hardest part of management at Radioshack, is lack of a work/life balance. The most enjoyable thing is selling"
bad,"Love the customers and working with technology. It's fun to answer tough questions and make sure the customer get everything they need, but doing that while updated three tracking sheets and sending hourly reporting to multiple people is just counter productive. They have no clear direction and are constantly changing their focus. The pay plan is not the greatest, and it is also constantly changing. Not to mention required 6 day work weeks. However they do offer a great health care package."
bad,"On a typical day at work, you will process almost as many returns as you do sales. With each sale, you are tasked with badgering customers with several offers which include offering service plans on every item they purchase, collecting email addresses to send customers a coupon, asking customers to check their upgrade eligibility on their cell service in order to later contact them several times when it is time for their upgrade, trying to upsell the customer on the current battery special and finally asking the customer if they would like to donate to the Livestrong foundation. After awhile you can tell the customers are more irritated than anything because they start to just cut you off as you start asking a question."
bad,-My typical day at work would be getting yelled at and being treated unfairly by my manager for being a female in the work place. did stop once another female was brought in to work. tried talking to district manager and upper management about problem but no resultions ever happened.
bad,"I liked the product that we sold, and I enjoyed my customers and coworkers, but the management changes direction twenty seven times a day. The communication expectations are ridiculous, and the sales tracking is oppressive. The compensation was not commensurate with the job expectations."
bad,I enjoyed the time and the opportunity to be a part of the team.
bad,"Typical day at work involved at least one customer telling you how pathetic you are because you can't change things around for them and you having to stand there and take it because you aren't allowed to defend yourself. I learned that just because a job title is promised to you and you qualify for it doesn't mean they will actually give it to you and they have no problem lying about your performance to keep from giving it to you. Management depends on what store you go to. I had a couple of great managers who knew what they were doing, the others didn't really care about their employees or company policy in some instances. Hardest part of the job is handling the unruly customers when your manager/district manager won't do it themselves because they are just too busy to deal with it or just don't want to answer their phones. The most enjoyable part would be the satisfaction of helping customers who actually want your help and making their day easier."
bad,"I worked there for 27 years. The first 20 it was the best compnay to work for, the lst 7 it was the worst experience of my life. People both customers and employes no longer mattered, safety was less important then product when armed robbies took place. Regional managers and above lost sight of ethics and honest selling practices. Do not join Radio Shack if you want a positive and growing enviroment."
bad,I am a twenty year veteran and love love my staff. The company is not employee friendly and it is definately not concerned about work / life balance.
bad,Nothing good but my manager no days off no double or overtime horrible holiday hours unfair sales practices no management advancement minimum wage just a bad place no holiday bonus
bad,was slow as they closed the company and the owner was not a very nice person and the prices of things was very high the owner was never really there he left it all up to me the manger to deal with everything but the customers were great and the I loved it other then the owner
bad,"decent company to work for in the beginning,but once they shifted to cell phone sales it killed the company.ill never forget when I had a customer come in asking about tvs,and my manger said hes a a tw.i didn't understand the reference,i went on with the potential sale,didnt get it and after the customer left my manger said he was a time waster,because hes not buying a cell phone.this actually went on for about 3 weeks,the same customer would come in and I was the only one that would answer his questions.well on week 4,he came in and I wasn't there,he asked when I would be there,came back and spent nearly 6000 dollars that day on a full entertainment system.after the sale,very excited  I went up to my manger to tell him about the sale,and his only question was,did I sell any cell phones.."
bad,"I was a keyholder, so I was responsible for opening and counting the register. During close I'd balance the register and take the deposit to the bank. Aside from my bosses, it was a good work place. I got certified to sell verizon, sprint, at&t, boost mobile ans virgin mobile. Regular day consisted of assisting customers, making sure everything is stocked and faced, print out any missing tags and planograms"
bad,"It was good in the beginning, but started to decease in the year 2009, bad decisions were made, customer interest dropped, I was let go to be replaced by an undesirable who walked out on the job within 4 weeks of taking my place."
bad,i come in load my truck i leave go make my deliveries i meet new people everyday myself and my co worker got along the pay was ok hardest part of the job was loading the truck and traffic
bad,To much work not paid for it. They expect you to live at the store.  Open to close every day I was scheduled.  Training very poor.  You are no prepared.
bad,I enjoyed most of my time there before being laid off after the company filed for bankruptcy. My biggest problem with the company was no room for advancement.
bad,"Radio Shack was not a very good place to work for. The biggest issue was management."
bad,Good For a high school grad. Work is slow the company went out of business. Management was unorganized scheduling too many people for the same shifts very horrible
bad,no very constittent work schedule always different from week to week and not able to be able to plan around it due to lack of schedule being published in timely manner
bad,"i worked for a third party store where checks regularly bounced. would have much preferred to work in a corporate store. not much room for advancement,"
bad,"I was working at RadioShack about a month or two before the company went bankrupt. The focus of your work was to sell cell phones as if you were in a cell phone store, but without the benefits or compensation. The management even told me about how other managers could make inventory 'disappear' during the yearly 'inventory' and how once you're a manager that you're able to basically steal from the company without anyone knowing. The management had too much power within the system and the other employees didn't have much say. The most upsetting part about working there was the lack of encouragement of being able to move up within the company."
bad,"My experience was great because of my manager. I learned alot here but i kept getting pay cuts and moved around while people who got fired shortly afterwards, were constantly promoted"
bad,Working at radio shack was my first job. I enjoyed the experience for what it was. It was competitive because commission was involved with every sale each employee mad
bad,"Greet customers. Since it was a commission based salary, the team was always competing for customers. The customer service and sales training were great."
bad,"Worked the late shift and did not have to worry about alot of the issues, and mostly worked b my self till the early housr of the day (3am) performing the job of 10 people al by my self."
bad,Started as a sales associate and worked my way up to assistant manager. fun work environment with something new everyday. Learned a lot to help me get to the next level.
bad,"Would have been a wonderful place to work bar the fact that the company was imploding. Much opportunity to ""be ourselves"", ""selling ourselves"" as we sold products. Time to develop great rapport with our client base; rather than sell for the most we could per customer, we took the time to listen to what they really needed and found great solutions for good products."
bad,"Lack of management support"
bad,The manager I worked with was amazing and kind.  The District manager was another story.  The manager and I where the only employees at this store and the district manager refused to do anything about it.  Radio shack has only one hiring manager for an area and that hiring was responsible for staffing all stores in two counties.  He refused to send any new employees to the store I worked at.  Radio Shack is on life support.  They are closing and will soon be out of business
bad,"A typical day including prepping, scanning and keying documents received from the accounts payable, accounts receivable, real estate, and human resources departments. I learned how to process different documents and about Microsoft Word and Excel. I had a couple of bad managers but also a few good ones. The hardest thing about the job was watching a manager give preferential treatment to certain employees. I enjoyed working with most of the people."
bad,There was always something to do at radio shack and they did provide spiffs when sells phone. I did not like the pay rate was still minimum wage and that it appeared you could only move up if you already knew someone from within.
bad,"A typical work week was 6 days a week and 54 hours per week.  If we were off a day during the week, we head to work over the entire weekend.  Paid time off was a hassle to get approved because upper management always wanted the managers there.  This was the hardest part of the job.  I enjoyed learning new technology and interacting with customers."
bad,business went under for a reason!! The company closed do to bad management. There is not anything else to really say. Radio Shack did not treat there employees well.
bad,"A typical day consist of making sure each customer got taken care of either answering questions or showing them where a certain item was. Keeping up with inventory was a must because there were a lot of toys, parts & cell phones to look after. At end of day making sure everything was clean before leaving was mandatory."
bad,"The reason I don't recommend RadioShack, is because all the stores have closed. Little by little they closed all the stores in Florida, Georgia and LA"
bad,"This company went out of business so I do not have much to say. As a manager, you would probably work 6 days a week. Only get half hour lunch and not too much time off."
bad,I worked part-time and full-time from November 2000 until the company declared bankruptcy in 2015 (with a 9+ month gap when I was teaching out of town). Since I worked for the company over these years I gained allot of experience in retail electronics sales. This company is now defunct.
bad,not sure how helpful this review will be as the company no longer exists...................but. Here I am..writing. nothing much else to say here.....
bad,Radioshack was a relatively easy job. When I worked there we were selling cell phones and that was the best way to make money. The focus was taken away from other items and you only focuses on selling contracts.
bad,"Not alot of support from upper mgt. Payroll was very tight and managers work alot by themselves."
bad,"There was a mixture of genuine, intelligent employees and uncaring know-it-alls. Corporate always forced unreasonable demands to the upper management  making it hard to service the customers properly. If you did it their way you got to keep your job, but if did not you were let go. It was always about immediate money and not the long term money, as you were able to tell by their actions. Proper customer satisfaction was never a concern. As long as they could sell a wireless phone they would see residual from that transaction."
bad,Everyone is friendly. Nice to communicate with customers. Friendly competition. Compensation is ok. They worked with my school schedule. Room for growth.
bad,"My first job right after high school, the manager was not thinking about decisions he should make and was almost never there. needless to say the company no longer exist for a reason."
bad,"Old brand, company did not have the resources to reinvent itself. Good people, just losing value proposition. Company should have switched gears earlier."
bad,"This company's corporate office doesn't communicate well with its entry level employees and sales associates lack incentive. Management is spotty, as few seem to willingly carry out operations required to keep an establishment running. Many associates are told what to sell, but lack the resources to learn properly."
bad,"When I originally was hired for Radioshack, I was ecstatic after having been an unemployed college student for quite some time. But there were numerous issues there I had noticed over time."
bad,"Radio Shack stores are very small and cozy place to work in. The staff numbers are very small and the management is very personal with staff members. This is a place for someone who truly loves elections and are able to keep up with the new trend. Like any retail sore you have two kinds of customers, the friendly and the non-friendly group. You learn how to cope with them and you learn how to move on. The only fear with working in the city or near an expressway was the fear of getting rob. Overall then working environment with guest was great however the upper management was a bit unorganized."
bad,"A typical day in the life of a Radioshack manager was to resolve customers concerns with their electronics, day to day it was a new challenge filled with excitement and lots of learning potentials. Management used to be all about driving sales and increasing the bottom line. Our culture was that of a small retailer that had not just one thing in their store but various tools to help customers. The hardest part was seeing the company go thru so many changes and losing their identity as a small retailer and trying to keep up with big box business. The most joy I ever felt was meeting new people, whether it was new customers or new associates or peers it was always fun to meet new people."
bad,"While I worked for the company for a long time, the work environment became hostile in the early 2000s and negative reinforcement ruled the day."
bad,This was a difficult company to work for that was unable to provide me with the help I needed as a store manager. I was thrown to manage a store with no background in management and working less than a year with the company.
bad,This was not a job that i would recomend to anyone one who wanted to make a living or wanted to make it a carreer out it. They did not care about there emloyees did not follow there own words.
bad,didn't really like working there much. the boss was super flirty. and the hours weren't enough. my co workers were nice though. i got along with everyone.
bad,"customer service "
bad,"I don't really have much to write about this company. Typical retailer job. Not much room for growth, decent coworkers but that's really it."
bad,"Managment could have used a little work . Needed to be a little more friendly, overal I learned alot it was my first job , taught me how to be responsible"
bad,"I worked at RadioShack for ten years, as a sales associate and assistant manager while in college and as a store manager after I graduated. It can be an enjoyable job with the right coworkers, and it's great for talking to people, but the compensation is ridiculously low and there is little chance for advancement, especially after the company was restructured."
bad,"Low pay for what is expected of you with the potential of a commission if you can sell enough of what they want particularly cell phones."
bad,"The company just isn't the same, they went away from selling DIY projects and tired to focus on selling phones. but that didn't work. That's why the company is where it is now."
bad,"RadioShack is a great company to work for if you're trying to pick up new skills, want to learn how NOT to run a business, or just want to have a part-time job while you focus your attention on more important and deserving tasks (examples school or a real job). Their customer service standards are excellent, and their components and electronic systems training is good - if you pay attention. RadioShack develops a very active-listener customer service skill set. One must listen and picture the customer's situation and needs, identify potential problems or missing information, and recommend them complete solutions that solve the problems they came to you with - and some they didn't realize they had."
bad,"I realy enjoyed the job and the co-workers, if only the management was more involved I would have been more effective and would have stayed longer."
bad,Was not a very fun place to work. Cell phone sales were everything so if you can sale you will be ok. Hard to find good people to work for $7.55hr.
bad,"Greeting, helping, upselling, cellphone sales and teaching customers to use new technology was what we did everyday.  I enjoyed teaching people about new technology."
bad,"it was a nice work place the other employees were nice people, and I enjoyed working with them. poor management I think the management could of been much better. overall I liked that job."
bad,"I didn't realize how bad this company was to work for until I left and was able to work in better careers.  As a store manager, I was required to work 55-60 hours a week with little compensation, and limited benefits.  You are responsible for everything with little support, and employees get fired constantly.  As a manager you are responsible for the security of your high dollar inventory, but offered no real way of protecting it other than ""well, just count it every day to make sure its there"" and a padlock.  This is a company that is on its way out and for very good reason."
bad,"Again , fun company however the people I worked with were ""snooty"" except for one of two coworkers. I was seasonal so not that many hours but they made sure to put me on the schedule . Unprofessional when they let me go, they just stopped calling me."
bad,"Co workers were fun to work with"
bad,Basically letting the inmates running the asylum. Very poor systems and lackluster training. There is no sense of teamwork and can create a hostile environment
bad,"District Manager does not have your back, LP always want you to call him if some one comes in to the store and steels, instead of Calling the police first.. I think this is totally wrong."
bad,Treated the target mobile crew like they didn't care with everything. Never had the proper items when people wanted them and that made the sale go down. Company never showed any interest in employee feelings when comes to breaks. It was like the contractor that we worked for took more care in us workers than the company
bad,"Being friendly with customers."
bad,Radioshack is a workplace that is a decent job at a high school level of work experience. Management made the job more enjoyable
bad,"i would not recommend any body to work for this company"
bad,"Many people know that doing retail can be very difficult due to quite a few factors. Sometimes it can be the people you work with or it can be the customers that you work with. When I first started working at Radio Shack I was in a very good location in downtown. We had a lot of people walking by our store and a lot of the employees had helped build the reputation for the store. We had a lot of return customers who knew that when they needed help with anything, we were the people to talk to. A little while later I was moved to a different location without being properly notified and it increased my commute. The store was located in a bad area for that type of retail. This meant that sales were lower and I made less money, but had to travel farther. I learned a lot about cell phones and other electronics. I was able to increases my knowledge of certain electronics and learn about the hobbyist culture. I had some co-workers who I really enjoyed working with because they were hard working just like me. We worked well as a team and played off of each others strengths. I had a few bad ones as well who were either lazy or just didn't really care about doing the job. They actually increased the work load and I dreaded the days that I would have to work with them. The hardest part of the job was a mix of the bad location and working with lazy employees. The most enjoyable part was talking to customers who were hobbyists. They showed me how to build all kind of things using basic electronics. It was fascinating to know that there were people who still believed in the do it yourself part"
bad,"On the job training would vastly improve sales, instead of interupting others.  Profit Sharing and breaks; higher salaries may improve staff moral.  Mandatory meetings everyday into the workday as you were working and just had to listen unless called upon to answer a question were a bad start to a day.  Friendly co-workers, selling an inferior product was the hardest part of my job.  Explaining how something worked and how it could be done better with a little effort from what we had to work with would have been the best part of my job."
bad,"Keeping the work environment neat and clean."
bad,It used to be a place you would enjoy coming to work everyday and handle issues and help customers with their needs. It then became a place where you weren't sure if the doors were gonna be locked one day and you were out of a job. Management seemed to be drowning to where they couldn't help with the things you needed because they had so much to deal with. The positive to the job was moving up from associate to store manager and learning the business aspect of the job. Without that experience I wouldn't have gained the knowledge that I have now. I appreciate that opportunity from them. The best part about the job was always the customers whether they were happy or mad it was always an accomplishment to fix their issues and solve their needs. The hardest part was balancing work and home life at the end of my employment with the company.
bad,"A typical day at work would consist of helping customers, keeping store maintained and keeping staff busy. I used to love my job when i was an associate but once i became a manager thats when the stress began. working 65+ hours when you are salary and you only get paid $2 per hour after 45 hrs. only having one day off a week. Receiving work related phone calls at home all of the time. Working every couple weeks doing an inventory that in most cases would last anywhere from 1 a.m. to 5:30 a.m. and then having to be back at the store to open in the morning. unpaid conference calls every day. The  Other managers were great. I enjoyed being able to control my store the biggest issue was the pay. If I would have been payed for all of the work i did and time i put in it would have been tolerable to deal with the other stress."
bad,I gained the knowledge of working a sales position with commission. However I worked minimal hours per week due to budget cuts but am extremely blessed to have had the experience of working in sales.
bad,"I really hated working there."
bad,"A typical day consists of opening the store and counting the money in the til. From there, you wait on customers, asking if they need your assistance or assisting them in decided between products. As the Assistant Manager and Interim Store Manager, I am responsible for making sure that the store continues to function steadily while being able to resolve any conflicts, should they come about. Within the actual store, my co-workers and I have not found a challenge we could not overcome. "
bad,"It has been a really good opportunity to be a assistant manager, but also a downfall. At the moment I held the position I had just transferred to a new location, pace was faster and more to do (very much enjoyed); but the downfall was that I had to hold multiple positions at once and still was underpaid, there were times I was left in the store by myself without break. Remind you I was pregnant, and  dealing with some complications. With all said and done they need to work on their communication skills and their work ethics."
bad,great opportunity to help customers. Love of helping them get what they need to make their live easier. To show customers that technology is not scary and can be seen as an asset to enhance their lives
bad,"I have worked for RadioShack for over 35 years and wish not to review this company at this time.  Working with hard working managers and sales people, hundreds actually was great.  Management however I wish not to say anything about.  I guess all I could say is if you don't know your history, your bound to repeat it.  Thank you for asking."
bad,"Selling phones was my main objective every day, and everything else was unimportant to the company. I was told I was getting a promotion and dropped out of college because of it, but then it never happened."
bad,"A typical day would consist of monitoring sales and inventory, servicing customers, checking and correcting timecards, training and setting goals for staff, ordering stock when needed, planograming and tagging merchandise, arranging training meetings and working with vendors/company reps. to arrange training sessions on new products and services; as well as plan events to attract more business. Any surveys requiring a follow up call would be handled on a store level. Hours are very long and make it difficult to have a healthy balanced home life. If you are looking to move up, there is fairly high turnover, so positions become available, though you will need to be very dedicated to your job and be willing to go above and beyond the call of duty to even be considered for the position."
bad,Pay was alright. Work environment was ok. There is not much to say about it because it was very brief.
bad,Developed relationships with many members of the community. We tried to over deliver our time and attention to this community.
bad,"Sales associate"
bad,Working with the public. Selling electronics to knowledgeable people
bad,"So being at this company, I enjoyed selling phones, working with the latest technology (which radioshack got last by the way; after best buy after walmart). I even enjoyed interacting with customers. There were major drawbacks with this job, The pay was minimum wage BUT there were NO raises. No commission bonuses and a lousy 2% commission on every thing you sell. If you got a return then it came out of your pay (2%) Not to mention some people only did half their job."
bad,"Radio Shack is where I started off selling cellular devices. Moved up through the company swiftly. Downside being management, and upper management. Once a certain level is reached, it's almost impossible to be promoted from that level."
bad,"Very poor management, constant pay cuts. allot of work for really bad pay for what you have to do."
bad,"The environment in itself is not bad at RadioShack. The quality of Management can fluctuate, just depends on who you get. I was in the MIT program for a few months before I left. To be honest it is a joke, you get rated on sales numbers and how much you can suck up. The pay is minimum wage plus spiffs and god knows what else. They is no clear definition on how you get paid. You get conned into thinking you can make TONS on how much you sell, in theory it is correct but you never meet the required numbers and always get hassled for it. I had to work hard to sell phone after phone and push upgrades and all sorts. The highest pay I earned was about 10.30/hour. For the effort it was not worth it."
bad,"Working at Radio Shack was not at all difficult to comprehend or complete. The most difficult part about working at Radio Shack was the compensation. Employees at ""The Shack"" are asked to do the same job as those employees working at major cellphone companies, with a pay that fails in comparison to those employees. In addition, employees at Radio Shack are asked to do a lot more tedious work, while decreasing compensation. There was also a constant revolving door of managers at my store in particular."
bad,well job is simple but to move in the company could be futile if have plans to move foward. Kind of sad
bad,"I worked at RadioShack for 7 years, advanced in the company and felt I always worked more then I got paid for. Job is constantly in jeopardy for your numbers and I didn't feel appreciated."
bad,High stress. Good sales incentives but unrealistic sales goals.
bad,Hardest part of this job is balancing home life. Managers are one men gangs. They do everything.
bad,great costumers poor management co workers was terrible hardest part of my job is to keep your personal life out of the work place most enjoyable part is I can help people get what they need
bad,Sales aren't very consistant and you have to have two item attachments to even get your sales commission.
bad,"A typical day would consist of counting the money before opening, making sure all tags are priced and product was out nice and neat. Making sure all demo products were live and working. Helping customers find the right product for them. The manager was okay he was lazy and had us do most of the work and the employees were okay to work with."
bad,"I wasnt really a fan of this company. I thought it was very slow with coming out with products and services, and also didnt like the pay."
bad,"As a company, Radio Shack is promoting the wrong people. They promote those who are solely good at sales and let leadership and administrative ability fall by the way side. I worked under a manager who was a great salesperson, but did not train new employees nor did she complete paperwork on time. She hit ""target metrics"" in sales but had to hire new associates almost monthly because she had no leadership ability and many employees quit without ever knowing the proper way to do the job."
bad,"Typically it can be very busy. We have to stay on our toes and be ready for any typeof customer asking for anything ranging from mobile phone to a resistor. Since working here, I've learned a lot about different small components of technology that I didn't know before. My co-workers are very pleasant to work with. We have kind of become a big family. the hardest part of the job was having to learn so many new terms such as ""capacitor"" or ""rf modulator"", but once you learn the lingo, then the job becomes pretty easy. The most enjoyable part of my job is interacting with the variety of people the come into the store."
bad,A lot of poor choices with their pay structure. Radio Shack is a dying breed. I was a MIT there and was told that I would get my own store within two months. Six months later I quit still as an MIT. Management wants to hold their best sales associates back so that they can just focus on selling rather than improving their resume with advancement opportunities. Every other electronic store pays better regardless of commission or not.
bad,"I was responsible for every aspect of this store: pricing, scheduling, delegating duties, cash deposits, loss prevention, etc. On a daily basis I had customer interactions that encompassed me selling product. If the store was slow I made sure pricing was correct and product was clean and presentable. At the end of the day i made a cash deposit and ensured the store was open ready for the next day. On several occasions when the store was burglarized I was required to drive to the store in the middle off the night to give the law enforcement access to our location to conduct their investigation. After they had left I remained.to contact and for the emergency repairman to come to secure whichever area was compromised. This was my first long term retail job. I honed my customer interaction skills, learned how to operate a point of sale system and do product inventory. The management here was not supportive and malicious to employees and customers alike. I trained many of my co-workers because there was a high turn over rate. Sometimes we had good teamwork and other times we didn't. This company didn't believe in giving raises because we worked with partial commission. So to earn a greater base pay one had to take on a harder job roll such as assistant manager or manager position. These rolls were hard to come by. The one thing I did enjoy about that job was when there were no customers, the employees were allowed to enjoy their own music and converse."
bad,"its retail, a high school job or retiree's job. There is no reason to make a career out of this unless you are in a higher area of management or operations."
bad,"Dealing with the public"
bad,"Helping customers with find products, answer any questions a customer has and solve problems for customers."
bad,Radioshack does not have good benefits and is not a company to make a career. Employees do not get paid enough to be doing all the duties that are assigned.
bad,I left for professional reasons. I attained my Bachelors in Social Science.
bad,"Commision rates were flip flopped while I was there. The region i was in was very iffy and unstable as far as reliable mangement. My own store changed management 3 times in the 9 months I was working there. I only stayed because I was told that there would be an open assistant manger position soon, i was never offered it and my hours could be as much as 40 or as little as 12 per week. The sales goals we had became unrealistic after the holiday season. Employees would let personal feelings affect the work. My manager didn't like me so I was eventually fired for something I was never trained in, even though my district manager had asked me weeks earlier to ""Please stay"" when I considered taking another job. The job itself could go along very well with college as the schedule is very flexible if your manager will let it be. You also get half price off of merchandise under the radioshack brand."
bad,"For a job where you get minimum wage and commission with no raises, they demand way too much from the employees. They want you to sell cell phones, but when you don't have people coming in to look for cell phones, and people don't want to hear your sales pitch for them, you get fussed at for not doing your job. I would not recommend anyone work for Radio Shack unless you can get a job at a store in a large mall."
bad,"This used to be a great company to work for.  Highly technical and interesting experiences were daily fare, now it is all about the cell phone plans... they don't even sell radios at RadioShack anymore."
bad,"A typical day at work is working with a great team that help one another out at all times. Great customers that come in just to say hi, because my team and myself give them the best customer service we can provide."
bad,"I don't really have the time without writing a novel, so here are some highlights. Current Leadership is totally out of line with Company direction and objectives, their is a reason Radio Shack has such a high employee turn over rate lack of training in the field as well as low comp plans for such a high demand of responsibility. Entirely too many leaders heading in different directions as well as Radio Shack driving the lowest profitable product in Wireless Service and expecting to be profitable."
bad,first job
bad,During my time at radioshack I was happy with my ability to advance in the company. I feel the company has poor leader ship and causes constiant changes in how things are done and creates unneccary stress. I also feel that working 6 days a week at a small salary it was not a fair trade. Then on your day off you always recieve non-important calls that interupt your single day to spend with your family from superiors. Poor awards and compensation for hard work.
bad,didnt make enough money to support a family but you do have a lot of fun and freedom.
bad,"lies were laid out everywhere, your own manager talked behind your back. It was just not cool."
bad,"The store in allentown pa that i worked out of was not a busy store, but i walked around,handed out flyers, and did alot of social networking within the store so that we would hit our quotas. The management at radioshack was not very good and the managers there do not like to help out there employees or anwser there phones whenever there is a problem and they need to be reached."
bad,"My typical day at work is making sure all our of tags for each product is on its on peg, ask every customer that walks in can I check their upgrade and also sell our products but mainly try to push cell phones. I have to try to sell RSSP(insurance) on 90% of our items in the store some seem reasonable and some seem ridiculous. If I don't keep my RSSP percentage up at a minimum my job is at risk and also my cell phone sale as well. They demand us to do many more task but they also cut our pay and we do not get raises as well. I been with the company for a little over 2 years as a part timer but they make me work like a full timer but I don't receive the same benefits as a full timer."
bad,Was a nice work enviornment. Only worked part time for a year.
bad,"Radio Shack Is A Company Now Putting All Of Their Money In Wireless Since That Honestly Is What's Keeping Them In Business Right Now. The Higher Ups In This Company Are Obviously Out of Touch With Reality On How Their Pricing Tiers Are And How They Treat Their Employees. One Of The Hardest Aspects Of The Job For Me Was Dealing With Irate Customers Who Had Issues With Their Cell Phones, And Those Older Customers Who Couldn't Wrap Their Head Around The Fact That Radio Shack Is Different Than It Was In The 1960's, 70's, and 80's As Far As What They Sell And How Much They Sell It For. They Constantly Change The Way They Things Every 2-3 Months And Are Huge Into Micro Managing Things. They Also Give You An Insane Amount Of Tasks While Cutting The Hours At The Same Time To The Point Where You Start To Question What's More Important Between Helping The Customers Of Hearing Somebody Scream About A Count Not Getting Done Because You're The Only One Working In The Store For The First 3-4 Hours It's Open. The Only Thing Good Was Having The Possibility To Control How Much Money You Could Make Depending On How Many Phones And Other Wireless Accessories You Could Sell And With Warranties On Many Items In The Store.....Notice How I Said That In Past Tense? Right! Because Starting In July Radio Shack Lower Their Phone Commissions From $30-45 Per Cell Phone You Sell To $12-16 Per Cell Phone Along With Completely Getting Rid Of Our Commissions On Warranties. They Replaced It With What They Call ""Team Incentive Pay"" Where You, Your Manager, And All Your Co-Workers Have To Be At Certain Percentages"
bad,"Company has changed alot over the last 3yrs. Cut pay, extended hours and staffing is a major issue."
bad,"the company its self is great i would still be there if not for my manager stealing 400$+ from my pay check, the mobile phone job is amazing i love it! just not who i was working with."
bad,I worked at radio shack for over a year and I got no advancement. I was the number one seller for several months and nothing. Finally the DM gives me a break and makes me a manager of a store and leaves out to hang and die. I had never been in a true position of management but I will say it was interesting. I managed the store for three weeks then got place back at my old store with a new manage who could barely speak English. It was horrible. I asked about becoming an assistant store manager but got no response. When I finally gave my 2 weeks notice the District manager fired me. Radio Shack my have their set of values and ethics but the hardly meet up to them.
bad,Radio Shack is a good place for a starter job for someone interested in sales. They pay a little over minimum wage+spiff and Commission. They don't tell you enough about the products and management is just based on your tenure not your knowledge about the job so there is no guidance. The only way to make more money is to sell their overpriced phones.
bad,In order to have a good check you have to sell a good amont of product evey week. Cell phones sell make the most and signing people up for charge accounts
bad,Its an ok place to work but as far as buying products well not so much. The prices are expensive and depending on the salesman the customer service can be a good experience or bad because he/she is pushy. The main key is listening to the customers need not pushing other products the customer dont want or need. Staff is knowledgeable of most of the products except for small parts which is a big deal since thats what radioshack started out as they've shunned away from the true radioshack. BUt other than that they usually have the product you are looking for in stock if not they can get it to within a couple of days.
bad,"I was treated poorly because I'm female. I was denied advancements, and my sales were routinely stolen. In addition, the pressure to achieve the minimum $75/hour sales drives competition into a frenzy and tears the team spirit apart."
bad,Established a good relationship with a lot of employees. Benefits are not great especially healthcare. Pay is minimum wage but with commission.
bad,• Offered the latest products in technology to customers
bad,"This company does not give health care, and all but management work off commission. They try and push cell phones on every one who walks in their doors."
bad,Empresa que necesita pulir algunos puntos acerca de su administracion.
bad,"RadioShack was a sales job that was difficult at times, mainly due to having many online competitors. If you know how to talk to people and sell, this company would have been just for you!"
bad,"Radio Shack was a great place to work, but I was fresh out of college and wanted more. I transferred from Jefferson City Radio Shack to St. Louis; and it wasn't the same.  They were slowly going out of business so there was no future in the company.  That's when I went to Enterprise."
bad,"Don't recommend as the Radio Shack is no longer.  It is now owned by liquidator and Sprint."
bad,There were so many voids left regarding information technology and parts/supplies for electronic equipment when the Shack left Vicksburg. Let's bring it back asap!!!
bad,"While it has been a number of years since my departure, as time pressed on you quickly realize how much the corporate policies can hinder, where they are intended to help."
bad,En el proceso aprender a abordar a un cliente con la facilidad de palabra y saber manejar situaciones complicadas con clientes complicados .
bad,Generally I abserved the needs of the customer and ordered product to fulfill these needs.  I strived to have a store that would fulfill the general needs of each customer
bad,What can I say? I got out at the right time. RadioShack couldn't find their place in this generation. Over 90% of sales had to do with phones. My first manager was a sexist pig who used the ladies bathroom for storage. My second manager was amazing but overworked. I was offered a job managing a store before I left but I didn't want to live in the store.
bad,"A typical day at RadioShack involved assisting every customer, managing inventory and constantly changing the look of the store. The hardest part of the job was meeting the extreme daily quotas."
bad,I joined the team at Radio Shack and was quickly promoted. The environment in my store was one of unity and teamwork. Unfortunately the company ended up closing its stores shortly after I started.
bad,"I was a part-time worker because I needed more money during the summer and during a fall semester. I worked only on the weekends during the semester, but my manager liked my so much that he treated me like an assistant manager. Which is great, but it came with a lot of additional and needless stress. I had a panic attack at work once and was sent home early because of it. I ended up putting in my 2 week's notice and leaving before the start of the next spring semester."
bad,I don't see the relevance in giving a review about a company  that is no longer in business.  It was bittersweet to see a store close that truly did it's best to keep going
bad,"Was out of work, took job, boss was good employess were freat low pay and no advancement  Thought I would be there for a while, but learning about company closure, I had to leave."
bad,not a good place treated their employees horribly if you got paid well they fired you. they set unrealistic sales goals for locations on items that were possible
bad,"My coworkers were great, and he company was great until the business started to fail. Management refused to tell us whether our store was closing or not so we wouldn't leave."
bad,Radio Shack is closing down therefore they do not care about their workers and is slowly taking away all the benefits of the job just to satisfy the corporate needs
bad,I dont really have anything to say one thing i can say is i enjoyed some of the people i worked with but the manager was not not someone i would i ever work for again...
bad,"I learned a lot of base knowledge about engineering just by working for the store. A typical day is checking that no missing price tags were around, rearranging a lot of product to different spots, and helping with each customer with a greeting and asking questions to find what they needed. Workplace culture mostly was casual as long as putting your best first each day. Hardest part of the job was the micromanaging of keeping up with daily tracking for upper management on what was sold and how many and if we asked all of the questions required to upsell Most enjoyable part was watching it all go bankrupt to their bad decisions of firing the marketing department from the first bankruptcy, forcing employees to do footwork and advertising themselves on social media, then continuously berating the sales associates and store managers. "
bad,The job was not that bad.  Great sales team.  You were given the opportunity to learn a lot while you were there.  The company was big on cross training.
bad,"the horribly low commission does little to motivate employees to reach the unobtainable goals. a culture of blaming store employees for failing company. poor corporate management and lack of communication causes a constant change of direction that impedes performance. overall an exhausting environment to work in. benefits arent bad, but only offered to full-timers, and most employees are kept part-time."
bad,"No need to apply for any position in this company as the over the past 15 years Radio Shack forgot it's core values and who their core customers were, gradually gave less and less to its employees and will be going down to very few stores if any at all."
bad,"Most of this job was store maintenance, because there wasn't a lot of foot traffic. Every so often there would be some new asinine orders from Corporate that would shake things up, but it usually didn't last and for the most part the job was very laid back. Being surrounded by electronics and components is a good relaxing environment for any geek worth his soldering iron."
bad,"i would show up open the store. turn on all store demos. then i would count cash in the register to make sure its the ammount it should be. clean store a little and help customers. radioshack has Sales goals they want you to reach every month. such as cell phones/plans, cell phone accessories, cell phone add a line etc."
bad,"Keeping up the store and helping out customers was a fine job. The pay was minimum wage with commission based on cell phone sales and warranties. There was allot of pressure from cooperate to push cell phones onto customers at the time, with minimum sales numbers to meet. This was an issue because my store might have only 3 customers the entire day. I had multiple shifts where I never even had a customer come in. Hours started to drop and that location closed down a few years after I left."
bad,Working at store level with employees is great untill you get harrassed for not selling a particular item daily alot of times hourly and harrassing phone calls first thing in the morning
bad,"Work hard for little pay.forced to sell warrentys that arent worth the paper they are printed on. not allowed to work overtime but, but forced to clock out to finish the sale"
bad,"Radioshack is a pretty decent place to work if you are looking to get into an entry level position in retail. The Employee's and training are pretty good at getting you setup with the right tools and skills you will need to succeed at most any retail position."
bad,Company was struggling to stay ahead of its debt. It over worked it employees because they wanted to sell everything to the customers even when the customers did not want it.
bad,"Other than the lack of management and no regard for customer service, the actual ""work"" was mostly standing around and talking to people."
bad,Always have the opportunity to make as much money as you want. Base pay + commission. Fast paced environment and very sales driven.
bad,lots mirco management. great co workers and great customers .. plenty of weekends and holidays. long hours. great training
bad,Best part of the job was helping all sorts of people learn today's electronics and also help the ones that are still stuck in the 1970's. The hardest part about the job is finding staff that is knowledgeable about what is in the store and also that can give great customer service. Upper management is always giving you more things to do even when you're not done with the other tasks.
bad,working at Radioshack is ok but prices were too high for customers and we get commission for selling cell phones but wasn't much & sometimes cost arguments between co workers
bad,The company is currently in bankruptcy so it is obviously not the best place to work. Many fiefdoms in this company - not much communication between the departments which is part of the reason they are in bankruptcy.
bad,"Financially struggling and trying to stay relevant to the consumer."
bad,"I pride myself on maximizing the sales and profit of 21 retail locations, ensuring the right management teams are in place, sales leadership, training and development, execution of non-negotiable standards of operation, cost control, and asset protection."
bad,Very understandable organization that consistently tries to keep up with current trends and business models.
bad,"Would not work here again.  Poorly managed, very low work hourly compensation."
bad,"I worked for Radioshack for 5 years and never saw anyone promoted from the management position.  It's long hours, weekends, holidays, and constant micromanagment.  It was a great job in college, but this company is fighting an uphill battle with larger electronic chains.  They set unrealistic sales goals and don't compensate employees well."
bad,"great job, great people,great manager,great employees,  low pay."
bad,"Management wasn't good, and products were pushed that I wouldn't buy in 100 years."
bad,I love working with customers on a daily basis however I believe in order to make a business work corporate should take care of there employees.
bad,"Many different computer skills, and multi-tasking. "
bad,"a typicl day here was challenging seeing that I had to sell as may batteries, offer wireless to every customer it was a lot a times."
bad,"As a supervisor a typical day would consist of counting the cash drawer, doing an inventory of the cell phones, setting the day's agenda and delegating tasks to other employees. Since this was a commission based job, providing excellent customer service was imperative since it translated to sales. This could prove challenging at times since the inconsistency of sales traffic led to pay that was below expectations."
bad,Company was fun to work for however the Advancement chances where not there. The pay never was enough to cover your bills and the high pressure to sell was not worth the paycheck. Nice tight nit group.
bad,I did sales here when I started in school before I found a REAL JOB
bad,enviroment was very stressful and management was never really helpful in solving the situation.
bad,"A typical day at RadioShack would consist of selling products to customers, replacing sales tags, and training new employees. My co-workers were great, very intelligent, and had a great mind set of company. Management was great as well, my manager was the sole reason of me being the top salesman of our district. With his training I was able to become the stores assistant manager"
bad,"Was told advancements were in my favor, but instead when I was off the manager picked a different employee. I was fine with that as the other employee was a close friend, but then the store got cut hours and I was left to 4 hours a week. If your not a person who likes to steal peoples sells then radio shack is NOT for you."
bad,"This is an okay place to work but it gets muntain, I have learned alot about electronics, cell phones, programing. The extra employees have been really lazy so I end up picking up alot of extra things to do that they have not done that were assigned to them to do. Management is good, can't really say there is anything enjoyable about my job other than I have one."
bad,"I liked my job at first, but after working there for years I never once got a raise, even after bringing it up to my manager. I worked extremely hard there, but never got any kind of recognition, or compensation, which just left me feeling abused. My managers never once even thanked me for all the overtime and extra effort I put in for our customers. I eventually left for a company that treated me better."
bad,"most days their were a lot of sitting around because of a slow location when you did have a customer talk about wireless you had a lot of pressure to accesorize and add service plans,stocking merchandise could take time from helping customers.co-workers were a lot of fun a diverse group that had a lot of knowledge.over all the company had such tough numbers to meet on a monthly basis and if you had a slow store you were doomed from the beginning"
bad,One of the worst jobs I ever had but I love the people I work with we're still friends to this day
bad,everyday was a slow day. learned how to work with the public.
bad,the most frustrating thing about Radioshack for me is that my coworker who was much lazier got a better job where all he does is sell wireless doesn't have to do planograms doesn't have to help customers if they aren't buying cell phones.
bad,"Incredible pressure by district managers to make number quotas with threat of losing your job. Unreliable managers with little to no training. Managers and district managers have little to no knowledge of the employee handbook and company policies. Minimum wage, plus commission, with no raises. Little to no room for career advancement. Company shows almost no regard for employees on the sales associate level. Very poor place to work."
bad,"Start with paperwork, straiten inventory on floor, sell to customers, coach employees and assist in wireless sales, review p & l."
bad,"RadioShack, in my opinion, wont be along for very much longer. The corporate management is some of the worst I have ever. They are trying to compete in a market that they had several years ago but are quickly to losing other companies such as Best Buy. The pay for all their employees is terrible, and that includes the store managers."
bad,Was not so fond of this work experience. There was hardly any customers.
bad,"-set/review goals, training, lead by example"
bad,The company has gone out of business.  The management was inconsistent.  They made promises but did not follow through.  The also put all their emphasis on cell phone sales and had no plan to generate income when the cell phone craze became more mainstream and less profitable.
bad,el clima laboral no era el mas optimo por lo cual el desenpeño de los trabajadores se ve reducido.
bad,A typical workday included proper placement of new inventory or freight. Correct pricing of merchandise. Display of new sales end caps and re-positioning of certain products. The hardest part of the job was the constant changes that were being made. Management was terrible and demonstrated little leadership
bad,"Terrible upper management, unreachable quotas, constant push to up-sell, significant amount of time spent rearranging the store. Radioshack was too busy focusing on how to try and make the most money on selling phones/accessories when they should have been focusing on how to save themselves as a company."
bad,Constant concern of being laid off due to the financial stresses the organization was under.  Management at the Divisonal level would cross the line of harrasment and verbal violence if mistakes were made.  Little support from corporate to help run district.  Not a clear explantion of goals and expectation.  Required one to learn daily and improve skills of organization and expediting self made directives due to lack of upper management support
bad,"This job kinda sucked, it was a business that didnt grow with the times. the higher ups usually want you to focus sales on things that dont really matter like batteries and power cables."
bad,todo en esta empresa es bueno pero lo unico mal es que en las emporadas que yo estuve contrataban solo temporadas.
bad,"I started at one location and was transferred without being asked to another location. The location I was transferred to was in a mall location and there was lots of theft in the store. Coworkers were very cutthroat. Management didn't manage, she was too friendly and showed favoritism in the scheduling"
bad,"Working at Radioshack was at times, like any job, a headache. However the (former) management which drove the company into the ground treated their employees like they're garbage. Since it went bankrupt only a handful of stores which have a right to use the name still exist."
bad,"Most of the people were great, but some not so much.  Very stuck up and unfiendly. I was laid off alot with another person who did the same thing.  Then they hired someone else to do our jobs."
bad,Only reason I didn't give a good review is because this company went bankrupt and isn't a big name anymore. The culture made working there fun and you got to play with all of the new gadgets. Easily one of the funnest jobs I have had.
bad,"Very chill environment, management wasnt the greatest, they always changed your schedule, went by what they wanted and never went by your own schedule"
bad,"The company isn't always necessarily a bad one, but it doesn't know what it wants to be or how it wants to get there. Messages sent by corporate are conrradictory and often completely idiotic."
bad,Management wasn't into training you how to take care of the customers but on how to get the customers to buy a lot from the store to increase profit for the store.
bad,"I started as a young person and worked my way up to a management position. At first a great opportunity to learn job skills and good work ethics. The company of course in it's later years were on a downward trend. I was a victim of that. Hard times, layoffs and other things going on within the company."
bad,"This was one of the most interesting jobs I have had as every day corporate, field management would throw something new and challenging your way...but all in all I had a great time with RSH and they will be missed when they close all their stores"
bad,"I worked at Radio Shack a long time ago and I doubt my review can be thought as up-to-date.  No health coverage and when I was there your continued employment depended on how many addresses you collected.  I could have been released at any time if they had wanted to.  And could be called in at any time to cover a sick employee or, in my case, was sent to a new location to cover for a manager who left (and I wasn't a manager nor trained to be one)."
bad,"Upper Management is constantly putting employees in unethical situations with no apparent actions to change policies.  "
bad,"Easy enough of a job once you get into a routine, alot of down time but unobtainable sales goals and not given a fair chance due to prices being inflated compared to competitors"
bad,"Our sales expectations were always increasing while the quality of our services and products continued to diminished. The pay was horrible. The job paid minimum wage plus commission and spiffs. The commission and spiffs structure changed during my time with the company resulting in a smaller paycheck. We were expected to do the job of a cellular sales representative for a fraction of the pay. Poor upper management. Higher positions were always filled from outside the company, never from within."
bad,"Firstly, this job was a very long time ago so my description may be inaccurate in defense of the company. A typical day at work was essentially helping customers and keeping the store clean. I had to know a lot of product knowledge. This was a time when Radio Shack sold very small components that you had to have knowledge of. Things are much simpler now. I learned a a lot about electrical components and computer parts. I have no complaints about management. My most enjoyable part of the job was satisfying the customer and getting them what they needed."
bad,"Job did not balance importance of anything but selling Verizon Wireless phones. We were instructed to push devices on customers evenn if they came in for a pack of batteries. Ultimately, if you did not sell a phone in a month you were threatend w/ being fired."
bad,"there was no room for advancement and no raises. Except for my co workers, working there was an awful experience. I would not recommend work there."
bad,"a closing business, with bad plans. no care for employees or customers. no advancement, 20+ year store managers, with district and regional managers being hired off the streets."
bad,"love to work with customers learned new items on the market , pay was very low . learned planagraming  . and display . loved mr coworkers ."
bad,"Radio shack was great. I loved the team i built in the long run things were not seeing in a great way till it was sold.  "
bad,"This place is okay as a first job but don't expect it to be anything more than that. The pay is minimum wage, there is almost no advancement, and the management for the most part is awful. The most enjoyable thing is that if you're lucky, on a busy day you can make a lot of commission but that's probably the hardest thing to do because you get your sales stolen most of the time by your own manager. You learn a lot about cell phones and other electronics and also about a lot of cell phone contracts and such so that's a plus as well. You also meet a lot of amazing people as coworkers and costumers, as well as some not so great."
bad,"A typical day there is just receiving merchandise as well as placing orders for customers and the store.  Performing great customer service and also having to meet a performance retail sales goal.  Management could have been better, but it was still good.  I learned how to do proper paperworks as well as filing, faxing, and copying.  I can now operate a retail store on my own.  My co-workers were good I had to train them all, so once they learned what I taught them thats when their performance have improved.  The hardest part of the job is having over 5 customers that need help and being the only one that was able to help them.  The most enjoyable part was being able to network and talk to new people."
bad,"No sales, no management really, it was like being paid to sitting around and sort through other people stuff."
bad,"a typical day at work would start with cleaning, loading software for customer cash-out, organizing the store and of course checking company and personal (company related) email for updates and events. After that, customers start coming in as the open sign lights up. Reassuring yourself and your coworkers that the customer is satisfied, and always willing to leave your store in his/her consideration set of companies for future purchases as well as referrals."
bad,"I have learned a lot working for this company, however, there is definitely a lot of change overall and a lot for me personally during my tenure.  Overall the people are loyal and great to work with, however, the overall environment needs improving."
bad,"Work was work, I really didn't look forward to coming into work. where I worked was mostly Spanish which I spoke none."
bad,"RadioShack was in essence a nice place of employment. Though there were sales goals, they were easily achievable if you were willing to you work tail of to succeed. The day usually consisted on selling merchandise with an emphasis on high ticket items, namely cellular phones. During down times it was mostly cleaning or updating plannograms which was a great was the pass the time between sales. Near the end of November, RadioShack reported a large financial loss, the company suddenly went in to desperation mode with frequent management changes, sky rocketing sales goals, and drastically lowering the overall treatment of employees. In summary, as long as they're able to get back on their feet, they should continue to be a quality business with quality products, and hopefully, quality employees."
bad,"great team to work with just not enough hours . i love and enjoy working with others  i enjoy getting to know my customers ."
bad,"It was a fun job because of the people I worked with every day but as far as overall management, it was a really bad company to work for."
bad,"Learned a lot about management duties. Processed weekly budget, generated payroll and learned about data entry."
bad,"Easy going workplace, very flexible schedule. Hardest part about the job, meeting the high standards of the company with such little to work with. Most all coworkers are amazing, management at the store level is great, once past store level company has fallen apart. Learned to handle all types of customers in different environments."
bad,"The pay could definitely be better, compared to the number of hours you have to put in. It is definitely a learning experience and was a lot  fun learning about all the latest and oldest technologies."
bad,"Decent. Some people have the opinion that if you're a girl, you don't know too much about electronics but little do they know WE as Sales associates have to take classes and watch much, much hours of video & literature."
bad,"Meeting and greeting customers, stocking, receiving."
bad,Working at Radio Shack was very educational and productive everyday. As a manager I would get to work an hour before the store opens for the day and prepare for the day. Such as file all the paper work from the previous day. Reading all the company emails that are sent. Walk the store and check for cleanliness and make sure all devices on display are functional and then the day begins. I have learned a lot at Radio Shack from managing people to helping people. Learned to keep track of inventory and payroll. Inventory and payroll are the most important part of retail. A store needs merchandise and people to sell the merchandise. The hardest part of the job for me was counselling employees. The best part of the job is learning about new electronics.
bad,this company saw its employees as replaceable it was a fun work place but you were not wel cared for
bad,Company was once a very nice place to work loved going in everyday..the past couple of years they changed direction and starting managing by threats
bad,Low Salary but is a small company 6 day work weeks I think they have 5 now. but a min of 55-60 hrs during non holiday seasons and 60 to 80 during Christmas. Customers were fun the DM and RD made the job not so much.
bad,A typical day of work contains infrequent traffic of customers. I've learn a great deal about electronics and wireless services. The staff and immediate management are effective and mostly cooperative.
bad,"Compensation was based on productivity, not enjoyable due to slow business. Co-workers were helpful and friendly. Inventory was always fun with pizza."
bad,"RadioShack, although has been a great opportunity to learn about some of the latest technology, really has its issues. All corporate cares about is selling cell phones, to everyone, even if they came in for an auxiliary cable. Its quite ridiculous..."
bad,a good learning experience with in depth knowledge of electronics and how they work. Good place to brush up your sales skills. Overall not an ideal career.
bad,"While working at radioshack I did really well, the staff was freindly, the compensation great. They, as a company, just lacked a morale compass. They wanted you to force Cellphones down consumer throats. Just really really push for them even if the consumer wouldn't be able to budget it. I didn't agree with this. other than that and some of the management at other locations (who would throw you under the bus, and yell at you in front of consumers so they could make more compensation) I thought it was an ""Okay"" job."
bad,I worked here for the birth of apples first iPhone. The popular ipod made its debut. Was cutthroat selling and inventory could be painful. Wasn't a bad job in its day.
bad,"I've worked at worse places than Radioshack but they were dangerously behind the curve when it came to their customer base. Way too much emphasis on cellular and keeping up with big box companies killed their business, which is why the company no longer exists."
bad,It was clear that the higher ups were stifling the bleeding but if you could of stuck it through there were moments with the customers that made it ok
bad,"Mal ambiente laboral ya que por más que hagas todo lo que te dicen cuando llega tu distrital abraham muñoz te dice que todo está mal, y luego la subgerenta sandra Ruiz de tienda si está de buenas te trata bien pero si no la trae contigo y en caso que ella haga algo mal te echa la culpa a ti y eso sí. Contar que si le dices algún comentario se pone a llorar y todo el tiempo te amenaza con levantarte actas administrativas bueno eso es aquí en Mérida en la 1578 americas"
bad,Radioshack was an okay company. Quit a few years ago because of a robbery. We were held at gunpoint. It was one of the worst experience of my life. tragic.
bad,As I first entered Radio Shack was not knowledgeable on Electronics so being hired as an Asst.Manager little hard with customers Had a lot of training to do after a year was able to get my own store Small store in competition with Mall store only a few miles up the road.Could not get inventory I needed to compete leaving me to be released I did do everything that was asked of me met quota on service plans.All mark downs on sale items were done in timely manner always on time DBL my cell phone plans from previous year Working on commission made making a decent salary hard when your customer base just wasn't there
bad,"Well, They went bankrupt. They had a lot of things to offer but they decided to go way off course with there initial vision. They had a lot of time to compete, but decided not to."
bad,very poor management from corporate. lots of internal theft. overwhelming amount of daily operations which were micromanaged all the while boosting sales and upselling products
bad,"-A typical day was filed with merchandising , selling, inventory management, and cash management."
bad,The atmosphere was very relaxed. The main issue was selling an item that either didn't work or was way over priced. Mandatory Incredible's sales were a pain.
bad,Dont bother applying they wont last much longer. They are going to slowly downsize into nonexistence. They were once a great company but the fell away from the things that made them great
bad,"Less about gadgets and electronics, and more about pushing cell phones on people at every turn. Wouldn't work there again, as I wasn't expecting it to be so heavy on selling wireless."
bad,"A basic day would have been to help anyone who comes by the door greet them in a friendly matter and try to achieve their needs however most of the time we were out of stock of the item they desired unless it was a basic auxiliary cable or mic connection. We were asked by our superiors to meet sales quota however they did not allow to order the top selling items for the store and instead send whatever they desired. Cellphones were usually outdated and the specials we had were low compared to competitors. Sales associates had to learn to cope with low inventory, searching for the item desired by a customer hoping it may be located in other stores so it could be shipped or even picked up by the sales associate. While the store had its flaws the most loyal customers came by even at the end of the store life. What was most enjoyable was the thanks that we got as a team for the effort we put to help each customer to new and unfamiliar technology."
bad,I went into this job with a goal I never got a chance to obtain. Days mostly involve cleaning the store and semi begging customers to buy certain things. It can be difficult to not seem the sleazy salesman sometimes.
bad,i left the job because of personal reasons witch i decided to pursue my BA in Marketing the capacity of growing as a carer sales man in this company was not on my objective and the company hit bankruptcy witch lead me to make the decision to improve my education
bad,"This company is in the process of failing.  I had fun working here, but in retrospect it seems like it was a waste of time.  I learned a lot about various electronics, and had to learn quickly how to deal with people that were in a bad mood or altered state of mind."
bad,I had no problem working their. I just wish they had let me know how bad the company was off before I got hired. I would have look for a job with better job security. I only work for six months before the store I work at closed down.
bad,"The location wasn't the best for this company. It was a modest atmosphere suitable for a retired person. The hours were minimum wage, and you could get sales from selling phones."
bad,Radio Shack is not a place to work for a long time. It is very difficult to get promoted as well as getting any type of raise. It all depends the management in charge that makes a good atmosphere.
bad,Immediate management was very good and I was taught a lot about the retail business. The company in the 8 years I worked for them had 5 CEO's and not of the management directions from that view.
bad,"A typical day consisted of selling items and having conversation with customers about how to use the items and what us that was in the store that will compliment it. Review of associate progress and helping them break their barriers. Maintain store appearances. Review contracts and file away. Writing e-mails and communicating with district/regional. Setting daily goals for store associates and filling everyone in on the hot items. Handling customer complaints and satisfaction in store. Budget store expenses and review profit & loss statements. Order merchandise for the store. Complete inventory of stores in district."
bad,"Radioshack has a very bad management and there is no advancement   what so ever, people getting fired for ridiculous excuses with no verbal warning or even written warning and they acquire you to work a Three mans work"
bad,"They pay well,  and have great products; but they don't have store security or a very good accountability system. While employees are not particularly well compensated(key holders in particular) due to position cuts, they do have a strong culture of hiring for upper positions in house. It it very sales oriented position, but if you get the wrong type of manager, there is little accountability outside OSHA options."
bad,I went back to this company despite being shafted out of a promised promotion and had to fight tooth and nail to get said position after I went back. I dealt with up to date technology (mainly phones) on a day to day basis assisting customers who needed help setting up DIY projects.
bad,"Start day with email, pervious days paperwork, opened store, helped customer find what they were looking for- what brought them into Radio Shack. Helping the elderly was the best part of the job. Set up next weeks schedule, work around part-time employees school schedules."
bad,Not to much to say a great company stuck in the past. Loved working for RadioShack. A typical day was slow with a million questions. You will be a tech guru when your finished working here. Store managers where great DM's not so.... The hardest part was going beyond customer care giving great knowledge only for the customer to buy the item cheaper somewhere else. The most enjoyable part was actually demonstrating  electronics.
bad,I Supervised 7 people on a day to day basis and operated a store with minimum input ny district manager. The comapny was decent but expected alot more.
bad,"Low wage, no management overview, no support from corporate, feeling sense of impending doom at the company.  The only positive part of the job would be people you work with."
bad,"A typical day for a manager would consist of opening my location. Reviewing the daily metrics for the previous day. Setting goals for the store as well as individual goals for all the associates working that day. We would interact with customers on a personal level recommending the best products to fit their needs. Managers were responsible for hiring the associates for their location which made the work environment very comfortable because there was only 4 associates working at a time. The hardest part of the job was competing with other stores in the area who had the same product, and also the amount of customers we saw compared to other big box stores like Walmart or Best Buy."
bad,"While the work environment was very appealing, the workload was extreme beyond industry guidelines."
bad,"You will learn about electronics and salesmanship at the expense of low pay, lackluster benefits, and the irritation of trying to sell expensive goods to a local market that not only lacks the money to but will often refuse to listen, preventing you from using your skills. If you know more that most employees regarding the merchandise, expect pass-offs from your coworkers that force you to waste time on a low yield sale, comission-wise. For me, I ended up being a glorified stock boy and tech support rather than making any money on sales. There is some potential to make money while working there but it often comes down to luck."
bad,"Knowledge required to learn on the job is valuable.  It's good to work around the latest technology and gadgets, however, commission and incentives are terribly weak."
bad,"I like my manager, however the corperation had very bad values. I enjoyed assisting customer and playing with all the new toys and phones, however the job was stressful due to having unrealisitic sales goals."
bad,i was trained very well to be a great customer service rep. I however thought as employee i was mis-treated.
bad,"I've been with Radio Shack for about 2 years.They train you pretty well, all free training,especially for apple which was legit for me. The pay sucks for how much you learn and have to do. They do not care about your personal life.I get paid $9 an hour as an assistant manager which i find ridiculous,and i feel used to the ground. Commission is supposed to drive you,but you only get 2% of what you sell which is absolutely nothing when you get your paycheck. The managers can be really lazy at times,really depending on the manager. The associates are usually good, some can be really lazy and shady when they sell warranties on you,then i have to deal with that person when someone told them false information. They push for cell phones like crazy,and if you don't sell any then you are gone. Keep in mind that we would have to know everything for contract phones and push them harder than non contracts. The Contract phones were AT&T, Sprint, and Verizon. You have to know everything about every carrier, same with the no contracts, which are Net10 and Tracfone, Verizon, AT&T, Boost Mobile, Cricket (Radio Shack's line of phones), and Virgin Mobile. The customers,like everywhere else is a hit or miss.But that's retail for you. It's a good job if you are in high school,living at home with your parents,but you cant survive on your own working here,even as a manager you live paycheck to paycheck."
bad,Hired just long enough to get their Radio Shack built and running and to show someone else how to run the store.
bad,"co-workers are great, upper management always changing as well as the company and they always promise to be a better place but so far they have failed to accomplish that."
bad,"While this job paid the most of any of my jobs because of commission, I was not a fan of the regular customers who were rude most of the time, the management who was also rude and snarky most of the time. It was obvious anyone there didn't want to be there (occasionally we had nice customers)."
bad,"Radio Shack allowed me to not only work full time for them, but gave me the opportunity to work other jobs outside of the company as well. As a freelance photographer, Radio Shack, worked with me and my schedule to insure that I would be available to cover certain events."
bad,"my typical day was selling items to customers and helping them find what they needed, answering the phones, and placing orders, sending shipments to other stores, checking in and putting away shipments, fronting, spacing, cleaning products"
bad,"The upper management is always putting unattainable goals on the stores, and acting surprised and angry when you as a manager don't hit them. For me the pay is ok for the work load, and the atmosphere is what you make it. its a good starter job with some wireless experience."
bad,"Once I arrive at work, I clock in and check my goals/email. When customers come in I ask what brought them in, and if I could be of any assistance. I do my best to sell them products that I think would benefit them or fulfill their needs."
bad,This company filed for bankruptcy twice while I worked for them.  That was clearly my main reason for leaving.  They don't have any stores open currently.
bad,After the first bankruptcy the company was sold to lender who said they had some minor changes they would make and the company would continue forward under the new owners. 6 months later we had lost most of the district and regional level management and they cut all managers pay by as much as 50%
bad,"As everybody knows radio shack is closing lots of locations,and a lot of employees are getting laid off. Do not get me wrong i loved my job but the lack of  higher management was sad, and even working hard and trying to meet quotas, the whole company including their marketing department was poor.  would not recommend."
bad,"Company went down the drain. Started as an okay job then the pay was no longer good enough. Took almost two years for me to get a raise, especially with the traveling I did for the company."
bad,"RadioShack has changed over the years in a major way. Back in 2012 they went bankrupt, but partner with Sprint to keep the doors open. So most RadioShacks have Sprint stores inside them. The upper powers get on you if your numbers aren't good. Their whole idea is that for every customer that comes in to buy something, they want that customer to spend at least $20.00, and its your job to make sure they do. RadioShack tries to push their own brands, especially their Ncrediable brand headphones by Nick Canon. Thats all they seem to care about honestly. Headphones and batteries. Your store could do over $1,000.00 in sales, but if you didn't sell any Ncrediables or a pack a batteries they will say something to you. Its ridiculous!"
bad,Low pay rate with high expectations in terms of commission sales. Fun work environment at times. Also a lot can be learned from staff meetings. They meet with representatives from all phone carrier companies which can open doors for more opportunities
bad,"Awesome start to sales career, a lot of different products in store. TV's, cellular, board builder. My manager was amazing he taught me how to run a store and maintain profitability."
bad,"I had the benefit of working for one of the better managers in the company. All in all it was very relaxed, but the company made some questionable business decisions. Coworkers were great, store manager was great. Upper management was awful, no hopes for advancement. Hardest part of the job was working up the energy to go in. Best part of the job was the environment though."
bad,"Radioshack offers a good work environment with great people. However, the company is going through a very rough time with a history of bad executives and a struggling industry."
bad,"The pay scale and company is not stable."
bad,"A typical day at Radio Shack was always a fun learning experience  dealing with different kinds of culture, meeting people, learning about there wants and needs.my co worker and i we always  become a family there at the work place because i always make people feel appicated.As a team and a leader you have to encouraged your team help them when there's a question to be answer."
bad,More days than not are slow. You will commonly find yourself with little to no work left to do. Other days can be busy only because of staffing issues which may leave you running the location by yourself for the majority to an entire shift. Upper management is hit or miss. Quality personnel are hard to find due to compensation issues and unachievable sales goals. Hardest part(s) of the job is trying to meet goals with no customer traffic/finding work and tasks to accomplish when there have been no customer(s) for hours at a time. Most enjoyable part of the job is assisting customers with their needs and teaching them about new and existing technologies.
bad,"RadioShack was once a fun and enjoyable place to work, where in every store there was a sense of camaraderie and togetherness.  Many of the store managers and district managers are good people who care about their associates.  However, over the years RadioShack has evolved as a company and certain things I used to like I no longer find joy in.  The hardest part of the job is definitely the overall pressure placed upon the employees to be absolutely perfect.  On the other hand, RadioShack carries many products that are interesting to learn about and some of the people I have worked with I find truly remarkable."
bad,"a typical day at work i am alone, trying to do the best i can when there is short staff. learned a lot about sales, could be a great place to work for college students not a career oriented. the hardest part about the job would be inventory. the most enjoyable part of the job would be the knowledge of knowing the phone updates etc."
bad,"Honestly one of the most unappreciative, under wheeling , underpaying companies I've worked for.  The demands on hitting numbers is everyday with unobtainable goals.  The plan you out of bonuses which they promise in hiring for pay...."
bad,"◾Build a loyal customer base by creating long-term relationships"
bad,Enjoyed working in this company. You are well trained and talents are used at there best.
bad,I learned a lot of retail skills. The company is not doing well right now and the management is unstable.
bad,"Radioshack does nothing to truly differientiate itself from other companies such as best buy. It has become another Cell Phone retailer and offers almost nothing in service and know how. I remember as a kid being able to go into Radioshack and they would help me rebuild an electronic or give me great technical advice! Now, it's about selling cruddy warrenties on cruddyy products and pushing cell phone activations. It's kind of pathetic how Radioshack cannot find a real market and is being murdered by other competitors."
bad,"open the store ,greeted people, helped with many different needs, stocked the shelf's,and cashiered."
bad,Well now they are closed for good. Very boring job. Just sat behind the counter most the day waiting on people to come buy stuff. Co-workers were cool.
bad,Was my first job. did not have much to compare it to. I left the company before they closed down. It was a decent place to work for. Commission was always changing.
bad,For good reason. The tech that made RadioShack great became obsolete and was replaced by the smart phone. Management couldn't or wouldn't catch up in time.
bad,"Learned alot to bad went out of business "
bad,"This wasn't the greatest place to work at. Retail remains retail no matter what, and back in my time working for Radioshack, this certainly applied as well, "
bad,It was a good experience for me working with people and learning the commission and electronics for people's needs. Cellphones were the biggest sales point of view.
bad,"why i need to make a review for a company that no longer exist?"
bad,"This company no longer sells hardward, electronics, or anything that was the original reason they opened their doors many years ago. They are worried about selling cell phones. 70% of their income was cell phone sales."
bad,"RadioShack was interesting in that it encouraged its employees to understand the products that were sold. Unfortunately it focused on selling some products over others, despite customer needs."
bad,A Typical day at work here for me was not the best experience. I had bad miscommunication. On top of that when i was employed at this location it was robbed twice in the time that i was there.
bad,Working at radio shack I learned about hdmi cables and how to remplace car remote batteries for free. Also recycling batteries was interesting draining them.
bad,2 bankruptcies over the last 3 years... It is going to be tough for anyone involved.  There were a lot of great people and leaders working for this organization that are now scattered throughout other companies.  There is still a little bit left of the company and I wish it well.
bad,It was a good place to start out for retail but fell off real fast as the company was failing but the people and customers I worked with we're more than adequate to work with
bad,"Store closures was basically all I really dealt with at this job, closed 3 stores by myself, along with continuing to work at the only open store until I found a better opportunity."
bad,"The job wasnt very hard to do. My daily tasks were to clean up around the store, take out trash, help customers with any questions they may have, and check out customers. The only problems  had with the job was with the management."
bad,Pay sucked if it was a slow week with little sales you were not paid but 7.25. Management poor. I relocated from one store to another only to relocate back to my original store but had bad experience with new manager
bad,"I was appreciative that someone helped me get one, simply because I needed the job.  I enjoyed what I did helping the customers but management was terrible.  I would close the store by myself.  Stayed after hours off the clock to get things done or I would get a write up.  Had no help nor support."
bad,Very unorganized. Management did know what to do. The pay was not worth the trouble. Received commission but did not enough hours to see a benefit from it.
bad,"This is a fast paced job, depending on the location of your store. The location will determine the amount foot traffic and therefore how busy the store will be."
bad,Radio Shack was a job i was good at so i did it for the amount of time i did. I really wanted to get into management and that was the best way to do it.
bad,"i started as a stock boy doing cleaning of the store. did the stores inventory doing over 80 + box of store product. over weekly bases for every store did two stores for a month. also worked at  several stores as a stock boy doing cleaning and store upkeep. after seven months i moved up to sale associate which helped with up keep of store. worked the register and help customer with phone company (sprint, verizon ,and at&t)after one year. became a key holder which entitled the same work as sale associate but also open and close store and dropped bank deposit off did this key holder position for about 4 store"
bad,"Leadership was very focused on constantly pushing impossible KPI's, even when doing better YoY we were berated. Managers were required to say something negative when entering store."
bad,"One of the biggest problems with RadioShack was the constant turnover of employees either leaving or getting fired. There was a serious lack of leadership throughout the whole company that trickled down to store level management and into the low level positions as well. One of the biggest issues I saw was constant confusion on what the culture of the company was supposed to be and it showed from top to bottom. All that being said, I was lucky enough to have had a manager (prior to my store closing down) that was very pleasant to work for."
bad,Radio shack was a fun experience. I learned alot of new ways to sell products and about the industry. It was a transition job for me though and i didnt get a lot of hours but besides that it was an enjoyable time
bad,"In the beginning RadioShack was a great place to work, then as time went on the company cared more about not losing money for the shareholders rather than caring for the employees and the customers."
bad,I really don't know what to say since the company is no longer in business but it was a good learning experience when I was working there
bad,"Horribly run, hard on its most innovative and successful managers because they did not follow their failing formula of money and cash flow over customers first.  "
bad,"Management was terrible, I liked the environment.  Co-workers were very helpful. Hardest part of the job was management did not like to help."
bad,"Low pay, overly excessive expectations. "
bad,"Arrive 5 minutes earlier than the scheduled shift to prepare to clock in. As you wait the 5 minutes and when your shift starts the manager and coworkers put you up to speed on the daily tasks and goals. The team collectively takes accountability for anything that happens on the job when they're present, which shows their morals. Hardest part of the job is dealing with management and higher entities for whatever situation. But the most enjoyable part is the flexibility of hours and a good team If you're lucky."
bad,The over all experience working for this company was a high skill set in order to keep up with the forever improving aspects of the departments and also the informative customers that we assisted inn their purchases. Other responsibilities for this position consisted of inventory and sales.
bad,"Fast paced environment, had to reach sales goal while giving the best customer service possible. Greeted customers while answering their questions about electronics."
bad,Do not work at RadioShack.  Upper management does not care about anything.  Pay is bad and hours are worse.  Training is lackluster so hard to help customers the way you should.
bad,I was hired with the promise of being a store manager.  Two weeks into training I was informed they were down sizing and got laid off.
bad,We were encouraged to not take a lunch.  We had to man the phones at all times.  No call was allowed to go to voicemail. High level of stress and workload and not compensated fairly.
bad,I only got minimal hours and had to do plan-o-grams all the time.  I got minimum wage and only got a small commission if I sold phones.
bad,"This is a company in trouble. no direction, no leadership and very old school. high turnover. headed for bankruptcy. no training and no idea how to correct the issues."
bad,"poor unstable environment, empty promises. fluctuating pay structures. non reliable supervisors. best part of the company is the team you build"
bad,"Did not like this job but mostly because of the management. She was very unprofessional and did not consider people's outside lives when making the work schedules. Also the pay was only minimum wage, the only incentive was commission for getting people to get contract phones."
bad,"Decent place to work for, but very unethical. Very drama based and nobody works hard. Its hard to stay motivated when everyone around you is either hung over every day or just flat out lazy"
bad,"An hourly plus commission position sounds promising, however, the commission rate is so low that it almost doesn't matter."
bad,"Sounds like a fun job on paper, but when I worked there the only thing that mattered was making cell phone sales.  They wanted us to cell 15 cell phones a week.  It's RadioShack we only had 15 customers period."
bad,It has taught me alot about my skills as a manager. Thats really all I can say about it.
bad,Great job with a lot to learn about different wireless companies. Able to lear how to sell and reach sales goals.
bad,"They want you to constantly push cell phones onto people, all while constantly changing your commission."
bad,"Minimum wage with sales commissions, but nobody shops at radio shack anymore, maybe 10 customers in a day. Very pushy with sales & questions to ask every customer. Forced me to transfer stores then did not compensate for gas mileage."
bad,Job becomes overwhelming and they don't pay enough. I would never work there again. The only thing that I liked about it is the staff I worked with a lot of cool people.
bad,"I worked each day as a sales associate responsible for the sales and service of electronics and new cell phone contracts, cash and charge transactions via Point of Sale computer systems, assisting customers with both common and uncommon electronics' questions and concerns, modifiying store signage to accommodate for weekly sales and special promotions, updating store displays to planogram specifications, implementing weekly and monthly inventory audits and price changes, working alongside 3 well-rounded, business individuals who molded me into the contemporary salesman that I am today, performed daily cash deposits, and maintained store appearance by way of window washing, vacuuming, product replacement, and closing duties associated with proper closing down of the establishment each night."
bad,"Communication within the company could be better, pay could be better. You have the ability to advance to store manager position very easily but nothing beyond that. Lots of goals to meet and things to sell to customers."
bad,I only work there a short period of time. The store manager did not foster a good training  or learning enviroment.
bad,Horrible Pay and what they asked you to do did not compensate at all.
bad,food service is a terrible industry if you need to live. not enough money and too much to deal with
bad,"The stores need a huge overhaul and the focus for sales reps should solely be on contract mobile and accessories.  Dress code change actually went from shirt and tie to jeans and polo shirt, complete wrong direction"
bad,"Although the customers were amazing, and I had plenty of interaction; the management staff was not there to back me up when needed."
bad,"not the best company to work for, not enough compensation. management was not well equipped."
bad,Selling was the priority on any given  day.  Other duties including receiving of new stock on an almost daily basis and prepping that stock for salesfloor.
bad,good part time job for college students. company is too large to offer minimum wages to employees.
bad,I had a lot of work to do with this company. I felt like the first couple of managers I worked under knew what they were doing. However some of them I felt like they pet everything on my and left early for the day. I would count inventory file paper work fix up new plan o grams and new information sheets about the new phones and plans that had come in the day before. I learned how to take inventory and returns on phones. Co workers were nice. The hardest part about the job was the sells. Enjoyable one was working with customers and finding out what there needs are.
bad,"From the beginning, the foreboding omen of losing your job due to lack in sales was present."
bad,This company was more interested in my sales and commission than my future with the company.
bad,need to improve management skills other then that no other comments.
bad,"Conference calls almost daily, store managers definitely feel micro managed from top management. Lots of sales training is involved which is cool. Most of the employees are down to earth people who want to do their best to help their customers. The hardest part of the job is maintaining a top notch staff, there is a lot of turnover due to low compensation rates. The best part of the job is the sales training and sales associates."
bad,Little to no foot traffic in stores. Invest in very comfortable footwear. Holidays is only time you make any decent money. 
bad,Management is very over zealous about sales and hound you about non important quotas. They basically want you to harass customers into buying thing they do not need.
bad,Radio shack gave me an oppertunity to work with employees and staff to find ways to best sell products and to satisfy customer. friendly atmosphere from both staff and sutomers which was very welcoming. hardest thing to do was to learn every product and the easiest thing was to help customers.
bad,"Electronics industry very fast-paced and innovative. RadioShack has become a destination for wireless plans, purchases, education."
bad,"This just wasn't the job for me, so I didn't enjoy working here."
bad,Part-time Sales Associate while working toward a Bachelor of Arts degree in Business at University of Houston. • Consistently ranked as a top sales earner in Houston’s leading sales district • Spoke Spanish every day to aid Spanish-speaking customers
bad,Very exciting place to work. I love learning about new technology. Very good experience. I really enjoyed my co-workers.
bad,"At Galvan Floors I worked as a Receptionist so my duties were to answer and direct phone calls, type in bills and estimate in Quick Books, and organize mail. This job was very laid back and you could work on your pace as long as work orders and purchase orders were taken care of first. I think the hardest part about working at this place was having to deal with my bosses relatives."
bad,"Well I got hired at a very odd time cause we were going through many different DMs which made it felt like the company was unorganized. I was left to work by myself for a couple months...in which was okay in a way cause I made more money but then again when I would be stuck in certain things, it was challenging. But as those couple of months flew by i learned a lot to the point where I could have been a manager myself. Its a face-pace job at times but more of learning experience every each day!"
bad,"Management was not very good, I was a temp there for a year and was never offered a full time spot, they would lay everybody off but me, yet they didnt offer me employment, typical day at work included morning stretches, and finding out what line you would be working on, then its off to work picking product and packing it neatly in a box."
bad,No vacation or time off. No training give all aspects of the job was learning through experience while working
bad,Radio shack wwould be a good company for someone is looking for part time work and to stay in the same position.
bad,"I worked for 5 stores across the Chicago-land area and managed 2 of those stores. If you like technology, like interact with people on a regular basis and are good at selling products then you would do pretty good there (if you can find one)."
bad,I don't see this company lasting very much longer.  More and more stores are closing.  With that being said it isn't the worst place to work but you're not going to make much money.
bad,being a sales representative to customers to buy products and was working for great commissions.
bad,Selling phones keeping up with sales monthly. Competitive wages.
bad,constantly hack at any employee incentives for working. basically paid minimum wage by the time i left the company.
bad,Meeting and exceeding daily sales quotes by engaging customers to create a need. I learned that retail sales is challenging but is very satisfying when you are very successful. The team I worked with was amazing and that was why we were all very successful. Overcoming the no's to make the sale. For me the most enjoyable part of the job was working with some great people and being part of team that was constantly a district leader in sales.
bad,"Run a store with four employees, responsible for managing and ordering inventory, flexing products according to planogram, pricing items and basically staying on top of operations. Operations would include, but are not limited to, daily deposits, daily reports, time and task management, validating wireless contracts, recruiting and taking disciplinary action. Also, help the team with customer service, sales, and store image."
bad,"Sells and customer service in audio, video, cv radio, tv, and cell phones. I specialized in cell phone knowledge and sells and held #1 ranking in over all sells in every district in Texas. The hardest part of the day was rearranging an entire store for new items, The most enjoyable part was getting to play with new tech and informing myself in order to out perform everyone else in sells."
bad,"Working for Radio Shack is a Fun filled working environment. I'm able to help consumers out and learn from them as well. The staff is always extremely helpful to me and we all work well together. The hardest part of this job is not meeting your sales quota. It's easy to attain when you have a sales mentality but sometimes hard when the flow of customers is low. The most enjoyable part of working for this company is that you get to make someones day. Someone can come in for one thing and leave with a bag full of stuff just because you recommended it, and it was actually what they needed."
bad,"To be honest it has been a great place to work and the money was pretty decent for for the work. But in recent months with the down turn in the economy pay plans have been altered in such ways that its very difficult to make the money you once did. "
bad,"This job only bearable in that i could enjoy talking with some customers about cell phones which is something that intrests me. however, it is required to talk to every single customer about wireless which can get really bothersome and intrusive, if all the customer came in for was a fuse and you are asking them about their phone service and taking up more of their time."
bad,"Radio shack is a great first time job to have as a sales associate. A day at work is often slow and not much is needed. Management can be okay depending on the store you work at, but the compensation is horrible. My coworkers are great. We all make a good team and look out for each other even though the sales is oriented towards individual success. The hardest part of the job is getting constantly told that your sales numbers or quota is down or lacking when you excel at every aspect of the job. The bad part is that the products are of really poor quality and often get returned. Radio shack is a bad place to work period"
bad,RadioShack is not hard work unless you don't know a lot about technology. Radioshack doesn't have security so there's a lot of multitasking involved. If your good in sales then it's the right job for you.
bad,I don't enjoy going to the basement to get merchandise. It's quite awful.
bad,business close down company needed to work better toward the employees the pay was not great took a lot of time to not only make money but loose money wasn't satisfied
bad,very fast pace kind of sale work...i learned alot about working with people. I enjoyed meeting new people.
bad,"A learning experience about dealing with customers, and selling products"
bad,"Good place to work, laid back atmosphere and interacting with customers was fun and managers were awesome"
good,This was a nice place to work. I worked with great people and everyday I had things that kept me busy to do that I enjoyed. I had great training and was able to do my job well!
good,I am willing to take a shot at any job for anything. I am waiting for anyone to prove that I am willing to work and that I can make it grow. I am not afraid to do anything to help.
good,"Selling phones and accessories ,helping customers get what they need plus more."
good,"The company is out of business doesn't matter what is said here.  They took advantage of both customers and employees.  Very poor regional management, No management listened to employees' input!"
good,It was a fun place to work but when my store manager would fix the schedule so me and another one of my employees we working up to 52-56 hours a week it got bad. I wish I could have stay but it was better for me to cut my loses
good,"I did enjoy working for this customer for almost 10 years, the pay was on the lower side but the benefits were good when I first started. I was laid off from this company not sure of the direction of this company."
good,"I worked for Radio Shack for two years.You think when you get a job there you will be selling electronics. You don't, you sell Cell phones and deal with no prospects in advancement. It is one of the worst jobs I have ever had. The best part was when customers weren't in the store, but then you had to put up merchandise with plan-o-grams or do these CONSTANT training courses on cell phone information so you could sell cell phones or some other useless electronic gadget. You will also be made fun of, or shamed whatever you want to call it for not selling enough cell phones. Basically its a highly competitive cell phone sales job which you occasionally get to sell electronics."
good,"Service customers, price inventory, stock inventory, order inventory, cash out customers, bank deposits, etc.  Also sell cell phones and activate."
good,"Poor management leads to a negative associate experience, that results in high turnover and poor sales. I likes the environment. I liked electronics."
good,the company was ok to work for if you exceeded your goals and did great in sales they would send loss prevention's to investigate and see why you are doing so good and interrogate to see why you are doing so good
good,"The job was actually very straight forward. i was a cashier and customer service representative, and i took the job as serious as any other. My team and I would always work to reach the monthly quota while providing great service and knowledge of the many electronic devices we carried. unfortunately the company was not doing very well as a fir and eventually filled for bankruptcy forcing many of its employees to be laid off."
good,"As Manager your day consisted of opening store,preparing cash drawers,review prior numbers to know what needs to be met on daily basis, construct a game plan to drive sales, Weekly and Monthly reviews with employees, training for employees, conference calls, and ensuring daily deposit was dropped of at local Bank. I learned alot about management and interviewing techniques. Coworkers were great to work with. Management was very blunt and direct not very helpful more so demanding. The tough part of the job was the amount of hours required to work as a Manager. The Most enjoyable was being able to get hands on with new technologies."
good,"i had a very responsible and fun store manager, but once the company got sold, everything went south we were under staffed constantly, i was part time working full time hours, rules and policies changed from day to day. constantly being told i needed to be on medicial leave for my therapy appointment once a week."
good,"but if you don't it is literally awful. Some of these managers make this failing company their lives, and expect the same from you. It's pretty pathetic actually, but what's worse is that a lot of them actually don't know much about electronics or retail...leaving you with only the internet to turn to in order to learn. You are also not trained thoroughly on the proper function of many parts or products, particularly if your store is under staffed. The CEO has even stated he doesn't know how the company is still in business."
good,While most of the employees you meet are awesome individuals the store in general has over priced items and is generally lacking a lot of high and low end hardware. Especially since they moved their primary focus to phones. Nothing but a sinkhole financially and they are in complete denial about the company dying.
good,"Ran high volume store"
good,The whole place is a joke. With promotions its who brown noses gets it. Not to mention the unprofessional-ism of some of the District/Region/Store managers! Doesn't pay nearly enough for bills! ONLY USE THIS JOB AS A SOURCE OF INCOME UNTIL YOU CAN FIND BETTER!
good,This was my initial base for sales. This is where you engage at a personal level and sale. Radio Shack has some good values but its up to the employee. I worked with some pretty hard to deal with people and no action as a Manager or Assistan Manager could be enforced.
good,A typical day at the Radioshack was to go in 15 min early and to look at the goals of the day basically beat the previews years numbers. I didnt learn much from Radioshack just the basic from the assistant managers classes . My co-workers where teen kids that where always on there phones and never payed attention . The only hard part of the job was dealing with the teens to listen to the manager or the assistant manager. The most enjoyable part of the job was to meet new people and help the costumers out the best i can.
good,work truck back stock merchandise help customers when need
good,my manager gets micro managed by corporate and set expectations to ridiculous and unrealistic heights and punishes employees for not reaching them. I get paid minimum wage with 2% commission I cant afford to live off that and this is why I'm perusing a job that works with my skill I have obtained from the Marines.
good,i didnt really enjoy dealing with other cocky salesmen......but i did enjoy working with the wide range of people that came into the store on a daily basis
good,"I loved the people I worked with, and the work ethic and drive of my immediate managers, as all of them were committed to working with us closely and getting things done. The managers were all very understanding of circumstances, such as if someone was experiencing personal issues, and they weren't distant and unapproachable. Beyond them, however, the company was a mess. Plans that don't make sense, and a very isolationist atmosphere between departments."
good,"The typical day at radioshack was to consistently sell cell phones, acceriores, and service plans. My only objection to this was I felt the customers needs were not the primary focus at the time I was employed instead making a quick buck and showing increases on cell phones and add on items were more important."
good,"It was ok, not a very rewarding business anymore, most of the product in irrelevant and only focus on phones and plans that can be better in other locations"
good,Working here i got to get people hooked up with all the latest electronics. And help them fix whatever gadget the customer may be working on. I was very sad to see the company go out of business again.
good,Radio Shack was a very fast moving company to work for at first. You have to move with the times and technology or you wouldn't succeed. I learned a lot with this company due to the fact that everyday I was talking and selling and trying to maintain a quality experience for every customer that I serviced. Through this I learned a lot about people and My customer service and speaking abilities increased exponentially. The management was brutal because you had numbers you had to hit and you were constantly threatened to do better or else you could lose your job. A typical day of work would be me interacting with customers and upgrading and selling phones and dealing with billing options through numerous phone companies. The best part of the job was the interaction with the customers and the fact that a lot of these customers would return and ask for you to be the one to service them due to their experience prior.
good,as a manager you get salary your suppose to work 40 hours a week instead you have more of a 50+ hour work week and never a day off because people call off.
good,Good place to gain customer service skills and experience. Easy going but you will be required to be a sales person. Competitive with sales quota per employee.
good,"overall the bosses for radioshack weren't professional, there was a miss communications from all department... they were invest lots of money even if they know that its not profitable"
good,"I worked for a dealer franchise. Owner thought they were god. always shoving political and personal beliefs down the throats of employees and customers. Pay Check was withheld more than once for various reasons. Felt very invalidated as a person. Made to feel worthless and less than human. Was faithful to the company for almost 7 years but was fired 72 days after my daughter passed away and 5 days before Christmas. RadioShack as a company was very good to work for. I was always top store in my district however the owners of my store were very difficult to get along with and very disrespectful towards employees and customers."
good,its a standard minimum wage sales job. Mostly you just try to sell everyone sell phones. Business is often slow so there is a lot of down time and mostly it just you and one other person.
good,"Radio Shack is poised to close very soon, if not all, most of its retail stores. In light of this, there is not much to say except this is getting to be the norm for many retail specialty chains, I would not recommend working there solely because there are no job available. Everyone who is currently working there will soon be unemployed."
good,"Worked for legacy RadioShack Co. and after the transition to General Wireless DBA RadioShack, and both - like any company - had their ups and downs.  I enjoyed working with the people in my community most, helping customers become friends, solving their technology problems and providing solutions."
good,helped set up customers with cell phone products as well as other electronics. the job security was not there as the company is no longer in business.
good,"In the neighborhood the store was located, It was a slow day everyday. Most of the regulars didn't really purchase what was needed to for the day's quota."
good,"A typical day at work was sometimes slow and boring,working for the company i learned how to sell products in bundles and how to become a quick thinker when it came to selling, i had some cool co-works i enjoyed working with them all..including management.the hardest part was dealing with ruled customer that came in from the hood with bad attitudes..."
good,The most unorganized company I have ever worked for with nobody to turn to when you have questions for anybody above district level
good,"Great learning experience, different management styles, interesting co-workers. Learned to become flexible and able to test new and fun products."
good,"Depending on the day of the week the store would be flooded with customers at certain times of the day.Energy was necessary to either keep up with work or stay focused for the next rush of customers. Management depended on the location of the store and the personality of the person, not really guidelines and procedure. The hardest part of the job was keeping up with ever-changing concepts, merchandise and systems. The easiest part was handling most customers."
good,Ive worked for the  company for over two years. During this time I felt overworked and underpaid along with no opportunities to advance to better compensating positions.
good,"RadioShack gave me my first experience at working retail. Just from that I will always be a fan of the company. Unfortunately, due to way to many changes way to late in the game they are destine to fail."
good,Job would have been good but management kept you from a positive environment.
good,"you learn a lot about electronics, but management isn't the greatest and the pay sucks."
good,My job was very fast paced and demanding. The rewards for doing a good job were few.
good,"Handle daily reports, review individuals metics, ensure staffing is correct. I have learned alot about how to make the customer happy. CUstomer satisfaction were the most important and funnest part of the job."
good,A typical day at work would be to clock in the count the drawer and open the store and give great customer service to the customers.
good,Radio shack is good place to work for school kids. Flexible schedule. No advancement.
good,"Upper management had no idea what was happening at the stores."
good,"My typical day would be to either open up the store or close the store. I was given reponsibiltiy of the keys to the store rather quickly ( less then 2months) and I took my responsibility very seriously. "
good,Helped customers
good,"Well, i work by myself all day, and am frequently being left out of the loop with things going on in the store. My boss does not like her job and is looking for a better place. Its hard to keep up to date on things when nothing is being told to me. The pay is baised on comission and the store where i am is Canadian based mostly so the pay is not that good."
good,"Pay is horrible, you have to work weekends holidays and week days. Managers like to smoke in the building and bribe you not to tell!"
good,Standing all day greeting everyone who comes in and push cellphones sales to every customer.
good,"Poor Management Skills and poor benfits for employees, poor work place. Unorganzied work ethics."
good,"Openned up and turned off alarms, counted cash drawers, and checked any emails from corporate."
good,Working 30+ hours a week and recieving a low income pay check every two weeks is not worth the hassle of the job.
good,New manager at the time was horrible after my manager was transferred.
good,A good place for a salesman to make money in commisions.
good,• Prepared and assisted in managing store floor
good,It is fun to work here sometimes due to the electronics. The hirer up of the company are not really that good. I have been told since November that i was moving up in the company and as of 03/2012 i still have not and every time i ask they keep saying wait another week.
good,My time working here was great at first. When I say at first everything was amazing. I was learning more that I didn't realize I could learn more about stuff I didn't know existed. But everything started to go downhill at a rapid pace.
good,The work environment and employers were awesome just the boss and pay wasn’t the greatest. It got me by but barely I would recommend this job but to someone who has another source of income
good,Radioshack is out of business. There is no point in writing this review. It is ridiculous that I am asked to rate a company that is no longer relevant in order to find a new job.
good,Radio Shack is a dead end job.  The management does not know how to run a modern business as evidenced by several bankruptcy filings.  This is nothing more than a part time fun money job.
good,Radioshack went out of business. The first store i worked at was wonderful but then was forced to relocate because of the reconstruction. It quickly went downhill.
good,"A typical work day includes:"
good,Radio shack can be great people to work for. But no one in the home offices knows whats going on and can't seem to get sales dates correct. Or they will do a major store increase and then put everything on sale. Most of our past Christmas toys came back due to not working properly. Or the parts just wouldn't stay on. My boss by far was the best to work for. But the big guys didn't have a clue what needed to be done. We were forced to promote our own store or create displays from money out of our own pockets. Greatest part was meeting some interesting people and learning something new every day. Downside was dealing with higher ups who didn't have a clue or any common sense and literally standing around for most of the day.
good,RadioShack is a part time job. Stongly recommend for first timers in the workforce. Job is easy going with a competitive field. Job could be easy with the right attitude and personality
good,This job i advanced fast but my pay never changed for some reason. i was an assistant manager still making 8.00 an hour and it really changed my view on the company.
good,"A shame to watch a great company fall apart, having products that have been a staple for over 90 years removed and replaced with things like Fitness monitors, bad idea."
good,"made schedules for all employees, kept up with all sales goals (daily, weekly, monthly) maintained a visually appealing store, daily activities included checking in deliveries and putting out new inventory"
good,Stores are run poorly. Shipments to the store are never items that are needed on the floor. Store is shared with Sprint. The Sprint employees leave work regulary while on the clock
good,radio shack was a enjoyable place to work as both sales clerk and manager but corp guide lines where not up to present standardsand where behind the times in the electrinc field
good,"The company structure overall, I felt was failing. The majority of customers to come in were looking for specific parts or cords that radioshack, in the past, has been know to offer. Unfortunately, the sales team was instructed to focus most of our efforts on cell phone sales and upgrades. Even if the customer came to the store to find a small watch battery, we were made to try to offer them cellular services."
good,They would push you to sell and they would push the more you sell the more you worked. they would talk down to you. But if you like sells then I say go for it.
good,A typical day at RadioShack included replacing tags and waiting for costumers to come inside the store.  Occasionally we did planograms and cleaning. I often provided task for myself to keep busy. I learned a lot about inventory and store opening and closing procedures.  Management was not to helpful this was kind of do it yourself-like store. Co-workers were friendly and welcoming but not as ambitious about the job as should of been. Hardest part of the job was wanting to work and management had nothing for you to do. The most enjoyable part of the job were the costumers.
good,"Happy during holiday season when they offered many opportunities to work over time.  Other than that their policies of paying their employees were unrealistic, whish is why the company is now going under."
good,as a retail manager for radio-shack you are expected to over work and you really do not have time for a life outside of work. the management team is very focused on sales and beating numbers which makes for a very active sales environment. its okay as a company to work for but i wouldn't stay to long
good,Not much room to advance. schedule was not flexible with my schooling.
good,"Specific regional manager was horrible and didn't listen to anyone. Literally had the view of ""if you don't comply we can hire someone within minutes"" type of attitude."
good,"Management is poor, compensation is horrible, it is a specialized skill to sell the wireless phones but 7.25/hr is not enough."
good,"They expect you to work a ton, but refuse to promote those who actually have the skills."
good,Great to meet new people. Management was not great but understood my school schedule. Co-workers were great and friendly.
good,"I will start off by saying the most enjoyable part about work is helping people with their technology needs and making their day in the end no matter how long it takes. I do enjoy two of my co-workers because they are very relaxed and most sane out of the group. Management is not good in my opinion. Managers need to be top tier before they try to lead or delegate any aspect of a workplace and i don't feel any of the many managers meet that standard. There is not necessarily anything hard about the job, but when managers are lazy it can cause being on the floor to not go as smooth as it should."
good,"Unstable - Little Job Security, upward trending - good out of college starting job."
good,"During my tenure with RadioShack, my daily responsibilities involve utilizing operational checklists, setting daily goals and expectations for every team member, ensuring all operational aspects of the business is met and email communications are taken care of in a timely manner."
good,"RadioShack was my first job during college, and a decent place to learn the skills of selling."
good,Good place to work at first. New management changed the culture. No real regard for home life. Old management was good not sure of it now.
good,Selling phones are a huge part of the job so creating a friendly environment is a must. If you aren't a sociable person this is not the job for you. Biggest drawback would be worklife balance as well as no room for advancement after you become a store manager.
good,"the job itself isn't bad. Much like most companies, upper management treats everyone lower as pawns and uses fear tactics to  produce results. Many good people are lost to other companies because of corporate lack of compassion. Turnaround rate is ridiculous. Managers are expected to do far too much and are forced to either work 50+ hour weeks to get all the unnecessary busy work done, or push it onto the salespeople, which in turn would lower sales productivity which would in turn get a DM on you about not reaching unattainable numbers. Inside an average store though people are friendly, helpful, knowledgeable, and overall good people just trying to support themselves and their families. "
good,"If you are looking for a place to work that takes all of your time RadioShack is that place. I worked for the company two different times and it was all the same. You did meaningless tasks everyday, the management was always hounding you and the training was not where it needed to be."
good,I would wait on customers and attempt to find the items they were looking for which was sometimes a struggle because there was no training on what all was available in the store.
good,Working at RadioShack should be better.
good,Do daily task and work and sales preparation for the day/week.
good,"At first I wondered how I ever got hired to work here, I still do. Let me tell you, the commission is no longer 2.75/h for maintaining your 75$ per hour sales minimum. When the new DM came in, I knew things would change. The last couple of months have been nothing but stress. I have now been told I have 2 weeks to improve or I get the boot. For a district that isn't performing, and has short-staffed stores, do what you gotta do. I would rather have the DM tell me like it is instead of putting it through the person in charge--who's not even a manager yet! After being done here, I doubt I'd ever step foot in there again. However, I've learned valuable experience from the retail business."
good,If u dont reach the goals for the day its risk taking sales jobs are risku
good,great for learning a lot of new stuff in the technology market. tough customer service. good benefits
good,"A typical day at work consist of changing price tages, rearranging merchandise for no logical reasons. Assisting customers periodicly throughout the day and consitant metric monitoring. Some positives are an opportunity to make decent commisions based on customer interest and opportunities to learn about new technologies coming to the market."
good,"Over the past 6 years, RadioShack lost their way as company leadership focused on squeezing profits instead of growing their business. What made them successful over the years was the people in the stores that took care of customers and recent mgmt treated them as commodities."
good,"I'm pretty sure Radioshack isn't hiring anymore in the States. "
good,"This company was just a good starter job, best for the part time going to school type of person. The best part was getting discounts on the products they sold. Too bad this store does not exist anymore."
good,I worked for RadioShack $ in a half years & they filed chp 11 and none on there employees including myself did not receive anything and I'm a single mother of 6
good,"Working at Radio Shack was a learning experience.  Unfortunately the business was going down hill and being pushed out of the market, due to other larger chains opening that provided better options and prices."
good,Commissioned based job at minimum wage. Sell electronics and sell services to thankless customers. The company doesn't really exist anymore closing more than 90% of their retail stores nationwide laying off thousands of employees.
good,"Radio Shack was a great place to get to know the retail industry. The pay was average unless you were in a high volume store. Many promises made, almost none kept."
good,"Shortly after being hired at RadioShack, age 19, my manager got away with over $1,000 in a deposit. Leaving myself and another 20 year old to run the store. After attempting to maintain it for about a year, I moved to a store closer to home (Maine). Within months I was receiving mail asking me if I was interested in buying the bankrupt company."
good,"The job was great and has some perks, but management and pay aren't the best. If the store wasn't closing I would love to stay working here. Other than those few cons, everything else is great!"
good,I enjoyed working at RadioShack however after some time and watching the structure of the company collapse i can say that its not a job id recommend to anyone hoping to earn more or move up the career ladder.
good,"very stressful at times, need to build higher morale amongst the various departments, long hours at times and perform numerous jobs when others have left"
good,The job was enjoyable but management set too high of standards for a slower store like what I worked at. We also had another store 5 miles down the road so our typical sales would be around $700 for the entire day. Lots of boring downtime but was able to get our store responsibilities done.
good,I had just recently moved to Las Vegas and was tring to find a job. Radio Shack gave me a opportunity to grow and establish myself here in Nevada. Thank you for all your support.
good,"The company lacked energy to beat the competition. "
good,Working at radio shack has sits ups and downs. Theres a lot of re-orginizing and price auditing. The co workers and very fun to work with and we all get our jobs done right.
good,The new company hopefully will change the company for the better. There is a great employee discount and good benefits.
good,"Responsibilities include:  Bank Deposits, Restocking, and paperwork, tagging, and illustrating great customer service, interviewing."
good,"It was nice working with technology and electronics."
good,"day : open up vacuum, clean windows, front merchandise, then assist customers, after every customer, the managers would sneak up on you and say ""why did u fail to sell batteries"" even though u give every customer the song and dance."
good,I didn't really enjoy the experience. The only thing that kept me balanced throughout the day was having a hardworking team. The pay was very low for the work that was required.
good,This company has filed for bankruptcy because of bad management and how the money was not handled by the right people. they didn't have the best interest for their employees.
good,A day at radio shack would be entertaining cause of all the electronics around you. You'd learn about how everything works and what everything was used for and why. At the time management wasn't the best. My co-workers were helpful at times but not as much. The hardest part of the job was making a sale with little training. Best part of the job to me was the customer service.
good,The job was okay. I learned allot about electronics. The management were understanding of my education. Over all experience was good!
good,"I had fun working at RadioShack while it lasted. It was a great learning experience and it will give you the necessary skills to sell. I think the location and the people always determine the level of experience you have. Basically, it's who you work with that can make your experience great or terrible."
good,I only worked with Radioshack for a year but their atmosphere sucked really bad. I did not enjoy working there< My managers were absolute jerks most of the time. The pay sucked and the hours were horrible.
good,"Go in and prepare the store for the day."
good,There's no job security and the pay is not great. Overall this job is for a college student.
good,The best part of working here was gaining the sales experience and management experience to work anywhere.  The people I worked with were some of the greatest people I have ever met and created some really great relationships with them.  However upper management was always changing their goals and direction and it was very frustrating at times to deal with these always changing issues.
good,My position was questioned whether I was the Lost Prevention mgr's assistant or just a clerk.
good,"This job had no guarantee pay it, it consisted of backstabbing among "
good,"It had a huge range of good from bad, i wouldnt reccommend working here unless youre completely out of options. The pay was not that great for all they have you do. The benefits were not the greatest as well either."
good,"before they started closing stores, this was a great place to work and a place I would recommend for employment often. After the stores started being closed, the job quickly became an exercise in insecurity."
good,"typical work day includes counting drawer, opening store,waiting on customers to come in.The direct store manager is an ok guy but the hire ups above him push for unrealistic numbers and generally make your day miserable.The idea that you can make people buy warranties or cell phones when they walk in the door is absurd. I like my co-workers they make the work day bearable."
good,you can make a lot of money if you are great at selling and talking to people. Minimum wage but great pay when it comes to selling phones.
good,"A great company to learn about customer service and sales. A typical day as a sales associate involves greeting all customers, giving valuable information to help customers, and finalizing sales using the POS."
good,"A typical day at work consisted of organizing merchandise, handling customers, and maintaining an orderly appearance on the inside and outside of the store. I learned how to handle money while operating a cash register, tactfully handle disgruntled customers, and perform security checks during heavy traffic. Management was poor, rude, and tactless when handling customers. My co-workers were positive and driven individuals. The hardest part of the job was dealing with management. The most enjoyable part of the job was working without micromanagement."
good,"Was responsible for driving sales, especially cell phone sales. Realized Radio Shack was in a decline and decided to explore other opportunities."
good,this was a part time while i was still in school so i really have no negative things to say about it.
good,The management sucks all the way around the stores are never clean and they hire anybody who needs a job.
good,I learned a lot at Radioshack a typical morning begins with me opening or coming in to relieve someone. The job was stressful sometimes because they hound you to sell cell phones. Sometimes I was the only one running the store for hours before help arrived. Management was not the greatest and the pay sucked for the long hours and the amount of work that they want you to do.
good,A typical day at work would be problem solving.Most of the customers we helped out at times would be rude. In the 3 years I was there I had been robbed 4 times. So security was not so great.I like helping people but not rude people. I loved the co-workers I worked with that was my 2nd family. The most enjoyable part of my job was helping someone even if it took me hours.
good,Radioshack I thought would be a great place to work. But when you don't make metrics that are out of sight. They close the stores down. Not good for the employees who worked there.
good,I learned a lot with some technology and different ways to work out a situation. I would like for the pay to be better. The most enjoyable part of my job is working with people.
good,"good job, good for student workers, teaching you basics of selling and motivation, management is what you make of it"
good,Work average of 50-65 hours per week with very little respect from higher management. Never payed meal premiums when worked over 5 hours on a work shift.
good,"A typical day would be me opening the store, reviewing the previous days sales, receipts, refunds and operation standards. Setting store sales goals, employee sales goals, couching and training, making work schedules. Reviewing P&L documents. Planning and executing plans for sales gain. Product redistribution and management. Employee advancement and training. Managing customer relationships with the company and creating life long customers."
good,The company cares more about profits and trying to be better than best buy than anything
good,Enjoyed learning how to sell electronic/technical products....learned how to trouble shoot moblie device...the hardest part was commission sales...enjoyed meeting new people and helping them...management very unorganized and rarely at establishment
good,"My typical day at Radio Shack was to greet customers as well help the customers and made sure they leave satisfied. Restock merchandise. What I learned working at Radio Shack are customer skills and I also obtained knowledge of the products. My manager was a bit lazy but was there whenever I needed help or had a question. As far my co-workers there was some who their job, there were some that was lazy. The hardest part of the job was meeting the daily quotas. The most enjoyable part of the job was seeing a smile on the customers face."
good,Enjoy everyone I work with and have made alot of friends and mentors in the process. The hardest part of the job would be the amount of hours that they require and expect out of the managers.
good,"I worked for radioshack for 3 years. You get great pay and the benefits are not to shabby but I don't agree with how they protect the hire ranked employees. You expect if your a manager for your workers to listen to you and what you say goes. But not in this company. If your a manager and you had the right to fire and employee they can go to your boss (the DM) and be back at work the next day no matter what the case was. I loved my job but I hated the company because they dont support their employees or help them succeed in anyway. I would advise you to really think about working for them before you do. Because every person who worked there after I got on, ended up quitting or leaving because of how the company was ran."
good,Great company to work for.You will have to do more research on the company to understand more benefits in details.
good,"Typical day at work was usually slow maybe 30 customers max, and that would be a very busy day to get that. This job has virtually no real training must come in with what you know, but its easy to get by on very little knowledge. Management was really laid back, to the point they would just ""go to lunch"" for a few hours and leave the store .The hardest part of the job is literally putting up freight and that isnt hard at all. The most enjoyable part of the day however is, due to lack of business, we could just sit around and watch tv, use the internet, or just sit around and talk/smoke all day."
good,Company was way too many rules to follow and exceptions to all of them
good,great job to start out at when you're 18. good experience for sales and looks good on resume
good,I opened and closed store daily. I was involved with everything from cash registry to shipping.
good,"Can be a great place to work with interesting products and new gadgets everyday. However, the pay is not commensurate with the amount of work they expect. Also, if you've never worked in a commission sales environment, prepare to see some sharks."
good,"competitive working environment. we very busy everyday dealing with all sorts of customers. i love my co workers, very fun easy to get along with. they work really hard. Management, could be better."
good,"After 3 to 5 days of training an employee, I enjoyed being asked questions about the different competitions and how as a team the store could out sell the other stores in our district."
good,"radioshack is was a great learning experience i learned a lot from the company and met a lot of great people, but, there appreciation for employees is very low and there. your potential for making real money is moderate depending how much cellphones or attachment u sell other wise i enjoyed my 3 1/2 yrs there"
good,Not a good place to work you work 6 days a week for very little pay and managment doesn't recognize your work.
good,Laid back place with lots of friendly faces. Learned a lot about consumer electronics. Some customers can be a handful but overall a good place to work.
good,A typical work day is being a cashier and constant floor presence. I learned about cellphone plans and how to be a cashier. I enjoyed my co-workers. Hardest part of the job was angry customers due to terrible coordination. My most enjoyable part of the day was helping a customer in need.
good,There's no break room for lunch. There's really not any room for advancement within the company and most positions are part time with no benefits. There's a daily training program to let you know about new products out but there's a lack of training on how to actually use some of the mobile provider's.
good,At my specific store it wasn't the best because of management. They must've known that RadioShack was going under so they would kind of take it out on us.
good,"10 Hour work day, relatively slow."
good,"the store i got to manage was in a remote location with very few customers, its no wonder they went out of business. the store had a bad locationa and didnt carry much either way."
good,"upper management didn't care about store level employees, all they cared about was there bonus and what filled their pockets, we busted our butt, and not one person cared"
good,"Average work schedule and workflow Mon.-Saturday"
good,The job itself was pretty rewarding because it taught you a lot about technology and you were able to help customers with their technical needs. The management was very poor.
good,"I enjoyed working here for most of the time, but upper management was shifted around, and I could tell that they were just in it for the money. They also did not communicate well with lower management, resulting in a riff between tiers of the company."
good,"I really enjoyed learning about new technology. That is probably the best thing I can say. They constantly changed commission rates, new manager every few months and huge turnover. Only place I have ever worked where people wouldn't call out or show up and nothing happened."
good,I would not recommend this company. It is not a good place to work. They do not treat employees fairly. They have a huge disconnect between upper management and store level.
good,not enough hours Radioshack went bankrupt and left hundreds without a job did not help us find new jobs after telling us company was going out of business
good,"This company, although had great advancement opportunities, closed down in Hawaii, and also gave me a great deal of trouble receiving my wages due. I am still fighting this company for owed wages."
good,I came in this company at the point and time where the company was being bought out . SO a lot of things weren't in order as they should have been. But it was the start of my experience in sales and I learned a lot from working. As well as getting experience in selling all pone carriers.
good,Good place to work could move up in the company. Make good money. Long hours and inventory where to long and not scheduled with enough employees. Discount where great.
good,"The company lost focus on who its customer was and how to continue bringing in new customers. Unfortunately, Radioshacks customer base was filled with curiosity and the first to adapt to online purchases. It is a shame that Radioshack did not think to go where it was helping its customers get."
good,one can go far with this company. maybe not now that they are defunct. not the worse job nor was it the best. always nice to be able to help people and get their problems solved
good,when i worked there it was a fun job but it was very low paying. I made 6.50/hr. No health insurance but you got discounted plans on cell phones. I had at least 7 store managers in 2 years at 2 stores.
good,The company is great but is managed roughly. You get asked a lot to com in on days off for no reason asked sometimes to move vacations and can be moved to new stores with very little notice. The people that work here are great and eady to work with if management treated the people better it would be a 5 star place.
good,"worked with multiple phone companies, sprint, AT&T,  and T-Mobile to set up new phone contracts and activate services of costumers. I was responsible for assisting costumers in trouble-shooting issues with cell phones and various other electronic devices."
good,It drew me and my wife apart with the ridiculous hours and low pay. I worked 40-60 hours most of the time and didn't get paid full over-time. How they got away with that is beyond me. The company went bankrupt and got rid of thousands of great employees without question. I don't recommend this company to anyone. Keep looking.
good,"Te dan una muy corta e inadecuada capacitación al inicio"
good,"The variety of product offered by the company keeps the employess tuned in and provides the employees with ample opportunity generate extra revenue. Radio Shack is all about selling, because the hourly rate of pay is not so high. Although, it did provide a solid foundation for me when it comes to retail and telecommunications."
good,I feel the company failed in staying in business because they would change there's way and there ideas weekly. they will not stick to one uniform or one project at a time. they were more focus on selling phones to every customer that walked in the door then what the customer came into the store for.
good,Very easy to lose your job if you cannot keep up with the high demands and pressure from management and higher.
good,"Great co-workers, alright management.  Well its out of business now so I guess that can be an indication of how the company was run."
good,The company was in financial distress at the time of my employment and has since filed bankruptcy. Due to the impending failure of the company the work environment was less than pleasant.
good,"The culture of RadioShack was tired and desperate.  Half of it was the old storefronts, dated decor and hardware, failure to stay relevant enough, etc. paired with their efforts which seemed unsure and hesitant, relying heavily on employees being expected to perform tasks and reset labor that was not part of their original job descriptions.  I learned a whole lot for sure, mainly because I was thrown into a management role while making an employee wage.  I wasn't taught much and to be completely honest the commission structure was very undesirable.  The carrier stores made three to four times what a RadioShack employee would make selling the same phone on the same plan.  I would not recommend working there."
good,"the work environment was good, got along with all the other co-workers and the manager. the pay could have been better for the work that they wanted us to do."
good,"Radio Shack is going the way of the Dinosaur and no-one has told them.  Most of their products are available online and at other retail chains for a faction of the cost.  Being paid minimum wadge with the opportunity for commission in a low volume store that never makes profits does not equate to a livable wadge or opportunities for advancement.  The crew making burgers at McDonald's get's paid better, have better benefits.  I would not recommend anyone work in a Radio Shack retail store that is not in a high volume area otherwise they will spend their entire life at work and not earn enough to pay their rent"
good,Working there was an hassle. The boss was always overlooking you and budding in on your business. I know he's suppose to but all the time?
good,When I was managing the store the district manger would not let me fire the people that worked there do to them not showing up when scheduled. Also the job did not allow me to have much of a outside life i would some times have to work a 80 hour week to keep the store running and on tracked
good,"Employees always unsure of tomorrow...."
good,"It was a great company to work for until they started closing doors, I stayed until the final moment but received no compensation because they declared bankruptcy"
good,"The job was very unorganized, there was a large lack of communication. There was no security cameras or measures in case of any sort of emergency. I was robbed at gun point there and not much was done about it. I learned a good deal about gadgets and cellphones at this job. The management was very unprofessional almost to annoying point. My coworkers for the most part were hospitable and helpful. What I enjoyed most about the job was the down time between waves of customers."
good,"It was a great place unfortunately they went out of business. "
good,"Work day are not to stressful. The work culture is mostly laid back, its a joy for me. the hardest part about the job. I would say is learning all of the product and all what radio shack carries not all radio shacks carry the same product."
good,it was a decent place to work except for the amount of hours a manager had to work in a week.  pay was great before the cell phone carriers decided to change their pay scale.
good,I really didnt like the job due to the manager and how the manager ran the store. Either the manager was always later or never came into work.  I went to work because i needed to make some money
good,"The company was a great place to learn management skills, keep up with new technology, and interact with a diverse clientele.  However, over the last several years, as corporate management struggled to keep the company profitable, the work environment suffered."
good,Working in Radio Shack gives you  chance to learn a lot about different products and how  to sell it and demonstrate. Gives you an opportunity to learn how to deal with customer with problems. I feel that the company needs to hire better managers and people that wants to work. And likes to interact with others.
good,"I enjoy the conversations with customers. Makes my day a whole lot easier and better. "
good,RadioShack was relevant until 2003.  Management brought in from outside destroyed the company.  There is a need for expertise in using and connecting todays technology
good,the job was good in the beginning but the way how the employees changed more than people change their underwear and I couldn't stand for that the only way could you possibly make a decent paycheck was to be a manager or above the management was all over the place and in and out because the turn rate for the job was crazy I remember having 4 managers in 1 year and I didn't learn anything in that time but to run the store the right way myself the only good thing about that job was the team I worked with which made the work day a little more easier I will say that's about it
good,This job was a lot of one o one with the customers.I learned a lot about the tech side of how everyday objects work . The management at Radio shack was really motivating. we had our goals every week and we were pushed to make them.
good,"Every day at work were different because each customer arrived with a different need. Even each client, we could learn about their own expeciancias. All coworkers, had a different quality. You can learn different positions, and exercise. One of the hardest parts of the job was working with disgruntled customers and always came with a negative ideal, but our job was to give that 100 percent with each of them for better customer service, and the customer can leave happy and return in the future."
good,"In 2010, the company took a turn for the worse, when we put all our ""eggs"" in the wireless phone business. Low margin for the amount of man hours invested."
good,"RadioShack is uncertain of what its culture is, where it wants to go, and it has cut large parts of its skilled staff in a desperate attempt to cut costs, rather than redefining itself to one culture and one direction.  Disorganized and losing relevance, a very sore loss for what could have been."
good,My manager was good.  I learned a lot and was able to network and meet a lot of nice customer. the hardest part  about the job was the inventories and changing of numerous price tags.
good,"A lot of work with minimum pay. Not a bad job, but very stressful"
good,"I started as an associate then after a little over a year I became manager. Had good hours of 50 plus a week I dealt with stock, banking, product supply and keeping our store up to code."
good,"Is Going in and having a enjoyable job that is productive and satisfying that you did what is the best interest to the company and to myself.  "
good,Its a fun and challenging job for a college student but nothing to make a career out of. They will make you push phone sales and all you get is a flimsy 2% commission. That's 2 dollars for every 100 dollars you sell in the store which is terrible. Planograms that are always changing and never ending as well as bad management. The only pros are you can have an employee rate plan on your cellphone bill and upgrade every year. (expect to pay $45-60)  They are also good about vacation and requesting time off.
good,"A typical day for me I play the role of functional and operational manager. I range anywhere from training and coaching associates, ordering product, product setup and displaying, product pricing, interviewing new associates, inventory control, filing contracts and reports, setting up sales goals for the day, keeping the location looking presentable, product demoing, customer problem solving, maintain the sales floor and back stock area, keeping track of high valued items, and conducting customer service sales"
good,"Terrible job, terrible pay. Long days, terrible management."
good,The most enjoyable part of working at RadioShack was the customers. Overall that's what made it great. There's really no such thing as a job advancement. They don't hire within the company if a management position opens. It's like a 1 to a million chance.
good,"sales and other part at store as well"
good,"Don't come into this place as a new employee thinking it'll be a career.  Not anymore.  The company values have changed and anyone is replaceable.  Employees are not paid what they deserve based on what's expected out of them.  By the time you get used to a new pay plan, after they convince you it's fantastic, they change it again."
good,"It is my job to meet the needs of the customer, by listening, and  understanding the why they came into the store."
good,"As a wireless consultant, my main responsibility was to engage with customers and sell our products. This was a very enjoyable, laid-back job."
good,A good part time while in school. poorly managed as a whole. No real way of moving up the ladder
good,"Assist customer with making an informed decision regarding buying high and low tech electronics."
good,i feel like i cant have a life outside of work i work for nothing and pay isnt what is worth going thur what i have done. I also hate they closed a store i worked at a no sign of what they are doing with anyone here when the stores closes
good,"Radioshack is a great company to earn some commission and get your foot in the wireless industry. They push you to cell phones, but expect you to know everything else. Pay is decent, and do not expect to make this a career for yourself, because managers do not get paid well. The store I worked for was fun, the team was well put together, we all got our jobs done. It was fun because it was in the mall. Everything was well, until someone robbed our store for 10 phones, and no one seen it happen. it was our busiest weekend of the year, and we all were busy. A few days later I found out we had no phones, because a customer was trying to commit fraud. Later my manager realized that we got robbed, and we all started to think how it happened. none of us were suspicious of any wrong doing, which made it worst, because radioshack had to blame someone. "
good,"Poorly ran company, upper management showed constant abuses of power and came to the stores with very poor attitudes."
good,"Great place for young people, not ideal for people with families. The pay is low and work is a lot. Management is unprofessional."
good,"readio shack really has poor vales and managment you sold phones and helped customers "
good,"advancement was available but training was next to nothing, salary was below average compared all retailers"
good,"I would open the store in the morning, file the paperwork away from yesterday while I assist any customers we may have. Occasionally I would have a customer interested in cell phones, so I would explain their option between companies and find them a full wireless solution. As the assistant manager I assisted with stock transfers, insurance claims, role playing with staff and making sure everyone (including myself) kept up with the weekly trainings. I loved my job just disappointed with some of the higher management. my district manager was sleeping with my managers wife. I never seemed to get paid on time. they either paid me for one week of a bi-weekly pay check or they wouldn't even send it some weeks. it was just ridiculous. don't get me wrong there were great people there too. I enjoyed my time with my radio shack team, but man..... that company there has some issues."
good,"Radioshack Kiosk is overall a very unstable company to work for. All in all they dont really have their business in order leaving all of their employees to just ""figure it out"". They do not adequately train their associates or managers. There are a few perks to the position like monthly and yearly bonuses, but those are only for managers."
good,Great people to work around . Always helping customers choose the right device for them or there family .The hardest part of the job was the upper managment tell there employee that the job means more then your family or children.
good,"I actually enjoyed working for Radio Shack. I had the highest RSSP rate in my store, and I ALWAYS made my quota. All of my fellow employees asked me questions and for help every day. Unfortunately my store was not making what we should of been making and we all had to sign a paper saying that we had to have numbers up by a certain date which I was not worried about since I had great numbers. I'm a mother and one job sometimes just isn't enough. That being said, I took on a second job that was ONLY on the weekends and even requested the weekends off ONLY but my manager who had his job on the line as well (and was fired not long after) CUT my hours from 30 hours a week to 8, making it impossible for me to maintain my numbers. Deadline came and I went to work to find out I was canned for something that was NOT my fault."
good,"A mismanaged company that filtered down to the employees. Always was criticized for not selling, even though ticket sales were down on average on a year over year basis. A typical day of work is helping about 30 customers between another coworker within a normal 6-8 hour shift. Spent a lot of time doing inventory management and store cleanliness since there is a lack of customers, and many customers do not come in to buy our product, but to refill minutes on their phones. My manager is a good guy but overworked since there is not adequate staffing, only four people to run a store for a week. The best part is the location and friendliness of customers. the hardest part is being blamed for a lack of sales when it is a company problem not a personal one."
good,"I had the best co-workers of my life. The hardest part of the job is when you are under a big presion, cause you have to sell but people doesn't want to buy anything."
good,"The company is very out dated, and management is unorganized"
good,"no weekends or holidays off. Pay can vary but is not much. Great job as a manager, but not an associate"
good,"You don't do much, but the pay is low and there is no way to get a raise unless to take a management position"
good,a typical day at work would consist of dealing with the public as well as making sure every product has the right price on it and putting away product from shipments. we may also have to ship off faulty product to warranty center.
good,"I accepted a job postion from a friend to work for him as a salesman. I learned so much about selling to people, knowledge cell phones and there features."
good,"Certain stores don't receive as much foot traffic as others but the hold us up to the same goals which doesn't make any sense at all. Don't get me wrong you can learn an awful lot at radio shack which is an amazing plus. Such as learning multiple operating systems of cell phone carriers, how diodes work, etc."
good,Selling consumer electronics on a regular basis
good,"The company does not promote internally. After 7 years of superb performance and being chosen the last 4 years as a District Manager Candidate, I have yet to be even granted an interview."
good,I worked with a nice staff and its nice to have base pay plus commission. The communication from higher up could be better though.
good,hard work and self discipline to sell phones is required. not much of a team environment. Everyone for themselves and their own commission.
good,When i first started it was a great place to work..since then it has become more about pushing cell phones down the customers throats rather than finding the correct product for a customer.
good,"They change the management staff very often, not precisely considering the employees accommodation, and at least in my opinion, they had a vision of the business that was not aligned with the facts.The most enjoyable part of this job was the team work."
good,As with any retail sales position you have to love it. There is little time for a life outside of the store.
good,Decent job opportunity with high expectations for workers.
good,Radio shack was a fun place to work because you got to learn something new about new technological trends. Thry got heavy on mobile phone sales and demanding that it lost its appeal. It's understandable though because the shack no longer exists..
good,"Getting to watch technology evolve and get to be a integral part of it was exciting. Managing a dying company, holding on to treads was a challenge. It was stressful, yet a fun challenge to keep the doors open and the lights on."
good,"Started my days by checking all products and making sure they were in there right place as well as all the sales tags were updated for any discounted prices that were being advertised that week. I learned all my sales skills at this company even though the company eventually closed many stores including the one I worked at, they taught you how to make the smallest sales to the biggest sales. The best part of the job was the schedules and the work itself because they gave me by far the best schedule of any company I worked with and the hardest part of the job was counting stock every week because the company had a lot of products to count"
good,Typical retail job with minimal pay and opportunity for advancement. Not a long term option for a career. Only worked there for one year after high school.
good,Training was not very detailed. You had to learn fast in order to keep up and make sales. There were quotas that needed to be met. Upsell! Upsell! You got to learn about new and developing technology. Learned about cell phone carrier billing policies.
good,"Buen ambiente de trabajo bajo presión, turnos rotativos aparte todas la prestaciones de ley, bonos de puntualidad, entre otras"
good,"Good place to gain a wealth of knowledge on electronics and all its components. Good environment, great coworkers and good customers. I learned a great deal about commission sales."
good,"when you work at Radio Shack you learn how to do every job in the store, from cleaning to helping customers sign up for cell phone services. you learn about all the electronics you have to sell and since electronics are always changing you never stop learning. we had to reach our sales goals and sell warranties as well as get people to sing up for credit card. we had to help customers find what they were looking for and help them understand how to use it properly. we were also in charge of redecorating the store and doing setting everything out on the shelves correctly and keeping prices up to date."
good,"Great Place to work for when I first started ,company tried its best to rejuvinate itself but just couldnt reach their goal.  Sadly I belive radioshack will be missed and deserves to be for all their great years of helping customers."
good,"The position was ok, but overall there were very few people working alongside me in general, so it typically boiled down to most of my free time and study time from school being scheduled for work."
good,"I spent 13 years at RadioShack, primarily because of my immediate supervisor. I enjoyed the products and services we offered, which made is easier to offer them to customers."
good,I worked for a few years and then got married and had children and stayed home with my family for several years. By the time I was ready to go back to work they were all closed down.
good,the demands from management were enormous. phone meetings every day with managers in the district. were expected to be at peak all the time regardless of where you were or your customer numbers
good,"While working at RadioShack, I did receive an abundance of knowledge and insight into the tech industry. Unfortunately, management was poor, and very cynical. It made for a stressful and overall poor working environment."
good,The times passed by RSH.... Once a great company to work for but as technology and retail environment changed RSH became irrelevant. Changes in CEO's were the writings on the wall in early 2001 to 2005
good,"Being a salesperson is a must! There are moments where you want to rip your hair out and yell, but you learn a lot about electronics. Management sucks, BIG TIME! You can not trust the District Managers or the HR Manager, you will go with fear of knowing whether you have your job or not after you try to make a report."
good,"Dealing with customers considering standards and rules along side with caring of revenues, target and commissions is our main work."
good,"radio shack hired all the wrong people for upper management.   after the bankruptcy, they kept the same mgmt people in place that made all the bad decisions that sent us into a tail spin.  instead of hiring new managers with new ideas , they retained the old worn out managers with the same poor ideas, no follow up, no standard processes, nothing that resembled a company that would provide great customer service.    it was a sad thing to watch as radio shack made the same mistakes over and over again.   the cell phone sales associates were not properly trained, and the incentives that were given out by management were not based upon performance or process improvements.   the vp's regional managers and district managers  were ineffective and in my humble opinion caused the company  to go into ruin."
good,A typical day at work was very repetitive as a closer and opener. I learned a lot more about electronics and gadgets than ever before. I had a very good and motivated manager.
good,At first it was fun and challenging. Then they filled for bankruptcy and it became more and more stressful as every one was fighting to keep their jobs.
good,Decent place to work. Very aggressive and competitive culture. Being a salesman and a manager of sales teams who operate in the mall was a great challenge. I developed a great foundation for my sales career during my employment here.
good,"My experience wasn't bad, the customers could of been better but the staff was nice and friendly for the most part. The main reason I stayed was because I became friend with my manager, loyalty was the biggest factor"
good,I first enjoyed working at RadioShack I had transferred to another store and the manager was horrible. There was no structure and no type of training when new products would come in.
good,The job was quite repetitive. It was hard for making any advancement to a better position. The store itself was closing down and running out of business.
good,This company is a 3rd party retailer for Sprint and was bought out several times by different owners. Lots of changes in managers and work approach which made it hard to work
good,"I enjoy sales so working at a retailer that sold everything from cell phones to LED bulbs was fun, especially during the holidays when we also sold toys. Most of my co-workers were cool to be work with and our manager was awesome!"
good,"The company culture was a good one the first time around with the company. A lot of people to answer to, however I did receive quality training  while the stores were open."
good,While I didn't love this job it was probably the best one I had. A typical day included helping customers and selling them everything we could squeeze into a bundle for them. I didn't really approve of it because of our customer base but my coworkers kept me going. The store management was great and so were all of the coworkers I had but any higher up then that and you could see that the company really didn't know what to do to survive.
good,Decent job until the company went under and filed bankrupt. Relaxed selling atmosphere for electronics and completing daily tasks. Normal levels of stress associated with management.
good,I thoroughly enjoyed working at RadioShack until they went bankrupt and left us with no info. The management and other employees were great. There was a great work environment and my year there was enjoyable.
good,"I started right after I ended HS and just before I began college, so this job basically carried me the whole College life and a few extra years before landing the job that would embed my profession. RS was a cool little place where we had regular customers and would come for the smallest resistors to the largest personal computer we carried. I didn't earn much and to make a decent check I had to sell some big ticket items and couple them with as many accessories and warranties as possible, so everyday it was a hustle. but it was a good time to chill and learn on the technology that surrounded us, which at the time was nearly cutting-edge (long before smartphones, HDTVs and tablets)."
good,"Good job, bad financial moves from company, it does indeed help better your sales skills to sell what the company wants you to sell, helps you have a better knowledge about electronic parts."
good,What can I say. Bankruptcy happens for a reason. They didn't not reward hard work and advancement was no good. The severely under pay there managers as well.
good,"A great experience for anyone looking for a first time job, but a reminder to always reach higher. Working there you will start to know the ins and out of the retail system, and it will be great way to get your feet wet"
good,Working at the Store was great but when it came with the upper management there was many lies told to the store managers and sales associates. I wish  they treated employees better.
good,Radioshack was an informative job in which i learned many skills. However management for the company as well as maintaining partnerships with the company is by far the poorest i have ever seen. Management of radioshack does not inform the employees of the changes being made to company.
good,There have been a lot of changes through the years with RadioShack and it has allowed me to learn how to work through all the distractions and changes that were going on and continue to do my job. This company has also given me the opportunity to learn how retail and management works. Unfortunately there can be a lot of down time with out customers.
good,"I honestly haven't worked there long enough to give a proper review. I would say, for the most part, I did a lot of stocking for the store, and had a good rapport with my managers and coworkers. It was very enjoyable, because I was given a chance to find and stock the shelves with the different items that received through the shipments. This was in Ala Moana Shopping Center, so parking was bad at times."
good,"Radioshack was great till it went down hill, people depended on radioshack where i lived and people went there for years. But the hours wasnt great but the employees made it worth it."
good,Overall Radio Shack's principles and procedures were lacking.  They turned away from their roots and tried to be something that they're not.
good,"I was not a part of the Radio Shack environment for very long, but I did take a lot from it. I learned a lot about products and merchandise I didn't know much about before working there. I enjoyed my time there."
good,"It was an easy going job. I knew a lot about the products before I started working there so that really helped me out. I just had to learn the not so common things about some products. The hardest part was learning the exact steps to selling a phone because some phones you would go through some steps and with others, you'd go through others. Overall, I loved my job there. I just thought it was rude how they only told me like 3 days before we closed, that we were closing."
good,Selection of in store products could not compete with online competitor's prices. The CEO at the time gave himself a big bonus and ran away like a bank robber.
good,"My job at Radioshack was located mainly in the downtown Portland area. "
good,"Not a good place to work, no management support.  Management personnel changes constantly.  No logic to anything being done.  No wonder they had financial issues."
good,Decent place to work. Friendly environment and great experience for future opportunities.Very flexible hours and good people alongside of me to work with.
good,"Setting ridiculous goals and achieving them isn't enough, working day and night isn't enough. The company wants more then blood. Wouldn't recommend working here."
good,Didn't Get the Opportunity to full-fill my true potential I had the position of a manager but was not granted the opportunity to be  management
good,"I started 14+yrs ago as seasonal to make extra cash for the holidays and from there my love of electronics pulled me in to part time, full time, assistant and then manager. I have watched the evolution of electronics during one of the biggest booms;ranging from desktop to laptops and tablets and also bag phones to smart phones."
good,"A typical day at work would be to help customers and flex the store, while shipping out items to other locations if needed. Do deposit around three and then close the store at the end of the day."
good,"This is a great first job, you get the experience in customer service of all types; the good and the bad. But after a while it gets old, you are pushed to do the impossible."
good,"Radioshack was actually my favorite job as a manager, the pay wasnt that good for what the company expected you to do but the people i worked with and the things we achieved as a team made it worth it."
good,"Once the challenging training period was over, I found the job to be enjoyable.  I learned about people from different walks of life and that itself helped me to grow on a personal level. "
good,"Its an interesting place to work, meeting new people all the time. As you become a part of the work place and team you also evolve into apart of the neighborhood family."
good,"I began working at Radio Shack to coincide with my part time work schedule at Sally's Beauty Supply. Though I have worked several retail positions and felt very comfortable with the store front, Commission was a new aspect for me. I found this to be challenging based on only working for Radio Shack on a very part time basis. Learning the ever changing contracts of multiple cell phone providers and frequent releases of new phones was a struggle for me since I did not have much knowledge to new released technology, and not enough time in the store to feel confident in the products I was selling."
good,I learned how to work in a fast place . working with sell phones. my co workers good. The hardest is trying to find what is wrong with the sell phones.
good,"Great place to work once you were in management.The upper management was always reacting poorly to every situation. Quick to criticize, but rarely complimentary."
good,"We would place new products into the store weekly"
good,I never helped more than 5 customers in a 5 hour shift. The management was nice. I was 7 months pregnant while I worked there. And I was given a chair to sit on in between customers
good,"Radio Shack offered a vast amount of training and information to keep their employees well trained and certified to sell electronics. However, the failures of corporate management and the decision to file bankruptcy to save the company were overwhelmingly difficult on their loyal employees, including myself. I was very dedicated to my job, I provided great customer service and worked with a team that was functional and enjoyable. In the end, I'm glad to have worked there for the immense amount of knowledge and experience, I just wish my experience could have ended better."
good,"Typical day of work is answering phones helping customer, opening new phone accounts, upgrading phones."
good,My typical day I would clock into work from the front register. Greet and assist any customer who might need help. Once all customers wre helped I would then Check the company Email to see if we had any new updates on procedure or new specials running. After all the I would start cleaning ad straighting the store until another customer walked in and needed my assistance.
good,"Started working at RadioShack when I was 21 as a seasonal sales clerk.  Over the years, worked my way up the ladder and became the store manager.  Have had a great experience working with associates and building my professional skills in various areas."
good,"Demanding job due to shifting company directives."
good,"Bankruptcy due to incompetent CEO's.  No leadership at the top.  Bad decisions everywhere."
good,"I have worked for RadioShack for a little over a year. I worked my way up to Store Manager just to be told that we will be turning into a ""Clearance Hub"" as a result my entire staff quit. I am now the only employee at my location and I am not allowed to hire anyone. I use to Love working for this company. Now I am working an average of 72 hrs a week with no days off or brakes."
good,"Company was constantly changing policies and procedures on a weekly basis. You're told one thing one week, and something different the next.  Pay was pretty low compared to what we were expected to know"
good,highly motovating and fast  pace. customer friendly environment
good,Management is off and on. Obviously it depends on the person. Cooperate does not care too much about it's employees.
good,I am answering phones to install the MP114 device. Different stores call to verify installation was correct. Employees log in to the router to check and verify the device is installed. I learned different run commands as well as how to break down instructions step by step. Management I had no problems with. We got along the way a manager and a coworker should. My fellow coworkers were enjoyable to be around. I never had any issues with any coworkers here. The hardest part of my job was not knowing if I would be allowed the next day to work. Was knowing that whatever I didn't know myself I had fellow upper management and coworkers that could teach me the skills I didn't.
good,learn about electronics worked with a great team and learned customer service skills
good,"I rather enjoyed the people I worked with directly and the manager was very skilled regarding the ins and outs of the company, but I quickly came to recognize that the company seemed to lack any strategic focus. The corporation was unsuccessfully trying to rebrand itself to resemble its competitors but only managed to alienate its core demographic. I am unsure as to the company's future, but I wish them luck."
good,"Working at Radio Shack is a great experience. There are chances to advance in the company and move forward but that is only if your goals are achieved every month and you never have a bad day. A normal day would be with updating prices on all products, cleaning and dusting the store, helping customers with questions about the latest technology; cell phones, TVs, tablets, etc. Working with this company I learned a lot about the upcoming specks on cell phones and tablets. I learned a few things on the DIY area by conversations with the customers. My co-workers are very friendly and the store i work at has a very good vibe and all the employees get along very well. The hard part of working at Radio Shack is completing the goals that are set every month. My store location is a small location with very low traffic, which makes it very difficult to achieve the goal of selling a certain amount of money within a certain amount of tickets. There are months where we go far and beyond the goal, but there are the months that we don't reach half the goal. Another down side to the job is always having to keep up with the cell phone carrier plans and knowing them by heart. These plans change about every 6 months or more. And the company makes changes to warranty plans and pricing on products without prior announcement to the stores which makes it difficult to know what price is correct or what warranty we actually offer. The most enjoyable part of the job is learning about the DIY items and getting to know the regular customers that come into the store and building rapport with those customers."
good,It's not a half bad job its just that the pay is mediocre and there is no hope of advancement!
good,Good place to work for but tough company to work for at this particular time.  Management is good for the most part and the hardest part of the job is having to keep up with all the store modifications.
good,"Aprendi a ser tolerante en cuanto a las ventas, seguir pasos para concretarlas."
good,"Easy to advance"
good,"Inventory"
good,"Typical day: selling items to customers, working on merchandising units, assisting customers with product issues"
good,"Placing orders for customers, restocking product. Learning about upcoming products and services. "
good,"I worked here for a full year , just for the experience. the job itself was fine, minimum wage to all sales associates, ALL! no matter how long you have worked there. district manager would push all managers to meet their monthly goals as normal. BUT my districts manager had the most terrible way of speaking to the anagers. therefore managers felt pressured and were often extremely frustrated and was put on us sales associates."
good,Radioshack provided the employees with non realistic metrics based on the number of customers and would give all employees a hard way about it. I did learn a few things from there to keep up with all planograms and proper signage. I made it as simple and easy as possible for my employees to try and reach their metrics monthly by coaching them and helping them get better in their weak areas. The most enjoyable part of the job was connecting with my staff and all of us learning how to grow
good,Working at Radioshack is good for a first time job but after awhile it feels like a dead end job and you will become complacent my experience may be slightly better than most stores because I had a good team behind me
good,"I worked part time hours for a company that promised me full time work, learning about the ins and outs of their shelf stocking and product relocation process 50% of the time, helping customers find products they were looking for and pushing cell phones on people who generally weren't interested.  The hardest part of the job was dealing with disinterested young adults who felt it was not their responsibility to take a more active role in leadership and were untrained in what they were selling to the customers.  Most of the associates were internet and social media savvy, but knew nothing about how to program an arduino, how to create custom electronics from kits or even what a di-pole antenna is and why it's important in radio communications."
good,"I enjoyed helping people and leaning products upper, upper management and corporate is totally clueless that is why there Are so many problems if they would go work a store they might understand."
good,"Being a key holder has its perks for the resume part, but working for Radio Shack does get tiring after a while. The management varies depending where you go, there are a lot of quotas to follow and keep up on, maintaining the store was not difficult so long as every one kept their part. my coworkers were friendly and understanding, but the management will always vary. the customers can be a hassle, depending on where you work. i worked there for almost 5 years and saw no advancement in the company. the pay changes a lot, their standards always change. their methods to address issues and concerns come off at threatening instead of cooperative. not to mention they plan to close a bunch of stores within the next year or so (starting 2014)"
good,"-Assisted customers with purchases."
good,"A typical day at work is waiting for a customer (at most locations) and praying that they will buy something. Management is lazy and inexperienced. I was appalled by some of RadioShacks Manager behavior. Co-workers are fun and cool to talk to. Mostly young kids. The hardest part of my job was having to give up and move on. The most enjoyable? Well, I learned that I am far more talented than i thought. Co-workers would desribe me as ""Corporate in Disguise"" or ""Undercover Boss"""
good,"A typical day would be handing the day to day operations of the business. Setting individual goals for associates. Coaching them so that they may reach their individual goals. Lead store sales. Interact with customers. Did everything possible to achieve sales goal."
good,"Good stepping stone, but not a career. Radio Shack used to take care of their employees much better, but in recent years pay plan and management structure have significantly changed."
good,Just a basic retail job nothing more. People were very nice learned a lot.
good,"Handled daily sales operations, handled incoming and outgoing inventory, customer service"
good,"Was a pretty nice place to work until hours with school work and bus schedule collided . Very nice manager, looks out for his employers. I learned about cellular phones and data/internet service even more and it was conveniently located within Sam's Club. So when it came to lunch breaks, it was affordable and Sam's Club gave out free samples!"
good,"Helping customer rather it be phone activation or everyday items Learned about mobile electronics "
good,"Hard work but you can make it a fun place to be, it is all what you make it."
good,"To sum up working for RadioShack in one word, ""fun"". There are a lot of learning opportunities with products and services.  Meeting and forming relationships with customers and providing great customer service on a daily basis is the goal."
good,"On a typical day at work, it will be very busy but we did have communication all throughout the store"
good,Radioshack is a great company to grow and gain experience. There's plenty of space for advancement and the incentives from hard work are great.
good,Sales- i was number one every month i learned all about electronics i enjoyed all the people i worked with at the mall.  It was hard to know everything in the store and selling phones was fun
good,Was a flexible employer while I was in college.  Had a very long training program to become a manager.
good,"I enjoy helping customers with questions. I am able to use my natural ability to advise or solve problems in various ways. I do not get annoyed or sarcastic when a customer walks in and asks a question. It isn't the customer's fault that they do not know what to ask or how to word it at times."
good,Well... I worked a ton but that came with the title.  great people to work with but upper management needs improvement.  
good,"    RadioShack is a great place to work while you're attending school.  They are very flexible and you can make a decent amount of money there."
good,"Job duties included: cashiering, bank deposits, closing key holder, merchandising, contract wireless sales, and store cleaning and organizing."
good,The day begins with getting the store ready for the customers so we can have a productive day.Help customers with what they come in for.Make sure all associates know what performance is required from them that day.Meeting new people is rewarding.
good,"RadioShack was my first full management job. I enjoyed the learning experience more then the work itself. I learned about profits and loss, inventory management, budgeting for payroll, setting and meeting sales goals and scheduling and managing employees. I didn't however agree with the overall direction the company was going in during my time there. There was a lot of employee and manager intimidation from a corporate level to increase cellular phone sales. This was an excellent area of revenue opportunity for the company I just disagreed with their methods of implementation."
good,"Radio Shack is where I first really relied on customer satisfaction and I also learned how to be a professional in a non professional environment, here by boosting my ability to preform my duties above the influence of poor management and an unprofessional environment."
good,"like to work with people.. it's fun, but it will get to you."
good,"A typical day starts with a conference call that last for 45 minutes that reviews your store and fellow stores metrics from the prior day/week. Overall, one important skill that I learned/developed is proper planning. ""Proper planning prevents poor performance"". Co-workers among the management field (in my district) were divided mentally among those that are looking to climb the corporate ladder and those that are satisfied with running their current location (this does not make a good mixture). One of the hardest parts of the job is that it consumes your life. Managers are there 6 days a week (most locations do not even have an assistant manager to help reduce the work load) for which we were only paid for 5. For me the most enjoyable part was my ability to hire crew members. Knowing that I was able to provide people with a sorce of income was very fulfilling and rewarding to me."
good,The best part of the job was assisting customers with the decision making process of selecting the right products and services that best meet the customers needs. The issues came in with lack of inventory and resources to make the customer experiences a completely satisfying and successful experience.
good,"I worked here for five months, and honestly didn't really take anything from it. The Philadelphia district manager is a scumbag, and the pay is totally pathetic."
good,"Our main job was to sell wireless, we went through weekly training to ensure that we knew our products. Most of my co-workers were joyful people and fun to be around. The hardest part of the job was explaining new technology to the elderly."
good,"I come in to work I do the daily run-down of the good to great document. Basically it incloses the opening and closing procedures that need to be did on a regular. Once this is done go on to the sales floor review the past days or weeks sales performance with the sales associate in attendance. Together we find areas of improvement where we can work on our weaknesses and capitalize on our strengths. Finally, we push sales and the the ares of the matrix we are graded upon."
good,i loved working here because i was able to venture off and pitch my own sales lines and wasnt told to go off a piece of paper that i had to memerize it made my day a lot easier. my favorite part of the job was cellphone sales because a customer would come in totally confused and unhappy about a cellphone and i could answer all the questions they were concerned with and let them go home with there day less stressful.
good,The typical day was slow until the holidays such as thanksgiving and Christmas came around. I learned alot about technology and products that I was not familiar. The managers were okay they usually were not around but they're good people.
good,"Every morning there was a required conference call before locations are open for all Store managers. Store managers only had 1 day off every week, so all your focus was on your job, no time for family. Other then that if you have good employees working for you, the job will be easy and fun. To make the job exciting for my employees and i, we would have competition on who hit on all metrics weekly."
good,"When I first started I thought the job was really great. I had never experienced a job that was based on commission and you basically controlled what you were paid. Now the company has changed in the past 4 or 5 months. We still get the commission, but it is now condensed and the management stinks."
good,"Typical day is to look at the list of things to do may it be receiving merchandise and restocking the shelves and pegs. Helping Customers and getting them what they need to help them with their questions and hopefully getting them the right merchandise they needed. The co-workers were great, fun and enjoyable to be around. The hardest part was there was none but to try and make your numbers."
good,"Overall a good place to work at during and just after high school. They train you, and as along as you make the sales, you will be okay."
good,"Sales commission great with you are a great sale persons, great place for someone who whats to be train to be a manager."
good,"Heavy emphasis on sales, great potential for high earnings based on performance. You are in control of your paycheck based on how well you do in sales. Greet guests regularly day in day out, strong knowledge of product will ensure a solid sales backing. Keep up with operations to make sure the Kiosk is properly maintained."
good,"I started nearly 2 months after I was notified I had got the job. I have a little experience in phones and computers, so with that in mind the manager tossed me on the floor on my 3rd day after 2 days of ""harassment and procedures"" training. Fun place to work and if you are driven make money but with the little training I was given I am having to learn as I go and losing money."
good,"Money was not great. My manager at time was good at times but then she would go completely to the left. Replaced by someone who did not have the experience, who would steal time, bash other employees, and if she had a problem with you she would try to get you fired."
good,"A typical day at work is assisting customers, pricing store, putting out shipment. I have learned a lot from working with the group of co-workers that surround me. I've learned more about electronics and small parts such as the new tablets, cell phones, led's, audio cables, and all sorts of adapters. Currently we don't have a manager so myself and another key holder are acting managers. One of the hardest part of my job is dealing with unsastified customers, usually if I encounter one of these outrage customers I get an understanding of what the problem is then I try my best to solve it (which I usually do) and they appreciate the time and effort I give. The most enjoyable part of my job is seeing a customer who has no clue of the new gadgets or what they excatly need walks out the store with a smile on their face. Which means they always return to my store!"
good,"It was my first job while being in high school. My manager was a very mean person to all of the employees. A normal day I would sell 30 items, and other electronics to customers. Answer a quick few phone calls, restock the shelves, and clean the store. Occasionally I would put promotional posters up on the walls or windows. I had the best co-workers. Always challenging me, and making sure I did my job. They would teach me things my manager never even told me, The best part about the job was putting a smile on the customers face, and making sure all needs were met. The hardest part was trying to keep up with phone sells. At the time not to many people were buying plans and were more into prepaid phones."
good,"Customer service greeted customers, helped them locate items, provided answer to help customer to select best product for their needs. Worked with inventory included cleaning, stocking, ordering, leading a customer to purchase an item that they felt comfortable buying. Located items from other stores and transferred item to my store at the request of the customer. Assisted in daily assigned duties. As a key holder I was responsible for opening and closing store, training new members, bank deposits, transferring merchandise from our store to other store or reverse."
good,"At Radio Shack i learned to be confident with myself because i was in contact with people trying to give them exceptional Costumer Service and make them feel like they cared. It was hard sometime to get on people good side, but eventually you learn the skill to make them feel comfortable. What you most enjoy at the end of the day is the ""Thank You"" they gove you for helping them in what they need and it puts a smile on your face to know you helped someone."
good,Radio Shack could be a great place to work if the management is restructured and the focus is put to products customers actually want and not products the company buys and tries to push off. Goals are unrealistic and the managerial style of control through threats makes the job far more stressful than it needs to be.
good,"I am a store manager at radio shack. I have been with the company from the time I was a part time associate. In the month of Decemeber I worked 28 days for 252 hours and when I asked for 3 days off in a row in January, I was denied. The stress level is huge. I am 23 years old and have a peptic ulcer from stress. They pay is also very low for the fact we have to work 6 day week every week."
good,They hired me in November and closed my store the following April. What can I possibly say that would be helpful? They went bankrupt and I had to find new employment.
good,"There didn't seem to be much room to grow, though I knew that it was only going to be part time for myself. It was a nice environment to work in, and I definitely gained experience in electronics."
good,"en esta empresa solo trabaje durante la temporada de campana navidena, la veredad no me agrado mucho las politicas de la empresa, al darte el uniforme el cual no era de mi agrado, y los horarios no eran cómodos."
good,"If you are not selling, you might not have a job."
good,"It was nice having commission, but the pay was never too fantastic to begin with. My fellow employees were always very enthusiastic, and fun to be around. For the most part there really wasn't that much going on at this job. Usually I just sold a lot of cell phones, and closed up shop at the end of the work day. There would be times when difficult customers would come in, but they are the sort of customers that anyone would run into in a sales related position."
good,"Hours were pretty abysmal,  pay was low,  expectations were extremely high. Towards the end of my time management felt a little disastrous and unorganized, but that was more than likely because of the looming bankruptcy."
good,Radio shack is no longer in business. They gave it a good run. .this company gave me skils to put my next foot forward and enhance my retail career. ...............
good,"I relatively enjoyed my time at Radio Shack. Unfortunately, they did not keep up with current market trends. Nor did they try to change, until it was too late. And now they are mostly internet based, with some remaining franchise stores. Also unfortunate was their pay. In the beginning, you could make a decent living wage. However, they slowly declined to only paying minimum wage, with little commission. But you were still expected to have all the knowledge of someone with a much higher pay rate. So many bad decisions on the party of the people at the helm, that destroyed a great company."
good,this company is not around any more but i did hear they might be coming back into some locations as a store in a store. this will be interesting to see how they do a second time.
good,Company lost it's way by not keeping up with the on line business.  The company also lost tons of money through bad wireless contracts with the major carriers.  All of them structured the agreement leaving RadioShack to take the biggest hit of customer costs.
good,"Opened the store and went right to trying to sell a cell phone to every costumer. It was the driving force of the sales team, and when there were not costumers in the store it was cleaning and stoking the store."
good,"Radio Shack was in the process of closing several stores, including the one I worked in.  As a result, the environment was not productive or positive."
good,"The advantages RadioShack had over it's competitors started dwindling in 1995 with the change of new CEO's every few years.  The direction to dominate the sales of cel phones and to carry name branded electronics was in my opinion where things started going down the path of no return.  Near the end of the company, the people working there didn't know anything about parts and how to make things work."
good,"It was a good place to work, good people to work around. Comfortable atmosphere, fun and not really hard work. Overall it was a good experience, and would work there again."
good,It was a good job until they closed all the stores. Although there are still some franchises around; the website is still up. I did learn a lot while i  worked there.
good,"It's a fun place to work with the right co-workers. "
good,No me sentí muy cómodo en este trabajo ya que hacía falta más capacitación por parte de la misma. El ambiente de trabajo era un tanto hostil ya que las ventas eran muy reñidas.
good,Overall a good place to work minus the facts the company is plummeting. mass lay offs which make there no sense of job security. I reccomend choosing a different route
good,"Radio Shack was a fun workplace involving the combination of technology, problem solving, and face-to-face interaction with customers. We had a good team oriented atmosphere in the workplace. Unfortunately that team spirit disapeared in the district and corporate management. Store managers were constantly interrupted multiple times a day to attend district and company wide conference calls that accomplished little. Stress was placed upon launching new sales goal programs on a monthly basis by corporate management. Little was done to deal with unavailability of popular products. Stress was constantly being placed upon add-on sales of high profit (high cost) accesories and insurance programs that would add as much as 50% more to a sales ticket. "
good,typical retail job. Asked to do alot (off the clock work) Needed more structure. They needed to do a better job of letting managers handle more responsibility. I will say I did like the people I worked with.
good,"Company is no longer  in busses. "
good,"I'm not sure if things have changed now that Radio Shack is owned by Sprint, but during my time at the company, it was a sad, stressful job. Too many disparate products to know about, and, ironically, none of them were radios. Too much stress placed on up-selling, especially in the cellular phone department, when most customers told me they'd much rather buy a phone from their phone provider (i.e., Verizon, AT&T, etc.)"
good,was a good place to work but shifted focus to cell phones and started losing original core business. then started hiring upper management from outside.. Atilla the hun moved in and company died
good,"Company is defunct. It's not possible to work there anymore. I mean, technically there are a few independently owned locations around, but that won't last long."
good,"it was a fun place to work before they sold out, good team work promotion and it was nice to get those incentive check, but when i became a manager with not much more pay and way more hours it got stressful"
good,Greeting customers and customer service. Hardest part of the job was trying to sell products. Most enjoyable part was meeting all different types of people.
good,Nice job getting 3 days a week on 4 hour shifts but other than that nice job nice people learn alot of things dealing with technology and computers i just stock
good,I had a great manager and the selection of electronics and prices was quite excellent but the pay was barely above minimum wage and corporate could be a real pain in the butt. I loved working with out customers and helping them out but I couldn't survive with this job solely. Now the branch I used to work at is out of business.
good,"Typical day was stressfull."
good,No profitable company business plan. Everyone thought we went out of business. The company that took over in 2015 did no advertising to let people know Radio Shack was back and why we were better than ever.
good,It was an amazing job to have while I was inschool. Unfortunately my store was shut down by the bankruptcy so I was left without a job. I really did love that place though.
good,"Not worth even trying to apply here anymore, most stores are closed and the ones that aren't are like a graveyard. Would love to see them rebound but they need a miracle at this point."
good,The most enjoyable part of the job is interacting with customers . Hardest part of the job is selling product at a high price with little quality to it. The store had rushes and times it was not busy just depending on the time of day. Management was lack luster everything seemed to be presented to associates last second and coordination with upper management and tasks they give us want great either.
good,"This job give me a chance to work while deciding on school.  Scheduling was terrible at times and the pay wasn't that great.  Nonetheless, it was a stepping stone to allow me to learn new skills and I am grateful"
good,"Overly Stressed, no work/life balance, good training on product.  Overall it's just a job and that is how you are treated.  There is no real benefit for working at Radio Shack, besides making you to be independent."
good,"Most locations are closing due to chapter 11. If any survive at all, it will be a tough uphill climb. Hopefully they can become a destination again, and not a afterthought."
good,Not a good place to work at. The manager who works at the radioshack was good with the customer and employees. The paid and the commission wasn't that good at all. Beside that I had enjoyed working there and meeting new customer every day .
good,Commissioned sales means a competitive environment among employees. Sales people were expected to add as much as possible to maximize their personal commission payout.
good,"When I first came to the Pinnacle Park location it was still under construction. I helped set-up the store to a new floor plan and stock it with inventory. Later, I was used by Radio Shack to help prepare for the holiday season by training personnel in the incentive/spiff program for Sprint/ Verizon service plans and accessories. This training was conducted during the 2004 regional sales meeting in November. I completed all of the product training and certifications for all of the Radio Shack product lines and was the Key Holder for my store. This experience gave me a deep understanding of retail sales and Verizon and Sprint service contracts and how to push the sale of these services."
good,"I worked for this company for almost 9 years altogether. I managed my current location for the past 3 years. I've been managing for 5.5 years. For a good portion of it, I enjoyed my employees, my customer base, and my bosses. "
good,RadioShack was a good experience for me at the time but the pay was not all that great considering I was a store manager there. Overall good learning experience.
good,The company as a whole was going downhill so my experience included working for people who didnt have the skills necessary to run a successful business.
good,"A good place for those who enjoy electronics, sales, & a interacting with people. Once there is no customers, you can enjoy the in-store items to entertain yourself and other employees."
good,I was an Assistant Manager at RadioShack for about a year. It was okay for the time being but I wouldn't recommend. It is definitely a good job for a College Student.
good,"Radio Shack is currently undergoing a tough time after being purchased by new owners."
good,"Six years ago Radio Shack was an okay company to work for, that is until they started closing down stores and lowered the commission structure drastically"
good,No stability in the company. Management changes too often. extremely low pay for the amount of responsibilities given. Company is about to go bankrupt.
good,Good employee and work place.  the customer are open and nice.  the store is clean and the employees looks out for each other.  The higher managements train the store mangers.  the store mangers coaches the store employees.
good,"For many years there was great opportunities, but with the new ownership taking over last year we lost most benefits to working there. Our 401K was ended, along with the matching funds. All seniority was lost and every manager was set back to $11.50/Hour. Payroll hours were reduced to only cover the hours the store was open (example, if store was open a total of 78 hours/week, that was your payroll hours). I always enjoyed the freedom to run my store and merchandise the way I felt best suited my customers. I also liked being able to recruit, interview, and hire my staff. The hardest part of the job was being in charge of everything. Managing, selling, training, banking, recruiting, hiring, loss management, cleaning, P/L reviews, employee weekly/monthly reviews, merchandising, local marketing/advertising, sales numbers collection, everything regarding my business I was in charge of top to bottom. I was there for over 23 years, what I learned was how to run every aspect of a Business. They closed all the stores in a large area which left me looking for something new. I would like to end with this, I have made so many friendships over the years and watched so many of my employees blossom and grow either within the company or leave to grow and develop with other companies, it is my proudest achievement as a manager to have some part in the successful careers that they accomplished."
good,simply know what your store has and offers and you will do great!!! I learned that you can not make friends in a work environment because then problems occur. the hardest part was that when the store was empty and spotless you still needed to find something to do since cameras are watching your every move and my current manager was very picky about not doing something when not needed !
good,"Not much job security, always changing and bad employee communication. Not enough worker comp or enough benefits to last any longer than a short term job."
good,"Had 3 managers within a 2 month period."
good,"The management doesn't look at you as anything more than a number, the store manager, and associates usually get along wonderfully, and it's like working with good family and friends, but the upper management just doesn't care"
good,The work environment itself is fine. Manager is fine and works with schedules. But Radio Shack is cutting hours immensely and theres no way to live off of the pay.
good,"I didn't mind the time I spent with this company.  The money was alright. The work was easy.  The real problem is they make you feel like you are just a replaceable cog in a machine, and with a dying company this is a real problem."
good,"Radio Shack was going out of business the last year I worked there.  They weren't giving me enough hours, so I had to seek employment elsewhere.  I loved the technology and my coworkers were like family."
good,"Working there was typically slow, barely any customers and the ones that we dealt with were older and had plenty of difficulty with the new technology which made servicing them funner than other retailers."
good,"typical day of work would consist of arriving to work in timely matter to at times open and close the store count the stores till "
good,"not a great place to work for, most managers i came across were very lazy and hardly ever helped around the store. They hardly even did their duties. Many of us were left to do manager duties and we were hardly able to take breaks. Training is terrible and almost non-existant and you had to learn everything on your own with almost no help from managers and purely on trial and error. It took a while to get the gist of things but it helps if you have good coworkers to guide you. Only good thing was they give a decent amount of working hours but always weekends and and evenings. They did work well with my school schedule though but schedules were always put up the day before the new business week. It was nice that they payed commission although it didn't seem like much at times."
good,At radio shack you learn many different thing ranging from cellphones to fuse. It requires a lot of training and practice. It is a great place to learn about technology.
good,"Long hrs while you learn, becomes much smoother as you become accustomed to the job."
good,fun experience and getting to know new people and the customer/associate ratio was good. the atmosphere was inviting and calming to work in with everyone around me.
good,Company in a downward spiral. Lots of lay offs and closings. no security even at district management level. Will never recommend working here
good,"A typical Day at work was to sell as much as possible and attach as many items to a sale as possible,As well as keeping the store tidy and helping customers in need. I learned different sales pitches , and management was reasonable and fair in most cases."
good,I ran very successful locations but the company as a whole just couldn't get itself relevant in a constantly changing industry.  I was glad I got out when I did but I was sad to see it go.
good,excellent opportunity to learn. Met some great associates and customers. Was able to learn quite a bit about electronics. Do not approve of the direction the company is going.
good,I love Radioshack being in electronics most of my life. Sadly the company is in need of many changes in order to survive and has become an increasingly difficult place to enjoy working at. I hope the Radioshack can pull off a turn around.
good,"Radioshack has a work environment that is set by the Store's Manager; generally the manager has to be prepared to defend some decisions even if they are profitable and efficient. "
good,Fun environment with numerous things to learn. Great ability to advance with company. Hopefully they will get it together and say open as they filed chapter 11 bankruptcy recently.
good,The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to talk to many people throughout the day or evening. and helping people
good,"Great products and knowledgeable employees. A fun place to work."
good,"pretty much I didn't like this job . The management was going under business , Employers were getting hours cut .The people around were not stable"
good,It is no secret that radioshack has had problems at almost every level of the company. My thoughts echo the information from the wall street journal as well as other publications.
good,Fun but you need to get into management to make real money here. Commission based sales driven culture. Would consider working here again just for the fun factor.
good,"A typical day at Radioshack was smooth, just understand what goals were disbursed for the day and what our store goal is. I learned what it meant to work as a team to make sales goals were met at the end of the month as a store. As well as balancing full time work and school altogether. Management can be improved in many areas, such as communication, training, and ethics. The hardest part of my job is closing the sale whether the customer was either going to get their upgrade or not. What I enjoyed the most were my co-workers they are such great people."
good,"Open the store 30min prior to doors opening, make sure operations are completed.  Learned how to manage a store and monthly and quarter metrics. Management varies from store to store.  Coworkers are what Corporate deems suitable for the job.  A lot of write ups for not hitting specific goals.  Phone sales are a must to survive. Most enjoyable part are the coworkers I've had."
good,"Job can be very fun indeed. I've learned a lot. However, with the downward spiral of the company, upper management is stressed, causing everybody else to become overly stressed. The company is done."
good,"Responsible for cash on hand and assisting customers with their needs, placing orders online, putting orders away, updating tags, processing payments, store audit, balancing cash drawer and making bank deposits and activating cell phones."
good,learned great customer service skills as a sales associate
good,"Overall I enjoy working for Radioshack, However without advancement opportunity it makes it undesirable."
good,A pretty fair place to work if you are passionate about helping customers. Somewhat unrealistic sales goals and expectations but job culture compensates.
good,"Great experience to work with a company that has thrived for almost 100 years. Unfortunately, they aren't making the proper changes at the store level to survive."
good,"I would clock in everyday, and the first thing I would normally do was go to the bank and handle the deposits. One good thing about it was not every day was the same. I would sit behind the counter and help customers unless something needed to be fixed or cleaned. I would handle bill payments when they were needed. whenever there would be a delivery needed, I would go deliver the appliance. I learned how to install appliances and count money backwards which was kinda cool. The management was very laid back. They did not really keep the store in order which became confusing at times. I enjoyed my co-workers. One was a friend of mine and we just hung out on slow days at work. The other co-worker was nice company she talked a lot but it wasn't a bad thing, I just listened. The hardest part of the job was not the labor, but it was the payment handling. People payed their phone and satellite bills there, and that was just along process that had a lot of flaws which involved calling the companies. It was tied to the Radio Shack companies but to the owners. I enjoyed the deliveries the most. I liked riding on the road. I enjoyed the labor part of the job over the retail part."
good,"Good part-time job.  Worked customer service and sold computers, TVs and cell phones.   Liked working with customers."
good,a great place to work with great co workers and a great atmosphere. well managed and a typical day goes by pretty fast
good,"I would love to continue my career at RadioShack and move up in my current company. But with the company in it's current state, a turnaround seems unlikely. I want to put my time & energy into a company I know I can be working for in 5 years from now. I don't know that is true with RadioShack."
good,Good environment and my co-workers pushed me to work harder.
good,"At my location, we were a little bit slower than a mall store.  It left me plenty of time to get planograms and floor changes done, along with making sure the store was clean and organized.  I learned how to make a schedule and balance employees work load.  My immediate supervisor was a blast to work with.  However, upper management was constantly changing policies and made the job difficult to handle. I think my most enjoyable part of the job was my co workers and being able to work with people on a daily basis.  I loved the feeling that I was able to help my customers with their problems."
good,There is a reason this company is going out of business.  They stopped training their employees and they offer so little compensation that the employees stopped caring too.
good,"On a typical day I will come in, get the cash drawer and daily paperwork in order, and ensure the store is in a condition to open up.  Afterwards I go through the routine order of items that must be completed in the morning and throughout the day (Check email, sales metrics, appointments, company memos, etc.).  "
good,"If you are technical and like computers and is curious on how they are built, and wonder about other electronics than you will like this job but if not than this is not the job for you. There is a hourly and a decent commission which is tempting; however, the district managers are very strict and are not open to hear anything no one else has to say which is not good. And the compensation for managers is not worth what they are asking the managers to do. Manager objectives are really detailed with the company and $18.00 per hour is not worth it."
good,I used this job to supplement some income. It was a good place to work. I enjoyed working with the people that I did. Helping the customers was rewarding
good,"While working there the retail culture within RadioShack changed.  But overall it was an good experience and I learned quite a bit about management, sales, and people."
good,Great place to learn old fashion sales techniques. The sales experience was very intimate. Employees were not compensated well.
good,"During my time at RS I started as a store manager, managing 6 locations. I was  promoted to Corporate Headquarters to start a Visual Merchandising Dept. During that time I worked on many projects that  benifited the company, the stores and also expanded my knowledge for the business world. I learned how to open a new division and  to close a division (TechAmerica). I was responsible for creating new fixtures that would be used in all Corp. locations (4500+)and some Dealer Franchise locations. I also did floor and space planning."
good,"I worked here for a solid years and in my time here the store that I was located at went through managers in that time. The job was an all exclusive electronics store that also did cell phone contracts with all the major cell phone companies. A typical day would be for me to come in and open up the store and count the cash register to make sure the store has enough money to start the day. Then I would unlock the doors and start the daily tasks of whatever needs to be done for the day while helping customers that came through the door on a daily basis. The job was very simple on a day to day basis just making sure the store was clean and music was playing along with helping customers in there television, cell phone, or whatever they needed at the time."
good,"Hardest part of the job was trying to sell cell phones and attach all the products they wanted you to sell with it. Everyone wanted the free phones and didn't want to pay anything. A typical day consisted of standing around the store and greeting people, there wasn't very much to do when it was slow we kept the place clean and decent. The management wasn't very good. if you had a problem they wouldn't resolve it. My co-workers, the majority were assume some of them not so cool."
good,"Very fast paced learned alot on cell phones and odds and ins that i wasnt aware of before such as cables and how certain things worked with adapters, my co-workers were amazing we always helped each other, hardest part of the job is doing contracts on phones with each carrier, most enjoyable part was talking to new people everyday"
good,"The great thing about the Shack is that you will never have a boring day. Every day someone comes in with new questions and with a lot of resources to draw from it is not hard to help people out. That's not to say you have everything and that you can help everyone. Sometimes you don't have the right part or your simply out of stock of the item that someone wants. Regardless you provide a great service to people daily."
good,"I have learned many things while working at Radio Shack and have loved working for the company. However, since the stocks fell out so have employees wages. Coupled with this demands over sales initiatives have increased to the point that you can be netting and grossing a profit over last year (Radio Shack only puts you up against the previous years numbers) and still be facing unemployment."
good,"Every day was always a competition among co-workers to sell the promotions the corporate office was marketing for personal gain. Salary was dependent on commission and sales. The company required many training videos before and after hire about new products, electronics, technology, and shipping & receiving from within. Management was difficult as it was often that managers were constantly being fired. The most enjoyable part of the job was the ability to assist customers or co-workers with product questions. The most difficult part of the job was advancement and limited to certain parts of the job because of my gender (female) and the ability to speak Spanish. My manager limited my skills to only assisting customers who spoke Spanish and the number of hours I could work. I finished the required trainings to be more technically advanced but was always denied the opportunities for experience to a male co-worker."
good,we had 4 different gm's in the 8 months i was there. hard to keep up with the changes.
good,"has to be more organize with the schedule."
good,I liked working for them because the company was fair and management seemed to be willing to invest in the employees.
good,Was a decent place to work. They had a young manager at the time so sometimes it was frustrating. Other than that not much to say.
good,"I must be at the branch 30 minutes prior to opening. I must make sure all computers are running smoothly, and must review the performance management tool of the store and associate level of the previous day. Complete and store all daily reports by noon. I must have afternoon huddles with my team members and present their daily goals. I must oversee all transaction done by my employees especially wireless transactions. Ensure all planograms and floor restorations are done. Ensure all money and petty cash and banks completions are done before closing."
good,planogram after planogram they rearrange the entire store weekly. they nit pick on employees about little things may be something as little as part of your short came untucked. they are very schedule friendly willing to work around school schedule.
good,a typical day at radio shack consists of lazy employees and incompetent managers all the way up to district. Pointless trips to Gonzales for meetings that don't mean anything. The pay seems non existant. It also seems to change alot over all not the best company to work for a career. Great for school though 
good,"Have to have to come in and apply yourself everyday to drive sales, I have learn about everything in our store. Management and co- workers are my second family. Hardest job is to maintain a smile and drive sales at the same time with difficult customers. Most enjoyable part is meeting new people."
good,"Average day of stocking, reorganizing, setting up displays, cleaning, helping customer all to varying degrees depending on the day."
good,I find the company a little behind in the times. When I was there I wish pay was a little better and there was more training.
good,"Helping customers find what they need while providing them with knowledge of our products. Selling insurance, mobile phones, new technology. I've learned the most succesful sales path and the best customer service. My management position consist of training employees, scheduling, RMAC, accepting orders and theft protection."
good,"proof read school ,material and other work related jobs."
good,Best sales job ever had a great oppotunity to advance with this company.
good,"A typical day I would come in around 12pm and stay until closing which was 9pm. I then would start doing any duties that weren't complete from the next day as well as doing assigned store chores. I learned how to run a store by myself, answer the phones, keep customers happy and keep business coming into Radio Shack. I enjoyed learning something everyday with gadgets and technology and making customers happy with their purchase."
good,Allows you to interact with customers on a daily basis and presents you with a unique challenge every day.
good,very good place to work very strong push to sell wireless phones as that is where you and the company make the money
good,A good family oriented company
good,Friendly co-workers. Lots of customer service involved. I learned a lot about electronics. The pay is commission based.
good,A typical day at work is fairly easy and smooth. Co Workers are fair to cope with and job overall is well
good,This place is the exact definition of a job. There is advancement so don't get me wrong. But this job is much better than working at mcdonalds.
good,Working for this company was good I learn how to build a clientele I understand how to work as team better to accomplish our goals.
good,"A typical day at work would consist of inventory count ""cage count"", cash intake, engaging guest, customer service, and product knowledge."
good,"Not a bad job, however the pay was not great and the company lacks focus."
good,very poor place to work very bad health insurance plan no time off between november to mid january poor management
good,"Great place to move up and establish your skills quickly, however the amount of micromanagement is out of this world."
good,"Low customer traffic area, but has awesome products along with affordable cost on service plans. Learned a lot about the internal workings of electronic items. Schedule didn't allow time to spend with family and manager was complacent on how the schedule was structured. All employees shared the same register."
good,My typical day is to come to work. Read my emails from Corporate so I am aware of whatever changes that I have to impement that day. Review all my previous day's paperwork and transactions. Have a brief review of my current Sales numbers. Review the days Sales and Adminstrative objectives with the team so they knows what they have to do throughout the day.Make sure that each associate aware of assigned task that have to be completed that day. The MOST IMPORTANT thing that I do is ensure that my team provides consistent customer service and hit sales objectives for the day.
good,It was a fun place to work and is a great way to keep up with technology.  Unfortunately they didn't make wise decisions to stay current in marketing.
good,"It was good while it lasted.  I retrained rather than fired poor performers.  Moved bottom ranked store to top 10, then a middle ranked store to number one.  new area manager came in and the company went bankrupt within a few years..."
good,Radioshack is a company where it met the customer needs when it came to cell phone plans and components that can help fix everyday technology with the advancement of technology Radioshack was to upgrade the products.
good,The work environment was hectic and stressful. The manager was on everyone's case even when we were doing out jobs properly. It was management that drove me away more than anything else.
good,"Job was pretty standard as far as a typical retail gig goes, my first manager was amazing and one of the best i'v ever worked for, but after she left the company she was replaced by several managers over the next few years that didn't seem to car about employees and where unrealistic in sales goals. These sentiments where echoed by upper management. Holidays where always required and risk of termination. At one time everybody was told Thanksgiving we would all have off, only for 2 weeks beforehand to change their minds and to say if people didn't come in they would be fire, even if they bought plane tickets etc."
good,"this one job i miss more than anything. Amazing customer base,fun work environment, company provided tech, and just over all job happiness. wish it was still around."
good,Radioshack was a fun job and I had access to resources to learn a lot of new skills while I worked there. It was a shame the company had to go under the way it did.
good,Es bueno como primer empleo ya que el desarrollo laboral es lento y poco benefico.
good,"RadioShack, like most retail outfits has some strengths and some weaknesses as far as a company to work for. They closed their doors a few years ago, I still believe that the dependence on cellular services led to the collapse. Regardless, it is a tough time for what we call “Brick and Mortar” businesses."
good,i learned a lot but they need people. it was always busy. the hardest part of my job was doing everything buy myself and wanting everything done in time. the most enjoyable part of my job was people. i loved the people coming in. the mall was always busy. i made sure my customers left happy
good,"Upon becoming a manager at Radioshack, they take away your commission, going to salary only, meaning, basically, that you take on more responsibility, but make less money than when you were an Assistant Manager.  Granted, your salary is larger than what your base was as an assistant, but if you are a good sales person, you will make less without your commission.  That is why I left, but it must be said that it was educational, and I did get promoted very quickly.  For my first job, it wasn't bad going from part time seasonal sales associate to store manager within a year...  Not the typical experience, probably, but it was mine."
good,Was promoted to key holder within a year. Had a fantastic manager/supervisor who believed in educating his fellow associates to sell big ticket items. Hourly pay and commission was terrible however.
good,"I worked while the company was in a decline (since closed), despite our store doing well there was no opportunity to move ahead since they did not have the resources. I was able to become supervisor and managed the store as most employees did not want the responsibility and did not take their job seriously."
good,Very busy during holidays. Under staffed and that led to more work per employee and manager. Low security. Conflicted with educational hours. Good as a part-time job.
good,"They are closing them all soon. Really enjoyed the people, the upper management was terrible. They only looked out for themselves. Even the severance packages were kept!"
good,"When I started, the training was unbelievable! I was flown all over the country for weeks at a time for training workshops, and I have them to thank for the foundation that I have built my professional career upon."
good,"Fun work place, dealing with customer was always fun but sometime can stressful when customer can't get what they want. Everyone was friendly and kept the job fun"
good,"It many be hard at first to learn everything in the store, but it's nice to learn new things. Electronics from the older days to now and how the world has updated their phones, speakers, computers, etc."
good,It was family owned and well all work as a team really nice people. We did car stereo install and also home antennas it allowed some outside work which is always nice.
good,"A typical day consisting of meeting metrics on different products sold such as batteries, and wireless accessories.  "
good,"I liked working for RadioShack as long as it lasted, it is a convenient job for a student, but not for someone who wants to provide for a family, since they are paying only minimum wage."
good,"Typical day helping customers with handheld devices, a lot of other electronics as well, most enjoyable part of the job was making everyone was happy !"
good,Radio Shack is no longer in existence. It was a good temp job for me on and off for five years though and I would recommend it for a part-time student if it were still around.
good,"In Michigan I had great management and stores and other employees worked together, once I moved to Georgia the management seemed not to care and the employees were cut throat and stole customers from each other."
good,managment can be a better but over all compaany is very good to work for has lot of growning opportunites that you can take in an move up an learn from
good,"Worked there for 10 years. I’ve heard stories about management and such but I was lucky, I guess. My manager became my DM and he seemed to really care about the employees. I met a lot of people that I still talk to today. The pay could’ve even better but what do you expect in retail? Black Friday’s weren’t that bad...long hours but if you worked with good people, it went by fast. I would recommend it if they were still in business...the hours were pretty flexible. The benefits were expensive but you aren’t required to enroll. The discounts were decent and you had downtime which made it easier to play with all the new gadgets first."
good,it was a great job but the sales goals were exceedingly difficult to meet because our product pricing was not competitive with the surrounding stores.
good,"A typical day at RadioShack included working behind the counter as a sales associate, as well as day to day tasks to maintain the stores cleanliness. Counting the money in the register and making bank deposits was also a big part of my job. The workplace environment was very friendly, motivating and uplifting."
good,I enjoyed working for RadioShack. Customers were very loayal and made going to work a joy. The people I e worked with were amazing and so was the manager. Very helpful and always willing to jump in and help you out of you were in need of it.
good,Was a good company with alot of potential to work for at its highest point. Priority was expertise over value and the company was very slow to institute any change.
good,Worked here for a short stint and felt like I did more work than compensated for. The pace of the job is very slow and quite. The company seemed to care more about its products then the people actually working to sell them
good,"you meet a lot of very interesting people and learn a lot about the things they are looking for and why they need it! also your always busy, and you get to try out all the new gadgets!"
good,"Worked myself ragged for a year at 70 hrs a week, but the pay checks and commissions kept me going.  Too much competition made the company dive, along with horrible upper management."
good,Employee experience at beginning of tenure was fantastic but bad leadership made terrible decisions that put company in position it is now. Grew up inside the company so I will always be appreciative of my time with them.
good,All Radioshacks are closing and I don't even know why I'm doing this review. I worked at Radioshack for a year until my manager threatened to slit my throat. The End.
good,"When I first started working with this company (Radioshack not general wireless ) is was a  great time to learn how sale. Also work With others (employees) up close and personal which build friendship with others, also by working with this company it really help bring out my competitive  side of me which played a part in my high sales and great customer service ."
good,Company is In Bankruptcy. Company was  and has been a staple in the consumer electronic industry. 95 years to be exact. Company associates aere among the most dedicated I have ever had the pleasure of working with.
good,"Started out well enough- was able to help people with hardware & software issues, but if you didn't sell cell phones, you were chewed out by District Management."
good,This franchise was poorly managed and disorganized. Proper training   was not givin for high tech store items. Daily work days were more likely to be stressful.
good,Great learning environment to hone one's skills as a salesman yet not a very high pay and not a good system in place to prevent employees stealing your commissions on your day off.
good,"RadioShack started out as an okay place to work. The biggest issue came when they started pushing phone sales. Now I could sell phones so that wasn't the issue, pushing phones left little room for hobbyist, which lost business."
good,"Radioshack is a decent place to work. There is minimal training when it comes to electronics, so being experienced with them will go a long way when working here. The company only really cares about sales, but in order to sell, customers will expect you to have an understanding and knowledge of products."
good,"For young kids working for the first time, it's great. Especially those who need to learn how to deal with people or have social anxiety. Management at the local level is usually nice, but the higher up you go, the worse it gets."
good,The days are easy. I learned how to better manage cash and work with customers. The management could use a little organizing. The hardest part of the job was juggling store duties with customer care.
good,The product Radio Shack was selling in their stores was very difficult to sell because it was just TOO out of date.  We made most our sales off pre paid phones.
good,A typical day would be to review and intercepts defective products before getting out to the customer. Then work with the vendor to correct the undesirable aspects of the product before moving it on to the stores.
good,Worked there in college. Mostly sell cell phones and plans. That's where all the money is. Once you get to management it falls apart. It's all old school guys who have been there forever and didn't want to change anything.  That's why they had to sell and close so many stores.
good,"Very little room for upward mobility, such as to move into higher management positions. This was a very fun, nice environment, where one can learn a tremendous amount about electronics."
good,"This is the job that gave me the foundation on which to build my ability to sell. They taught me how to ask for a sale, to ask open ended questions, and how to close. There was a high turn over rate so loyalty was highly praised. Overall it was a great first experience in sales."
good,"I returned to this company after two years with another due to the enjoyment I got out of the position I had.  Formerly Radio Shack was a fun place to work with monthly contests and incentives.  They rewarded your work and I felt it was easy to move up.  When I returned, the company held on to those values for the first couple years.  When the CEO changed, the fun and rewarding atmosphere was replaced by the stresses of job insecurity and high pressure sales practices.  The company was unwilling to spend money on the stores and employees resulting in unhappy employees and loss of sales.  After terminating nearly all upper management and cutting benefits of lifelong employees, the stores closed quickly.  The few that remain are not much more than Sprint stores with batteries."
good,"Opening and closing the store was enjoyable for me but then again that was a longtime ago. Co-workers were great to work with, only bad part was taking care of customer complaints."
good,"I loved Radio Shack, I advance to manager position in 2 Months, Long hours, but rewarding, Great managers, Great Location, but I moved to Las Vegas...."
good,Great place to work for. The employee discount as great especially around the holiday season. And the employee recognition packages were definitely a way to keep us working hard and loving our jobs.
good,"This workplace is closed now, but if you must know, a typical day of work included me stocking shelves, dusting, and handling transactions. The management was my father so I had a pretty easy time. The hardest part of my job was dealing with difficult customers. The most enjoyable part of my job was the long breaks I could take."
good,"better than it was before the changeover. pay isn't that great, and management makes alot of promises that they don't intend to keep, though it's still a good starter job."
good,"productive place for work, great place to learn customer service skills and techniques, also how sales operations work"
good,This was a fun work place. I had great co-workers. I learned a lot about customer service and different type of appliances including cell phones and cell phone services.
good,"Busy work days, in all time,lots of interaction with the customers on a daily basis.Great management team. Great co-workers."
good,"Excellent place to work if you have a love for electronics and even more so if you enjoy A/V setup."
good,It is a very relaxed environment and you have a lot of down time.  Don't have a lot of support from higher management though.
good,"I worked here for 8yrs and it was great!"
good,This was a good place to learn about electronics and begin selling to the public however it could be long hours for the pay.
good,I go to the district office and pick up all the new promotions study up on them and drive store to store teaching the in store sales associates so that they can implement and emulate what I brought to them so the stores can further excel.
good,"Show up early, update planner, check sales from the day before, check our up against sales and assign goals for those working that day, check company memos, check email, load cash in drawer, make sure registers are working, walk through the store and look for anomalies, follow up with previous days tasks and make sure all are done. Now, open the store for the customers.  Sell what we can and the rest of the day play tech support.  Help customers with what they need and offer our deals to them as well.  Attempt to take a lunch break if we aren't busy so we don't have to leave the one other person vulnerable in the store.  Usually an afternoon conference call (put the phone on mute and listen as best you can with customers in the store trying to talk to you).  Assign tasks for the evening to the associates that will be closing the store.  Try to leave at 6 when the schedule says but something will keep me there. Phone call, customer, DM, play catch up on paperwork from a vacation or day off, typing up employee reviews are just a few things that would keep me from going home on time. "
good,"nothing to crazy other being able to watch sports while at work, depending on store might have a good or bad manager. no benefits"
good,"The most enjoyable part of the job had to be helping most of the customers. Sure you would get the occasional difficult customer that seemed like the only thing that makes them happy, is making your job as hard as it can be, but those don't happen often. My co-workers were great but the upper management was not the best communicators. I had to find out, almost daily, about what was happening at the corporate office from our customers who had read about it on various news reports. Instead of finding out from upper management, I found out that the company was closing thousands of stores through our customers"
good,"In-store managers were mostly down to earth and friendly."
good,"everything and anything you had to transition to a bigger sale, it enhanced my knowledge of newer electronics but was very poor in stock and communication.  managers always had anyone's back in sales assists, and always helped recommend products that may otherwise been left out upon attempting to recommend the complete solution.  very competitive work environment and was always a challenge trying to outsell your co-workers.  but the most fulfilling thing was once a sale was made and the customer was happy with their purchase, the sense of satisfaction that came along afterwards knowing that you made their life more enjoyable"
good,"Working at RadioShack's Estate Department had it's daily challenges, lots of internal politics, micro management and fear of being laid off at a moments notice.  I saw 48 people come and go in the Real Estate department, most went on to do better things in life.  I was told I was too nice to landlords but I was always a leader in deal count.  When I started management was very passionate about how the company was ran, towards the end all the passionate people had been let go and outsiders brought in to bring the company down.  I saw the future and got out while the getting was good."
good,"The typical day starts at 10am for the opening shift."
good,"Management and compensation were poor, due to unstable leads of position to low unexpected wage fluctuation, rendering with poor store moral. Although pay and management did lack there attention to detail was accurate and manner with clients and customers experience far exceeded its expectation."
good,"I feel as though this job experiance could have been 10x better."
good,"A typical day at RadioShack involved showing up to work 15 minutes early and then deciding whether to begin dusting the shelves or immediately helping customers. Since I worked in a rather small town (10,000 people) the business would come in waves and would require you to drop whatever you were doing to assist the customer."
good,"A typical day at work would consist of checking inventory as well as pricing. I would also be responsible for checking company emails for any changes in pricing, and other things. My manager was great, he was extremely knowledgable and was always willing to help me out. My co-workers were great! We were more of a family then employees. The hardest part was having to deal with angry customers, I always hated having to be the bearer of bad news when it came to certain scenarios. The most enjoyable part was also the customers. I loved getting to know each and every one of them. It also made them more comfortable to see a face the recognized and knew that everything would be taken care of properly."
good,"Upper management made some poor decisions in the past 2 years or so that caused many of the stores to be forced to close. Other than that the experience was good. Had a good relationship at my store with my employees and customers. "
good,While working at Radio Shack I was able to gain valuable skills in customer service and sales while working in a field which I enjoyed.
good,"Enjoyed my job with company, learned a lot about working independently and with others.Hardest part was trying to get carriers to pay freight claims, Most enjoyable part was working with the people.  I will miss working for RadioShack. I believe RadioShack tried hard to take care of their people."
good,Overall great place to work. Strong upper management team. Great atmosphere. Customers heavily rely on my team and I for tech help and general advice. You feel appreciated by your customers at Radioshack.
good,"It was a wonderful first job and I did learn a lot. However, I don't feel that they really looked out for their employees. Advancement only happened if it benefitted them and frankly I feel that the company is a sell out and that is why they are going out of business. They should have stayed true to who they were. I listened to the customers all of the time and this was they opinion as well. I did not enjoy the job. It was a job. I took it seriously and showed up on time everyday and worked hard, but that was all. I absolutely loved my boss however. She is the best boss I will probably ever have and I still keep in contact with her. Management was about the company and not the employee. They would not tell us anything about the company closing. They just quietly pushed us out the door, which is how I lost my job. The hardest part of the job was the pressure they out on us to sell. If we didn't sell a certain amount, they threatened to fire us. But we were selling phones to people who don't come to RadioShack for phones. They didn't want to buy them and it was extremely difficult. My co-workers were good people, none of them bad. One co-worker in particular became one of my closest friends to this day.  A typical day at work was checking out customers when they're ready to buy, sell to them, clean the store, check for repairs, accept shipment, put it on the shelves, etc."
good,"I can say I am a tech geek and I loved my radio shack experience. I got a chance to be me, learn a lot and stay updated on today's and future technology. I enjoyed making each customers day whether they came in happy or sad they still left out with a great customer experience. I found myself become a leader. They have a lot of lazy employees. If you are not into technology or sales this job is not for you. However if you love technology and or are a natural at selling then lazy employees will be no problem for you. Just be the leader and everyone else will follow."
good,"I would open the store count the money drawer file some paper work make sure the store looked presentable before opening. When the store opened i helped whatever customer came into the store whether it was helping them find a battery or activating a cell phone. Usually my store wasn't busy so if there was a shipment of items i would accept those and put them out."
good,A typical day consisted of waiting around for a costumer to come in while also trying to price the entire store with truing to restock the entire shelves. Which was alright but some employees didn't do all the work and you would end up getting blamed.
good,A typical day at work for me was interesting. Never the same thing twice. I had a lot of responsibility at Radio Shack. I learned that there are more things to retail than just clothes and shoes. Management was very easy to work for. My co-workers were great. The hardest part of the job was dealing with people who didn't understand return policies. The most enjoyable part of the job was helping people. Having a great product knowledge helped me out a lot.
good,"The job itself was good. Rarely had any customer issues and most people who worked with me were always satisfied and happy. Even had them laughing hard at times too. Company wise however the dynamics changed so much. I was with Radio Shack for two years and at first it was not too bad of a job. But the constant intra company changes were too much and the company itself basically shot themselves in the foot. If you're not looking for too too much pay and benefit wise then go for it. Otherwise, I'd stay away because who knows what will become of the company within the remainder of the year."
good,I was taught about many brands and product I've never been in contact with before. Found great ways to be attentive to costumers and sell high priced items with knowledge about them.
good,"Retail is an art, not a science. It is the art of having a conversation. In my tenure at Radio Shack, I have learned that what separates the brick and mortar stores from e-commerce, what really draws in customers, is the associate. It is the individual that has knowledge that pulls people into stores and keeps them coming back as loyal customers. It is the ability to have a conversation with another human being that will listen to your questions and help you with answers you never existed. This is both the hardest part and most enjoyable part of the job. Helping people find solutions to their problems is truly gratifying, but it can be the most trying. Sometimes the answer to a question is 'no' and no one likes to hear that response. Such is dealing with the public. A competent and well trained staff is worth the added expense to a customer, and inspires brand loyalty in a way that will never be matched by the online retail experience."
good,"A typical day at work consists of helping many different customers with their technological needs. We would help to activate or upgrade phones from many major carriers, help with DIY projects, come up with ways to simplify household devices, and more. During my time at Radioshack, I really learned a lot about technology that I would have never known before. This is a company in which I had the ability to learn something new EVERY SINGLE DAY. I also learned different skills to help me manage a sales team and make sure to drive sales and try to reach set goals. My co-workers (for the most part) are very knowledgeable with today's technology and we are always willing to help each other. We work in a team environment in which everyone works towards success as a whole. Honestly, the hardest part of the job is having to try to adapt to many different customers throughout the day but the most enjoyable part is when you know you were able to really help someone."
good,"Ones day could be busy or slow, either way expect to spend long periods of time with customers.  Many times costomers dont not know what they want/need. Expect to help them find in-sotre solutions. I feel Radio Shack as a brand is trying to ""keep up with the Jones's"" in the industries, and because so, its employees suffer. I learned much about technological products and services through the power-point training exercises. Management could range from competent to idiot-savant I think you just have to be with the company long enough. You may expect the same with co-workers. The hardest part of the job is spending hours on the phone with phone companies attempting to connect cell phones. The most enjoyable part...."
good,"My days of working here were fairly easy and even sometimes fun. Everyday I would help customers find exactly what they were looking for and then proceed to check them out. But I also had to inform my employees when it was time to clean the store, pick up litter outside, restock the store, planogram, and take out the trash. I also had to go through alot of training in order to do that job. I learned so much working here in my field I'm wanting to go into, including the details of phones I was selling, how all the product works, and how to set up phone plans and paying peoples phone bills. The management was fair to say the best, although if you try to transfer to another store, you will never work for that company ever again no matter how hard you try. My co-workers were very half and half, meaning half were kind and relaxing, and the other half were depressing and frustrating. The hardest part of the job was definitely having to work with my manager. While the most enjoyable part was talking to my other coworkers while their were no customers in the store."
good,"A typical day at work is helping customers with any electronic issues. I've learned more about cell phones, electronics, etc. Management was okay but was a bit unfair to some employees. Co-workers were fine. The hardest part of the job was trying to cell phones every work shift. Most enjoyable part of the job was learning more about cellulars."
good,"Too little pay for the amount of work, knowledge, and stress required. Corp management doesn't know what it takes to do the job.  It is fun to do some of the work but most of expectations set on the team are too high"
good,"A typical day consist of ringing out customers, answering phone calls related to products or troubleshoot tips, activating/upgrading wireless retailers, clean/rearrange the store."
good,"A typical day consists of helping customers find what works best for them. I learned that patience is key to any task. The manager for my store is a great guy to work for. As is the District Manager."
good,"Hours: 48 hours a week with 2 days off."
good,its a nice environment to work. very laid back. they pay minimum wage plus commission. its an ok job for someone who wants to have a career in the sales business
good,"End of day transaction summery, marketing initiative, product sales. I learned a lot about technology, wiring various components, and overall more mechanically and technically inclined. Management was good and supportive. The people I worked with had very good people skills. The difficult part of the job was inventory, we had to count everything in the store. The best part of the job was employee discount on things such as cell phones and various items."
good,"I learned about a lot of technology that most of the public does not understand today, mostly due to technology being handed to us rather then us building our own. Had a great team to learn and work with."
good,"Company changes policy's and services so much its hard for anyone to keep up with, plus they don't inform you of the changes until you've been doing it wrong for a while and then say ""oh by the way you are doing it wrong."" "
good,"Gave me the ability to learn more about the new inovation of technolgy, great one on one customer experience and managment skills. Motivate me to learn more about management skills."
good,"Company asks management to reach goal that cant be reach for there store. Customers assume that you are trying to sell them something cause you will get rich off of it, which is farthest thing from the truth. In fact associates only make very little. On the plus side lots of cool technical things to learn. Being taught different sales strategies and ways to approach a sale. If you ever make it into management you will overtime know how to run your store as if you own it your self."
good,"Days can drag on or be very hectic depending on location. Company is sales and metric oriented. Easy job, most customers are great. Good job if you like talking to people and like technolgy."
good,it's a fun place  to work. Great if you like dealing with electronics. the is pay not so good. it needs better management
good,"RadioShack has been a big part of my life learning retail. It has helped me with customer service, learn how to ask open and closed questions while processing a transaction, and helped me learn more about inventory, price audits, and stocking. The co-workers are fun, optimistic, but they have a difficult time adjusting to the store I am located. The hardest part is to work 40+ hours when they only put me as a part timer. Usually, a part time associate can only work 32 hours or lower. We only have three people at the store and when my manager is off, it is only me and my technician. When my technician is working on repairs, I am on the sales floor on an average of 5 hours by myself. The most enjoyable part of the job is being a technician and a part time sales associate because it helped me learn more about the responsibilities on how to market and help people with their needs at the same time."
good,"productive workplace, very stressful, neatly organized, crazy hours, interesting place, great items."
good,all management cared for was to hit the numbers they wanted. not anything else.
good,"It is a good job but being located in the Mall,we really don't get any business. Everyone is cool,just a bit quiet. Overall, the store is a great store.I learn something new everyday."
good,"On most days at Radio Shack I would work the closing shift, usually from 1 to 9. I would be on my feet either selling to customers, or if the store was empty, restocking the shelves and back room. Very little down time but the fast pace kept all employees up beat and spirited. Team work was very high among our sales force and I learned to work quickly and efficiently with each member of our team. My manager and assistant manager worked off of each others strengths, one leading in sales and the other leading in procedure.The hardest part of the job was usually inventory, this would require at least two extra management personnel from district stores to come in and for all of us to count then most likely recount the entire store. Other than being tedious and time consuming this really was not all bad because our stock would reconcile and we could start fresh with tracking our sales data. The most enjoyable part of the job was easily the people i worked with and their willingness to step in and get the job done."
good,Daily hurdle with associates and a daily conference call with the DM letting you know about the required expectations.
good,loved working with the co workers i was with there. I was a bilingual sales associate there so i got ot talk to alot of different people. The most ejoyable part of my job there was the people. i love being able to help people
good,"a typical day at work would be me walking in early to see no manager on the days they are actually supposed to be there, no planograms done so I would end up doing thing them all to keep things in order. I learned how to take control of a situation when I have a lot of customers and no help. my management was very lazy  and always late. My co-workers were very friendly but they had little knowledge of the job so I would always end up either helping them or doing the work for them to get it done faster. The hardest part of my job was having to be antagonized by very angry customers for my co-worker's mistakes. The most enjoyable part of my job was helping out customers who appreciated it."
good,"We don't have many customers come in,  but when we do it's nice because we work as a team. Co-workers are pretty cool for the most part. I learned new things about technology, I learned that my communication skills could be better. The hardest part of my job is dealing with angry customers. The most enjoyable part of my job ist meeting new people."
good,"A day at work would be slow nights with little to no business. I learned Planogram's, How to use the computers to activate phones through the top pre and post paid wireless carriers, I got better at customer service and my selling skills. I normally worked with one other person and it made the night go by easier and made it fun, you could split the work up and get a lot done or your co-worker can be beneficial in selling a phone or accessories also. The hardest part was the constant change on the computers and the way things were sold it made it less pleasant. I enjoyed making the extra money from the phones sold and also helping a customer and making them happy or feel more informed."
good,"help customers with questions they may have, ive learned about a lot of technology oriented things that i never knew before, my management team in reno was fun and awesome, but my management team in vegas were mean and not fun to work with, i loved my coworkers in both locations, the hardest part of my job was trying to get people to buy a new phone, the most enjoyable part was being able to do plannograms and rearrange the store"
good,"I opened the location completed payroll and time cards.  I completed inventory checks, banking and set sales goals for each day.  I reviewed all employees progress and determined what needed extra efforts.  I had 5 total employees who I enjoyed working with daily."
good,High pressure to sell attachments and extended warranty. As manager I work over 55 hours a week and am on call everyday.
good,"I like the people I work with but the company doesn't seem to show much love to the ones who work harder and have more knowledge. It's great that there are legitimate advancement opportunities, but the people that get promoted aren't too deserving. It could just be the store I worked at, but they make it seem like it's a felony to request a weekend day off."
good,Working at RadioShack taught me how to work in a sales environment and needing to hit company targets. Hardest part of the job was the fact that the company changed those targets to often.
good,"While I worked with them for 18 months things never seemed to get better. We were always penalized for things that were out of our control and never recognized for the good things that we did. My co workers were amazing, I've never worked with such a great team of people before. Almost everyone was willing to help with issues when a problem had come up. The most enjoyable part was being able to deal with the customers that came in. Sure we had bad customers every now and again but the amount of genuine people we had come in was fantastic. The pay was bad though, there was no room for raises, and you were making barely enough as a manager."
good,"Working for radio shack is a great opportunity to learn many things about cell phones and other electronics. However, depending on who the district manager is depends on how the district flows. I had horrible experience with my district manager not understanding that I had children to think about in certain situations and that I wasn't single like the majority of the other managers. I did have a good time learning about different things and how they could help my customers and using them and what them change the way my store ran as a whole. I enjoyed teaching other people weather it be customers or new employee's how electronics we sold work and could work for them. Overall, I loved my job just not the politics."
good,"Radioshack is in the top 5 of the worst places to work list. I had a great manager so it made work doable, but there was no room for growth. I had no interest in becoming a manager because of the severe lack of freetime. After 52 hours, you did not receive overtime no matter how many extra hours you worked."
good,Very nice company that can teach you alot. Good place to work if you are starting out as entry level for corporations. You can learn alot about the retail world and being competitive.
good,A lot of what separates Radio Shack employees from employees of other electronics stores staff is the extensive training and thereby knowledge of the products in the store.  I enjoyed solving the problems that the customers were facing whether it was a simple problem with a battery installation in a phone or a more complex demonstration into soldering for an old transistor radio.  I enjoyed the people I worked with but I can't get over the fact that I believe as a company they are moving to slowly to keep up in the fast paced world of computers and high end technology.  I feel a slip happening due to the comfortability and familiarity of online shopping has proven to undercut any price we as a retail operation could offer.
good,"I'd spend the day helping customers find products they needed through a series of questions while doing planograms in between."
good,"It is a good business and you get whatever effort you put into it. As far as a sales associate you get paid hourly and also commission bonuses. Radio Shack's top priority is phone sales, and if you are not selling any phones then according to the district manager you will not be there very long."
good,I was the Assistant Manager at Radio Shack and worked there while I was attending college.  It was a fun and interesting place to work.
good,"make calls and sell, sell, sell. difficult to balance this job with school most managers aren't willing to work with schedule."
good,"Mainly just helping people find what they came in for, then try to sell them extra things to go along with what they buy. Co-workers can be helpful, but it is still about competition and making money for yourself and the company. The main product to sell is Cell Phones and plans, and how much you sell will let you know if it was a good day or not."
good,"did cashier most of the time.  Helped customers understand and learn more about phones and other electronics they were intrested in.  The hardest part of the job would be selling contract phones, a lot of people didnt want to sign up for a contract, they rather have pre-paid phones. "
good,"This was not a very demanding job at all. The day typically calls for extensive customer service, activating a phone or two, and making sure the store looks nice. While working at my first two locations, management was steady and I got along with them just fine. However, management was very unsteady during my final four months with the company. While my last store was in a different city than the first two, the store still only had a manager during January until he took another job, and the store ended up not getting another manager until April. Also, the pay rate changed constantly, at least four times since last July. I got along with all of my co-workers, many of whom trusted me dearly. I'd say that was the most enjoyable part of my day, getting to interact with my co-workers along with pleasing the customer to the point of great praise. The hardest part of the job has to be dealing with angry customers, simply because an irate customer comes in many different forms. From the calm yet angry customer to the very loud, obnoxious and angry customer, it is all negative due to the fact that a customer has been disappointed with either our service or somebody else's service from another store. However, we usually got the problem solved thoroughly. Overall, the job was not bad, just at times highly inconvenient. "
good,I liked working with my coworkers it was a good working experience for me. I learned a lot from working there
good,"Greeted customers. Interested them in services and products including warranties and accessories. learned and used prior knowledge of electronics, batteries, chargers, and other equipment. required to meet sales quota for store and cellular phone sales. answered phones and customer questions. Used and maintained register as well as work station."
good,Very busy work day with customer care i learned to work the pos system how to check in merchandise co workers where always friendly hardest part of the job would be the high volume of phone sales
good,"There are some things that are frustrating about Radioshack, but overall, it's a decent job and has decent hours if you don't mind working weekends. The customer base largely determines your sales and experience, so look into this if you are questioning whether or not to apply. Basic is minimum wage plus commission on phones and a few other items."
good,"Radioshack is rated by some surveys to be the 3rd worst company to work for in the U.S. My manger, on the other hand, was EXCELLENT, and kept me there for several years because I enjoyed working with him and his team. Locally the store I worked in is full of intelligent staff who know their stuff. Corporately Radioshack will squeeze every possible penny out of its employees, does not care one bit about turnover or burnout, and will pay you neither diddly nor squat for your time. Radioshack does NOT encourage its employees to learn and grown in their field, rather it serves up old fashioned 'training' programs aimed at an IQ of about 70 and generally wasting everyone's time. I hope the company does not die, but I would predict it is headed down a slippery slope into becoming little more than a cellphone kiosk much like other electronics stores. That's where the largest profit margins are perceived to be, which makes shareholders happy."
good,"Love my personal store but not much room for advancement, there is only advancement to management if you excel in sales even if you have no management qualities."
good,"I enjoyed managing a multi-unit retail establishment, I loved working with my team and coaching and training."
good,"I enjoy working for the company, but the pay isn't worth it. While you do get commission, base pay isn't even $9 per hour as assistant manager. Management above store level doesn't seem to care."
good,"Good starter job. I held this job at sixteen and worked for an incredibly rude, condescending manager. This made it very difficult. I was a high school student at the time, however, and they were flexible with my schedule. Very standard retail environment."
good,A normal store manger works about ten hours doing many jobs from sales to training.
good,"In this position there was an incentive to sell. If you are not a salesperson, then this job is not for you. The pay is ok but did not enjoy the job or the people that I worked with."
good,"Detroit location was a fast pace store, interacting with a loyal customer base everyday. Very easy to generate decent money on top of base pay via commission sales. I found this job easy to advance in. In no more of 2 months employment I became a key holding assistant manager. Training was also informative and quick."
good,Fun work environment but very poor financial compensation.
good,"Radio Shack has kiosks in Target selling contract cell phones. A typical day starts with opening the kiosk by checking cash drawer amount and making applicable deposits, checking stock and signage. After opening duties are complete the day is spent approaching Target customers and engaging them in cellular conversations. If a customer is interested and ready for an upgrade I find out what the best option for the customer is and make sure they walk away understanding how to work their new phone. If the customer is interested but not ready for upgrade I ask to take their information to file away and contact them at a later date. Store mangers are always willing to help and provide advice, both when I was an associate and as a new manager. District management is less helpful and will often ignore requests for help, whether it be for advice or finding stock to aide a customer. The hardest part working for Target Mobile is bringing in new customers. Radio Shack and Target can not come to an agreement on advertising, because of this Radio Shack and Target rely on store associates and managers to speak to as many customers as possible each day to spread that word that Target sells contract cell phones. While a lack of advertisement is one of the biggest frustrations for us as employees it also has its benefits. It forces us to speak to many different people each day and learn a little about the people who shop that location. Frequent shoppers will often stop by to say how much they love their phone, ask questions their recent purchase or just stop and chat."
good,"Wireless sales, a fast paced day. Calls and quotas must be met"
good,Typical sales job. I excelled at all points that I needed to.
good,Having been employed here for a few years it has been a very good learning experience. Its a fun atmosphere to work with where you encounter different situations on a daily basis.
good,"I liked being able to help customers find what they needed and help relate day to day tasks with items they could use and buy from the the store. I learned how to use some effective scheduling software. My co-workers were good people, I enjoyed there enthusiasm. The constant change in upper mangement was the hardest part and the best part was the commission added on to my pay check."
good,"Fun working place, good people, tough market, lots of competition, economy maybe effecting the company s strategic planing. All this collectively effects the satisfaction of employee."
good,"Starting out everything was great, goid pay steady business. Changes started being made, hours cut and xomission metruc system changed which meant less miney and a poorer work environment..."
good,Great place to work with opportunity for advancement and increases earning power.
good,"Grat job while in college, managers works with school schedule, but dont run into any problems. The company could careless about its employees"
good,"Radioshack is currently undergoing a culture shift designed to make it a more Work/life balanced environment. Currently Managers work 6 day weeks with a minimum of 51 hours. this will be changing to 5 days per week, but overall it is a good place to work."
good,"sold phones, it was hard to move up, district management wasn't very good, co workers were lazy, enjoyed talking to many different people"
good,"the job was horrible everyone in management basically is out for themselves, very racist enviroment, i was not aware until i worked in it."
good,"Gained alot of experience with my time employed by Radioshack, Only reason I left the job was because they went out of business, which was unfortunate."
good,"Company lost touch with customer base, and continued to make decisions that would further alienate the customers. That with a lack of marketing led to most people believing we were closed or about to be, years before this was the case."
good,When is we’re open was a good place to start. Good for a beginner job and good people to work with. Learned a lot about sales at my time there. Sad to see them close.
good,"Worked hard to achieve manager position, but because of my age, (I think) I was passed over.  I ran a number of stores at different times, promised the manager position, but was not promoted."
good,"While with RadioShack they were very quick to teach and promote within. You had the ability to not be too micromanaged while still having goals to hit. It taught me to focus, be self reliant, and helped me learn how to manage others as well as communicate effectively with my employees and customers."
good,"Are they still in business?"
good,"jornada larga, todas las prestaciones, bonos y comisiones"
good,"radio shack allow me to search for new opportunities, as well to allow my sales skills to improve. some coworkers were pretty lay back and easy going to interact."
good,"Radio Shack was nice place to work, but it went out of business."
good,"It's about what you may expect from retail work. Keep busy show up and be professional, treat customer's well. "
good,"I find it interesting that indeed is asking about what it was like to work at a company that went bankrupt years ago. It was a typical sales job. You got paid either just over minimum wage or by commission, whichever was higher.  Depending on which type of store you worked in determined what sort of clientele you dealt with, the more rural stores sold more in parts and radio pieces,  the mall store more cell phones."
good,"I have doubts the corporation has any stores around but while it lasted, management in corporate was poorly managed yet the sales associates were always fun to work with."
good,Radioshack was another great company to work for. I was fresh out of high school at the time and it was a great job for me. I learned how to sell items to customers even if they didn't want them.
good,Radio Shack was a nice place to work and shop.  Too bad they couldn't change with the time and stay in the electronics business.  I miss having them around to get electronic parts and other high end components that I knew would last.
good,"Learning everyday as well as contributing to a safe environment. Not stressful. The hardest part of the job was maintaining inventory of the store. However, I liked the boss."
good,"While Radio Shack was in business, it created a culture, that led to bad decisions in management, promoting unqualified people to positions of power. not keep up with the times, especially online. Radio Shack kept on doubling down on business practices that did not work. this is a major reason for their demiswe"
good,"I was constantly learning while on the job at RadioShack, always new and different types of electronics coming through that I'd have to learn about in order to sell."
good,"I had good management, not too many crazy expectations and good hours. The pay was minimal and the work was repetitive. There are no more Radioshack's left."
good,"RashioShack's culture provides an advanced technological workplace with a diverse background of employees.  I feel as though I learned much in my early career from Radio Shack,"
good,"I like helping customers everyday. I made sure the customers that, I helped left happy, so they would come back. If they would not be happy, then I would not be happy either. Until they were."
good,"Managers lead the way"
good,Company Closed so there is not much to say. It was great while it lasted. It was one of my first jobs and since then I have advanced well in the sales industry.
good,"I enjoyed the ongoing training of cutting edge electronics. "
good,"Then work place, typical day at work, what I learned, management, culture at work, hardest part of job and the most enjoyable part of the job were all average."
good,Company had great dynamic in employers yet the higher ups made huge mistakes which cost the company big time as they no longer exist anymore. Overall was a good experience.
good,"this company has now bankrupt, but when i was working for radio shack, i had one of my best days of making money. it was a fun environment and the customer base varied from kids coming in to buy toys to older folks coming in for transistors radios. Absolutely miss working for radio shack"
good,This is a sales driven work place. If you don't like sales then this is not the career for you!  Management is understanding if you need a day off. Work life balance is good.
good,The Radio Shack Sales associate position is a great position for someone wanting to learn about new electronics coming out and play with the new devices. Though the company could use some restructuring with upper management to keep the business up and bring out products that are desired to be sold.
good,"Don't think it's around anymore, but I enjoyed my first job as an associate. I liked learning about new electronics. Decent job to begin working at after high school."
good,was a great place to work until the closed the majority of their stores and was let go based on the lack of stores left and needed to part ways with me.
good,i would have to say that the hardest part of working at radioshack was definitely the theft problem. maybe it was the location of the store that i worked at but we would deal with theft every week.
good,This place always hired good quality people and made sure their employees knew the products they were selling. Unfortunately that's a benefit that many take for granted because radioshack is now defunct.
good,"Radioshack was the best job I've had. It helped my learn about technology and grow my skills into customer service. Radioshack gave me a lot of returned investments. Although, It was stressful at time for the sales because of quotes that needed to met every month and the location of the store wasn't in the better location compared to our other locations in the area"
good,They put too much money into phones and lost market share. Closed almost all their stores. Now they sell gimmicky electronics instead of electronics they were known for having.
good,"I worked at RadioShack for about a year before they went bankrupt."
good,"The hardest part of working here was that you had no support. All decision had to be made on the fly, It was a 7 day a week job for management, I was on my phone 24/7 without reward."
good,"Open and close store, do daily deposits, set the daily goals"
good,While working at Radio Shack there were many things you could have been focusing on. Whether it was activating phones or selling people electric or connecting parts for different things.
good,A work day at radio shack was to make your sales. you get paid almost by performance. It was competitive but everybody learn to work together. Management was reliable and always help on the work floor. It was a nice starting point in sales.
good,A company with unlimited pay opportunities and good benefits. As a manager they had a great bonus incentive program with plenty of room for future growth potential
good,"As a sales associate, I was a key holder which included opening duties and closing duties as well as making bank deposits. I worked to help customers by creating solutions to their projects or ideas. I also worked the cellular sales and setups including activating and showing how to use their new device. I would also help reorganize product and set up for current sales or price changes. I did also offer my assistance many times to our other stores and did customer pickups all over the valley. I gained much technology knowledge and great people skills."
good,"Last CEO did a great job of comunicating and keeping people focused on the company's mission, but unfortunately the business model was overwhelmed by its competition."
good,"The job itself was ok, however after cell phone sales were removed from the stores you could tell sales were plummeting so it was a slow environment. Not long after many of the stores went bankrupt."
good,"We worked a lot of hours with decent pay, not the greatest benefits, and a boss that was a micro manager. And no option to earn or get PTO of any shape, form, or fashion."
good,RadioShack was a difficult place to work with some managers who made things rough for you and didn't really work around your school schedule. I enjoyed some employees but theyalways had drama and you couldn't say no to anybody there and it made work uncomfortable.
good,Unfortunately Radioshack filed for Chapter 11 Bankruptcy and left hundreds without jobs. I worked there for 4 years and got to work with professional people as well as develop customer problem solving skills.
good,"My boss was cool,work load was not hard,district manager was not so nice,loved the people i worked with,was fun dealing with most customers,lots of cool gadgets, very chill atmosphere when district manager wasn't harping down ur throat"
good,Radioshack taught me basic sales and was great in teaching customer service.  Not much oportunity for advancement but overall a good company.  No longer in business.
good,This position was great for a summer. I learned about the technology we sold and the other services we provided. I feel like my resume was increased from this one position.
good,excelente trabajo con grades conocimientos tecnológicos así como capacitaciones constantes sobre los artículos en venta
good,A Great Work Experience In The Electronic Department its Tough But once you get the Hang of Everything .It Gets Easier But the hours were Great an They Work Around Your School Schedule.
good,This was a great job to learn hands on customer service and sales. It was a very cutthroat environment and employees were not compensated well. And there is the minimum
good,It was a good idea to work here but they sermed to be short staffed on thier management with all of the disturbance in the store and the outside market.
good,"the actual company has gone bankrupt, so most of thm are closed now. But, when i worked there, my manager was extremely rude, and i worked holiday expecting the promised extra pay and never ended up getting it"
good,Everyday seemed to move very slow. The pay was okay compared to other phone companies and what they had to offer. Most of the time you were just showing people how to use things.
good,bankrupt why do I have to answer about a company no longer in business.................. now I have to add some extra stuff to just get through this. crazy...............
good,"Sadly the establishment no longer exists. While I was there the staff was focused on providing quality service to customers, despite so pretty testy situations."
good,"A Sales Rep may work 3 to 5 days per week.  Duties include all aspects of sales (presenting, closing, processing sales entry, handling cash, plus inventory listings, merchandizing and maintenance.  Careers in management are excellent for devoted, motivated sales-oriented people.  One deals with an intriguing cross-section of the latest electronic equipment (computers, mixers, stereos, TVs, etc.)"
good,"Radioshack is a tough electronic stores that pays minimum wage plus commission. However, the only way to make a decent living is to only sale post-paid phones and in someways we had to push the sales into customers who could afford it. Thus RadioShack no longer exists."
good,Radioshack was a great company - very structured and process oriented with a lot of qualified professionals working in every dept. Radioshack has closed down operations in several stores
good,"First job I've had ever.  Learned a lot while there.  Unfortunately, the company didn't thrive under competition.  RadioShack ultimately closed down in the locations I worked in."
good,"The corporate stores are closed, they laid off the assistants a year or two ago. I  preferred this job to full on manager; though at times I felt like the full on mamager."
good,"RadioShack for me was a fun relaxed job most of the time, customers were just as open to teaching you as you were to teach them. Though training was overwhelming, they had you learn so much that did not pertain to your store; so most of the time you were learning on the floor."
good,"Electronics, science, and technology are not only my skills, but also hobbies.  I enjoyed helping people with their issue, but made sure to  use vocabulary and associations they could understand;  This made them more comfortable"
good,"Coworkers were great, management was eh, pay was minimum wage plus commission which, given the nature of the company's business structure, didn't add too much to the pay check."
good,At the beginning of my time at RadioShack it was very good.  I enjoyed coming into work and the people I worked with.  At the end of my time there it was very stressful and unproductive.
good,"I was lucky to have a really good store manager at the time of employment, otherwise this would be a warning than a review.  Day in and day out, it wasn't about helping the customer, it was ""How many cell phones did you sale today?"""
good,to much computer training on information about cell phones and other topics about the things that were sold at the store. To many things to learn and a litlebit of training.
good,"Everything about Radioshack was awesome with the exception of my last year there. The company started going down hill, corporate management was constantly changing, and communication became poor. Before the decline within the company, it was a fun environment to work in! We competed in selling phones and having higher commission rates. Hours were based on sales and performance."
good,"not much of a great company to work for career wise was great while it lasted because i learned a lot , compensation was fair and the company was pretty fair and consistent"
good,"Easy to work there, just couldn't balance work and school well, I worked long hours and had no time to do homework or projects  that i was assigned through school. I was also transfered farther away than I needed to be and it got difficult to get there on time, even though I achieved that every time"
good,"Being a manager at this facility was fun, making sure everything was in place for the day and we had shipment for the week, scheduling and accommodating to everyone's needs wasn't easy but it was fun. As a team member, and not a manager, you must meet a percentage of sales to remain an employee, it was stressful and very cut throat but it was enjoyable. The goals by the DM was unrealistic for the amount of business we had."
good,"I learned a lot of new things at RadioShack and it was a good place to get work experience in retail sales and customer service. I usually maintained organization throughout the store, assisted customers, and was a cashier."
good,"Worked here for quite a few years, learned alot about managing people.  Radio Shack is now gone out of bussiness.  managers were forced to work 6 days a week and often times would be burnt out."
good,"Not much to say about this job, it was a pretty good place to work. Enjoyed working with customers and providing information about products. Great place to work temporarily, not necessarily great for a career."
good,this was a great place to work when they were selling phones. now I couldn't say haven't work for this company in years. But I loved my time there. Should open them back up
good,This was to long ago to describe. We worked with clients in a retail setting assisting them when they had questions regarding products in the store as well as products in the catalog for order.
good,"company filed bankruptsy closed all locations so there is no longer a company to work for stores are n  longer in business so there isn't any workday to give information about,"
good,is no longer open. company filed backrupcy. No stores are operating at the moment. the company was forced to close their doors due to lack of revenuew.
good,Typical retail store closed down back in 2014. Radioshack is a good company to work for however the company has disappeared. Sales commission is not really good at all.
good,Company was great to work at by helping customers find everything they need. I loved running my own store and training my employees. I have with this company through ups and downs but unfortunately the company went bankrupt months after I decided to leave to pursue job at best buy.
good,The employees that I worked with were wonderful.  My co-workers were the main reason for staying at RadioShack.  I am grateful for RadioShack giving me the opportunity to work there.
good,Worked as the store manager. did sales and talked with customers did the paperwork and deposits open and close the store trained associates .I really enjoyed it .
good,"Retail. Managed one store 60 hours per week> Sold alot of TV antennas and CB radios. Long time ago. Good company, fun, general public and electronics do not mix but."
good,Many stores have closed and I'm sure the way things are done has as well. Previously a store with medium traffic. Haven't visited a store in years to know what it is like
good,The company has gone under. There is no future for this company so please do not waste your time. they had their time but it has passed now so good luck finding any electronic parts
good,Not many people shop at radioshack anymore so days went by really slow with about 50 people max entering the store a day. Not much job oppurtunities to move up.
good,"Not much to say about this job, it was a pretty good place to work. Enjoyed working with customers and providing information about products. Great place to work temporarily, not necessarily great for a career."
good,"the company was great and what they stood for. I learned to fix phones and have weekly conferences. I enjoyed making my customers happy and they enjoyed leaving with a fixed phone, or I pad."
good,Radio shack isn't in business anymore but if it were it would be a good job for teens and early 20s while in college. Not a place I would wan to stay longer than a year
good,A majority of the people working there clearly did not want to be there. They only wanted the paycheck. No sense of passion or interest in their work.
good,"RadioShack is a very competitive in sales, fast paced environment. As it is a retail environment, the management had very high turn over, therefore inconsistent. High demand in time and holidays, not the most balanced culture."
good,There was room to grow. I enjoyed what I did there. I learned a lot and it was the best job I ever had. I learned customer service and how to work with a team to achieve goals.
good,"At RadioShack the management was very personable and team focused. Definitely had to be an on the floor leader than a back room officer. I loved my time working at RadioShack, but the home office management made poor business decisions that prevented the RadioShack format to be a profitable business."
good,"I was paid below minimum wage and they somehow got away with this by promising ""spiffs""- incentives for pushing specific products while hypocritically espousing the notion that RadioShack's mission is to make sure each customer gets what he or she wants."
good,All I did was answer phones all day. Talked to people thathat only had complaints & issues with their service or the company. The breaks were too short.
good,"This would have been great if the focus would have been more on sales and less on planograms. Some store managers were rewarded for having stores that looked great, but were not making a profit."
good,"Inventory review, organization, sales to bilingual customers. Opening and closing responsibilities, because the management trusted me after only a month of working there."
good,radio shack was very fair the management was very compelling and I was very fortunate to have such great leaders in my life to help me through some tough times.
good,"C'est lors d'une foire de l'emploi de le directeur de district a eu le flair de m'embaucher. 3 mois plus tard, j'étais assistant-gérant du magasin."
good,"Radio Shack was very flexible with my schedule as a full time student. The atmosphere was very inviting, yet slow at times. The most enjoyable part of the job was getting meet the unique customers"
good,"Its retail, what is there to question? most everyone knows how it works, not rocket science. sales is not for everyone but anything else anyone can do."
good,"this was the best job ive ever had. customers were great. every day i learned something new. customers were very passionate and help full in teaching the new employees about receptors, capacitors and led lights."
good,"very hit or miss. if you had a good team you'd do well, but one mediocre employee could throw off the entire store. upper management was useless and ceo made bizarre choices that showed a lack of understanding of the store level functions."
good,"Probably one of my favorite jobs I have had. Yet, there was little to no job security. I was told about important things in the company late at times. I had a great manager."
good,"Was first job and got great sales experience, but wasn't exactly was I was looking for in selling phones not the best compensation job for commission sales not to mention them going bankrupt"
good,This chain's inability to keep up with the times caused it's inevitable downfall. The pay was inadequate and the company was full of employees who knew their days were counted.
good,I worked for Radio Shack over 20 years ago.  My experience is too old to provide a fair and adequate review of the company.  I can say that it was a decent experience for a young person just out of college.
good,The higher up people don't know how to do there job. If they had new management and listened to there employees then they would still be in business. Otherwise my manager was a great one at that.
good,Normally we stocked things and took care of customers. Not too many came through which let you focus on your stocking more and get more items on the shelves
good,Radio shack was a decent job where I recieved a lot of knowledge about electronics and cell phones. I made a lot of sales there and some life-long friends as well. But the pay was not comensurate with the work load.
good,i worked at radio shack so shortly i don't remember much except that i was the first and only job that i have ever been robbed while i was working....
good,"sales and customer service enviorment, must meet goals to attain good commission check . minimum wage per hour plus commision. Its a great way to start  as a first job, opens the doors to other wireless service  providers."
good,Very fun place to work. Ability to be creative and contribute. Was very fast paced and energetic. Obviously the last few months were tough. Really grew as a professional there.
good,Like any other sales focused job theres a quota. This included the protection plans that no one wants and asking for emails no one wants to give. Oh and dont sell a cell phone without selling accessories with it unless you want uppermanagement on your case.
good,Learned a lot about different areas of sales as well as training on new electronics that would lead our culture in the near future. Great job atmosphere
good,A very fun place to work but difficult to make sales with the competition out there. Management changed often and compensation was very hard to follow at times.
good,"Company filed bankruptcy in Feb 2015 and again in Feb 2017. Was laid off as part of company store closings. The job was typical regional LP work - store visits and audits, operational controls, investigations, etc."
good,"Loved the work, customers, and products. It was rewarding and fun. The unfortunate thing is their business model. The partnerships they have made and the ripple effect it created are insurmountable. I only wish that this company was as awesome as its concept."
good,"There were plenty of times that there was absolutely nothing to be done in the store. The worst part, the reason why I rated it with only 3 stars, was the fact that they never gave any raises, even if it was a promotion."
good,"Unfortunately a bad managerial system. Theft. There was no tracking of sales, inventory. The schedule was nice. Commission on sales. Extra hours of work."
good,I loved working for radio shack! it use to be the go to store for everything from batteries to lab top computers. But in the end poor management lead to the faith of radio shack.
good,"The company is great to work for. However, it is a sale driven company and there's a lot of competition which I was great at. I just can't continue to work for sales because it takes on a great deal time to persist a customer to purchase something they don't necessarily need."
good,RadioShack was a good place for me. I am sad that today's culture has led to the demise of this business model. I don;t know if it can be revived. Thank you
good,"Daily routines consisted of common duties with any retailer. Cash handling, customer service, sales and merchandising. Consistent learning on new tech and products."
good,The company is a good concept but fails to be competitive in pricing. Without pricing being competitive they company struggles to hold on to customers from competitors both online and in box store retail.
good,"RadioShack was very laidback and fun to work at although the management and upper level executives were very friendly, they did not check on employee progress or training."
good,"This is an OK job for someone who is just starting to work. They pay minimum wage. The schedule changes every week. I had a manager who seemed nice at first but after a while I realized that he was a bit arrogant. I noticed a trend in his behavior because if an attractive customer would come into the store the manager would be ""extra friendly"" and if a less attractive customer would enter the store then he would not attempt to assist them and would send any other associate over to help the customer. I'm pretty sure not all managers act like that within the company but it is sad that I had to take direction from such a pretentious person."
good,you meet a lot of people and can easily get annoyed sometimes with the unrealistic demands of your superiors but other than that its a pretty chill spot to work
good,I barely remember wqhat it was like working at Radio Shack. It wasn't even paid work. I was just an intern that was learning the way of the working world.
good,"Closed our location, laid off all employees. Easygoing town and a bit of a sleepy job, but the community was fun to be around. Sort of an odd blend of IT work and sales position."
good,"Radio Shack is going out of business currently and if you entered a store before the end became apparent, I am sure you understand why it went the way that it did."
good,"My duties as a Supervisor were to secure company merchandise. I was responsible for maintaining the store, training new employees, promoting sales, customer service, and meeting the criteria of company protocol. I was responsible for exceeding sales goals and continuing company profit."
good,"i loved my job because of the client base, i was challenged by customer inquiries and coworkers.  i definitely stayed busy without a moment to spare time wise.  sad to see it go"
good,Working for the company you see a few questionable sales tactics by the company. The metrics they set for each employee to obtain are also pretty questionable. Since they are set by nation standards not individual store or store region.
good,"Typical day at work involved customer service, shipping/receiving, retail store management, P&L daily/monthly reviews."
good,"Great opportunity to learn about electronics and other gadgets. Sometimes customers were great, some were unpleasant. Great people to work with. Job is best for college students."
good,"A typical day at work for me starts with checking the refunds from the previous days, setting up employees goals for the day, check previous day performance and work on what metrics need improvement for that day/week/month."
good,"This was a decent job after a major move to help me get on my feet from moving from TX to PA. Again I do not remember all my usual duties, but it was a start to some wireless experience."
good,"Radioshack was a pretty good company to work for but couldn't keep business afloat and in the midst of the collapse of many of their establishments couldn't keep their employees satisfied with incentives that would motivate and benefit the empoloyees. A typical day of work would involve all aspects of fluidly running a retail electronics store, from merchandising to sales execution to loss prevention. The management team would do their best to keep the small staff motivated and sales up even in the decline of the volume of customers. The hardest part of the job was meeting the sales goals provided with practically no to very little foot traffic visiting the stores. The most enjoyable part of the job was getting to truly connect with the customers that walked through our doors and learning how to build customer relations beyond their sales needs."
good,"Friendly co-workers and staff but unfortunately that's the only good thing to say about this job. Pay is horrible, management is clueless and job is more focused on selling cell phones than actually attending the customers needs. It's no wonder why the business is folding"
good,Ok for now!  Work 8 to 10 hours a day by your self waiting on customers. Also handling cash and stocking merchandise. Demoing new items to the customers and up selling products.
good,"Typical sales associate position. Wear a uniform, talk nicely to the customers, etc... Not much room for advancement, though."
good,"At Carl Zeiss, the culture was amazing, hard worker, dedicated employee. I learned a different aspect of the work environment which exposed to a lot of posibilities"
good,"I meet people and help their electronic needs. Hardest part sometimes is understanding their problems, the best part is when we can solve their problem. Radio Shack has offered the public a variety of products and services from day one. Danny Fox is one of the best managers I have ever worked for in retail sales and I have learned so much from his experiences with electronics."
good,"The old RadioShack was a great place to work.  Times did get tough and they had to file for bankruptcy.  Don't have General Wireless full you, they are not a better RadioShack just have more money."
good,Are used to work here if you years ago. Things have changed before it was just Radioshack and Radioshack and Sprint. It was a relaxing work environment. Managers were cool.
good,"Radio Shack is a fun a sales competitive place to work! I enjoyed speaking to different people from all walks of life and helping them. When the had questions, we definitely had answers!"
good,"Before the company filed for bankruptcy, it was a great place to work, helped customers find the right product for them, set them up with a new cell phone, and kept the visual merchandising in order. However, after the bankruptcy, the foot traffic dropped drastically, making my job security scarce."
good,"The commission decreased to the point it wasn't worth it anymore. The hours got cut, all the good sales people and good managers left the company because it is a dying company."
good,i didnt enjoy working there company is not good at all. im discourage for the type of job i was there to do . managers were not professional at all. district manager bad
good,Use to be a great place to work back in the day but things have change a lot since they file bankruptcy but General Wireless is trying to change things around
good,A typical day at Radioshack would be just playing with toys after the store is clean waiting for customers to come in. The job was fun the first few weeks and then it became to repetitive and lost interest very quickly.
good,Of all the time I spent with RadioShack the day to day was my favorite. The team I built and the customer base was phenomenal. New practices and experiences every day.
good,"es buena empresa para trabajar bueno tambien dependiendo d los jefes que te pueden tocar , a en lo q mi respecta tuve la suerte de tener una buena jefa que se llama tammy , se porto muy bien conmigo y se podia trabajar muy tranquilamente ."
good,The Company wanted you to meet all these quote numbers because they were going through bankruptcy so they couldn't afford not to hit numbers.
good,Decent job to have during college. Work days were very slow and relaxed.  Business was very slow.  Easy to work around college/ home schedule.  Very trusting.
good,"Company is a good company to work for but the turn over rate is high, besides most of the stores are closing as well. The store pays well so that's a good thing."
good,the best part of the job was dealing with the customers. the manager didn't really handle business like he was supposed to but none the less got the job done
good,"Days were always filled with projects to do."
good,"Radioshack was an amazing place to gain experience, it taught problem solving, team work, competitiveness and leadership it had great products at competitive prices amazing management and compensation, that is until it went under new management. Radioshack slowly started to crumble after it took on new management they did pay cuts as well as took great products off the shelves slowly customers started leaving as well as other great employees at Radioshack, with the loss of great employees the company started giving out horrible customer service and then it just went from bad to worse. Customers left and my store went from 50,000 a month average to 20,000 in sales in just 2 years and then because of the loss in profit they kept laying off full time employees, then giving a pay cut to the managers, until finally laying off the assistant managers to keep there company going."
good,"I spent my days helping customers and teaching them how to use specific technology to meet their needs.  I learned a great deal about all types of technology and how to handle difficult situations.  Most of the managers I worked with were wonderful, however, there was such as large turnover over management that sometimes it was difficult work with some of them.  I loved my coworkers.  We all became friends and always had fun working together to make the store an entertaining and pleasant place for customers to come for any technical help that they required.  We all had our strengths and despite the fact that corporate made sales a little too competitive over time, we still were able to be respectful of each other.  The hardest part of the job was meeting quotas that corporate began to push.  I started to feel less like a customer service rep and more like a used car salesman.  The most enjoyable part was educating customers and helping them with any needs that they may have, no matter how large or small.  RadioShack did a great job training their employees on all technical matters and all the co-workers also helped each other expand their knowledge further.  It was always really gratifying to see a customer act like I just saved their life."
good,"at first it would be ok but as i learned more and got out of training, i learned how dangerous for job security. if you managed to go more than a few times without selling accessories or insurance you would lose your job."
good,"Our days were almost never really typical, as they were different almost each day. I learned how to sell mobile lines as well as how certain electronics worked. Management may have been a bit erratic with certain things but for the most part was easy to work with. Co-workers were very easy to work with. The hardest part about the job would've been the mobile line sales and the most enjoyable part of the job was the pay."
good,Fun place for the DIY customer who likes to experiment and try new things. They appreciate the team members.
good,"it doesnt exist any more, the store close down because the company lost a lot of money due to fraudulent activities. now it they are sprint service stores."
good,Was a great small buisness Grocery Store. Worked here while I was in High School. Company is no longer in buisness. Was a great store while open.
good,"This was a different environment and product then what I was used to previously but it was a good learning experience. It was slow paced which gave me time to have better customer service and helping them find what they were looking for,"
good,I had fun at the job the workplace and it's employees were great and had helped in any way they could. I got some retail experience.
good,"When I started working at Radio Shack back in 2004 it was a fast paced environment, meeting so many different people everyday. Now in 2016 it's very slow since they filed for bankruptcy and we hardly receive any shipment. I've learned that you have to be courteous and friendly with each and every customer no matter what you are going through personally. My coworkers are great to work with the few that we have as of today. We had about 16-18 employees, now we are down to 6 including the manager and assistant manager. The hardest part of the job to me is dealing with theft, because you don't know how that person is going to react towards you. And the most enjoyable part of the job is meeting new people every single day."
good,"Working there, I was responsible for giving the best customer service to each customer. I help Spanish speaking customers as well helping translate. Communication skills are very important. Also, I had to be knowledgeable in electronics."
good,Usually quiet with a medium flow of customers but would get extremely dead pass a certain time. If you know how to speak spanish an individual can make great commission on sales.
good,"I worked for the D.C for 25 years, in different departments, I've met and worked with many different and interesting people. I was faced with different learning challenges and was able to master each one. Whenever a heavy workload was in place as an employee I found it was always better when myself and co workers came together as a team to get the job done. I was able to learn how to complete tasks in a timely fashion, I was also trained and taught how to operate the mezzanine, as well as stocking, packing, and auditing."
good,The people are great but the company as in the CEO are not that great with there workers. But management was great and the culture in store are great learning experience.
good,"I didn't worked a long time at Radio Shack because the company went bankrupt, but the time i was there i enhance my customer service skills and how to be a sales man."
good,"While working for radio shack, I was able to assist customers on new purchases on cell phones, while giving them feedback on the newest and current phones while being able to offer my recommendations, only after listening to their needs, as in data plan, texting plan.  Working as a team, with only five co workers, we would always assist each other if needed to help close the sale.  I enjoyed helping customers, by teaching them how to use their new devices and offering them add ons they may need."
good,Started as an asst mngr. And had to learn all aspects of store operations from receiving the merchandise to ordering I also had extensive training in the art that is selling and how to increase through suggestion a one-item sale into a multiple item sale therefore increasing the sale amount of the customer.
good,A typical day at work would be more like a Sunday I would open the store put off the alarm fix the store the merchandise I learned how to meet the customers needs and wants I was in charge of the store when the manager or assistant were not available I had to do whatever needed to be done that day. Working with my co-workers was good because we each knew what we had to do. The hardest part was when a customer needed something and finding it for that customer making sure they had what they needed the most enjoyable part of my job was when I had happy customers.
good,"Stores were mostly dead, the occasional tinkerer would stop by."
good,Long hours but your rewarded for your hard work. Great manger. A world of technology. The one challenge of the job was to remember the customer was the most important key to success no matter how challenging they might be.
good,•Trained and supervised sales team to maintain a desired level of detailed product knowledge as well as recommended customer service practices.
good,no backbone with management no leadership or control of business and nobody cares to help one another everyone is just out for themselfs.
good,I liked the team I had while working there. They knew and practiced team work. My supervisor was nice and flexible with our needs.
good,"Loved working there that's why I lasted there over 10 years.  "
good,When I was there it was a good place to work and made decent money for what it was. I only worked part time but still made decent money
good,"When I first started working at radio shack, I got along with everyone. My co workers were very nice and helped me out if I needed help. The hardest part was for me going up to people and trying to sell because I was a shy person but by the end I was really opening up. The most enjoyable part was putting smiles on customers faces! Usually my typical day at work was pretty normal but after I transferred stores it went all down hill. My new store manager did sexually harass me! I did not like how unprofessional he was so I quit. I did try to tell my district manager but she just blew me off. I could not believe how they didn't handle this serious issue professionally."
good,Thats it not much else going for them. You work a lot and they care very little. Overall ok place to work. I should say I worked for them a long time ago. Things could have and probably have changed a lot since then.
good,"Great for a first job, customers are usually really nice wanting electronics, most of the time the store is slow but good for a first job"
good,"goals set to high compared to inflow and wants of consumers. "
good,I loved my job there it was  busy and you worked hard. you had to learn all the technology and it was fun keeping up on things and very rewarding
good,Stay away from RadioShack. It's a sinking ship. Sprint saved them from bankruptcy. They can't compete against Best Buy or Amazon. Best to apply elsewhere.
good,"I didn't work there very long, but they had demanding goals. Employees were held to a high standard and pushed to exceed."
good,"This job no longer exists, Target now runs its cell phone department through resource management. This job required knowledge of all 3 major phone carriers and monthly products and specials being initiated by all three on a weekly basis."
good,"Radio Shack seemed to care more about the numbers than their clients. I had to push the product on every customer, even when it was not relevant."
good,"i've learned alot of electronic things in this store. the management was great and worked along side everyone. As co workers we worked as a team. the hardest part of my job, there wasn't really a hard part."
good,"cashier and celling phones"
good,using conflict resolution to solve customer needs. Meeting sales goals and following company guidelines to move product. Keeping up with current market trends and merchandise.
good,"Radioshack taught me many things; how to sell, and got me started in fixing phones. I had a wonderful manager who was supportive and helped me grow in the areas I felt I needed to. I learned how to sale merchandise, shipping, and operations."
good,Overall the company worked for me I was in charge of day to day operations and maintaining a profitable store location I on a consistent basis met and surpassed sales goals.
good,Working at Radioshack was alright. The store I was at was the smallest in the district of 24 stores... Then came the day where they cut hours and started closing up store.
good,More worried about driving sales then whats best for customer. Also won't advertise the company to drive new customers back into the location.
good,"It didn't get much business, so it left me bored most of the time. I would find myself cleaning the windows seven times a day just to have something to do."
good,Learned how to work with Customers while they were in all states of mind. De-escalated issues and problems that appeared. Really taught me how to handle people correctly and take care of their needs pertaining to my job.
good,"Fun work place but very competitive. Base in sales, knowledge, responsibility and commitment.   A great learning experience for the first through the last day."
good,I had wonderful co-workers and several great supervisors. This job offered great experience in customer service and retail. Some things I learned here I have been able to carry on through my career in customer service.
good,"I enjoyed my time at RadioShack because the crew we had working at our store was awesome. There was never any drama. But when the company started to really fold in on itself, management changed and everybody's hours got cut."
good,I learned all about electronics and how fast technology is changing. I definitely feel that this job position helped me to become a more efficient customer service representative. I'm a team player who enjoys working as a team.
good,exciting but new challenges everyday.I learned that you have to treat every customer when they walk in the with the same respect.
good,was a good job. mostly dealing with customer facing support and helping solve customers concerns about products and how they work.
good,"Organizing different sections of the store, counting the register before and after shift. Made weekly audits with staff and manager. Learned how to set up phone lines and the difference between the items. My co-workers were very outgoing and fun to be around with along with management. The hardest part of the job was inventory and rearranging all the items from one section to another."
good,"Radio Shack is a business based on customer service. On a daily bases my duties included but were not limited to DR, coaching employees, meeting sales goals and handling customer service issues. I learned various tools in the areas of customer service and effective leadership. The most enjoyable part of working at Radio Shack was my team surpassing daily, weekly and monthly sales goals."
good,I loved this job.  All of my co workers and I got along wonderfully. Everyone in this job was wonderful from employees to the District Manager.
good,My day consist of opening and closing the store. I would do a walk around the store to see what needed to be ordered.  Paperwork and set weekly and monthly goals for the store and associates. And do inventory of high price items. Also do conference calls twice a week and hold meetings with associates. The hardest part of the job was doing my job when I had no help but with time management things were easier for me. The most enjoyable part of the job were have challenges with my associates so they could reach their goals and they were rewarded with a prize. It made working so fun.
good,it was a great company before they bankrupt. they had a great thing going where they were tops on loose electronic parts and small niche where if you wanted to DIY you could count of radioshack.
good,"opening the store, doing the morning paperwork, setting daily sales goals for the employees, putting up shipment making price tags. Helping customers. Great co-workers great sales team, The hardest part of my job is dealing with difficult customers. The most enjoyable part of the job is helping people get the right products they need."
good,"Standing around cleaning, to many employees on floor. "
good,"Consumer electronics retail chain store with moderate daily foot traffic, heavier on weekends. Radio Shack ok to work for, but the chain started having difficulty with sales and forced to close many retail outlets - even after re-modeling many of the outlet stores."
good,definitely not the time to be here. sad to see a once great company fall so badly. I was able to advance quickly but I often wander if that's due to so many people leaving the company in 2014.
good,I always had to greet customers making them feel comfortable and noticed when they entered the store. I learned how to patient and listen that was the key basis to happy customers. I worked with worked four other employees one being the manager. Our manager ran a tight ship but it all paid off in the end. We worked very well as a team. The hardest but do-able part was meeting our monthly marks and numbers. the most enjoyable part was repairing phones.
good,"would get there at 8.00am "
good,"If you know how to sell cell phones, you'll do fine here. If not, you're going to struggle, and fast."
good,"My radioshack store is very fun and organized with the great coworkers that work there. the problem is with the company in bankruptcy and new ownership the hours have been cut, products aren't in store, and it makes working with a smile very hard."
good,great company was going out of business and was cutting hours at work i was unable to finish all task i was given due to the lack of hours i was given
good,"Good Co-workers, and the management was nice enough. Not much chance of movement and opportunity. I would recommend as solely and temp job and only that, not worth having a career with."
good,"Working at RadioShack provided me an opportunity to experience the challenge of selling a product (cell phones/plans) to a customer. It was a challenge that I relished and became better at with each day. However, the training I received of putting a customer on a new plan through the carriers website was not sufficient."
good,"Walmart was my first retail job that helped me alot in school. They offer good benifits, and many hours. Set aside from all the drama Wal-Mart did ok."
good,"this was a good learning position. a great starting management position. Decent pay for advancement, The better ideas for fixing the structure of the company came far too late"
good,"RadioShack was a 'hit the ground running' scenario. Week by week, the schedule keeps changing and along with the policies."
good,Very good place to growup. and with a lot of costumer ....and is very clean place .. my manager is very good manager and i love this place .. and my partners too
good,Fast paced job with many daily operation challenges.Fun team building and customer satisfaction feedback.Enjoyed basically running my own business and helping literally thousands of customers over several decades with solutions to ensure their positive experience and continued patronage.
good,"Advice to Management....Your CEO & EVP polluted the culture of rewarding great people by laying them off and keeping individuals on-board that they worked with at prior organizations and brought them into position with little to no knowledge of all that it would TRULY need to ensure the success @ RadioShack... it always comes down to the people! These two ""people"" are only out for themselves.... Goodbye RadioShack... you have captains running your ship aground."
good,"I have worked at this location for 37 years, Started in the assembly lines then moved up to order puller. Worked in the warehouse as receiving clerk for many years then moved to the office. Packaging division of Radio Shack was fun and I enjoyed working there."
good,In this position I have learned it all from running a business to dealing with different people. My experience as a manager was mediocre due to my store being closed after nine months on the job. I have had lots of co workers come and go and learned a bit about each one. The hardest part of the job is selling something that people are not actually looking for. The most enjoyable part would be helping the customer find a solution.
good,"Since Radioshack was heading towards bankruptcy, the days were quiet and uneventful, so I spent most of my time stocking and organizing."
good,"Typical day includes setting goals, checking cleanliness, run reports for trends and daily sales, helping customers in getting what they came for as well as suggestive selling, receiving orders and putting out stock to the salesfloor. I've learned the nuts and bolts of how to run a business and be profitable.  My management skill is to adhere to all company policies and procedures. Making sure the location is as profitable as possible by selling the right products and making sure the associates are following the correct sales behavior.  the hardest part of the job is keeping up with the pace of customers when the payroll hours allowed are limited.  Without fail, when selling a phone or another time collective service, the customers keep coming and there seems to not be enough of one associate to go around, so the multi tasking comes into play and the pressure.  the most enjoyable part of the job is to serve the customer and have them leave with a smile on their face knowing that they will be back to see me/us for their next electronic need."
good,"i didnt enjoy working for this company, but grateful for the oppurtunity stayed for two and a half years but wasnt satisfied"
good,"My Manager was awesome and very dedicated."
good,Working at Radio Shack was easy enough. I worked my way up from part time sales associate to Assistant Manager in about 4-5 months or so.
good,It is a sink or swim job. You perform and you last if you don't then you will be phased out. Typical sales job with an extra emphasis on wireless phones.
good,"Tech retail store struggling to keep up with customer needs. Sad to see them fading away, but they struggled with public perception for years."
good,"Not a lot for me to say, I didn't work here for very long and I ended up having to leave this job because of poor management. I would shop for customers that where interested in cell phones, products and accessories."
good,Dedicated employees who love their job. Great people to work with. Personable and knowledgeable. Fun and easygoing. Hardest part of my job is being on my feet for many hours.
good,"I learned some new things about cb antenas, cell phones, different kinds of battery's, checking in vendors. One of the most enjoyable things about working for Radio Shack was meeting new people."
good,The average day at RS you greet customers and help them with whatever they are in the store to purchase.  I learned a great deal about newer technology.  The store manager was great and very flexible with the needs of the employees and customers.  Corporate puts pressure on it's employees to up sell every ticket and to push the sale of cell phones which most customers get annoyed with when questioned about their cell phone service so it makes the job difficult when you are constantly irritating customers at the request of corporate.  I understand being a sales associate working on commission you SHOULD be trying to up sell everything to make a decent pay check.
good,you have to push sales. know the merchandise. always on your feet. quick moving. black friday is the busiest. good work environment.
good,"Brand is good, but the hours and and leadership are not too great.  Bad pay structure for management, high turn over.  Plus, the company is on it's way to going out of business"
good,"If you want quality brands at excellent pricing, Radio shack is the place to go. We pride ourselves on excellent customer service and making sure our customers leave happy."
good,The management and co workers were great. The customers that came in were so different in a way that you actually learned alot from them also. Everyone that came in and worked for Radioshack loved it due to the new electronics and gadgets we got in that we were able to try out.  The associates loved it due to flexible scheduling and commission they received. But since they are filing for Bankrupt one of the hardest things I had to do was to explain to many that they might not be employed by Radioshack. The best thing is that many understand whats going on and due to the relationship and respect we have for each other we stick with it to the end as a Team in our store and we try to have fun like always and fully take care our customers.
good,was a good place to work but was a sales position. Helped in giving experience with the public.
good,"The little time I was I had no problem with anyone."
good,"I like working for Radio Shack, would be great with better salary. With Most managers I know being young, under 30, the salary is great, but for someone older it may not be what your looking for."
good,"over the past few years, i have learned a lot working for radio shack. great experiences that i will take through out my career."
good,"A typical day at Crossmark consists of preparing food samples for all Sam's club members. Understanding different key points about different products and marketing those points to each customer. I enjoyed my coworkers and the environment that I worked in, everyone was always helpful and had a willingness to work as a team. The hardest part of the job would be handling multiple customers at once. When this happens you have to speak very fast and sometimes it gets distracting. The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to learn about different products and seeing the customer's reactions."
good,It was great to work with kids and help then find the right shoes and clothes to wear. I didn't like that my work check had bounced
good,Commission sales based job that can be stressful at times but can be fun to work as a team and drive sales.
good,"Radioshack is a small thinking company. They don't strive for greater than the small stored and parts that they peddle, If you need a screw to fix an RC car than that's your place."
good,Everyday consisted of meeting sales expectations from the previous year. Each sales associate was tasked with meeting particular cross sell abilities such as warranties or additional products.
good,"good co workers"
good,A normal day at RadioShack consists of completing small tasks between providing customer service to customers. Must combine customer service tactics with basic electronics knowledge in order to provide the customer with a positive experience.
good,Awesome company to work for. Always loved helping others. Enjoyed being the store manager and able to run everything with my ideas.
good,"If you want to work hard and have your job duties constantly changing, then this is the job for you!"
good,good college job but that is about it.  but it was a fun competitive job
good,A 5 or 8 hour shift with a few breaks. A good about of knowledge had to be picked up fairly quickly to be able to sell people what they want or even know what they are talking about. Selling phones is stressful and a slow process.
good,"the job is pretty easy"
good,Good people that work for the company but the direction has been that of a confused child for quite a long time.
good,"Typical day was helping customers find the right product and see if they qualified for a new phone or wanted to get a new phone plan. Manager was nice, but was required to pressure us to sell service plans.. Service plans were kind of a sham so I didn't like this aspect."
good,"starter job for money while in school, and also helped work with people building electrical circuits"
good,"•	Contact new and existing customers to discuss their needs, and to explain how these needs could be met by specific products and services."
good,Open and closed store and made sure everything else was completed throughout the day. Kept employees working all day and helped them achieve sales goals that I set For them. Helped the store have a Month over Month sales gain.
good,"A typical day of work consist of helping costumers and maintaining the store's policies while achieving company goals. Achieved personal sales and profitability goals by consistently and pro actively engaging guests utilizing the Company’s sales process."
good,"Not a bad job, considering it was my first ever. I had not too many complaints aside from the constant nagging to sell more phones, when clearly the customers don't want to be pressured into something they realllly don't want."
good,"Radioshack is a franchised corporation so this review does not reflect upon Radioshack as a whole, but the owner and operator was intolerable and used outdated management techniques."
good,"It was a retail position, not much to say about it, expect it was good sales experiance"
good,"Job depends on selling abilities. You have to know how to greet and be patient with customers as everyone is different. Customer Service is required. There really isn't a hard part about the job, it is an easy going job. If you're not selling you're not making money in this job field, as everything you sell goes towards commission."
good,"I learned how to sell to different types of people. I also learned about management of people, merchandise, and money."
good,"The RadioShack I worked for would have been a great job to work for if I had extensive knowledge of electronics. The training I received was not very good from my main trainer, so my job was not don't to the best of my ability. My typical day there was restocking, phone activations and register transactions. I was not very good at phone activations. I loved my boss and co-workers as they were very helpful (except for one in my main trainer) and friendly. The most difficult part of my job was assisting the customers with phone activations because of the lack of training, but I always improvised, asked other co-workers and got it done. I enjoy helping my customers and seeing them  leave happy."
good,"RadioShack is an excellent place to develop interpersonal skills. The daily interaction with customers gives employees adequate experience in providing excellent customer service. A typical day consists of setting daily sales goals for each employee followed by ensuring that all operational duties have been met. Most days require an update of visual and promotional merchandising. "
good,Was a great Multi Unit experience with full P&L responsibility.
good,this is a good company but there is no room for growth wirhin the company
good,I think that Radio Shack has lost focus on their customers by pushing corporate expectations on customers. I think that when an organization losses focus on what is most important--the customer--you have an organization that is in trouble.
good,"The system works and pre store closing it looked easy to move into the store manager position in part because no one wanted to deal with it. I have encountered two District managers one of which was knowledgeable and hardworking the other who was a micromanaging imbecile. Depending on where you work this can be great or terrible."
good,Assist customers on a day to day basis. Learn something new every day regarding technology.
good,The most enjoyable part of this job is that I can be around people and technology. I have learned to provide complete solutions to customers.
good,Working for Radio Shack was a learning experience.  I learned alot about electronices that I did not know before.  Management was very passionate about their jobs and passed on a lot of knowledge.
good,Enjoyable company to work for. They showed me a variety of new things dealing with cables and fuses and other electronically items.
good,"Most of the I was usually maintaining the up keep of the store. I helped many employees find electrical parts for projects for school and home, that dealt transistors, capacitors, resistances, and micro controller. The hardest part was to decipher exactly was every customer needed and how a certain product would benefit them. I enjoyed to be the person who helped a customer find what they needed to complete whatever goals they had set."
good,Every day presented a different challenge. Helping customers troubleshoot their electronic devices was a great experience.
good,"Really learned to push my sales skills, I became the top salesman almost every month."
good,"The policies, procedures, and even the overall facility setup and design template make it easy to move from one location to another and be able to know exactly where to find certain forms in the manager's desk drawer. Plenty of support information available and clear expectations of job performance. A higher rate of pay would have made this job literally more rewarding."
good,"typical day at work would be selling and Demonstrate that customer comes first by serving them with a sense of urgency.  Maintained friendly and professional customer interactions. Worked as a team leader to provide the highest level of service to customers loved my co-workers to pieces, the most enjoyable part of the job was making the customer happy"
good,"Typical day included helping customers, store maintenance, and ordered products that were needed."
good,"This company requires you to sell to make money. This would be a lot easier if they allowed you to maintain a decent inventory or had some control of what you have in your store. Amazing deals on phones. The amazing items are online only. Co-workers are generally great to work with, managers not so much. Store procedures are often over the top and trouble daily procedures."
good,"Not a place for advancement, i would not apply or recommend any one to apply for a position at this company"
good,"Assisting customers with products. Such as explaining and demonstrating how products worked. I learned that it can be difficult to maintain sales levels when holiday season was over. My co-workers and I got along great, even outside of work."
good,"My days are pretty fun. Display TVs allow customers to come across great movies, TV shows and sports games. The radio allows them to hear some of their favorite songs. Me and my co-workers top their visit off by offering solutions to their problems. It's simply the place you want to be especially if you're into technology. There's honestly no hard part that comes along with being a Sales Associate at RadioShack. The only con is the compensation. It tends to make you feel like you're doing more than you actually should."
good,sales day in and day out. I learned customer service and management skills. Coworkers were young and ambitious to earn money. Hardest part of the job is keeping employees motivated. Fun part of the job was talking to customers
good,The experience gave me good customer service skills. the customers made an impact on how I view customer satisfaction
good,"Walk in 5 minutes before schedule starts then sign in on time. Inspect my area of the store. Talk to my store manger or MIT and ask if there is anything they need done. Help customer's who come in using the 4 E's. 30 minutes before time walk around the store making sure everything is in order. Close the store and clean up and make sure the sore is ready for opening the next day, then leave. "
good,Slow easy work. Demanding sales goals and very pushy management.
good,customer service setting up cell phone contracts stocking and cleaning floor
good,we sold everything in radio shack phones tvs computers i was sad when they closed our store
good,"My responsibilities included keeping track of high value products such as cell phones, tablets and laptops. Taking care of customers and accessing the cash register. It's not too hard of a job since I am tech savy."
good,"It's not a job you're going to like. Unless of course you like trying to sell everyone a cellphone regardless of who they are nor their circumstances. When I was here this was a heavily commission based job, but it sucked for me because my manager robbed all of my team's sales. Otherwise you are making minimum wage to sell batteries and vacuum. Your coworkers will vary, I can't really comment. Mine were pretty cool, but that may be because we had a common enemy in our manager. The hardest part of this job was definitely the constant auditing. The most enjoyable.... the paycheck every other week. This job is not fun. You aren't meant to have fun. You are meant to turn a profit. That's all."
good,I learned how to study and keep-up-to day information on electronics. Management was very helpful in my learning.
good,I worked for RadioShack during the holidays until late winter.
good,"For the most part I love my job at RadioShack. I do not get enough hours for me to continue, but I will stay until something more reasonable comes to light. I have been there for a year and a half. I enjoy working with my co-workers."
good,i sold mobile devices everyday and made commision. nothing was hard accept when we had to push sevice plans that didnt offer full protection
good,"Edits, adjust T&A, answer phones, process hours and put on pay sheets to be paid. Run queries, process payments, retro and pay missing time. Reissue and void checks. Term query and process term checks. Prepare paperwork for imaging. Pick up mail and checks. Process requests for paystubs, W2's, and address change. Print checks. Filing and data entry. Change W2 information. Work in fast pace environment."
good,"I would spend most of my day fielding customer requests and trying to meet their needs in terms of what product or service best suites them.  The job also included inventory and the setting up of marketing displays on the sales floor.  There was regular on the job training.  Management was very clear about their goals and requirements.  My co-workers were wonderful to work with.  The hardest part of the job was making ends meet some of the time.  Obviusly it was an entry level job but without a lot of cellular sales, your commissions were pretty low."
good,My day at radioshack consist of lots of meetings and goals. focus on beating last years sales and my store always won because of my sales exp we where always number 1 in are district. nothing more important in retail then keeping labor down and revenue up. always . And you have to get used to policy changing all the time. nothing ever stays the same ev er
good,Productive and fun work environment. Fast pace and exciting.
good,Good work place Environment. Management was OK. Restaurant job was not my area of expertise.
good,I had a pleasant experience at all of the three RadioShack's I worked for.
good,I have learned this is all about selling and communicating with customer base on solving issues about variety of products.
good,"Very laid back atmosphere not much challenge, does require some knowledge but nothing out of the normal."
good,"great place to learn about customer service, and to meet goals that are set to achive"
good,"I love dealing with new smart phones, and meeting new people. It was standing all day in Sam's Club."
good,"I love working for this company, over the last several years job security is the reason I am looking at a new career"
good,"I help assist customers with their needs, also partake in sales transactions, in addition to daily maintenance within the store."
good,I enjoyed this comanpany even at its worst moments. friendly envionrment
good,Typical day at work is coming in and solving peoples problems. Usually dealing with a lot of questions on why an electronic they have may not work. Selling and figuring out customer needs. Knowing how to sell contracts is important and you will be asked to push towards wireless sales and battery sales. Usually two employees per shift.
good,"Sales are slow."
good,a typical day at work was always filled with tasks to fulfill your entire shift so work was never dull.
good,Work was very fast paced at times but others we very slow and uneventful. Met a lot of interesting people and my co-workers were great. I learned a little about consumer electronics.I really enjoyed when I was able to help someone find a solution to their problem. The hardest part was dealing with rude people that felt as if they owned the store.
good,"Pretty much all they care about at radio shack is Selling wireless (cell phones) selling batteries and insurance plans on products. The typical customer that comes into a radio shack is not looking for any of those things. So you have to help them find what they came into the store for, and some how talk them into getting a two years contract, and buying batteries, which hardly anyone uses anymore and Radio Shack does not have a good price on batteries so it's hard to get them to buy any. And if you work a saturday night, don't expect to get out of the store anytime soon after they close because every saturday night, you have to go around the store and change the prices on all the products, which takes AWHILE."
good,"The typical day was easy, review P&L and employee metrics, write the daily plan for them and then do basic visual merchandising. Throughout the day do your best to sell a phone to someone who needs one, cleanup and go home. "
good,"I learned how to maintain a store."
good,"answered incoming calls from customers about products, sales, and repair calls"
good,compensation is minimal and incentive is not enough. family owned business
good,You tend to have chances to move up in the company. this is a great place for a first job and if you like people this is for you.
good,"I have nothing against my direct manager or against my former employees, but I believe that the company is going in a wrong direction: sales-oriented mindset rather than a service-oriented one. I was dismissed for sticking to those convictions rather than my employers using my strengths to better help the company."
good,"My day starts by opening the store, counting to make sure that the cash drawer has the correct amounts from the night before. I check the work email to see what the expectations for the day might be. I then, depending on the day, count wireless inventory over $99, send the wireless checklist from the day before to make sure that all wireless transactions are correctly processed. After opening the store I greet each customer and ask what brings them into our store today. On the days that my store manager is off I am required to do the deposit and take the funds to the bank. I have learned effective communication and customer service skills. The hardest part of the job is translating what customers try to say they need versus what they mean they need. The work environment is very friendly and I enjoy going into work everyday."
good,a typical day at work is pretty easy make sure everything in store is priced and store is clean do deposits and over shorts open and close. learned about small parts the go into computers and tvs and things like that management is hardest part manager dose not do job and looks to employes to do everything for him. co-workers are great lot of good people that get over looked. the hardest part of my job is how slow it can be and to find things to do at that time when store in already 100%. best part is the co-workers.
good,"This job consists of a lot of standing around and waiting. Stored upkeep and planogram updates are also responsibilities of the sales associates. I learned how to multi-task very well at this job. The management was decent, I learned a lot working there. I got along with my co-workers. The hardest part was staying busy when the store was slow and everything else was completed. The most enjoyable part was the fact that you got rewarded for your hard work."
good,not a fan of management. but overall the company has potential.
good,"Great starting Job for most teens, the pay is low but the ""spiffs"" are good, by that I mean bonuses on selling cell phones."
good,"Sale item and merchandise like TV, radio, electric part, cell phone"
good,Management was really great; he was so easy going and the hours where flexible. The hardest part of the job was to serve 2 clients at the time. And the most enjoyable part of the job is acquire new toys to play with it.
good,"pretty busy day everyday, i gained more patience being around diffrent types of customers everyday.the hardest part is watching all customers in store at once while im alone."
good,"Meeting customers and helping them get what they wanted or help them troubleshoot any problems they may have had electronically."
good,help customers with any problems they have with electrioncs
good,"Radio Shack is a typical retail sales position.  Great job for someone trying to get their foot in the door with customer service, sales or commission based pay."
good,"Working for Radio Shack taught me a l,ot about customer service and in sixteen years of work I learned alot of different management styles. While I would not work for them again I take with me a lot of knowledge."
good,"Register and checkout was simple and effective, and the company presented an environment to the employees that both motivated them in their day-to-day responsibilities, and provided ample opportunity to move up. Training and product education programs were thorough and accurate, and goal that were set were feasible yet encouraged growth."
good,"Overall, RadioShack is a decent place to work. The only negative thing I really have to say is I felt like they put a little too much pressure on you to sell. For example, you may get the same quota expectations as a part time employee as a full time employee would get and if you don't meet the requirements you often get yelled at and embarrassed."
good,"Working at Radio Shack will provide and opportunity to gain exposure to team building, hiring, management, and sales. The lessons learned and skill acquired will undoubtedly be useful in future jobs and careers."
good,"Informed customers of services and products that AT&T, Tmobile, Sprint, Verizon, offered.  Also sold DirectTV services to customers.  Answered questions customers had.  Solved problems such as phones that were messing up or just problems with bills, etc. I learned also with this job that customer service is number 1.  It keeps customers coming back to your company if they love your attitude and are patient with them.  The hardest part of the job was complaining customers but you keep calm and just solve their problems the best you can."
good,"The job was wonderful and a different experience. I got to learn about different items that people used on a daily bases from cell phones to fuses, and different do it yourself hobbies."
good,Management sucked in as far as the other Assistant did more searching on the internet than working.
good,"Short hours, fun job if you enjoy children, requires patience"
good,While working here I learned a lot about electronics and cell phones.
good,Radio Shack should focus on innovation and customer service and less of remote control cars and low end products.
good,This job is very informative and you can learn a vast amount of information.  The business relies too much on the store manager and they are not compensated fairly.  It can be a fun environment if management does not make it stressful.
good,"Management was just absolutely terrible, and the way the pay was setup, it was impossible to meet your quota so you were always making minimum wage."
good,Great co-workers and customers. Competitive and fast-paced. Great Hours and loads of fun.
good,Required to know all cell phone providers information. But less pay than the actual employees of the companies
good,I liked working here and I also meeting new people. I learned about hooking up stereo and televisions.
good,Required work week was 52 hours and they do not pay overtime to salary employees.
good,"all managment, customer service and cash handling duties."
good,"Great Temporary Job! Loved selling, and working with electronics while also helping customers, and interacting with them."
good,for assistant managers and above decent benefits. Corporate needed to improve package for floor people. very good products
good,job environment was reasonably pleasant for years until financial situation started going down hill. Some good benefits.  Location of corporate office is very nice. Many layoffs now. Not the best work environment anymore.
good,customer service experience hard with keeping up with meeting sale goals but its great team work involved
good,Great coworkers and learned alot about all types of  electronics.
good,I worked with a good sales team and sold electronics. I talked to customers about their electronics and try to find the best appliance for them
good,"i dont really remember much but training was a big plus, the discount program will help the employee more then compensation."
good,fun to work with but slow on the updates good products but bad serevice plans!
good,"A customer service position selling various electronics and other things. Coworkers were the best part of the job. Force selling something to someone wasn't for me. I still completed work and sells goals, surpassing them a few times."
good,"Great job/career.  Perfect for those who work hard with the intentions of moving up.  You are in control of not only your store and everything in it, but also your future.  Decent salary to start and fair commission structure, although could be better.  Takes a special breed to work for Radio Shack so you are surrounded by people like yourself.  Cons of the job are long hours and VERY little time off for new managers.  Checklists and mundane corporate tasks can interfere with an already massive work load.  Job security for tenured staff makes promotions more difficult even if you're outperforming the senior staff. Hardest part of the job is the future of the company.  It looks promising for the first time in years but it may be too late for a turnaround.  "
good,"I think this job can be limitless if your right for the position, i mean if your right for sales and being put to the challenge. Anyone can work here but it takes good customer service to step up in the company."
good,"It gave me a good experience in sale, but for what they ask you to do, the pay is terrible. The business will probably go under within the next 15 years. They won't be able to survive on this sale philosophy."
good,I was able to learn to deal with different types of personalities. A typical day at work was mostly busy because i worked during back to school season
good,i loved it at ready shack because i had the chance to meet different people from different back grouds. i enjoyed assisting customers with their questions
good,"This job was great, a typical day was to greet customers and help them with what they needed to purchase. I learned how to work some of the new phones and how to program them. My co-workers were really nice and helpful, they taught me how to do everything. The hardest part of my job was that sometimes customers would ask for a specific thing and I didnt known where it was (but that was only like the first week). The most enjoyable part of the job was that it was a small business store and a lot of the customers were frequent customers."
good,I like working at radio shack i have a good boss who takes his time to train me.
good,I personally loved it. The customers are amazing. Of course there were bad days but I could still leave work with a smile. I love the phone activations and communication between the customers and I. 
good,"Not a bad job, manager was kind of creepy, hit on me a couple of times. but the pay was good with commission."
good,a good company with different kinds of electronic gadget i work as elctronic technician repairing an audio and video product such as camera cctv amplifier or paging system
good,was very demanding and sales driven enviromnet no more it required you to work alot of long hours 
good,"While I did like working for RS, they were surprisingly inept at promoting a healthy work environment.  Most employees felt disposable, and very few people had their heart in their work.  Most store management and workers were great people, but the majority of upper management obviously saw nothing beyond numbers.  They did not seem to realize there was a correlation between employee satisfaction and performance."
good,Hours were not consistent.  Hourly wage was low. No overtime past hours assigned.  
good,A Typical work day would consist of customers entering your store. Greeting them properly and ensuring their needs are what make part of work day efficient.
good,I was not employed very long with this employer as I received a better offer to move back to the Dallas market.   The culture was a different experience at Radio Shack but the employees were really nice people and the management team was very strong.
good,It's a good place to work but the company is a little far out from where I live... 
good,Radio Shack is a good company to work for if you are looking to gain retail experience and learn selling skills for various products and to a diversified customer base.
good,... And if your not good luck getting a coworker to help you.  Team building classes. promote people who sell well but have no management experience in management positions.
good,I learned from cell phones to computers to small gadgets. My typical day at work consisted of planos and working with customers and partnering companies all threw the day. 
good,"I've been with RadioShack for almost 2 years now and it's had it's ups and downs. But to be honest if it wasn't for all of the great people I work with I would have left a long time ago. They have dropped the pay with raising the expectations from you. They give raises to people they like and are good salespeople, not good in management and do not train them properly. "
good,"The most enjoyable part of my job was knowing the latest high tech gear, the latest hgih tech equipment right when it comes out."
good,Great place to work. Lots of cool toys to play with while working. Definitely would recommend others to work there. Benefits and pay was up to par with most electronic companies. Going to work felt more like going to an arcade.
good,Good for young people with very little retail experince. very laid back
good,"money, invantory, customer service, brakes, phone ancer question sale cell phones, take test on there equipment you sell"
good,Normal retail workday. Learned that working for a good person is important. Co-workers could be catty but also fun.
good,Minimum wage for alot of work. The best place to start if this is your first job ever.
good,It is very interesting job you stay up to date on all the new tech that's coming out. as long as you sell sell sell and have add ons your good.
good,"It was a good place to work during the summer. People with technical backgrounds are directed toward customers with technical problems. Since it is a commision based position, those with the technical backgrounds help customers and fix problems while the other sales people ring up sales."
good,its a great learning experience to further a career in other fields of sales
good,"working as cashier , floor slaes asscoiate , draw counts , re - stock , price tagging"
good,enjoyed the customers and meeting their needs hired and trained some excellent employees
good,"Competitive work place abd alot is asked for minimal wage, you have to know what you are doing, Its a very high speed job."
good,I wasn't a huge fan of the job however it would be good for a student.
good,"good discounts along with the pay (commission). The work environment was good, fun and friendly."
good,retail sales
good,"Good sales compensation(commission structure), minimum base pay, and if you get along with your manager and your team, the job is worth it if you can reach the branch goals(which change almost every week). You can learn a good deal about basic consumer electronics, and the company policies actually exist to help the customer."
good,Taught me everything I know inside and out about technology
good,"Pushing Sales is very important in this company so you do learn a lot of selling tricks do's and don'ts, meet a lot of people, management for the most part is great but not ideal for someone that is interested in keeping this as a job during school because they will want you to make moving within the company a priority and school to them is not priority. Other than that good place to work"
good,"Nothing great here, not sure how to review the store, they can sometimes have a difficult work environment, but pay okay for a part-time job for a possible college student and work around your schedule. Co-workers are generally fun to work with and the customers are generally easy to please. Management is pretty exceptional and easy to get along with."
good,"Explain electronic devices to customers, handled money transactions with customers and made deposits at the bank for Radioshack. Participated in inventories at the store. Responsibility of opening and closing the store. Stocking the new merchandise every week and daily cleaning of the store."
good,Awsome crew to work for. was real teamwork i miss the good old days of radioshack and joking with the crew .
good,Exciting company to work for. Sales environment so compensation fluctuates based on economy and location. Some unrealistic expectations with limited room for advancement.
good,I don't want to say anything negative about this company yes they're strict and the management is kind of sloppy but i don't blame the company. Its the people who work there that can make it gokd or bad. My first manager didn't train me very well and didn't try. My second manager was awesome he taught me a lot and really showed me the ropes. My third manager was nothing but drama andwas fired like my first manager. Its not the company but the people who work for them. Some just didn't care and spoiled it for the others.
good,Provide customer service
good,"A typical day at work included me opening the store and getting everything ready to service and sell to customers. I learned a lot about sales and different POS systems that many of the different wireless carriers use. The management was decent and for the most part pretty laid back with everything. I enjoyed working with all of my co-workers and they enjoyed working with me. The hardest part of the job was learning all of the wireless carrier's POS systems and cellphone plans all while working in a store full of 3,000 items. The most enjoyable part of the job was working with a good staff in an upbeat environment."
good,"I learned a lot about Radio Shack, a little about selling electronics, and something about politics."
good,"The work day was slow, not very many customers would come in on a daily basis. The people i worked with were great, always there to help make sure everything was taken care of. The store manager was alittle out there in the sense of how he treated everyone. The best part of my job was making sure customers recieved what they needed to complete there projects."
good,Manage daily operations while meeting revenue and sales goals. Open and close location according to company procedures. Train associates on multiple companies and demonstrate the advantages of each. Schedule associates to maximize customer satisfaction while remaining under store budget. Track P&L statements. Resolve customer issues in an order to maintain customer retention. Meet with sales managers of different companies to discuss new products and marketing strategies. Increase store business and traffic using different marketing strategies. Recruit new high performing associates.
good,Basic retail electronics sales not exactly the most exciting working environment. I was in a very small store with very little foot traffic and only a handful of employees. Not a very memorable work place.
good,"A typical day at Radioshack would include dealing with customers and their concerns regarding electronics, setting up accounts for Direct TV, Verizon, and Sprint, and the sales of wireless phones. Management was pretty good. My supervisor basically allowed us to be on our own unless we were really in need of help. My co-workers were great! The hardest part of my job would be on a exceptionally slow day when I had to try keep myself busy. The most enjoyable part of the job was having a supervisor that trusted us and our judgement."
good,"I really enjoyed working in sales for Radio Shack. It was a small kiosk in Sams and the sales were always steady and worth it. I sold for ATT, SPrint, and Tmobile. Tmobile offered the best perks out of the 3."
good,"I enjoyed working with electronics and being able to test and ""play"" with the brand new things on the market. Commission based position and for a part-time job it was good."
good,"i work one on one with people and phones. i look up things for the people and help them find what the best phone for then, take payments, do credit checks, and use the pc to cash out."
good,"Designed, implemented, and supported enterprise performance management and business intelligence systems for Hyperion. Developed and maintained Essbase Applications that included forms, business rules, calc scripts and shared services. Work with a team of four and rotating being on-call. Handle any problem that arises. Work closely with internal business customers to understand reporting requirements and implement those leveraging Hyperion Essbase, or depending on the user requirements. This includes development of user requirements, development of specifications, coding, unit testing, user acceptance testing, documentation, and implementation. I learned a lot about Hyperion Essbase. The hardest part of the job was making yourself known. The enjoyable part was the flexibility they gave their employees with learning new things."
good,"this job is very flexible with school hours which was an advantage, but we were treated very bad and given many things to do that didn't allow us to really create a good customer experience."
good,"On a typical work day my job mainly consist of recruiting of new or upgrade wireless customers for one of the many wireless carriers we are authorized to deal for. I've learned a lot of selling techniques along with organizational skills and the required actions inorder to meet goals. Management on the store level was excellent however moving up in the company the management lacked understanding of the way things work on the lower levels therefore there was a gap in knowledge. There was also limited room to move up in the company. I enjoy my co-workers, we work as a team to reach our goals making it a friendly environment and not too competitive. The hardest part of this job is have to reach goals that are sometimes unattainable and being expected to do work that others do for much more compensation. I enjoy working with my team members along with the flexibility of schedule."
good,I learned much about myself and the general public at Radio Shack. Every day stretched me and challenged me to think on my feet and help the customers come up with a solution to their needs.
good,"Good company, benefits, job security and advancement. Got to work/life balance"
good,"electrical parts, wiring, cellphones, gadgets and other small electrical devices."
good,-Great working environment
good,Radio shack was a great job while i was going to school because i was able to be around all the parts and components that i used in school.
good,"This job depends on how the economy doing because you make your paycheck by selling phones and if nobody is buying phones then you will not make any money. It is a very competitive job because you get paid off of compensations, so one week can be good and the next can be bad."
good,"The job itself wasn't something to be happy to wake up to in the morning, however the people within my work environment we're very comfortable. I felt the need to be a team player and help my fellow associates where I was strong and they were weak. I learned how to deal with all types of customers, from old to young, cranky to perky, and many different races, as well as dealing with the language barrier. Management I wish were better in the sense of decision making. For the hardest part of the job I would say coming in on a bad day and having co-workers further lower me down, having to deal with this and trying to present a professional appearance was challenging. I handled it well but it was indeed a hard time. Unfortunately I don't have a most enjoyable part. The times I had fun where when me and certain co-workers we're scheduled together, we helped others with a fun carefree attitude and it affected all our customers in a positive way which made me happy."
good,"Radioshack is not for everybody , but if you kiss enough ... you can do pretty well. If you don't (like myself) you have prepare yourself for long way to get promoted and watch your every step ."
good,A typical day would be we doing stock and when pressured with customers I would step in.Nothing was really hard about the job just did not set well with my school schedule.
good,"I have worked with very good, caring, hard working managers. I have also worked with dishonest, selfish, unresponsive managers. At times, this goes beyond the store manager... However, I am not comfortable saying more about that. This is a good company, but, the higher levels of management do not necessarily act for the good of the employee or the customer. If you find a store manager who follows the actual rules of the company as pertains to the customer or employee, then you have a good one (and there are many). BUT, the ones who feel differently certainly do hurt the image and perception of what would otherwise be a good company."
good,"Fun and fast paced but progression is slow. Not a lot of middle managers, average culture. Work closely with cross functional departments. Always learning differnt things so boredem is not an issue."
good,"A typical day at work would be helping out customers with their electronics needs. I would walk and point them to the right direction if they needed any help. Another part of the job was meeting our sales goal. Each week we had a new number to beat. We would also sell cell phones, we were part of AT&T and Sprint and for that we got paid commission. Co-workers were good teammates, but the management wasn't on point. Overall I did enjoy working for this company."
good,an ok job to have while you are in school. I have nothing much more to say.
good,This position was very rewarding once i developed strong sales skills. The management was very good to me and they put me in positions to succeed.
good,this company puts a lot of worth in team work. each department helps each other and with customer care the company does not do the point. the point being to point a fingure and tell a customer what they are looking for is over there.
good,Radio Shack is one of the oldest electronic chain stores in the US
good,"Working as a Sales Associate for Radio hack was both challenging and interesting. My duties were to sell appliances, store maintenance, stock and inventory. throughout my employment at Radio Shack I learned to activate cell phones, run basic maintenance for various appliances, and provide excellent customer service. the most challenging part of working here was the challenging demand for sales, however I did like the compensation."
good,Work was very physical and hard. Could of used more help. The company also is a great place to work.
good,RadioShack is ok for young kids or college students. I learned how to sell products and make them more appealing. My co-workers were great.
good,Was in transition and this job was very beneficial and taught me a whole ne skill set.
good,Radioshack has a lot of different gadets that would interest any age at all. The best part is when shipment arrives and we get to play with the items and gain knowledge as we put them away
good,A typical day at Radio Shack involves a lot of customer service. You have the opportunity to learn about the different products hands on. This job allows you to interact with customers and resolve their inquiries. The hardest part of this job is balancing your work schedule with your personal life. The schedule is inconsistent for the most part. The pay can be great depending on if your a superior salesman.
good,"If you are good with electronics and new technology, you may like to work here. You must be sales driven or compensation will not be that great. Employess get discount off of merchandise."
good,During my years of service I have learned a lot about technology and
good,"Company is great, structured well and is overall set up great in a corporate respect. Every store is different so I will not knock them all but they seem to make a lot of changes with store layout continuously. Pay is terrible, minimum wage and I could never afford the benefits because the pay is terrible."
good,"On the outside, RadioShack looks like a mom-and-pop store just as they always have, and most stores offer great customer service. But the management culture is caught up in reports and sales metrics rather than the customer experience, and they are constantly changing their minds about what and how they want to measure. Meanwhile, on the store level, they pay a poor base wage and expect tiny commissions to make up for it. I liked the people, but management left a LOT to be desired."
good,"The store managers are the only things keeping the District managers from firing everyone. If you take this job, prepare to be talked to frequently about selling more batteries/phones/accessories/credit cards/service plans/etc. Fail to meet the majority of your goals for two months in a row and you are gone."
good,"A typical day at Radio Shack consisted of making sure the store was clean, making sure customers came first, planograms and restocking items when they needed to be restocked. I really enjoyed interacting with customers."
good,I worked there in total for almost 40 years and had opportunities to learn and advance over that time. Mostly a great experience working with dedicated coworkers. Overall the management was poor and pay and benefits were lacking but employees were generally treated OK..
good,"It was one of my first part time jobs in Florida. The environment was much different then in NYC. It was much slower, less consumers of products, it was closing down, and the management was VERY minimal and a great deal of leniency with any request in regards to time off, days off, lunches and more."
good,I only worked there for a year but it was very laid back from top to bottom. Unrealistic goals but that's because the company was only a few months from going under....then it did
good,"Not much to really comment about."
good,Una emopresa en la que dia a dia tenia mis labores y tareas las cuales debia concluir para concretar al termino de mi horario laboral lo cual desgraciadamente muchas veces ellos no lo respetaban
good,"I had an awesome run at Radio Shack when I was in college. I met great friends, new people, awesome coworkers and I'm still friends with my coworkers. The only problems I had was the opportunities to advance and the pay. The pay was terrible. No raises, waiting for a year for medical benefits."
good,"Radioshack was an enjoyable experience as I was able to learn about electronics and telecommunications during my tenure with them and their lack to become a big box store killed them. Customers were typically elderly and most had an understanding of electronics, some of which, even taught me a thing or two. The culture was very relaxed as it lacked sales quotas and revolved more around presenting a tidy store. Radioshack offered informative information in regards to their electronics and did not leave you undereducated unless you so choose. Management was too relaxed and it felt as if it lacked care for the store and its employees."
good,"Help any customers with any questions they had. Try to up sale as much as possible. Repair cell phones, tablets and iPods infront of customers."
good,The pay is ok for the work you do which is chill. When I worked there is was $8.00 an hour but that was before we had raised minimum wage. To be honest I think the company went Bankrupt.
good,Radioshack from my experience was a decently good job. It had the high paced feel of big box retail at some points balanced with periods of uninterrupted focused work.
good,The store manager and my coworker were both wonderful people to work with. Upper management often times was disconnected from the reality of retail on the ground level.
good,Was an okay company until they liquidated most of their assets and closed 70% of their retail locations.  While I was there though work was fun but the company went too heavy into the cellphone race and that fueled their bankruptcy.  They quit all the stuff that made them great just to try to compete in the cellphone market.  It didn't end well.
good,Radioshack was a decent company to work for. I believe they are all closed in the area now. I wish some were still open i would have made a very good manager for the company.
good,was ok place to work management had unrealistic goals pay was low had to jump through hoops just to get bonus and it wasn't very much prices to high told my area supervisor company would go bankrupt and it did
good,When I started 13 years ago the company was starting to fail. Over the next 11 years I saw poor judgments lead the company to bankruptcy and 2 more years later they went into a second bankruptcy. One more year and they are down to 24 stores that are liquidating.
good,I put in a lot of hours a small store and was only given so many hours to give out to employees so I had to make up for their hours. Great sales training and good competition to keep you motivated. Great fellow associates.
good,"I've been a loyal employee of Radio Shack for many years. I have seen the good, the bad and the ugly of this struggling electronics retailer. I was fortunate to leave Radio Shack before they closed for business."
good,A typical day at work was pretty slow and uneventful. I was not very challenging or competitive. The one good thing I learned was fixing phones which turned out to be a pretty interesting process. Management was pretty relaxed and supportive. There was absolutely nothing hard about this job.
good,"I came to RadioShack in the dead of Winter 2014, near the very end of the company's life."
good,"As my first job, I gained much of my now honed sales and customer service experience in the Shack. I loved the team I worked with, and at the time took everyone's hours while they were away or busy. I ran the store and worked with the District Manager, handling inventory shipments, sales quota, and displays alongside marketing. It was a priceless experience."
good,The Job itself was fun the problem came with the lack of communication with management and corporate to employees. Sometimes would get 3-4 different answers to solve a problem and still ended up getting talked to
good,"If you plan on ever using technology, Radio Shack is a great place to learn the fundamentals of that field. I just wished that the company could've lasted."
good,"This company was average in many ways. The amount of stress was low, but the work was not challenging. The culture at the location where I was employed was relaxed and the manager was accommodating and encouraging."
good,"My typical work day, as a part time employee my duties were to greet and assist all customers . Being located inside the mall located in a busy area. It was a non stop all day but fun enjoyable co-workers."
good,Radioshack was a company with a great work culture but near the end they started cutting more and more employees while pushing the cut workload up to the manager. As the store manager I was doing the job of 3 different people without any compensation for my work beyond the base compensation from before the extended workload.
good,"My review would be pointless unfortunately. You cant get a job a RadioShack anymore."
good,Recognition makes employees feel good about their workplace and their job. Written recognition in the form of thank you letters doubles the impact of employee recognition. You can use these thank you letter samples in your workplace
good,Theres not much to say truthfully. the job for the most part is easy. there is a lot of sitting around waiting for customers and than when they do come in they dont usually buy something
good,"Radioshack was fun to work at my store, however, upper management was too demanding, and gave only 10 days' notice before closer, and asked me to work overtime without pay...."
good,Easy going. Great boss. Just a par time job while in college. Knew radio shacks were closing so I did not see a lot of advancement opportunity. Took it as just an easy part time job.
good,"Most of my days were spent (unnecessarily) rearranging products according to constantly changing planograms (or display guides), many of which were arbitrary in nature. Between these, however, I learned a great deal in customer service, and became acquainted with the various systems for cell phone contracts as part of my position. The hardest part was the monotonous planograms. The most enjoyable part was probably friendly regulars, and occasionally getting to do toy demos."
good,This job consist of packing up boxes in trucks as fast as you can. I learned how to work fast and stay focused on my duties. Management was always walking around making sure everyone was working. The people you work with was different everyday depending if you were on shipping or receiving. The workplace culture was fun because you interacted with different people form different cultures. The hardest part of this job was the long hours and how much of a impact it had on your back. I enjoyed the rapid pace because it made the day go by very fast.
good,"Store in my city was never busy, a lot of downtime to clean up the accumulated dust and hang around. Very very small commission and not much incentive to hit sales goals, besides on batteries."
good,"Working at Radio Shack inside TArget was a cool job for a high school student, I enjoyed not only working with people at my job but also working with the employees of Target.Job was very easy."
good,"It was a great place to work, but it needs better management, its was horrible on that. But the most enjoyable part of the job was when you find what the consumer needed."
good,"Great customers with a good atmosphere to learn about and sell electronics."
good,Work there for 8 years. Do to poor business decisions the company is now on its second bankruptcy.  Pay is below other retailers in the area and will more then likely close all stores end of May 2017
good,This company had so much wrong with it I wouldn't know where to start. My personal experience working there wasn't the greatest. the did however have good deals when it came to getting phones.
good,"Began in Repair department at the Personal Computer manufacturing facility on Blue Mound Road, Tandy Home Computers. "
good,"This was a fun place to work. I was able to play with electronics and mastered the skill of persuasive selling and exceeded sales goals.. I oversaw smooth business operation as a general manager and functioned in an hr capacity hiring my own staff,i was promoted to team leader and in made the telecommunication marketing and merchandizing manager which allowed me to use my creativity and utilize my innovative ideas. The hardest part of the job was the retail aspect of it. This is why I left to go nursing school."
good,"The typical work day starts slow but picks up, it can be a slow environment or a rapid pace. no two days are ever the same. sales are usually dictated by your ability to relate to customers and find what they want or give them something better."
good,"This was a first job. Though part-time, it help me to establish a good work ethic and stressed the importance  of proper customer service, time management skills, and how to adhere to a daily operations plan. "
good,The coworkers I had were amazing to work with and provided a fun environment. They were determined to show me the way of the game and taught daily procedures to take care of independently. Going into work I remember immediately having to check the quota for the day which more often than not was unrealistic.Sales techniques were meant to low blow the customer into a trade or deal that in return would benefit the store and leave them in debt.
good,"RadioShack was a great first job for me that helped me build my social skills. I learned how to greet and approach customers, finding out what they need and how it works, as well as learning how to manage a store. My manager was great, he very knowledgeable, friendly, and easy to work with. The hardest part of the job was being the only associate there at some points due to the lack of staff, which meant dealing with several customers at a time while being alone. The most enjoyable part of the job was helping customers understand our products, and showing them how it would benefit them for whatever they needed it for. I had many repeat customers who would come back to seek my assistance because of the great job that I did."
good,"I worked with some cool people at Radioshack, unfortunately there were far too few of us. The manager was constantly forced into working crazy hours which lead to an in general more stressful work environment. They day to day was also pretty slow, but the complexities of the what we often had to do(provide detailed info to customers about various electronics/components) was challenging. Ultimately, every thing done was overshadowed by the closing of the store or even potential death of the company. A lot of the issues I had may have been resolved if there was just more money to go around."
good,"You are there by yourself most of the day running the store and taking care of customers and operations the entire day sometimes without the labor hours to have someone come in so you can take a lunch break off the clock or just a breather for a moment without running around knocking everything out, even big projects by yourself. "
good,A good customer service job. There was never a dull moment.  Sales Associates always have a good opportunity to help customers.
good,working there allowed me to be m0re responsible. I learned to communicate with people on a more professional level and got an idea of how the work force operate .
good,-A typical day at work would be very slow and plenty of mean customers. I learned to watch out and notice shoplifters. The manager was very nice and helped me learn a lot. My coworkers were fun to be with and intelligent. The hardest part of the job was dealing with customers that are rude and others that would steal but the most enjoyable part was having amazing coworkers that  would always help you when needed.
good,"As a part-time employee, I was able to grasp the general idea of retail. Most people would think that it is only important to sell a product, but RadioShack showed me the importance of engaging with clients to guarantee their return. I tended to get more things done than my co-workers. The hardest part of the job was convincing clients to buy things they really did not need, but surprisingly I am really gifted at doing this."
good,"The company really let itself go, focused on Wireless sales to keep afloat, forced to push cell phones on every customer, ask for upgrade checks, harass about new phones or switching companies, and shoving batteries at everyone who walked up to the register. Sales expectations were ridiculously high and the incentives to sell where nonexistent. My manager was amazing, however the rest of my coworkers not so much. District Managers were tough but fair."
good,"RadioShack taught me many people skills that helped me in sales. For the most part working at RadioShack was fun, but can get overwhelming during the holiday season. I did think there were too many regional meetings that were a burden to drive to. Overall is was a good working experience."
good,it was a great place to work and build knowledge of electronics. I learned a lot during my time at radio shack. there are many other things i learned as well.
good,I worked at Radio Shack while attending school and I gained experience in customer service. Management was very helpful and we all worked together to achieve our sales' goals.
good,Productive Work place with great experienced colleagues. Great sales training along with marketing and business review ironically. Lots of hardware experience.
good,"It was alright, everyday was the same. We ate the food we sold at %50 off. They will try to get two stores out of you, when they're paying you for one. The job was easy and my co-workers were fun."
good,"As a former store level manager, working for RadioShack was as good a job as you wanted it to be. With a well trained team beside you and a district level manager you can work with, RadioShack was an awesome place to work. Constant updates to product stock, getting the scoop on upcoming tech, and the general ""feel-good"" vibe of helping a 76 year old woman replace the batteries in an old weather station while she tells you a story of days of yore were commonplace in a day to day scenario. The real problem with RadioShack was, and still is, its price-point on most items and the trickle-down funnel of negativity from upper management. It really sucks all of the fun and gratitude out of working there. The most difficult part of my job, in particular, was trying to balance out having a positive attitude and sales perception to my team while constantly being bombarded by ever-increasing sales metrics. It's very hard to motivate a team of individuals to want to sell items to customers when the metrics they have to hit are outrageous. It was always a frustrating game of see-saw between metrics and morale. Outside of that, RadioShack was (for the most part) a fairly enjoyable place to work and advance my knowledge of technology."
good,"the daily work is sales. maintaining a neat, clean and presentable work place. "
good,"Manage a sales team"
good,"I learned a lot about consumer electronics, specifically relating to mobile phones and do-it-yourself projects. Most of my coworkers and I supported each other in our duties."
good,sales where always happening. busy all thru year. money was paid by hour or commission. to many test taking. products where easy to sell. the services took alot of time to finish contract and connect the phones
good,The company was great to work for. The bankruptcy was not all that great it made me unsure of a job.I learned a lot in my experience with RadioShack I know how to manage a store I learned how to sale commission base stuff
good,You get a chance to work with many talented and dedicated people that will work harder than anyone else in the business. You will learn how to read a PnL and operate as if you were a business owner. Despite the cutbacks the company has made and will made I enjoyed my years with them and appreciate the opportunities it gave me.
good,"For those who are looking to get a foot in the door and learn great skills concerning electronics this is a great starting out position. This position give you skills in the retail side of business: stocking and re stocking, up selling techniques, as well as training with current cell phones from the major providers both contract and no contract."
good,"Radio Shack showed me that what you put into a job, that's what you will get out of it. Work life balance was ok once you learn the job but that was only with a perfect staff which was hardly ever."
good,"The people at my level was like family, almost all of my immediate managers were great.  When needed there were long hours, but fellow workers helped when they knew how. In the marketing area it was difficult to get normal IT to understand that the business users changed the requirements not just to do so, but because the more they learned the more they refined their request."
good,Your day was driven on wireless sales and how to create new ones. daily we would do inventory counts as well as setting planograms. We would also make sure that prices in the store were up to date at all times.
good,"Radioshack was always the go to place for gadgets and parts. But they never progressed because there were too many ""brilliant"" people with ideas trying to run the company. Always switching out CEO's who thought they were so smart and thought they knew the future of the company but were just as ignorant as the last. By trying to compete with other companies like Best Buy, who sold all forms of tech, they lost the key form of their brand, which was in the parts and gadgets that you couldn't find at Best Buy, or any other tech store. Also, they never took advice from ground level (the managers). And they worked us to many hours and demanded to much from the stores. And when advice and input was given to the higher ups it was ignored, (as if they dealt with what we dealt with on a day to day basis)."
good,"My experience with this employer was ok in the fact that I learned how to cut corners to make projects come together. We never had enough time to do it how they wanted, not enough hours. It was do 1 thing right and do another wrong. but stay on pace...I dont know...not many incentives, impossible bonuses made going to work a drag some days."
good,"I took care of programing cell phones and contracts, bill pays. Management was ok. Most of the co-workers were nice to work with. The hardest part of the job was dealing with some of the customers. I enjoyed most was learning something new."
good,"A typical day for me is opening store at 10am, counting the money making sure the store sales tags are up to date and providing great customer service. my older manager was the best. co workers are nice."
good,"This job often required us to have technical knowledge about all of the products we sold. Most training was done online, but I found my background and interest in electronics to be most beneficial."
good,"I enjoyed my first few months at Radioshack as someone who just got out of high school. Pay isnt that great, but its something."
good,So much leadership change without a clear direction and watching cash go to zero so now we are in bankruptcy.  So many lost jobs and still paying executives large salaries.
good,The job keeps you in tune with retail practices as well as on top of technology. The retail aspect ensures you are socially on track with your sales and people skills. The product knowledge teaches and keeps you abreast of the newest and hottest innovations in electronics.The culture and the people are very pleasant. The hardest part of the job is dealing with customer complaints and as of late the entire state of the business.
good,"Retail position, company is now in bankruptcy, forcing me to look for a career opportunity. I have been loyal to this company since my first day. I am sad to be in this position."
good,"I was hired as a sales associate and quickly became key- holder at this store. I learned that communication among the management team and associates is vital to an enthusiastic work place environment and exceed goals.  My managers helped me understand  business analysis, how to improve the complete customer experience, and the many facets of forecasting, training, and setting goals for the business.  The hardest and most enjoyable part was the gaining product knowledge to better assess a customer's needs."
good,"Fun and fast paced, co workers can be fun depending on competitive drive."
good,"Assist customers with purchase choices. We have to have a working knowledge of many aspects of technology. Cell phones, telephones, radio communications, television and related products, computers and networking and related electronics. Home entertainment and cool toys.  Batteries of every nature as well as installation. We have a team of ""nerdy"" intelligent co-workers. The hardest part of the job is not fitting a product to the customers needs. the most enjoyable part is informing customers and assisting, training as well, with their new purchase and all set in a fun setting. Using the demo's in store too."
good,"But it was a sales job.  Once their stock started to fall dramatically, their were so many changes that it was impossible to keep anyone around.  Tenured managers would resign due to the ridiculous goals that the DM would set.  What finally drove me out was the fact that they wanted to me sell high tech smart phones with all of the bells and whistles to the elderly to boost our sales.  All the customer would want would be a prepaid phone for safety purposes, but we would be pushed to sell the items just to get the inventory moving."
good,"I Start off the day by making sure all the products in the store are priced and visible to all the customers. Making the store look organized and presentable is mandatory from my view, no one would want to shop at a dull messy store. I'm the type of guy who is always looking for better opportunities to make a better living for me and to progress in this culture. You will always catch me learning something new day by day, if its not about technology its about what goes outside of radio shack. When I got hired at Radio Shack the manger hired me on the spot because he saw this urge of wiliness to do anything possible to move up the ladder of success, and I did second week of work and my manger offered me the opportunity to become a phone technician. I took it of course knew that it was a good start to my career in life. I enjoy a day at work with my coworkers because we've all become close and always support one another whenever we need it. There really isn't a hard part of my job, not that I can say everything is easy because its not, all you need is patience and basic knowledge. I love my job because I get to interact with different people all the time, and im always learning something new. So overall a typical day at work is how you want it, If you want it fun and easy you can make it like that, if its not like that then that's on you."
good,"After reviewing the sale I verify all refunds for the day and ensure inventory is correct. Then set the sales goals for the day . Also, "
good,it was a great experience. it was a slow paced store and we really didnt have to many customers. this was a temporary position. it was fun working with  my coworkers. i just disliked the area the store was located in. It was a very open environment to work in.
good,"It was a good place to work for the time i was there, however i think compensation for managers could have been a little higher."
good,"Much of what I dealt with at RadioShack, I had little experience with beforehand. Within a week or two of working with the company I felt confident explaining the use of all of the devices for sale."
good,Same as before interesting place to work as well as learning environment.
good,the job was cool and laid back but alittle to laid back for me and made me become lazy the management is very unorganized and plays alot of favorites . overall the job was nice but money wise if youre not manager i wouldnt advise this job to no one.. they cheat you with pay im here till i find a better job
good,A good starting job for entry level with the ability to move up into management. Must be willing to work 5-6 days per week and available all hours that store is open.  Must be good at time management as well as multi-tasking to be successful. Must develop a Team that can execute programs and be able to react quickly to change in programs or environment.  The hardest part of job was not having a good balance of life due to staff reductions and the manager having to pick up the slack and extra hours.  The enjoyable part was all of the loyal customers that you meet and get to know over the years.
good,"Organizing different sections of the store, counting the register before and after shift. Made weekly audits with staff and manager. Learned how to set up phone lines and the difference between the items. My co-workers were very outgoing and fun to be around with along with management. The hardest part of the job was inventory and rearranging all the items from one section to another."
good,A typical day at work would be to check any updates with new products and any updates with the visual merchandising. We also were informed of any inventory drop offs. The work day included working with customers that would come in and finishing the day off with regular store cleanup. I learned how to read charts for incoming inventory items as well as operating the stores P.O.S system. Management is not so great; doesn't listen to the employees. My coworkers were quite negative towards the job and destructive towards store merchandise. The hardest part of my job was to learn the ins and outs of all new products that came to our story often. The most enjoyable part of my job was communicating with customers. I enjoyed helping them with whatever it was they needed.
good,"when i first started working here i was lied too. i was supposed to get a assistant manager position, but come to find out after the interview and everything i was only getting a sales associate job. but they still want me to do assistant work. its a nice place to work if you are a teen looking for his or her first job but not for someone that has a family. i feel they are too demanding at time for so little pay."
good,Provides a decent work environment and job security however its lack of opportunities for advancement provide low morale for its sales representatives and managers.
good,Radioshack is a great place to get into knowing more about today's electronics and business. The ability to work in a comfortable work place and learn about what you love is an abundance at Radioshack.
good,"Overall not a bad place. Easy to excel in but with sales falling every year but sales goals staying at a constant high, it can be tedious"
good,A typical day at work involves plenty of merchandising (putting items away and cleaning the store). It is a great opportunity to learn about many aspects of technology. Co-workers were probably the best part of the job. The hardest part of the job... is answering tough tech questions(as an associate) as a manager the job can be impossible if you have a weak team . Unsure of job stability at this point. And the compensation for managers is not enough for the work
good,radio shack isnt doing well right now so they are changing everything.  being a manager it was like a different theme each week. rssp or surveys ect...
good,"If you want to do well with RadioShack it is possible, but the hours are long and it is demanding. This is a job for single people who don't have a significant other. There is a lot of fun to be had but the hours and work are demanding and you wont have much of a life outside of work. I loved it and did quite well, but I am looking to settle down and that is just too hard to do working 5-6 days a week and 10+ hour days."
good,back in 2006 paid really well. became like most box technology shops very service plan driven. stopped paying employees
good,"Working at Radio shack I got to play with all of the latest toys first. I learned about computers, cellular service, satellite service, land line telephones, and security systems. I even learned to install most of these things myself and I was a very young woman when I began working for the company."
good,a typical day at work would start with the  reviewing  and planing of the  wireless call log list. also we participated on the   morning conference calls from the district manager to go over our sales goals
good,"I gave this only three stars based on the end result, sales goals. Each month we have to meet quotas and if we don't then it's no big but if it's a repeated process then you get fired. I had my job threatened multiple times because I wasn't meeting my district managers expectations and made working there unbearable. Everything else though with my co-workers was a fun experience."
good,must have flexibility if you would like to pursue a part time job
good,i learned customers like the friendly repetitive business
good,Great place to learn about the latest technology. You must be sales oriented because pay is commission based.
good,great customer service. every moment you're on the floor your customers and your sales are your main focus
good,"i worked for radio shack doing sale, my job was to interact with the customer and help them to be informed of any product they might be interested in buying. hardest part of the job would of been trying to up sell the customer. the best part would of been knowing your customer left happy"
good,  The kiosk I worked at was a slow location and it was tough to get sales.  The kiosk manager was friendly and understanding.  While the people at the store were nice and made us feel welcome.  They seemed to appreciate the help that we gave them when we could. The most difficult thing to deal with here was the pay.  The base pay was low. It was 8.87/hr with Radio Shack and 9.25 with Market source.  The commission or spiff was also very low.
good,"Being at store at 8 am and keeping track of all transactions from the last day, looking at the sale and setting daily goal for store and all associates. taking care of shipments and scheduling. open the store at 9 am. Going over the sales and goals with associates. Teaching the persuasion technique to the team. there is a friendly competition between co-workers. Merchandising and is the hardest part. and the most enjoyable part was succeeding in sales and goals.     "
good,"Great team environment, but the benefits were horrible! However, there is new leadership, and things may change..."
good,I have come to learn alot from working a RadioShack. I learn about P&L being competitive with sales and numbers. Growing and training a team of sales people. 
good,Had a great time here with this company when I was younger but I cant see myself working there in the future
good,"Commission structure was decent, staff was good, but a good manager is rare."
good,"Days go by very slow due to low traffic, with the exception of Christmas season. Many training courses that don't help you make money. Pay is hourly with low commission on electronics and service plans. Cell phone sales have high commission rates. Better off working for ATT, Sprint, T-Mobile or Verizon and avoid the things that won't help you get paid."
good,"A typical day at work contained different ethical backgrounds and personalities of people.  I learned how to satisfy any customer no matter how nasty their attitude is.  Management is as overrated as i thought it to be, i actually fell in love with it .  My co-workers were amazing and make me feel glad to come to work everyday.  The hardest part of the job is managing the hours due to certain expectations. The most enjoyable part of the job is profiting and recognition for great sales."
good,It was a fun work environment. Management and coworkers were great. It is a good second job or part-time job. Hours are hard to come by unless you have worked their awhile.
good,"The typical work schedule was to clock in and read over the company news/emails if there were not customers to already immediately assist. Discuss with the manager/boss over what were the goals for the day (i.e.; price changes, product stocking, advertisement, special sales to push, etc.) Customer service and knowledge of all product, and where it was in our store was essential."
good,"Radioshack is a great place to work, ESPECIALLY if you are a teenager or otherwise new to the work force. They provide excellent training compared to other companies, and the information you will learn will help you in jobs to come. The compensation is decent, but it can vary by location since the pay is commission-based. The team-building exercises are pleasantly cheesy. I actually miss working there sometimes."
good,Greet customers and help them out to choose the correct item needed.
good,"Be productive and assist each customer, keeping the floor clean. Learned how to work a register, push for a sale, do inventories. Good management, re-arranging the store to facilitate customer service. Co-workers were great, couples of guys and girls I enjoyed working with. Hardest part of the job, assist several customers during holidays."
good,Radio shack is a great company to work for! They are very understanding when it comes to trying to balance your life.
good,"A typical day at work in RadioShack. Greeting the customers finding out what their needs were, and meeting those needs. Whether they were there to purchase a cell phone,house phone or any other electronics our store offered. We were there to assist sometimes we even had to run credit checks for various providers.Ex:Sprint,Verizon,At&t. We answered incoming customer calls to our store and provided them with their needs, whether it was to price an item or something as small as finding out our store hours. We stocked and did pricing as well. That was a typical day at RadioShack for our team."
good,"A typical day on the sales floor would consist of working the register, replenishing inventory if needed, answer customers questions as well as educate them on the latest gadgets available in-store."
good,"help customer with what they are looking for, checkout customers, greet customers, engage customers into a product they may be interested in, planograms, stocking items, scanning store for prices or missing tags, count register at close time, close store, open store"
good,"Ok for a highschool kid or someone fresh out of college, terrible compensation"
good,Pretty cool people that you work with and the managers and those higher motivate you to do great. Fun place to work and challenging
good,Lots of waiting for customers. Pretty slow days until the last few hours of the day when everyone decides to show up and shop.
good,"Radioshack used to be a very stable company although it has lost a lot of its stability due to financial problems. Decent company to work for, but not very competitive pay."
good,Good place to work at. But due to economical crisis. Sales and pay rate changed considerably.
good,Radio shack is a pretty good company to work for i would just say it was not really for me.
good,"I enjoy working there interacting with customers, you make your own money once yoy set yoy goal beacuse its based pay plus commisson."
good,"It's a good place to start in retailing. It gives the employee a jump start knowledge on technology and up selling items. Downfall is the community you are working with and the customers always have a blame towards the company. The paycheck is depending on how hard the worker works, usually is hard to get commission since the competition between Radio Shack and others are so great."
good,It's a great place to work at if you need a part time job while in school. Your always seeing different faces and always interacting with new people. it's a plus if you love electronics because your always around them.
good,radio shack is a fun and great environment that treated employees with respect i have learned a lot products and customer service its a great starter job
good,RadioShack is no longer in business as a corporation. There are owner owned stores scattered across the country. A company purchased the website portion.
good,"Es un empleo regular, que absorbe casi todo el tiempo del día; rolaba turnos, hacia aperturas y cierres. Lo peor, llevaba 1 minuto tarde y me penalizaban, pero salía 30 o 40 minutos después, y no pasaba nada. Cono para empleo permanente, no le veo agradable."
good,"This was my first job during & after college. The manager was very fair, & respectful. I was able to receive more than enough hours for my time there. It was a nice part-time job, unfortunately the store closed !"
good,Enjoyed this company. Wished they were still in business. Gave me many opportunities to improve skillsets and assisted in supporting my future management profession.
good,"This was my first real job as an assistant manager. I enjoy the people that I worked with, and genuinely had fun here. Having to push phone sales was annoying but it was what it was. You could tell as a company the times were changing and Radio Shack was no longer relevant."
good,This was a start off job for which after holding it for 3yrs decided to get personal and advanced myself to higher challenges at a cellular level(Sprint). This company is a pickup job for the light gamer in sales.
good,RadioShack was a great learning experience for me. Taught me great customer service skills. Showed me how to problem solve by listening first then break down the issue to solve it.
good,My manager was amazing and acutally cared about his employees. The money was great to be a sales associate. Depending on your motivatio  you can male $30 am hour simply my selling phones
good,Radio Shack was my first job and they provided me with the opportunity to improve my personnel management skills and they had a great benifits package.
good,Management at the time I was with Radio Shack was very good.  All associates in the AP team were compensated fairly and treated respectfully.  Training was top notch and benefits were very good.
good,RadioShack was a comfortable and welcoming environment. I enjoyed the friendly competition with my coworkers that drove us to achieve our sales goals. I enjoyed interacting with regular and new customers in our neighborhood. It is unfortunate that the company did not stand in certain areas.
good,"In my experience, the management at the Lake Jackson was one of the best parts about working there."
good,"Provided IT-related guidance to customers on purchases related to personal computing, in-home computer networking and small business computer networking."
good,"My survey answers simply reflect that this company no longer exists.  If it did then yes I would recommend it."
good,"Learn alot about electronics and hobbyist equipment.    Very skilled at product knowledge, had most of the latest electronics, especially cellular devices."
good,It was a good place to start training in the art of sales. They provided plenty of classes on different selling techniques. Once I got in to management I learned a lot about employee management and the behind the scenes of running a retail business.
good,great place to work but issues to management. you learn alot with the training and get great experience. Radioshack would have been able to stay afloat but the company leadership got everything all wrong.
good,Es grato cuendo de verdad se siguen los estándares de visión y misión de la compañía
good,"Buen ambiente de trabajo pero demanda mucho tiempo si tienes un puesto de Subgerente o gerente, no paga días festivos ni horas extras a empleados de confianza y pocas posibilidades de ascenso"
good,With the exception of the pay. I enjoyed my time there. I had a great relationship with the staff and supervisor. I enjoyed helping the customers. Training was helpful. The store was always neat and clean. The store was located in a great location and store hours were good.
good,"Constant changing environments"
good,Radio shack helps you learn new things regarding electronics and phones. My multitasking maximized by the time I left. Flexible schedules. Train as you go.
good,I  enjoyed working at RadioShack  until aboutba year ago. The benefit change up.the commission change up.my hours has change from fulltime to part-time.noe my job is closing soon.. I need to find a new job before they closed down.
good,this was my first job under commission. very competitive but through that come the healthy competition amongst your employees. healthy competition and sales generates a great revenue stream for the store
good,I enjoyed my job but there was too many test on the computer required but management would not give me enough hours to complete the testing along with selling the products. This store is now closed.
good,Fairly easy job. I worked on commission so it is very competitive at times. When there is less people walking into the store you have to jump on the customer hoping they will buy something.
good,"In the last 15 years I have learned a lot.  There have been several changes that I had to adapt to.  Over all the company was a good company to work for, now the company is going through another bankruptcy and it is time for me to leave."
good,Assisted each customer by listening and finding out the best solution with the best of my ability. A smooth and over the top service is what I strive for.
good,"The people i worked with were great, Pretty easy job for the most part given my sales background."
good,"Enjoyed my first 8 years. Meetings were fun. Compensation was great, bonus structure was incredible. The 9th year pay structures changed, commissions changed. As bankruptcy and company finances dwindled it became hard to work, hard to keep staff and morale was bad. There isn't much of the structure of it's origins left. Left the company as final buyout was approaching."
good,The most intensive preparation for their employees and managers.  The atmosphere was very competitive in this sales driven job.
good,"I've worked at radio shack for 3 years now and the biggest part of my job that I enjoy is helping the customers fix their problems. And making custom adapters. "
good,"I was part-time, my work shifts consisted of me setting up displays and resetting the store. The hardest part of the job was understanding my boss."
good,"Operations remained the same every morning, but from time to time we would have different sales representatives that I would join with to give seminars and tips about new products that were getting ready to launch. I always made sure to make activities fun as we learned ways to create a better and productive business that everyone was involved with. As a team we learned as much as possible to prepare ourselves to be successful."
good,"Each day at Radioshack could be different, Dealing with customers of all ages and many different projects."
good,"Great place to learn new things about anything technology wise, sad to know there are very few of them left. Learned about major cell phone companies, and about many varies of small parts for projects."
good,"A typical day is usually filled with going  planograms and reviewing inventory. After the operational procedures are done the rest of the day is taking care of the customers. Radioshack itself has not taught me anything however, I have learned a lot from the customers that enter the store. Originally I was stationed downtown where I learned much about the finance, marketing, and advertising world. Without a doubt the customers is what I love most about working in retail."
good,Provided full benefits to all employees. The management are educated and train employees well. You are paid hourly plus commission and are provided paid vacation days.
good,"We have some great days at Radioshack with lots to learn and a bunch of fun to be had."
good,"Great job when it comes to earning hourly wages and commission based pay. Some days vary when it come to making sales and the only forms of difficulty is selling multiple carrier phones. The job description may have changed at the time before my store at Summer St in Boston MA closed. The manager was cool to communicate too, and the task weren't too strict. I only wish the pay per hour was a bit higher than it needs to be. Overall, its a good starter job for those who are interested in selling electronics."
good,"Loved Customer service and The Job Plus was the latest Technology on Tvs. The downfall I saw was Socializing by  The Young Crew outside of the Job But When We worked as a team, All was GREAT"
good,It has it's good and bad moments just like any company does. But overall all my hard work paid off when i got promoted and got a very decent race along with it. Just most retails jobs it requires a lot of your time and presences.
good,"Pretty relaxed work environment, rarely a rude customer. You do everything around the store like stocking, cleaning, selling, which is expected. Never really gets busy, most days are near dead."
good,"This was a wonderful job to learn how to be a manager.  The atmosphere was fun and staff was like family.  Being a call center, it could be stressful, but there was support when you needed it."
good,A typical work day requires providing excellent customer service through strong product knowledge. The ability to provide accurate information to customer questions regarding complex consumer electronics. Employee training was on-going and not just part of an orientation period.
good,"I provide customer service to multiple customers throughout the day. I handle money transactions throughout the day at the end of each sale. As an associate I also take inventory of the products inside the store. I also provide wireless carrier services as well. At the end the night I do proper protocol while closing such as wipe down phones, windows, and countertops, taking out the trash and vacuuming."
good,"A typical day of work start it working with a different types of customer. In radioshack you learn to control yourself, have the capacity to be a multitasker with no exception. Usually we have a good kind of environment, we handling a lot of calls during the day. The most fun is that we are multi-professionals."
good,"Expect the same normal duties on a daily basis. The employees are friendly, but not much goes on. Most of the day is filled with tedious task to keep you busy."
good,"Great place to work, but the condition of the company right now is terrible with declaring bankruptcy, pay isnt great and benefits stink too"
good,"I spent alot of my early years working for Radio Shack. Even though i did enjoy my time there, i believe i left at the right time. In commission paying jobs, its always best to have a progressive payment structure for your frontline employees. When i left, the payment structure, started to change. The employees were getting paid less, and everyone knew it. Employees need some sort of an incentive to start moving the merchandise especially the ones with the highest gross profit margin, and Radio Shack was taking that away. Its been years since I've worked for the company so i don't know if the company has changed for the better. Hopefully it has but i doubt it."
good,Great people who I worked with and they helped me to make me feel comfortable. I learned about electronics and activated phones for customers. I also helped them troubleshoot any issues they had with their own tools.
good,Day could be long and sometimes could be short. Good days depending on the time of the month and the type of customers that come through the door. Management is ok as long as you abide by their rules. Your co workers are friendly but are always out for themselves. Hardest part of the job is if you are not in a stable mental form this job might not be meant for you.
good,"•Typical day-to-day as a Sales manager includes will service, sell and manage for the company for all stores in the district related technologies, and facilities."
good,The bosses like to tell you how much money they spend on stupid things while making you feel poor and like you don't make nearly enough and you are surrounded by employees who do not care.
good,"The management was great, the people were awesome, and was a great sales experience."
good,"Freedom in the workplace, A little to much push on sales for a retail position but all in all a great job."
good,Learned a ton of things about electronics and tech advancement. Great training methods and hands on teaching. Great energy and love for customer and product from the whole team. The most enjoyable was just the family enviroment. The hardest part was the lack of compromise that was given to employees when it came to customer satisfaction.
good,RadioShack would be a great place to work if the pay was competitive and if they gave raises based on performance.
good,"Franchise store with family owned business. Handled sales, returns, and incoming freight."
good,"Recuerdo que el día 24 la tienda estuvo repleta de clientes,teníamos que ser muy rápidos y no perder la calma estar al pendiente de cada cliente, peor aun porque justo ese día  llegaron muchos a hacer reclamos referentes a los productos llevados  días anteriores."
good,u make more money at a fastfood if that location isnt busy with rich customers
good,"A typical day at radio shack involved management of a team of sales agents. Interaction with customers, inventory, shipments,sales. Leading a team was the best part of the job. Seeing our branch as a whole succeed is a great feeling. The hardest part of the job we were understaffed so I worked what ever hours need to be covered. I learned how to work well with a team, also how to manage a team of successful employees."
good,Sometimes slow. sometimes fast paced.  Always a lot to absorb and learn about!
good,"Radioshack is a great place to spend 10-20 hours a week as a student. "
good,"Gained a lot of managerial experience"
good,"I have learned that with the skills you pick up through out working, are skills that are transferable to other positions."
good,"We must meet certain quotas each month in five different categories; cell phone sales, insurance sales, batterie sales, attach %, and general sale per hour. The most enjoyable part of the job is getting to work with customers first hand. I love helping people and getting them what they need and giving them the best most pleasant experience possible when they come in to the store."
good,"Cool place to work at, co-workers are fun, management could be better, I love being able to talk to as many customers as I do and do such a great job in my sales, great location, lots of business."
good,"Good work environment, provide good compensation, the most enjoyable was the customer-sales relation."
good,"This job taught me a lot about technology, salesmanship, and data cataloging.  Never too fast-paced, but brisk business; the worst part was pacing oneself on slow days.  Management was friendly, if impersonal, and the customers were all easy-going.  Plus: free XM Radio while at work."
good,"The job can be very demanding. It was fun to help out customers with whatever issue they may have but the overall job isn't that great. Major con is no commission. Used to make decent money working for the company but they took away the pay. Still required to do the same amount of work, if not more, and get paid way less."
good,A good time if your a people person and like meeting new people all the time. You'll definitely get pulled out of your comfort zone if your normally not a very social person.
good,good job helping others find what they need family owned great experience. had a lot of fun.
good,"its a great place to work and make commissions if you're in a busy store, but the management is poor and the sales goals are unrealistic."
good,Lots of responsibility with little pay. Horrible benefit plans. Fun to work with customers and help solve their issues.
good,constantly merchandising
good,It was a relaxed working environment. Sales Driven. The management was great. Had a good experience with the coworkers. Downside was not enough hours were given.
good,"Except for the Rude manager, I loved that job!"
good,"My typical day at radioshack would begin by reviewing both my personal numbers, as well as my where my store stands for the month. After that I go over my managers approval log of the previous day, which includes things like reviewing price changes, returns, and essentially anything that had to do with product and finances. I walk the store and make sure all products in each sectioned are tagged and properly set. I delegate which tasks will go to which employee for the day. After that I oversee and assist my associates with both sales and operations."
good,"Work is pretty simple, get there and its pretty calm through the day, wish they had better employee sources for information, also wish the management was better place seems like a management mess."
good,If you are able to handle a fast paced management opportunity then this is the right place for you
good,"Slow commission based opportunity, great for entry level posistion"
good,RadioShack is of course very much driven by sales so there is a lot pressure to sell. But management can be very supportive and the commission made can really make a difference in the paycheck.
good,"At the time I worked there, 12 years ago, there was two much focus on cellphone sales. Sprint was in a hostile take over of the company, and it led to the demise of the company. However it is rebuilding with different models in malls that I would gladly work for if there was an opportunity where I lived. It is seeking to regain its status as a parts company, more difficult than 12 years ago with the proliferation of parts purveyors on the internet."
good,"-business slow, great environment."
good,Although you work long hours for little wages you and your team built life lasting bonds since you spent the majority of your life with them and limited work/life balance.
good,"Be ready for productive customer service. "
good,This company was a great company to learn different management styles with. I am saddened by the companies closure as the company always strive to show employees how each component is interconnected to another within the company.
good,"My store was closed after giving me and other employees less than a week's notice. Then I was ""transferred"" to another store without my knowledge. I was consequently terminated at that location after not showing up for a week. However, no one felt the need to contact me about my relocated job and new schedule."
good,I had the best boss/Market manager while all the store closures were happening. If Radioshack had decided to keep one or two stores open in my state I would probably still be working at my store.
good,"the management is what made that place enjoyable. great employees to work with. work was mindless, and easy. got customer service skills and learned about technology while working here, cant complain."
good,I love that I learn the aspect side of sales and really learning new products. It could be stressful at time but the over all experience was fun. The company had nice perks as well.
good,Is a good place to learn customer service and retail sales. a typical day at work would be making the store ready to open if your working the opening shift and greeting customers as they enter and helping them with what they came in for and make sure they have everything they need.
good,I liked the job great atmosphere able to converse with customers about there needs regarding products its a learn as you go store with a good feel to be a part of a group the only issue I had was there constant demand to sell phones when it was pretty much black and white that it would be foolish to buy a phone and even get into a service through radio shack because if all fails with the customers new product regarding there phone they would refer you to the actual company which would have been your best bet before you started the idea of getting one
good,"Company needs to improve how they interact through the levels of management.  Constant working and lack of location planning leads to limited customers, added stress and issues in customer service.  Management focusses on certain items rather than whole sales when rating employees, failure to have a 10% for batteries per ticket can lead you to get written up or fired."
good,"mucho trabajo, siempre habia que hacer en la tienda, aprendi sobre productos electronicos, la gerencia era buena, asi como los compañeros, la parte dificil era lograr terminar las tareas asignadas rapido para poder vender, lo mas agradable fue el ambiente y las capacitaciones constantes."
good,"I enjoyed my employment with RadioShack in Attalla, Al. Every District Manager that I worked with was supportive in my training as a manager and helped me make my store better."
good,The management at RadioShack has always been flexible with my school schedule and has helped me be able to work while attending the University of Maryland.
good,Radio Shack is great place to work and learn basic electronics. After working there for over 3 years I have learned an awful lot just being around customers and having great conversations. I would have to say that interacting with the customers and learning new things are the best part of the job.
good,"For the most part i enjoyed my job very much, worked with alot of nice people and customers. I made Very good pay at my young age. Would recommend anyone technologically inclined to give it a shot."
good,I cant really say that it was too bad. I mean the manager was cool and my co-workers were very understanding and friendly.
good,"Great Honor to be Promoted to the biggest store in the district, also a great pressure. I saw that there was no room for failure, and with that had to be team work. I restrained and assembled a team that would drive sales and know operations to move to the next level. We set sales records since 1975, when the mall opened Radio Shack. Great team work and we finished with a win!"
good,After view years of working with this company it was losing sight in my opinion of the customers needs and wants focusing on specific sales gains I.E mobile phones. Lessing there options to the customer for overall shopping experience. I did learn many technical skills in various electronic fields while they were still available and sold by the company. Co-Workers seemed to dwindle due to cut backs and high demands for sales goals even unreachable by management.
good,company is growing again after bankruptcy fun place to work the managers in paradise and chico are very nice good people to work for company is still growing
good,"It almost felt like home, the size was perfect and the atmosphere on most days you controlled. Its easy to form a good relation with your manager as it doesn't feel like you're always on the chopping block. Learned many little tips and tricks to make stuff work. Unfortunately I fell in love with the job and had to close the store. It was always a pleasure to come up with some way to fix a problem for the costumer."
good,"Over the ten years I have made great freinds in our small town. Helping people with their problems from cell phone issues to electronic's. My co workers are like family. What remains of Radio Shack our staff we have been there for ten years. So we work good as a team. Leaving is the hardest knowing that I'm leaving good people. It's almost like a family issue, divorce. Heartbreaking. When you help someone and seeing that smile because they couldn't or didn't want there equipment to be broken. "
good,On a daily basis on would come in at the start of their shift to make sure that all price tags are properly placed and the store was cleaned the night before. During the day one must make sure the there is product on the shelves and that the customers get the proper attention so that they know exactly it is that they came in to buy and at the end of the day the whole store would have to be cleaned and dusted and after the doors are locked we make sure that any old price tag gets taken down an replaced
good,Working for Radioshack was a life changing experience. I learned all the responsibilities as a Store Manager ; i was able to train and create an amazing sales team. I enjoyed every moment being employed with the company especially when my hard work was noticed and i was promoted.
good,They are going through a transition after bankruptcy. The policy has change and so has the inventory. Not sure how radioshack will still be the same.
good,To many things change to fast. Company can't make up their minds on important matters. They don't care about the people that actually do the hard work of the company.
good,"I worked with great people, love the work pace and environment. The company is having financial hardship and had to file bankruptcy causing it to be very difficult to secure a future."
good,"I liked my job, I had a good time with the people I worked with but the corporate management is clueless. The commissions are terrible and the fact that they make you work harder for less money is unacceptable to me."
good,"I worked for RadioShack Corporation for several years, and it provided a fairly stable schedule and good benefits for FT employees (paid vacations, insurance, stock options, etc.).  However, if you're not into meeting sales quotas and a high-stress retail atmosphere, then this company is not fit for you."
good,"Overall a great place to work, fun and pays decent. Everyday is a learning experience. good employee discounts. able to advance quickly"
good,"Management can be flexible -  let me work from home if I need to wait on a repairman.  "
good,"Worked in Saybrook Plaza. This used to be the busy store in Ashtabula.  I got promoted to manager in this store when they opened a brand new store in the Ashtabula Mall.  My sales numbers were compared to the previous year in the Saybrook store, when it was the busy store in Ashtabula, while the brand new store in the mall was compared to the old dumpy store in the Ashtabula harbor.  The mall store showed amazing sales gains compared to the old dumpy store, while sales in Saybrook went down, because people were now going to the brand new mall store."
good,Days are usually filled with challenging endeavors and various situations. Numerous opportunities to deal with different customers with a variety of purchasing interest and electronic issues. Management and employees are pretty close knit and work together to satisfy customers.
good,"estuve poco tiempo en esta empresa, ya que el ambiente era muy pesado, como se trabajaba por comisión los compañeros siempre se peleaban las ventas, y cuando el articulo que buscaba el cliente era de bajo costo, nadie lo quería atender, no se fomentaba una sana competencia"
good,"Radio Shack is a great place to work however they require you to do to much work without enough pay. "
good,"radioshack was like a second family, working closely with others and also while making money sells was the key to this job and gave a competitive work space with sells numbers"
good,I got hired as assistant manager and worked with a great manager and employees but the higher ups are just too dumb and have no idea what they are doing. They make the employees change the item display almost everyday and then tell them that the way they did is wrong and the District manager has no problem throwing employees under the bus even though it was his own fault for a mistake that he made.
good,"very flexible schedule"
good,"When you close the store it should be ready for the first customer of the day. That does not always happen. The right hand does not know what the left hand is doing. Your manager tells you one thing then the distract manager tells you some thing else when they decide to make an appearance. Upper management does not see the average RS store. There is days that you may not have but a few customers in the store and they wonder why you are not meeting your goals. The store closings are sad because RS use to be a electronic store but now all they want us to do is sale phones. There is a lot of old timers out there that wants to fix stuff them selves. I don't know how many times a day I hear RS is not what it use to be."
good,"My job there was exactly what I had been doing for the past 20+ years.  "
good,This job was a sales quota based environment. At the time I was required to have a minimum $50.00/ hour sales quota. I sold everything from cell phones and plans to Dish Network.
good,"Excellent pay. scheduling was reasonable, however the hours were very few."
good,"El salario base es muy poco, y la comision a veces es complicada sacarla ya que piden mucha venta y el porcentaje es bajo"
good,"Overall a good company to work for, honestly I really like Radioshack, but middle and upper management even if they started as a sales associate completely forget what it's like to BE a sales associate/store manager as soon as they become a district manager or higher. They're nice enough at face value but they treat their employees very badly."
good,"a typical day at work, helping assist customers with a product or questions they might have. I have learned everything there is to know about great customer service skills. My co-workers have helped me get out there and be comfortable with confronting customers on there problems and/or questions."
good,"A typical day has you on the sales floor then doing marketing tasks."
good,my typical day at radioshack was to always greet customers and I loved how they thought I was the sweetest thing ever hahah! our weekly basis was to sell at least 8 phones and at least three warenties for the most part I did what we had to do but if we didn't our store manager and district manager would get on our case it was a hard job because your pay was based on the sles yoyu did but economy now a days its so hard to sell phones but I did like the job showed me a lot of different things that most of the jobs I have had before
good,"We were given weekly and monthly sales goal, which pushed me into setting daily targets. This exercise brought out the best in me at achieving my goal and kept me motivated at all times."
good,"The Radio shack Corporation is a good start up job for young people, who are looking for some sales experience. Beyond that, it is a typical retail sales environment. You're judged based on your sales performance, and a lot of the sales goals they require, are unreasonable and unattainable depending on the store location. The compensation is Horrible, considering similiar jobs have a much higher compensation package. You sell cellular phones for all three carriers, and have attachment goals you have to hit with every sale. Most cellular companies pay 13/hr plus commission for their sales employees, whereas with radioshack, you get paid minimum wage plus a small commission. On top of this, you have added responsibilities of helping customers with ALL of their problems despite the fact they did not purchase anything. You also sell a variety of other products, and you have to juggle all of this, on top of store planograms, and offering meaningless promotions that most people arent interested in. The hours you are scheduled are based on sales performance, so if you ever fall behind on your sales goals, its near impossible to do better, considering you get 4 hours night shifts on a sunday."
good,"A typical day at Radio Shack can be intense. There are many goals  that you have accomplish by the end of the shift such as upgrade checks, opportunity calls to make and number of phones you must sell in a day. "
good,"I been with this company for two years going on three and I am looking for better benefits higher pay ... A typical day is being really busy ...multi-tasking , fast pace, and mainly consist of activating prepaid and post paid , customer question , and informing them of any benefits for them "
good,"The job itself is fairly easy. Co-workers are more like a family rather than co-workers. It is not a bad job, considering it is commission-based, but with recent commission changes, there has been a drastic drop in pay.."
good,I really enjoyed working for this company because you learn a lot about electronics and various items that you sell. You receive base pay and commission and part timers do receive benefits.
good,enjoyable place to work after the past managers were removed
good,"the staff was amazing, great management, unfortunately the pay was low"
good,"Come in to work help whom ever is next, sell phones and or warranties..after the boss leaves try to sell at least 3 more of everything. Closing time we count the till set the alarm and lock up."
good,"It's an ok job, could get boring at times. Lots of inventory and stocking involved."
good,Coporate shut down my store just recently because they are not doing very well in the stock market and their sales. They are a good company to work for but they have a high risk of laying you off due to shutting down their stores. They shut my store down even after I met all of my sales. I was the store manager and was probably one of the best store managers to date.
good,"selling phones through radioshack corp. inside Target Mobile kiosk. Not a hard job, until you actually try to activate a phone. There are too many tedious steps, 4 different carriers(at&t, tmobile, verizon, and sprint) that you have to learn about.and too much information to be taken in at a time. I lucked up with 2 great managers with totally different selling styles so it is easy for me to engage guests. Face it EVERYONE needs a phone. Half the time they come to you. Goal for one full day is only 1 phone. Easy! The days when you work alone are the most challenging when there is no one there to tell you the right way to do things"
good,Advancement potential is good. Management supports employees. Outstanding training. Retail hours and very little work-life balance for managers.
good,Hours 7am - 4 pm . Management great. Co-workers were hard worker and fun. Hardest part of day was some days doing the overtime. Most enjoyable part of day was the paycheks.
good,Opening or closing the store myself. Talking with customers about products. Making sales.
good,While I was a college student my manager position was excellent! But now looking for something new.
good,Quality workplace experience. Very good sense of teamwork. Store manager was excellent and good at relating her skills and experiences to help me succeed.
good,It is a good part time job for a student and for someone who just wants a part time job.  I had a nice time working here and liked the fast paced setting.
good,"a work day consists of regular duties helping customers with product. i learned how to sale"
good,This was a drastic departure from the existing management structure and store managers were slow to accept the changes.  By the time this program was in full swing it was successful but expensive to implement.  The company was not willing to make the initial investment nationwide to get to what would ultimately be a much more successful model.
good,Enjoyed working with the public and learn about new technology. Worked with a wonderful group of people. was able to use artistic skills to display new products.
good,there is always a level of advancement in this company and the people that work for RadioShack is great company to work for.
good,"Great place to work,stress free work environment,great team to work with,I really enjoy working with the public,What I really love about my job is helping the public out with all there electronic needs"
good,I learned a lot about people and the sales process during my time with them. I also liked to learn about the latest and greatest of technology which we had plenty off.
good,"From open to close I loved working with my diverse clientele with my team of superstars. Everything I learned about being a manager came mostly from my experience on the job (since I was just thrown into the fire) and I learned from my college courses as well. There were a few good managers, and even fewer outstanding ones, including myself. Once word spread about the mass layoff a lot of the managers kind of just mentally clocked out, although I knew I was going to be part of that, I gave my all day in and day out. I went weeks without a day off since other managers refused to captain inventories, thus resulting in me moving up to Senior Manager. The monster team that I had was personally recruited by me; I believe that a person-to-person interview is very crucial, you can hear tone of voice change when asking questions and read the potential candidates body language. The hardest part of working there was the daily down talk me and my team faced from what people were hearing in the news, but that never crippled us or discouraged us from performing. The best part of my job was working with my team, not only did I teach them how to sell, proper work etiquette, and customer relations, but I also helped them improve themselves as a person and gave them life lessons."
good,"started at sales rep and within a 2 months took on a role as a manager. a typical day consist of opening store and prepare for the day. I learned how to do payroll, do schedule for who was working and complete daily reports. the hardest part of the job was working 54hrs per week. the most enjoyable was the bond I had with the employees."
good,Radioshack teaches you the skills in selling various amounts of items. Great place to work if you need to balance school and work. Management has always treated fairly.
good,The most intriguing position that I have had the pleasure of being a part of. There were times that I would go from helping the regular cable seeking customer to helping the knowledgeable tinkerer and then transitioning to a conversation regarding the exponential progression of technology with my colleagues. The hardest part of the job would have to be dealing with altercations in general. I have had the same difficulty as a manager trying to resolve an issue that arises between two associates as well as between an associate and a customer.
good,"You may not get paid a lot. HOWEVER it is an easy job. It is a fun job as well, and I enjoy it.  Typical day, get to work, clock on, and just do what ever needs to be done IE missing tags, shipment"
good,There's next to nothing to do on a daily basis.You don't have any busy work to do. You assist customers whenever they come in & when there are no customers there's nothing to do but sit around. You have to vacuum everyday at the end of the day & make sure the store is presentable for the next day.
good,learned a lot great company but got out of the core of their customers and seem to focus on cell phones
good,easy to learn type of work. lots of networking. i learned a wide rang of skills dealing all cell phone companies
good,"When I first started with the company the slogan was ""you have questions we have answers"". At that time we had to know what almost everything in the store did before we were even allowed on the sales floor. Because of this I learned a lot about problem solving and coming up with unique solutions. I also learned a lot about customer service and how to handle difficult situations."
good,"Sales associates maintain the in-stock condition of assigned areas, and ensure that it is clean,"
good,"You will learn and experience new things everyday "
good,I really enjoyed radio shack and learned a lot bout being a good sales member. This is a great job to get into the tech world of sales.
good,"A typical day at work was great when it came down to helping customers. At my store it was always depressing though, because our store was hidding. We really didnt have that many customers. As for how everything was set up the store was a mess, and we was always behind on planograms and our scores was low cause of poor management. I've learned how to activate phones, and organize planograms. The management was HORRIBLE. I was workng at radioshack for about 6 months and already had 3 new managers. The hardest part of the job is trying to keep everything organized and up to date with other stores. Most enjoyable is connecting with your customers. I loved my customers and they loved me."
good,The only complaint I had about the job was that they cut commision on the things we could sell so it became more difficult for me to get paid extra on top of my base hourly pay.
good,Just a good place to work and you grow with experience coming out if that is your intentions... If you are willing to learn be coachable and putting that knowledge in use that you will become successful either in radioshack or coming out...
good,Radio Shack was trying really hard to transition their style from old technology to new. they moved the focus to cell phones but it didn't work well enough to keep them open.
good,the work day consisted mostly of cell phone sales. This was my first sales position where I learned how to sell. The management was great and the workplace culture was nice.
good,"Es una empresa estable con buena oportunidad de crecimiento, desgraciadamente hay aspectos que hacen cansado y molesto el empleo,"
good,Radio Shack was very teachable to electronics. I learn to be a better customer service rep. and was able to perform at the top of my level. Radio shack was a job for advancement
good,"radioshack is a good entry level job, it is easy and very time managing, it was a good place to start until its most recent changes to the company.  overall good job"
good,In my typical day taking care customers and helping them with their needs in bills from cellular phones and electronics. we had a nice staff. I learned about electronics more.
good,To assist customers in knowledge base of technology and wireless platforms. To also assist younger generation in the DIY culture
good,"I started the job very unsure of what to expect but the team has helped me a lot along the way, they showed me all the necessary software and made sure I was comfortable using it."
good,"Radio Shack was my first job out of high school. My store manager was a positive and great coach during work and outside of work activities. Unfortunately, the company took a down fall which resulted in closing of stores including the one I as located in. My manager and co-workers created a warm and enjoyable environment to work in. My job consisted of phone or electronic repairs, creating cell phone contracts for customers with the three top cellular services providers, as well as providing the best solution to all technical problems."
good,good place to work. the pay is ok. the hours is the hardest part of the job
good,"Duties were shipping/ receiving, stocking, tagging, dusting merchandise selves and sale merchandise / cellphone."
good,"a Typical day at work is going in, doing my duties, helping customers, etc"
good,"The job was a unique experience. The average day was spent helping customers with their DIY needs, technical questions, and setting up wireless phones. The management at my store was just okay. The hardest part of the job was trying to help customers find the component parts when they were not too sure of their needs. The most enjoyable part of my job was helping the customers and providing the best customer service. I also enjoyed learning all the things I was able to learn about other areas to the world."
good,"I really liked working at Radio Shack, but if you cant sell enough dollar per ticket each week you cannot keep your job, and that was very stressful to me, especially being a minimum wage job."
good,"open store "
good,Radioshack is a great company to work for and provide a great safe working environment. It's performance based and very upbeat as a retail sales business. The individual stores and their team represent the company well & you ultimately decide how much you earn. It's a very rewarding occupation.
good,"I love the customers. And I just loved working for radio shack but the manager, I believe she was prejudice, because she would say things that would difference our race. And I was comfortable, so I just found another job and plus she wasnt giving me a lot of hours and wasnt paying me enough to deal with her prejudice smart remarks."
good,"Worked with electronics, co workers and managers were friendly. most enjoyable part of my job was customer service."
good,"Would engage customers before they approached our service desk, met monthly sales quota, competed with other phone companies and other stores within our market."
good,"I was hired after RadioShack survived the first bankruptcy. At first, things were great working for RadioShack under the new parent company, General Wireless. The manager of my store decided to leave the company, so I was given his position after only being with the company for 5 months. The position was wonderful until RadioShack filed for bankruptcy a second time. I was not offered any severance pay when my job ended (after over a year of working for the company), and there was no option for relocation."
good,"I worked in a mall and most of the day was making sure the store was neat and clean, making sales and offering good customer service. One day a week was putting out new stock and sometimes we had to change the store around based on what the company wants. Overall not a bad starting sales job."
good,Radio shack  was a fun and also at the same time challenging. I love meeting and talking to new people. The co-workers were amazing and outstanding to work with.
good,It is a great place to start a career. Unfortunately the company filed for bankruptcy and there are only a few locations still open.  The work environment is fast but there are some down times once in a while. I had the opportunity to work with some new gadgets. the most challenging would be the competitive sales aspect of the job.
good,hard to make any profit of commisions. nnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnn
good,"RadioShack is an awesome workplace that teaches sales associates how to be a great salesman. A typical workday would be helping customers solve electronic problems or activating a new cell phone. Radioshack is well managed and are very good with keeping things in place. I absolutely love my co-workers, they are the best part about my job. I really feel like we are all family. I also love the fact that they work around my home schedule. Which is why it is so hard to find another job."
good,My term at RadioShack was very pleasant. I had a manager who was very influential that taught me a lot. We stay in contact to this day. I learned to not only manage my staff but to coach and mold them as well. The people I worked with had great attitudes and were all about helping each other to make the location successful. The hardest part of the job was leaving because I loved it so much.
good,"I was a manager for 5 years and got to travel, plus the company took care of my mileage, I also got trained really well, plus got to train others in the best customer service possible."
good,It was a very fun place  and compeditive work enviorment. We earned commision so we was always competing with eachother.I learned alot ofbout cell phones.
good,"My experience working with Radioshack was a very pleasurable one. The clientele was excellent and the phone call volume made my day much more productive and made my days fly right by, looking up products and helping identify customers needs. "
good,New pay plan is worth looking into. Coworkers are great for the most part. Product knowledge is essential to success.
good,The company was a great company to work for and i will never have a bad thing to say i had one issue with the company as far as rehire but the only reason i had to leave was due to a really bad car accident and had to take care of my mother who was more injured then me. and n ow the company i was used to is now Sprint stores .
good,Challenging because you get to learn about new technology often which is a good thing.
good,Landscaping is fun if you really enjoy it but i wouldn't recommend it if you cant handle it.
good,One are my most favorite jobs. I really enjoyed bringing technology to customers in a way that they could understand and benefit from them. Overall if the company would not have gone under I would still work for them.
good,"it was pretty fun to work there, was working approximately 30 hours a week, and was a full time employee, Was essentially a assistant manager, I needed to take care of breaks, as well as deposits"
good,Poco a poco fueron cambiando las prestaciones hacia los vendedores
good,"Lacking management, slow, about to go bankrupt and hardly anyone knows about the company anymore. Lacking opportunity to advance in any way."
good,"A typical work day included a lot of interacting with customers, answering multiple questions, etc. I would say the hardest part of the job would be staying the late nights when we would have to rearrange the entire store."
good,"Great manager"
good,"Would have been established in job security if they had not of went out of business. I liked the customer service experience, and helping customers make there purchases."
good,"Radio Shack was a marvelous company to work for, when I first started, the management and employees were very happy, after a while the company was presenting looses, and managers were pressure to produce more, even being in a district that was first in the nation, the pressure was intense, because we  had compensate for districts that were under performing and the new CEO did not seem to understand the culture of Radio Shack and the loyal customers that Radio Shack allays had, he try to convert the company into a sale-phone company and drove it into bankruptcy."
good,"To many hours required for the pay. Exceutives are clueless to whats going on in the field, as they sit up in their ivory tower, and earn the big paychecks. Then they visit stores, and do nothing but talk down to people and are almost always patronizing and condensending. Thats why i finally left and wouldn't go back to work for them. Executives need to fix the culture in this compnay, by exec's, but this has always been their problem and i'm sure will never fix that problem."
good,"I loved working with customers helping them chose the rite mobile plan for them. I enjoyed being on the computer and talking to the wireless companies. I learned a lot about patience. Being patient made the day go faster and easier. The worst part was making commission, and having to battle for a client. I loved that job, but I felt like I was discriminated againsted, because I was pregnant and asked to resign."
good,"Very demanding; however very rewarding job. This was very fun and challenging, With this job you never knew what the day would bring which was part of the fun.Big con you never knew if your store was going to stay open"
good,"selling phones, with attachments, selling all products, meeting my numbers."
good,"•          Initiated a sales offer to every customer"
good,RadioShack was your go to shop for electronics and home solutions. Radio shack has gone more to cellphone sales then anything else. were forces to push cell phones to every customer that came in. some customers were just in for parts and were bombarded with phone sales. 
good,"greeting customers answering phone calls floor sales was fun to interact with customers was a plus for me i like face to face conversations with customers management was good never complained about work schedual, co workers were great to work with. Most enjoyable part was providing great customer service always putting a smile on customers faces is a plus."
good,I considered Radio Shack as an iconic company growing up and I used to buy electronic components and gadgets from them frequently.It was great honor to work for them as a temporary sales associate unfortunately I had to leave early due to neglect on behalf of these so called (MBA) executive who ran RADIO SHACK down to ground by turning such an Iconic company to a Cellular Phone Shack..
good,"While I really enjoyed working at RadioShack, it is no longer a business. I absolutely loved my job there, however, regardless of my views of management."
good,"The job was not challenging, it was generally easy. the management at the time of my employment was not so good. "
good,I was store manager of a radio shack as it went out of business. It was an interesting experience. I'm not sure how they are now.
good,"They expect all of their employees to be trained on all the new devices and gadgets, as well as all the post paid and prepaid cell phone plans, so that we can better assist customers. Every time a new smartphone was released, there was a new training program we had to complete. We learned every plan offered by all the different cell phone carriers with the exception of straight talk, that is the only one we did not carry. We learned how to determine what type of electronic (ex. Cordless phone system, Tablet, Gps, Tv, computer, so on) we should recommend to a customer based on their individual needs, we also learned how to get that information from the customer, by asking precise questions to get the most helpful answers without having to badger the customer. The RadioShack environment was both up beat and friendly, the customers as well and the management and employees were all very enjoyable. I loved my job at RadioShack. However it boiled down to not being able to pay my bills on the salary I was making."
good,"Up early and leave late, customers complained on how company changed they were not the same after bring cellular into the company. Managers 48 hours a week with little hours for employees so managers worked by themselves a lot of the times. I learned how to manage  time management, how to keep track of my P&L,and inventory. I loved my co-workers that I knew. Company isn't big on family like workplace. Not a fun atmosphere. Hardest part of my job was listing to conference calls when i worked alone as a Manager. I enjoyed leaving work."
good,Not a very intense environment with the exception of the doped up customers that walked into the store all the time. Really not a lot to be said.
good,This place wasnt all that great. They do not pay enough not only that but they dont treat the workers there with respect. I would never go back to work there.
good,"I have learned a lot of experience from this job that I can put to good use in the future as far as sales, customer service, stocking and packaging."
good,open and close the store. helping customers find the products they need. inform them how to save on their cell phone plans and review their current plan
good,"A typical day at work was either opening or closing the store.  I learned how to manage my time at work with school work and home life.  The management and my co-workers were for the most part pleasant to work with.  Sometimes I had Senior Management or co-workers that were not too pleasant but I learned how to work with or around them. The hardest part of the job was trying to help a store full of customers (some good - repeat customers, some bad - thieves) and give each one of them great customer service with only two employees at any given time.  Being a Store Manager I always had plenty of employees on hand but as an associate you do not control this issue.  On the other hand the most enjoyable part of the job was when you had customers that recognized your efforts and hard work trying to juggle the customers, praised you for your work and great customer service, and waited only for you to serve them or would leave if you were not there."
good,My work hours did not work with my family's schedule.
good,"I have worked for radioshack for 6 years. In those six years I had been denied advancement 5 times to the company deciding to hire an outside manager who I was asked to train. All corperate radioshack locations only pay minimum wage to associates, however if you sell, you can make big bucks."
good,"Radio Shack also lead to my growth as an individual and also as a customer service representative. A typical day will be preparing the store with the display of products, selling of products and learning about new innovative technology. Co-workers were very helpful with each other also ensuring that we all achieve our goals. Hardest part of the job was achieving our weekly sales target. Most enjoyable indeed was operating the electronics and explaining to the clients of the benefits of have the product of their choice."
good,"It was hard, sometimes a little dark...but the team I worked with and the people that I was lucky enough to call peers were a special group..The withstood all the tough days and in many cases stuck it out to the end.  While we cant all be friends in a professional capacity I would advocate for almost any one of the people I was ""In the trenches with""  I hope all are well....Without them I wouldn't be who I am today"
good,everyone treated each other like family. We took breaks together (set breaks) We had to clock out for lunch only got 30min if you had to leave for lunch that was hard because of the traffic
good,"When I worked at radioshack they were going through an identity crisis, one year they tried to be hip the next they were all about being an electronic parts store. One thing that was always there was commissions or spiffs as they called them."
good,The management and team I had were some of the best. We all got along very well and helped each other out whenever possible. The store was always slow.
good,It was a nice starter job. It's pretty fast paced because of the traffic that comes in and out. You also have fun going against your coworkers to see who sold the most phones that month.
good,"RadioShack was the first job I ever had. It was relaxed, due to the fact that it was on it's last leg. Bankruptcy and such..  I enjoyed my time working there, which also helped with college schedule."
good,the company has sold most of its stores and had many financial problems. The company was a niche market and had lost touch with its brand image. Sad to see the company go.
good,"Love helping people with electronics projects, however it was all about cell phones, cell phones, and more cell phones."
good,The company is basically out of business I haven't seen another store anywhere I have been so job security was not great. The pay was fair for the job demands!
good,Like the newest geek toys?  well this is the job for you.  Help people find the right gadget.  Help them fix their gadgets.  And much more.  I worked there what 20 years ago so I have no idea what its like now.  I do know its not commission any more. They have removed most of what made them famous.  They really have chosen to become non-relevant in modern times.
good,"I enjoy working and learning about technology. Get to learn about customer service skills. Learning about all kind of technology everyday, wires and amps on certain things"
good,"Always offers ideas to solve problems based on good information and sound judgment."
good,"Stocked product. Ringing up customers. Watched boring training videos from time to time. Learned something new everyday at Radio Shack. I didn't know anything about electronics, I was a stay at home mom and learned a lot about the latest technologies and how to hook them up. The hardest part about the job was having to meet sales goals."
good,I was a sales associate at Radio Shack.  I would help customers find what they needed and check them out.  I learned that not every store has a good business base.  The management was questionable.  Sometimes stores would go weeks without a store manager.  There was a very high turn over rate with store managers at Radio Shack.  The hardest part of the job was the Black Friday days.  The most enjoyable part was the interacting with all of the different customers that came in.
good,"A Typical day at radio shack would involve Taking the Trash out, vacuum the carpet, mop the floors, scan and put out empty tags, check in shipment and put the new stock on the floor. What i have learned from working at radioshack would mostly be about connectivity. How and what parts are used to connect home equipment.The Management i have to say seem to have some communication issues although that is only a perception. My co-workers are good people with like wise attitudes. The hardest part of the job is trying to figure out how to get customers equipment connected correctly which is also the most enjoyable part of the job for me i tend to like a bit of a challenge."
good,"Good and Bad Days, The people are cool to work with, and management is okay.  The hardest part of the job is when you have to deal with the people who believe everything is over and you must accommodate to the prices they believe they should pay."
good,I enjoyed the customer interaction and helping them understand what their needs were. I learned how to manage other employees and run the store as the acting manager when she was needed elsewhere.
good,"Everyday I would clock in and proceed to my section assigned. I had to check all tags make sure pricing was updated and the section was clean and organized. After making sure my section was up to guidelines, I would check to see if management had any task for me or if anything else in the store need tending too. Mostly important greet and help any customer that came into our door. Before clocking out check my sales goals make sure I achieve them if not exceed them, if not make sure I left with a number in my head to make up for the next work day. Radio shack was my first selling job. Quickly I learn I had a tongue for sales and I fell in love instantly with it. This job taught me go beyond your goal, achieve a little higher and healthy competition is always fun. Within four months I become key holder and then progress from there to wireless consultant. My management team groomed  me in so many ways to lead and taught me never settle to just follow. The hardest part of my job was pulling in customer but overtime that soon became the easiest. I loved the relationship and understanding that my co-workers and I had, the push for greatness management gave and construction criticism when goals wasn't met."
good,"During my time at Radio Shack, I've seen many things change, not always for the better. Radio Shack is a company struggling to reinvent itself in the midst of a market already saturated with technology. Their prices are competitive, but they just don't have the brand power, the name Radio Shack no longer carries the weight that it used to. A typical day at Radio Shack consists of trying to sell every single person who walks through the door a cell phone. Which is fine, but the higher profit margin items have been pushed aside for the latest Galaxy or iPhone. The hardest part of the job is being encouraged to talk people into things they don't want or need. The one thing that makes this job enjoyable is the people I get to interact with on a daily basis. We have a very loyal customer base in my area and that's what keeps me here."
good,was not informed that my job would be getting cut two to three months after i was fully trained and was laid off
good,Early part of my career there was a strong commitment to the people and company. The last 5-6 years it was about turn over to sell phones and not the overall product line.
good,"If there was more compensation or a bigger cut in commission made, this would be ideal. However, that isnt the case."
good,Great place to work and develop sales teams. Once a stable and strong company and now a fading company.
good,It was always very busy work days. Dealing with customers and the technology they brought in was my favorite part of the job although the upset and irrational customers could be considered one of the worst part of the job.
good,A work day was more like being and doing chores at home. Friendly atmosphere. Good management. Down side pay was low and no benefits. 
good,I would work here if you are trying to advance outside of the company and to learn some good selling skills and how to do things with electronics. Other then that this job is not a life job it pays minimum wage
good,"Work would consist of daily operations, selling electronics, maintain store appearance, reporting sales numbers, learning about new products, daily bank completion. I learned how to effectively sell electronics and thoroughly communicate and explain how our products work to customers. Co-workers were always changing as well as managers, I became friends with a few of them and still talk to them to this day."
good,"During the bankruptcy process, corporate insured that RadioShack would only be closing a small portion of their store and that our store would be one of the ones spared from this ordeal. The closures were supposed to happen in rounds but our store and 99% of all others were suddenly set to close permanently. I never intended to stay there for much longer, but the fact that my time there was cut short makes me wish I could have made the decision to leave when I was ready."
good,Good company to work for until some bad management was put in place from plamet video which brouggt company downhill like planet video. Management makes the employees stay and company grown but they got to hungry for phone business and not their back bone of electronics.
good,"was a good company as a tech. great coworkers with friendly atmosphere. "
good,Typical day at work was very dead. The area I was in was not very busy. I learned a lot about up selling and a little about electronics. The pay I'd say was very fair.
good,A typical day could be slow or fast. It all depended on customer flow. I liked the crew that I worked with and had a good manager. The hardest part of the job was dealing with disgruntle customers.
good,"Working here was fun, I worked multiple locations, and enjoyed them all. I enjoyed those I worked with, things were productive and always had something to do."
good,Working here is an  experience.  The world of Electronics changes daily.  But some costumers don't like change so you keep both of that in mind and to keep a customer.    You go to Great lengths to give them great service and pride yourself what you do.
good,This was temporary job the manager was a great boss to work for training with him was the best.  He was always wiling to help and train you with any and every thing need to get the job done.
good,Although understandably so... General Wireless DBA RadioShack grossly underpaid its management team.  I had 11 stores (a district) and was paid slightly more than a store manager.
good,training was really helpful when you first start in retail. the  management was always there to help you especially the  manager. The pay wasn't that good to live off.
good,"Stocking, restocking, and labeling was a daily thing. Learned how approach and help customers with their needs. The managers were great people to work with. Hardest part was working during the holidays. Meeting all types of people and being able to help them was what I enjoyed the most during my time here."
good,I work at at Radioshack for three years. I basically dealt with customers who were in need of help with technical issues. We also learned the Sprint side of the business. We learned the mobile industry.
good,"vised forms and prepared manuals required guiding activities of bookkeeping and clerical personnel who posted data and kept records. Executed daily operations of Human Resources and Medicaid Billing, Client Services, Payroll, and Cash Management"
good,"This job will get you up close and personal with a lot of people.  You really need to know all the products the store sells if you want to get ahead with this company."
good,"trabajo base metas y objetivos horarios muy extensos , pero muy buenas comisiones exigente en cuanto a cumplimiento en números y cantidades de ventas mensuales"
good,"Mi experiencia en radioshak fue buena, aunque para ser una tienda que se ubicaba en una zona donde no se tenia bastante venta, por tener competencia como coppel, walmart, sams, y viana, la tienda era mas cara que cualquier otra tienda, se pedian ventas muy altas las cuales no cumplia la tienda."
good,"working with electronics, learning about new technology and meeting new everyday, fun and knowledgeable co-workers, management is good and fair to employees"
good,"Helping people find what they need."
good,No management guidance but high management pressure. My first day I was there for 15 minutes then the manager left and I was at the store alone with no training. I learned everything myself and advanced through the company on my own.
good,"Day to day operation of retain electronic store. Responsible for training, counselling and evaluating employees on a weekly training of daily activities."
good,when i got this job i was going to school at unlv but i had to drop school because i couldn't afford it and my grades where showing for it because of my grades i couldn't afford unlv anymore so i decided to work so i could afford a car and then go back but i ended up getting laid off and finding another job
good,The most enjoyable part of the job was my customers. My customers were sweet people. I really loved my job. First it was all the customers. They helped us make money and ensured we had a job.
good,"It was good for the time that I spent there learning everything about sales and electronics. Job duties included:"
good,The hardest part of the job is keeping sales quota up and above projections required for the store.  Maintaining store up keep and pricing.
good,"TARGET MOBILE/MARKETSOURCE"
good,"Enjoyed customer interaction, hiring and building my own team, but was disillusioned with the management turnover. I had 6 district managers in a 5 year span. Some of the financial decisions made by the company led to its demise. Overall it was a good company with a strong name. Unfortunately decisions were made that affected the company's long-term financial strength."
good,"filed for bankruptcy. prior to that me was spent managing my team, attending project meeting to make security decisions."
good,"Tough environment with declining sales and lack of E-commerce presence."
good,coworkers were great but management could of been at work more to help with promotions and big launches for new electronics that came in.
good,"I recommend Radioshack to people because they can find many different products that may offer a solution to their needs and wants. Other stores don't offer components, variety in power elements, and DYI products."
good,I learned that hard work is not rewarded. and they try to hide the internal issues that were affecting the company. Ultimately having to make big changes in the infrastructure
good,Good part time job for a college student or someone looking to makes some extra money. Strong sales abilities are a must along with customer service.
good,Helping customers decide what types of devices they were looking for. I learned how important customer service was in that small setting and have used it on a very large scale to build and maintain long standing customer relationships. My co-workers and I were very close and worked very well together to help the company succeed.
good,Help customers find certain items or choosing a phone company and selling plans and devices as well as restocing store and inventory
good,"Some days busier that other"
good,Its a good job if you like working hard and meeting goal! Competitive Business
good,"Typical Day - work on images for print and web production."
good,Its a good start for a senior in high school. Made minimum rate plus commission. A lot of pressure to sell phones.
good,Radioshack was an ok place to work. The side i was on actually was sold off to another company due to inability to meet demands of the market.
good,Radioshack is a fun workplace and a great place to learn about technology.
good,I loved working for this company but they did not take in consideration of the family values and culture that you have.
good,"A typical day at work consisted of restocking shelves, customer service, making the schedule for the following week, calling customers about phone upgrades, and receiving shipments from FedEx"
good,"I with customers on a daily basis, teaching and learning all the new technology from cellular devices.. i work with ony 2 other emplyees and we help eachother with as much as possible. the hardest part of the job would be to actually convince our customers to pay for the cellular devices they would like. i really enjoy meeting new people every day and teaching them the lattest technology widgets."
good,"Always something to do: assisting customers, stocking merchandise, and cleaning the store."
good,I found the management staff to be very polite and approachable. They were always available to problem solve and coach me. I feel that customer and customer service was more challenging than the company itself. I also feel that the company places basic sales goals on everyone and didn't account for the business hours. Which effected your sales goals if you worked the slowest shifts.
good,I worked at this company over 12 years ago so my memories are not that fresh I enjoyed my coworkers the pay was fairly low but I was not really here long enough to rate this fairly
good,"They no longer exist for employment."
good,"Lower levels of management was great to work with.  Upper level management - Director level and above - not so great to work with.  Pay was below industry average, and minimal chance of advancement."
good,While I enjoyed working there towards the end they stressed cell phone sales and I had no experience in that. I was good at everything else. But let go in the end
good,I would not be able to recommend or review this organization as it has gone out of business. While I worked there it was very competitive in my specific store and the other associates would do anything to get a sale.
good,"en mi lapso hubo muchos cambios y restructura, lo que obligaba a mover o quitar gente, era un tanto inestable la permanencia, al final la empresa cerro y cambio de dueños."
good,Maybe it was just my store but  higher ups didnt seem to care about you nor what you have going on. They were only after numbers. My store was short staffed and  managers came and went quick. And staff were left to run the store best they could
good,i learn how to beome a sell rep with this company..manager was not all the great but im a quick learner..most enjoyable day was when i was the 3 on sell for our region
good,"Learning and working with components and innovated product was a good experiences."
good,"if you don'[t have a family this will work for you, just if you have a college schedule sometimes depending on manager can be difficult to work around your schedule"
good,"Great job to start off with sales and commission sales (cell phones) you learn a lot from a small retail open, mid and close 12-hour operating job. flexible with college/ school and become hand and tech savvy."
good,"It was a fun place to work. My location was a slow one, but it gave you time to learn about all the products and really help out the customers that came in."
good,"Radio Shack was a fun company to work for. However, their compensation (wages) paid the very minimum,which I didn't like. Especially, since I was a Key-Holder and I was expecting to get paid more money for my work."
good,Customer service is key in any retail especially a commission based position. You learn how to effectively manage your time and sales. You will learn all you need to know about electronics and everything else!  This is a great place to make a lot of friends that you will consider family. The hardest part of the job is making sure to hit goals while still keeping a customer feeling like you aren't just selling them something. The most enjoyable part of the job is all the Great people you will meet.
good,It was fun but too bad they went out of business. I had an awesome team to work with. I learned about a lot about electronics. Didn't like the pay because it was below minimum wage.
good,"Worked at Radio Shack twice. Second time I was an assistant manager. When time came for me to manage my own store, I was sent to Indiana and was not given promised promotion."
good,RadioShack was my first job and working there helped me understand the dynamics of having a job. I was able to transition comfortably and I learned a lot from the other training  employees.
good,Aprendi  muchas cosas ya que ahi forme muchos conosimientos un dia tipico escanear mencancia postear checar que los objetivos diarios en ventas se alcansaran capasitar a los asesores nuevos y los de antiguedad corte del dia al cierre de tienda enfajillar los depositos para el dia siguiente
good,"Company is fun to work for, ever since we are own by Standard General wireless now the company has brought through some good ideas and they are succeeding. Unfortunately most customers don't know that we still exist."
good,The store was fun i enjoyed talking to customers about the products we were selling. Iv learned a lot more talking to customers than reading about what we thought they wanted.
good,"Job can be fun at times when you get to play with new tech.  Compensation is low, but company is going though a rework.  Hopefully it improves for the lower end workers."
good,The day would start by checking the training board to learn about any new devices that were coming out or a new sales tactic that might help boast the numbers. Then a look at what the daily total for the store and what was required of me. Most of the co-workers were friendly and help pass the dead time between customers. The hardest part of the job was being able to keep up with all the new changes at the end that did not help our sales goals but felt more like busy work. The most enjoyable part of the job was learning all the new features that came out with the new product and being able to relay that to the customer that could use those features.
good,"a typical day for work for me included myself checking the emails, reviewing daily tasks and weekly goals, then assisting customers in products they are looking for. my co-workers were pretty down to earth and all of us got along for the most part. Management used to be wonderful until recently. The store manager that is currently employed is not a very fair manager. She believes in favoritism. If she didnt like the one time you did something, no matter on how hard of a good job you do, she will not praise you upon it in any way, shape, or form. The hardest part of my job i feel was getting stuck on the phone with technical support during a transaction. The easiest part of my job was being able to assist customers in fulfilling their needs."
good,It is a shame the company leadership failed to see the crisis in the making leading to the chapter 11 filing well before the current CEO was placed.
good,"open the store, wait on customers who came in"
good,A typical day is setting targets for not only myself but my staff as well and working towards those targets by on the floor coaching with each team member after each sale. I spend the mornings completing all required operational tasks for the day then spend the rest of the day on the floor assisting customers and maintain store standards.
good,"RadioShack has been a great place of employment. During my time there I have learned what it takes to truly be a servant leader. I would not be looking for a new career opportunity if we had been successful in our efforts to turn the company around. "
good,"Fun to work with others in a positive environment, thanks to the store manager. Although days may be slow with customers, employees keep the day interesting while sharing knowledge amongst each other in relation to sales opportunities."
good,I had the best time working with my fellow workers we were a team to meet. I learned a lot about cell phones and had a lot of fun activating and showing customers how to use there phones.
good,RadioShack allowed me a chance to become the person I am today. With that chance I moved up and gained experience. I appreciate the opportunity I was given and will forever be grateful.
good,"The management swayed often, and the company seems to keep changing their goals."
good,Worst part was you never knew if you had a job when you came in.
good,"Working at Radioshack was a learning experience for me because they sell many different types of electronics and parts. I would stay busy stocking shelves, answering phones, cleaning, and assisting customers. My coworkers were always very helpful and friendly. The management was willing and eager to train or answer any question. They are also very strict about safety. I enjoyed going to work everyday because it was a challenge for me, but it was also a very good place to work."
good,"I used to come in and make sure everything was clean and ready for the day, then as the day went on I would help customers find complete solutions. It was tedious, but satisfying to help someone find something they were looking for. There I learned Point Of Sale and customer service. I worked with 2 managers and one treated us with respect while the other treated us like recruits in the military. One lifted us up and taught us while the other talked down to everyone. My co-workers were some interesting characters that taught me about their culture. The hardest part was trying to do my job and gain the respect of my managers. The most enjoyable part was searching for a long time to find a customer a solution and finally finding exactly what they needed."
good,Radioshack lost its soul when started to bring management personel from the outside.  New way of treating employees and ideas that took the experience of shopping at Radioshack.  Employees could not be trained right because they were pulled to clean the stocks so that the company saved money and that also caused the employee to be less knowlegeable of the products we sell.  Long long hours for management and no appreciation or pay.
good,my day consisted of sales and learning about electronics and sales.
good,Low Compensation for workload. Good environment learned a lot about having patience. Co workers are amazing! Everyone is in the same boat.
good,Though I do not have a lot of customer service experience I have learned a lot and have improved my interpersonal skills.
good,"Assists customers with any technological questions and fixtures on phones, cameras, computers, tablets. Etc. Answer questions and find reasonable solutions to meet the customers expectations."
good,"Learned the ins and outs of management.Co workers with knowlegable, and fun to work with."
good,I left the company on my own terms as discussed with the Kmart HR manager.
good,"Everything was sufficient."
good,"I never stop working at radioshack, regardless if there is a customer in the store. I learned many new skills in selling and technically related topics."
good,"Worked there for over 7 months, Great place to work, had a great time while I worked there."
good,"A typical day a Radio Shack can go from laid back to So much people in the store.It goes from checking the ratings, selling numerous products to just giving your knowledge to people about many products. Also activating cellular devices, Technical support via telephone and in store, Teach customer how to use their mobile device, Show customers the many features and benefits of their mobile device, and explain the billing and plans chosen by customer."
good,"Welcome customers into the store, engage them in conversation about items they were looking for and recommend additional items. Management was amazing but little to no advancement based on available positions. There was really no hard part of the job the most enjoyable part of the job were the people."
good,"Fun work environment, some benefits, minimum wage and commission"
good,Worked with a great sales team. Was at a good environment. resolved issues on sale.
good,"A typical day at work when I was a web developer consisted of determining what product I would be doing an online tutorial.  After I became familiar with the product, I would take pictures of that product for web demonstration and then design a tutorial teaching the customers how to program or use that product such as a scanner or digital phone."
good,"Management is always in the store and bettering associates knowledge, hired staff is competent, easily accepted- hardest part of the job is the scheduled times"
good,"Everyday at work had opening procedures to handle. Inventory check, money counts and drops, checking time sheets, reporting my daily number to my district manager among other things. I have learned to be more patient and better manage my staff to successfully be profitable not just month by month but for the year. Have a better understanding on P&L and how any company will work with the right formula. The hardest part of my job was getting all the resources we needed to move ahead, from actual inventory to getting a day off. Guest and my interaction with people was by far the most enjoyable aspect of my job at radioshack/target mobile."
good,"They always see you as replaceable and let you know that all the time.  If you want someone to work hard you can't be calling them names and putting them down all the time."
good,Very slow paced job. Looking for something more challenging. 
good,"This position required an upbeat attitude and excellent people skills. Management and associates were required to sell, in addition offer additional services to each customer. Building a rapport with customers was essential in order to offer the continue services and products offered. This enabled me to be a quick thinker in response to questions, build close relationships with customers, and turn conversations into new opportunities."
good,"A typical day is geeting customers, stock shelves, and and selling phones"
good,"Work at the Shack was enjoyable,I worked in locations that have managers in place for short periods. Co workers were great to work with everyone wanted to have a happy work environment. Customers were great I ended up building a big client portfolio. People knew me as someone that would help them answer there questions to the best of my ability."
good,I did like working there because it was pretty much an easy job. There wasnt much customer flow to the are which made it difficult on sales so there wasnt often that we could make extra money from sales. That had to be the hardest part about the job.
good,"I gained knowledge of services that different phone carriers provided with mobile phones and wireless service. Selling these mobile devices and wireless service was based on commission, along with the hourly rate."
good,Radio Shack is a decent pace to work. Its a fun environment and you meet new people everyday.
good,"Typical day consisted of cashier work, customer service, and cellular phone sales."
good,This was my all time favorite job. I love working for this company. I enjoyed the constant training and educational learning to help better my knowledge about the company and their products.
good,Wireless sales/operations. Co-workers are very friendly and helpful; a joy to work alongside.
good,Radio shack was like any other job. Working there was easy and great commission.
good,"fun work envrernmnet, hrly pay is ok but the comition is great, easy company to move up in"
good,"My responsibilities include maintaining the overall appearance of the Store by keeping merchandise fully stocked, neat, and organized. I provide quality service by effectively communicating with customers to answer questions, locate merchandise and provide requested assistance concerning prices, functions, assembly, features, and product availability. I processed incoming stock, sales, returns and transfer of stock to other stores. i supervised one to two associates when manager was not present. The hardest part was learning about fuses and connectors for projects. the most enjoyable part was teaching customers how to hook older equipment to new equipment."
good,This is a great company to work for. You will learn so much and can make the best of this experience. Not only are you there to help customers but you can make alot of money if you just stay focused and concentrate on key items. You can make this a fun place to work!!
good,"Besides the fact that they went bankrupt, I enjoyed my time at RadioShack. My manager was always happy and always there if I needed help. Whenever I asked for more hours, I started getting called in any time somebody called off. My manager started giving me tasks that require a little more responsibility. You gave me opportunity that allowed me to advance to assistant store manager. I am grateful for my time at RadioShack"
good,"The company was good to work for before the upcoming year of bankruptcy. It became hostile, and unrealistic with it's goals and put too much stress on the store manager to perform"
good,Buena empresa pero en la sucursal donde estaba yo la subgerente es incompetente e ignorante y la gerente por igual y nunca se me capacitó para crecer en la empresa y no dan comisiones apesar de que vende muy bien
good,"Started off fine, but even after increasing the stores bottom line by half a million dollars. They were unwilling to promote me or compensate me appropriately. Overall, good experience, but wouldn't work for them again."
good,"At particular location, had dependable manager who assisted with improving my skill asset, for example learning how to communicate better with customers and improving sales technique."
good,"The foot-traffic was minimal, I learned cashiering, stocking, inventory and product demonstration.  Management consisted of one Supervisor who was not the Store Manager.  Workplace culture was tailored to the customer's needs and wants.  Hardest part of the Job was tuning into a customer's sense of direction based on small sized products.  The most enjoyable part of the Job was when sold additional items that were actually accessories."
good,"Buen ambiente laboral, tranquilo y buena ganancia."
good,This was an excellent place to work in. You got to see what projects people were working on. My coworkers became by best friends. You always got to play with the newest toys available.
good,"I was mostly a salesman but also a manager trainee.  There were times when I ran the store and people thought i was the manager.  Sadly, this is another business that has closed down."
good,The training was very extensive which taught me how to do my job very efficiently.  Before business closure I enjoyed learning and striving to get further in this company.
good,I worked at RadioShack as a second job to make ends meet. I had an awesome manager and worked with some pretty interesting people. All in all it was a fun experience.
good,Since this company is now out of business. There really isn't much to write here. It was a fun place to work and I kinda wish they never went out of business.
good,Es un buen lugar donde trabajar y conocer personas
good,"this is probbaly the best place iver ever worked at. great coworkers, excellent manager. it didnt feel like i was really going to work. i was given plenty of opportunity to grow and to build a career with the company if i choose to"
good,"This was a awesome first job. I was into cell phones and electronics heavy at the time. This was the perfect job, I was able to be compensated to sell things that I liked."
good,Great place to learn about electronics. Excellent opportunities to grow within the company. Probably had the best manager I've ever worked for and learned the most from.
good,"Great for an entry level sales position. Commissioned based and a lot of troubleshooting.  Also, basic understanding of electronics and  wiring would be a good thing."
good,I did enjoy my time at RadioShack but the problem is the company has filed for bankruptcy and now there aren't that many locations around and those ones will be owned by individuals not corporate.
good,i loved working at radioshack. unfortunately they didnt quite make it through the change to consumer electronics. the competition took us out.replaced by sprint
good,Radio Shack can be a fast past environment at times. Especially during the holidays. You would have to have a love for customer service to be successful with this position.
good,Great place to gain experience with a wide variety of technologies. Lots of opportunity for gaining experience in selling techniques and providing excellent customer service.
good,"Radioshack was a sales focused job. It was a good place to work, and I enjoyed helping customers with their electronic needs. I gained a vast amount of knowledge by working there."
good,"That was the only thing we would ever hear on a conference call. SELL PHONES! That is all the district manager cared about, was our phone sales numbers. It was very cut throat."
good,"i enjoyed my time working for Radio Shack, although the company is mostly no longer around it helped me pick up a lot of my sales experience and thought me how to approach a potential sale, every client is different its important to ask proving questions to find out what they really need."
good,"Radio Shack was an excellent place to work, the team was like a family. RadioShack understood that the sales associates were the life of the company, and that was important."
good,"typical retail sales location.  you sell tvs, cords, adapters and small electronic parts.  You also have a chance to make more money by selling cell phone service."
good,Laid back at times and fast paced when trying to sell. Had unrealistic sales goals for the area of town. Other areas have better chances to make sales goals. Very low sales incentives based on cellphone accessory sales. Good coworkers made environment tolerable. Great starter job.
good,"was a job close to home and school with the perfect hours thar i needed. worked fine for a needed pay check and to juggle school and motherhood. co workerswhere great to work with, but management needed to go"
good,"I learned a lot about sales and working as a team to meet certain quotas. While occasionally cutthroat, it wasn't unmanageable. I am generally satisfied with my experience."
good,"This job was fun, if you enjoy learning new things. I never knew anything about diode, or transistors. Or anything related to DIY projects. I also learned about activating new cell phone contracts.  This place was fun, and then there were days when I just wanted to pull all my hair out and kick everyone out of the store.  I've done open and close by myself on a Sunday, while a huge cell phone sale was going on. Although the customers were cool about it, I couldn't get anyone from any other stores to come and give me a hand. Not even my store mgr, was willing to come in."
good,I loved working for a franchise of RS. I was it hadn't been bought out after bankruptcy was filed. I would work for the company again if they came back.
good,"Must know where all the products in the store, because you want to show where every items small or big.  It can take an average person 10 to 20 min looking for an item if not know where its located.  Store sales number must be met everyday, if not met employee and store manager are held accountable."
good,"Days as a manager at radioshack were focused on maintaining the business, despite the gradula implosion of the company by poor upper management, as evidenced by their several bankruptcies. I learned a great amount about technology and interpersonal relationships which will remain valuable for my continued career. Dealing with customers was something i thoroughly enjoyed and made the job very suitable. The largest difficulty i had was with the lack of ability i had to increase radioshack's standing. Most of the decisions that led to radioshacks downfall were done at the upper levels and no amount of passion or selling talents from a single store could alter that."
good,I kept the job until it was announced that the store was going to close and I was working another job I decided it was time to let the company go. Enjoyed my time there.
good,"poor manager, good company, great experience. I dont know what ended up happening but i am pretty positive this store is closed now anyway, probably due to the poor managment."
good,Everything in the store always remain the same so that the customers can find them.  If a customer have a questions than you help them out the best that you can.  Radioshack is now close here so yeah I can't really recommend working there.
good,Radio shack as a job showed a lot of promise but working there meant there was a clock on your job. Since the business was going under but still very rewarding
good,Radioshack is no longer in business or is tanking because they have been closing all stores in my area. If youre looking for a job here you might need to start looking somewhere else
good,"Flexible scheduling and breaks made for a nice work environment.  Upper management was occasionally bullying but would also provide lots of compliments for work that was well done."
good,The customer service experience is good with the job. You get to learn to different skills everyday with your coworkers. The day is busy sometimes with different duties and goals you have to achieve for the store.
good,"Working at Radioshack shaped the course of my career forever. I was able to go from a sales associate to a store manager in about 3 years. The level of encouragement to grow was tremendous and as a result, I've taking so much learning and valuable experience into my career."
good,Worked there for over 17 years. I enjoyed the working atmosphere and worked with many wonderful people.  My bosses were all very fair and nice. Company has gone into bankruptcy so I was laid off.
good,"Great company while they lasted.  "
good,"my first job entering college, good experience and prepared me for my future customer service jobs. This was a fast paced location where many of the customers were regular customers."
good,"Before Radio Shack lost more of their stores, they were an awesome company. They treated each of their employees with great respect and they also promoted within the store."
good,you learned a lot from the managers. was able to multitask when necessary. traveled from store to store and met new people. was able to work with a group of people and on my own. was sad to see the position go.
good,"Unfortunately, this company is no longer open. I cannot recall if the entire company is gone, but all the locations in Casper, Wyoming are. Nevertheless, it was a fun place to work. I learned a great deal about cell phone plans and the pros and cons of different brands and models. I also learned a great deal about tablets, e-readers, and laptops."
good,"Drive sales growth through a trained, motivated sales team to achieve set targets of profit margin and customer retention. "
good,It has been more than 15 years since I have been employed here. I cannot give a fair review. It was great when I worked there and I enjoyed my time spent there.
good,Its has been over a decade since I worked for this employer. There have been multiple changes in executive positions & the company has since filled bankruptcy & undergone structural changes. I cannot give any current opinion of this employer
good,RadioShack's focus during my employment was selling cellphones and accessories. A majority of how an employee was evaluated was based on their level of success and the behaviors to reach goals. Even as a manager the majority of the day was spent selling and trying to transition any customer interaction to a cellphone sale.
good,A lot of training in order to work for the company. Which helps staff achieve peak customer service both because everyone knows about new technology as well as functionality.
good,Great for learning all about Wireless sales. Also provides you with knowledge of many different types of electronic products and cellular devices. Great work environment.
good,Was a great place to work until it became all about cell phone sales. They really tried to get us to push people cell phones they didn't want or need when all the customer came in for was a battery or charger. Was a nice friendly workplace. Got along with most of my coworkers and the manager was awesome.
good,"RadioShack, the neighborhood electronics convenience store, is a leading national retailer of innovative personal and home technology products and services, and power supply needs. Founded in 1921, RadioShack is owned today by General Wireless, Inc., which acquired the storied brand in March 2015. The new RadioShack has over 1,700 company-owned stores,"
good,"Radioshack is/was a great company to work for, when i started as a sales associate there were lots of guidelines to follow which i thought was great. You were constantly aiming to achieve daily and monthly goals. I worked my way up through the chain to become a store manager with 3 years and maintained above average sales and bonus goals for myself along with 6 employees working under me."
good,"I've worked for Radioshack for a while now. If it still exists after these next few months, I'll cross my fingers that my job does too. It wasn't the company that caused me to stay so long however but specifically my manager and to a degree my coworkers. I was lucky enough to end up with a Boss who cared about us and strived to create the best work environment he could. The job itself was relatively easily, only becoming stressful when customer would come in not knowing things as simple as how to turn on their phones- and the amount of theft we had to deal with, while most likely a result of our area, was nevertheless an annoyance. If you're looking to work for Radioshack, apply knowing your job security is little to none."
good,"Form the get go I was put to work, I learned as I went along. From"
good,This is a good place for a student or single individual whom is trying to work there way through college as an added place to have an income.
good,I really liked my time at Radioshack they have some good systems in place and some good people to work with good training the only problem i had was managment to much drama that had nothing to do with the workplace
good,"I acquired entry level skills of technology knowledge, product display, commission skills of sales, data & cash register entry, how to approach customers, & make sales transactions over the phone."
good,It is a good work environment. I had many experiences within the company while becoming an associate to an assistant manager.
good,very stressful at times but overall very enjoyable until sales decreased and bankruptcy was filed - no longer a company that you can work for - was bought by another company
good,It was a job straight out of high school.  Great for the student trying to become independent but not a long term job. It gave the experience to know how to deal with all types of personalities.
good,Some of the people I worked with had a personal agenda on company funds and expense. On good days I enjoyed this job a lot of days with nothing going on though.
good,"I had fun learning about the job. Its fairly simple retail but there were somethings that you had to know for the hobbyists that would come in for parts etc.  Knowledge of tvs, cell phones and other technological things helped but you learned a lot on the job as well."
good,This was the time of commision and if you worked hard your paycheck showed it. You could earn bonuses and gifts for being the top salesman/woman in your district.
good,I loved my team. Hard-working with winner's mindset. 8-10 hours of work flew by so fast and were enjoyable thanks to my team and overall amazing customer base.
good,"Overall it was a pretty good work environment, management was understanding. Got along well with coworkers."
good,RadioShack was a great job but unfortunately became very dull after there merge with sprint wireless. company started losing volume which meant less sales which meant less commission.
good,"with all of the products and services Radio Shack has to offer, there is never a dull moment at the store. Plenty of things to do and help people with."
good,"Always change; New technology, Change in the lay out of the store, New product, etc. I enjoyed the customers. Always was something to learn and training to do."
good,"Was very technical and easy to understand. Only hard part was assisting difficult customers and tending to everyone's need. Other than that, was a very rewarding job."
good,My store was a great place to work until they started with the store closings.  Providing the tech support for wireless services was my favorite part of the job.
good,Was an ok place to work. Meet new people and assist customers with various technical problems each day. Learn as you go kind of job. Would recommend anyone to work here.
good,"Atiendo a las personas guiándolas en la tienda mostrandole el producto que desean, cuando hay la oportunidad reparto los volantes de la tienda, aprendo a tener un trato mas ameno con las personas y conozco las características de los productos ofrecidos."
good,First gig as a store manager.Great place to showcase customer service skills and your will to please your guests.Great products that i still seek to this very day.no big complaints here.
good,"This company was great to work for. I initally started as a sales associate but quickly rose through the positions until I reach Store Manager. Radioshack ran like the a typical retail store, however, it focused too much on parts no one needed anymore. Unfortunately, Radioshack ended up declaring bankruptcy in 2015."
good,Enjoyed working with customers and co workers. Radio Shack created a fun energetic environment. Although sometimes we were very busy the job was fun.
good,Radio Shack was a part time job that offered an opportunity to explore new technology and meet new people. Many times the compensation would make this job just a bit short for a living wage unless one pursued management. The Radio Shack I worked at had a great manager who believed in making his team members successful and he did not tolerate horseplay which intern made for a more rewarding customer experience. One had to work weekends many times which involved being ready to help customers with needs and it was always good to see a happy customer.
good,I loved to work at radioshack it was a nice company I hate that they had to close majority of their locations .I loved to be able to help customers and learn new things.
good,"During my time at Radio Shack, I developed great friendships that will last forever. I learned a great deal about running a retail environment, but I'm ready to branch out to a new adventure, and make my next job, a career."
good,"Unfortunately, they died in 2015.  The new stores that exist are not ""RadioShack"".  The job was very intricate as they weren't sure how to move forward."
good,"Having great customer service,  providing a warm welcome and pleasing your customer making sure they are satisfied with their visit and that they find what they come in looking."
good,"Customer Service"
good,"i would open the building. turn o displays to make sure everything is working, count the cash drawer, and phone inventory. i would greet every customer and assist them with what ever they needed"
good,On a typical day at work I would start by opening the store. Then I would instruct employees on their duties for the day. We would wait on customers and put out advertisement. Then I would due bank deposit and close the store.
good,Doesn't pay very well but with good co works it made it easier. Health benefits are okay and the management was good to for the most part. Not to may changes in company policy which is good.
good,"Located on a beautiful campus in downtown Fort Worth.  Great team environment.  Supported many areas within the company from international, supply chain, finance, IT, etc."
good,Typical day at work would consist of processing freight and distributing items to the sales floor. I leaned great organization skills and how to work fast. Management was great as well as co workers. The hardest part of t he job would probably be trying to meet the deadline in which all items had to be out of stock room. Most enjoyable part was working around clothing.
good,"A typical day at RadioShack invokes a lot of small sales for items such as audio adapters, micro SD memory cards, or simply pre-paid cellular payments.  The challenge is in deciphering the goal of the customer and providing the correct and optimal solution. Most customers have no idea what the correct name of a product is so there is usually a need to ask a few questions to find out what it really is they're looking for.  With each transaction you need to also try and add more, usually a pack of batteries that is on sale, or perhaps a replacement plan for the cable they're buying. "
good,"Great atmosphere, easy to understand pay model. I loved the superhero feeling I got when I ""saved someone's day"". Strayed too far from customer base and lost a large following. I fear the day of Brick and Morter Stores to be closing soon."
good,Radioshack has been one of the best jobs i could of asked for when it comes to retail. I am very into technology so this job allows me to go in more depth of my education of technology with out having to go to school. I started out as a part time sales associate then with in a couple of months i became a full time sales associate/ key holder so this job allowed me to move up slightly toward a better job position. Even though it is just my manager and i running our store it has allowed my manager and i to become close and bond more.We have shared some very enjoyable and not so enjoyable moments.The hardest part of my job is  I wish my hours were a little different just because i always close and it never allows me to have some down time before going to bed.
good,Fun place to be at and learn about various products and the culture of radio shack. At the time i worked for them my DM was not the most pleasant person to work for therefore affected my rating.
good,"Had a great management team that was always ready to teach you something. Great place to work if you are into technology, and always kept up to date."
good,Being in a social enviroment helped improve my people skills. I learned to take responsblity in my own hands. Taking over other co workers task can be over whelming but I got through by being calm and remaing focus.
good,"Retail experience, learned about the products, interesting people to work with. Was great to get to speak with new customers on a daily basis"
good,"Closed down...no longer in business in Saint Louis, MO...enjoyed the company while i was there!... would have recommended it to anyone!"
good,"I liked working there until the boss i had left under started working there. i was never treated the same when we got a new manager, everyone was all buddy buddy with him and he always treated me like fecal matter."
good,We are all very friendly and get along with each other as well as customers the management is great. It's awesome that we can all work together as one.
good,Loved learning all about the different products. Tons of interesting conversations with customers. Lots of cool new tech.
good,Working at RadioShack was a great experience. I had the opportunity to learn about many useful gadgets and much needed tools.
good,Nice job for a retail sales associate. The work schedule is flexible and the salary and commission are good. Not many customers.
good,The most enjoyable part of my job was when I could help the few people that came into our store find what they were looking for. Also on top of that the customer always left satisfied.
good,"Awesome corporate structure policies and guidelines!"
good,Radioshack was an excellent stepping stone in my life before they went bankrupt nationwide. I learned the majority of my skills there.
good,-I loved working at Radio Shack.It was a fun work environment .I learned new experiences and loved to work with the guests hands on.The hardest part of my job was fixing merchandise when its already broke. Also dealing with upset customers as well. The enjoyable part of this all was learning new things about items .
good,A typical day at Radio Shack consisted of help customers with techinical problems with anything from speaker systems to cell phones.  I learned alot about electronics and other related technology. It was a very rewarding feeling to have a customer leave with a solution to their problem.
good,Honestly I ordered pizza watched free movie channels on dish watched the eagles play on Sundays. The manager was a huge dick to everyone. Im glad i took advantage of this job it eventually closed lol.
good,It was an ok place to work.  The hardest part of the job was selling contract phones for me especially because I worked part time and that was a requirement that I fell short of even though i did sell prepaid phones.  I did get along with everyone there and my manager saw that he could trust me right away because soon after I started working I was given the responsibility of opening and closing the store along counting down the cashiers draw and given the key to do the bank deposits.
good,i liked it alot there at radioshack. good managers and co workers. benefits could have been better. the pay is the part that is really bad.
good,"Fast paced job with many opportunities for growth."
good,"fun, chill, you can manage your stores axactly like your personality, if your personality is lazy you have a horrible store but if you keep up with your store you do great"
good,"During my six years in this small town store, I didn't have to deal with very many typical angry customers. Most people were very nice and appreciated my assistance. As such, a typical day was fairly amicable, consisting of assisting customers, chatting with co-workers, and enjoying whatever was on the television display. "
good,"REALLY enjoyed the people I worked for and worked with. I didn't see this as just a job, I L:iked going to work and helping customers. The hardest part of this job is being a female. I would get everything a customer would need to hook up a home stereo system and they would doubt me, until a  male would approve of what I was saying. this is not the companies fault its just society!"
good,"Same as before, we are there to help customers with pretty much anything they needed help with.  Always giving us something to challenge us."
good,I loved working for RadioShack for the do it yourself customers. The clientele is worth it. I loved the mixture of phone sales with the other products we sold. I learned so much about electronics.
good,"While employed at Radio shack a typical day started off with coming in at your scheduled time and look over the daily checklist. I would normally do both open to close and work 6 days a week. The morning opening procedures included counting the money in the safe. Making sure that all merchandise has price tags and take a daily inventory of our high end items. Also my duties included filing daily paper work, organizing paper work and customer files. Also helping conduct quarterly inventories and helping assist customers through out the day. "
good,"Alright so Radioshack was a decent company to work for, the place I worked at was relaxed but professional. Some days would be fast, others would be slow but overall the experience is great. I learned more about phones and technology and the management was very cool. Some of the co-workers were not so friendly since the environment for commission was competitive. The hardest part of the job was when you had a rush and you were ringing up a cell phone and there are tons of people in line to be checked out. The most enjoyable part of the job was probably how the co-workers felt like a crew more so then just some fellow employees."
good,"llegamos nos cambiamos, empezamos a descargar cajas, luego lo abrimos y empezamos a hacer el conteo de los productos por tipo y lo registramos , hacemos el conteo por segunda vez para la verificacion y procedemos a guardar y devolver. "
good,I loved the customer interaction at radio shack and helping them with their problems. The employees were great to work with and very motivated to be the best
good,Great way to start a sales career.. not fast paced but great sales training seminars.. not cap on what you can make.. great environment..
good,Help customers with Electronics. Cellphones and Plans. Help with issues. Try out products. Meet daily and monthly goals.
good,Company made some bad choices over the years but was still a good company to work for to many promises made by higher ups that were never followed through with
good,A typical day was filled with sales and finance management. I learned many cell phone settings and capabilities to full advantage of helping out customers with choices. I also learned to repair damaged cell phones and tablets. Co-workes are serious and trust worthy as well as management. The hardest part is dealing with so many people on a daily but its also the most enjoyable getting to know them.
good,There is no Typical work day. Everyday  brings on a new challenge.  That is the best part about my job. Co workers and management are on the same page
good,"Driving store sales of mobile phones"
good,Fun easy going place to work. If you want to succeed in the company you need to know your stuff and pay attention to the training videos.
good,"I enjoy my time on the clock at Radioshack. It's a typically laid back location with a system set up to encourage good employees. Commission is made from various places on the job, and the co-workers are way more often than not a pleasure to work with. The hardest part of the job is honestly dealing with difficult customers and keeping yourself busy in slow times."
good,"As a store manager I would handle all of the day to day operations. I would also lead a sales team to meet and exceed sales goals. Job duties would have included keeping inventory, loss provention, customer service, handle any escalated clients. My manager was the district manager and only saw her a few times a month. My employees were very easy to get along."
good,"My typical day at work is i walk in and already have a list of things that need to be done.  So at the beginning of the day I'm swamped, but it gradually slows down.  I learned a lot about sales, making customers happy, troubleshooting repair of phones, and basic computer repair skills.  The hardest part of my job was trying to help customers with a smile on my face when they are acting very rude towards you.  They most enjoyable part of my day is when i get to work on computers downstairs and listen to music with Kenny."
good,"Working here was really productive and fun. Day after day I had a new role to work by, and i say this because everyday I had the oportunity to work with new and different customer. Each and every customer had different and unique needs and my goals was to help them the best I could."
good,"My very first day at the job, I was left to operate the store alone. It wasn't a good first impression for the company, but it was a great learning tool. I was number one in sales and loved the thrill of competing for commission."
good,Great place to work. Company support and training tools were very helpful.
good,"helped customers that came in looking for electronics, up-selling to cellphones"
good,"Meet new people everyday-You learn about P&L, customer service including how to build your customer base, merchandising, inventory, pricing, filing, performance management, cash handling, and hiring. The hardest part of the job is trying to adapt with numerous changes that take place almost everyday. The most important part the job is the feeling you get when you know you have helped someone who had no clue about something."
good,I enjoyed working for Radio Shack because I learned so much not just from training but from interacting with customers as well!
good,"Entrepreneurial environment, opportunity for professional growth, many great people work here."
good,"This was an incredible experience for me."
good,"Large company with good people, but lacks direction. Management needs to be stronger with less turnover."
good,RadioShack has a great environment for both customer and employee
good,"typical day at work help people find items they are looking for and operate the cash register while also getting people to try to buy cell phones which you can make commision off . as for management at first the manager that was there had been working for radioshack for over 10 years he definitly knew how to run a store, on the other hand there was a manager who came maybe a month after i started and the original manager retired, she had no idea what she was doing idk how she got the job she fired everyone to bring in her friends and family, ive never heard or experienced something like this in my life, people can be really foul whent they ready to be, and she also got fired later on."
good,The location i worked in was a very slow area. The amount of traffic that came into the store didn't meet up with the amount of people that worked there. My manger was around the same age as me and would constantly get overwhelmed with the work load he was given. The hardest part of the job was trying to show that i was a good enough worker to advance because my manger hired his friends. I enjoyed talking to the customers and assisting them with what they need. I learned how interact with customers. They really wanted to make sure that we knew how to make customers feel comfortable and assist them with everything they need.
good,I enjoy the ability to work with customers one on one and give them the best experience possible.
good,At Radio Shack Distribution Center we worked as a team to get the work done. We would work from 8 to 12 hours a day. It all depended on how much orders we had. We would work on our own until we finish our tasks we would help each other till we finish all the orders we had.
good,My first customer service job great hours and good pay I really loved this job
good,"RadioShack Is a great company to work for especially the mobile phone division. Typically my day would be interacting with customers and try to help them find a phone that will best suit their needs.That is the most enjoyable aspect for me,"
good,"Handled opening and closing of the store"
good,"•	Provided and ensured every customer received excellent service.    "
good,"Radioshack's management at the store level is often fantastic and fun. Above that, the company is completely disconnected from reality and continues to make poor choices, which will lead in its eventual demise."
good,My days consisted of making sure if they had the merchandise that it was stocked on the shelves. If the they didn't have the product on the shelf or in the store order it. Most of the employees were fun and energetic. The most difficult part was making sure that all the merchandise was in stock.
good,"We'd get to work, clock in, look at the task paper and begin work right away. I learned different things about a lot of products. I learned how they worked etc. My supervisor was very nice. He was a jokester but he'd always put work first. My co-workers were also very nice. They were helpful as well. The hardest part about the job was  trying to convince people to upgrade their lines. The most enjoyable part was the frequent customers that we'd get.pr"
good,typical day is always interesting cant lie about that. enjoyed my time working there
good,"I worked off of commission. At the time, benefits was not offered but pay was decent for all I did! Great atmosphere!"
good,"With growing up in the technology age and it outrunning most of anything these days was a nice experience in learning. With me being highly into electronic and living on my computer it felt normal in doing most of anything there. Made me relate to a lot of people that came in and to know I actually knew what I was talking about. Co-workers never seemed to stay long so that always came and went. Management you felt like you knew more then them, which you probably did. Hardest part was during the slow hours of just standing around and not having anything to do sense you've already done it all."
good,set goals that are hard to meet. not a friendly work environment.
good,"Gave 100% good customer service "
good,"Responsible for entire store level operations including hiring, training, evaluation, scheduling, payroll, store design/layout, merchandising, pricing, productivity and achieving operational standards, employee retention, inventory control and loss prevention."
good,There are some very good people to work with at Radio Shack.  I enjoyed working with the accounts receivable department.
good,"Really fun and interesting job, it gives you the opportunity to learn new things that will be useful at home."
good,"demonstrated merchandise, answer questions close sales, and perform customer service.  enter data into the computer, cashiering and money handling.  I like selling and getting people what they want."
good,"Working at RadioShack was very enjoyable to me. I looked forward to coming to work, I enjoyed helping ensure that every customer left with a smile and confident knowing what they came for was accomplished."
good,I love learning about the new technology and meeting the new customers and building a relationship with them
good,"This is a job where if you have people skills and can sell talk and stand on your feet, you will do fine. Pay is good because of commission."
good,"Become to pushy with customers, slows down , cut back on employees,"
good,"Selling cell phones to different clientele."
good,"it was a easy job for me because i love electronics."
good,It was a fun place to work but the management was terrible in my area. Far too much micro managing.
good,the coworkers were the best. i learned a lot about cell phones. the hardest part is putting up with people.
good,The typical RadioShack workplace consists of a lot of movement. I learned many things about electronics.
good,"A typical day at the shack involves answering phones, scheduling appointments, and above all customer service. On top of all that, I am in charge of scheduling, pricing, inventory, and tech support. People who work at Radioshack are very friendly, and easy to get along with. The hardest part of my job, was knowing the only way to move up or get a raise in the company was to become management. With Radioshack closing 20% of their doors, it is very difficult to find management positions available. The most enjoyable part of my job was building my clientele. Knowing a customer by name, and their preferences was a big plus for me."
good,"Friendly and Competitive Environment"
good,"Sales Associate / Person In Charge (PIC)"

good,"A lot of small type jobs most be done plus online test to get your full pay and experience. Once you finish all the small work customers become your day maker with sales and cell phone carriers plans. Had many managers working here most work with you, you just have to communicate same with your co-workers. Hardest part would be memorizing all the carrier plans and product locations, they change a lot. Most enjoyable part would be working with your co-workers and being able to know exactly how to fix a problem or concern someone has."

Everyone gets along working together. The hardest part of the job is to approach a customer and closing the sale. The most enjoyable part is you can work at a steady pase and very comfortable environment"
good,"•Help the store to achieve and exceed monthly sales goals and company metrics."
good,"Oddly enough, this high school/college job I had at RadioShack might have been my best-paying job to date thanks to commissioned sales.  If  you can sell and/or are lucky enough to be at a high-volume store (I was both), you can make a pretty handy living even just working part time."
good,"I get to interact with new people every day. They come in to shop or fix a issue they might have and I do everything in my power to get them a solution. I get to play with all the new electronics as they come out. Working with the public has very rewarding moments and it teaches me a lot about people as well as getting to learn so much from so many people. I manage 5 employees on a daily basis, training them, coaching them, guiding them. I love being a manager and watching my employees succeed is a great feeling. There is nothing hard about my job day to day. Most enjoyable part of my day is seeing my guest leave happy with the customer service they received as well as with a solution to the issue they came in with."
good,"A failing company that holds meetings in the old, dusty, grimey basements of failing stores. Lots of fun working there though. Very homey environment. Upper management just sucks."

good,"My time with this employer was very beneficial.  They created an environment that fostered learning, growing, and adapting to change."

good,I Liked Working There I Love Technology And Meeting Sales And It Was A Job That I Was Very Great At
good,"answering phones and questions "
good,"Help customers with everyday electronic needs from programing a remote control to programing the newest cellphones. I learned to navigate on Sprint AT&T and Verizon's customer contracts to upgrade devices. They management is really helpful and always encourage you to do your best. All of the co-workers teach you what they know with no problem, the hardest part of the job was learning how to navigate Verizon's customer portal. The most enjoyable part of the job is being able to help customers find a full solution and see them leave the store happy."
good,A typical day as a senior customer service representative consisted of answering phones for RadioShack stores and customers.  We offered support and placed orders.
good,i worked at two locations for this company. the first one being at the augusta mall. thats is relaxed and fun. every day you will look forward to going to work.  the second place was the north augusta location. this place was a nightmare. the store manager is up tight and plays favorites. if you are a favorite you can tell customers off. if not start looking for a new job. 
good,Radio Shack is a performance and metric driven business that rewards performance and outcomes.
good,"I really enjoyed working for Radio Shack. I hated that I had to leave due to hours being cut. I was not use to trying to have customers buy specific products and this position really made me open up to the public. I had to be more vocal and express my true opinions and hope that the customers would listen. I loved working with my co workers and I really enjoyed my managers. You could tell they had your best interests at heart. I did not care for all the inventory or the plan-a-grams but it was something that needed to get completed. A good thing about working with great employees is that we helped each other. The plan-a-grams were probably the hardest and the ability to open up comes a very close second. I was put in a managers position for a short period (manager was on vacation), but it opened my eyes to what it takes to keep a store running at its best. I really enjoyed the new experience and finding out more about what I am capable of doing."
good,This was a fun job. Getting to work with people face to face was rewarding. 
good,I like working at radio shack. Once in awhile we get a rush of customers but it's maintainable. I like the work environment.
good,i had a good time working for them. and the mangers are good and i learned how to manage working with difficult customers
good,"A typical day at RadioShack would include making sales, cleaning up the store and trying to repair previously bought products to ensure the customers would be satisfied with their purchase and their ability to use the products comfortably.  I learned how many electronics worked and how to fix and repair many of the items, I also learned how to make make-shift solutions for problems that a customers had with either set up or uses for the products otherwise not thought about that make the products even more useful. My management and coworkers were all great, we were more like friends than coworkers and the environment was always positive and supportive. The hardest part of the job was dealing with irate customers that wanted things that I could not help them with, for example returning an item that was over 30 days or upgrading a phone for an upgrade price that was not due for the upgrade yet.  The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to offer customers solutions for their needs and showing them how to best utilize their products for what they needed."
good,"Open kiosk, inventory/cash count, help guest clarify any questions they may have. Most of th time there is only one employee there at a time due to it being a small kiosk. As a sales associate I sell phones as well as activate and cancel lines of service. Just like we do sales we also have to deal with returns, exchanges and conplaints of unhappy customers. I made sure every customer left the kiosk happy with the sale they have made."
good,"A typical day at work, would be to prep the store for customer browsing, Talking to many customers about their mobile phone issues. Having to check a data base of batteries in which to assist customers with. "

good,"A typical day at RadioShack included constant customer assistance, and constantly trying to reach a goal for wireless sales. I have learned many important customer relationship skills while managing RadioShack, and now know exactly how to present myself when dealing with customers and how to make customers exceptionally happy with their experience. The management at RadioShack absolutely works together as a team in order to ensure the overall success of the company. My crew in this company was very happy to be there day after day, committed to the company, and always seemed to maintain a positive attitude. The most challenging part about this job was keeping up with the ever-changing wireless products, plans, and information in order to accurately present the service to the customers. The job was overall very enjoyable, and the most enjoyable aspect was the satisfaction and gratitude that came with reaching sales goals. "
good,The workplace was always constant with customers walking in and out purchasing things or just browsing around.
good,A typical day at work consists of engaging in conversations with customers about there cell phone provider.
good,Learned alot about sales. learned how to work with all different types of people.
good,Worked for Radioshack in Virginia Mn for about a year. Was a good job compared to some retail jobs. Wouldnt mind working for them again if they werent so concerned about quotas. I did pretty much everything at that job got to help customers which was my favorite part. Great training. Decent pay commission and base pay. The only major issue I had was with the district managers being so obsessed about sales numbers and would get fired if you didnt meet the goal. I worked in a very low traffic mall and you were expected to hit numbers which were impossible some months. They would threaten to fire GOOD employees not meeting the goals. I ended up quitting before it got really bad I could see the direction the company was going and couldn't see myself there much longer. This company is going downhill and is closing stores I recommend staying away from them unless you want to get laid off.
good,i sold elctronics it was fun i learned how to work a cash register
good,"A typical day would include learning new product specifications and understanding how the products work. Depending on the day I would either open the store which includes readying the store for the day, or close which I would count down the registers, clean, and make sure the financial gain of the day would reach the deposit destination."
good,"I learned how to deal with difficult customers and easy customers. The management was alright, not the best, but alright. My co-workers and I got along for the short time I was at my store and a typical day at work would be taking care of customers and ringing them out on the cash register."
good,"A typical day at Radio Shack varied due to what shift you were working. Most of the time you were helping guests with questions that they hadabout the products we sold. Radio Shack does carry the three major cell phone companies (AT&T, Sprint, and Verizon). With that being the case many people had questions about the service and about the phones, being a wireless specialist it was my job to help answer any questions that the customers had."
good,"You have to be self motivated to increase your income in this job. You have to push sales of various items, and current promotions to receive bonuses. It was a fun job because you have a lot of freedom in the store. You are not subjugated to one area only"
good,Its a nice environment to work in. At times its a little hard to do a cell phone sale due to how our economy is. They always wanted a contract sale that's were the more money was. You also had to meet your metrics and if you didn't you would have to do some counseling. Most enjoyable was meet new people and keeping a conversation so they would come back to visit. Also keep them satisfied as well.
good,A typical work day mainly consisted of sales while at the same time creating a customer friendly environment. My co-workers were awesome because we worked as a team to help each other meet individual sales expectations. My work day included selling but also opening and closing the store and creating the schedule for my staff. The hardest part of the job for me was leaving because it actually became a second home the most enjoyable part was the long lasting friendships created from working at a place where everyone feels apart of something greater than themselves.
good,Great environment to work in with professional people. Senior management is in transition which leaves a bit of uncertaintly as to corporate direction.
good,"It was very slow work day. lots of busy work by doing plano, need better marketing tool, learned alot about management there"
good,my co workers are fun to work with we're like family..the hardest part of the job is when ppl reject your service of selling them things.

good,Management was very helpful and friendly. Work environment was fun and demanding at the same it.
good,helping customers
good,A typical day consisted of opening the store at 9:00 am and closing the store at 9:00 pm. I learned the long and hard hours involved in retail. Management can be very rewarding in the retail industry. My co-workers consisted of approximately 18 other store managers in my district. The hardest part of the job was the long hours accompanied by the 1.5 drive to work. The most enjoyable part of the job was our teams ability to hit our monthly targets each month.
good,demonstrate customer service to establish customer rapport.
good,"my typical day at work would be to open the store and make sure the presentation of the store was up to its standards. Taking down promotions and putting new ones up, redoing the floor layout of the store to what the picture for that paticular store should look like. Most of my days at the end of the day would be to close the store count money in the cash drawer and drop the money off at the bank."
good,Helping client's with products related questions
good,"A typical day at work consist of clocking in restocking setting the stores displays straightening products, working inventory in unpacking inventory, helping clients with projects or setting up cell phones. Most of the co workers where part time and easy to work with management can be a little pushy on certain issues but i'm sure its mostly about overall sales of the store. The hardest part of the job was the odd schedule for me. I was the one that would cover any shift if anybody called in, that wasn't my goal but thats how it worked out. I really enjoyed helping people find that little part for there project or helping them find a new cell phone."
good,Constant pressure from District Managers.
good,"open and close,count safe, make daily bank deposits,open new cell phone accounts for numerous cell phone providers"
good,"I got hired on August of 2011. I already went through 3 managers above me. I have been promoted from a FT Sales Associate to a MIT in a matter of 3 months. Now I have to wait, and wait for my District Manager to remember to interview me for the actual Assistant Manager position that comes with a pay raise. The company always asks that you aks a million and one questions while selling a million and one things to customers. It's alright for the most part. Over all the company has been quite a perfect fit for me but if another career opportunity opens up wqith better pay, I'm there."
good,Learned a lot in this job love it as my first job. The thing that I learned I am still using and will continue to use.
good,"A normal day would consist of helping customers find what they came in for. I was educated on alot of new things, how things work, and what their purpose was. The management was ok"
good,"I truly enjoyed learning more on techincal and electronic issues. I did not like the low pay,"
good,"All in all a great company, i have worked here from high school till present and i have learned a great amount of people skills , managing money , i think radio shack is a great job to grow with."
good,"My time at Radio shack was short due to it being a temporary position, but I still learned alot from my experience while working there."
good,Your job experience with RadioShack is due to the traffic of the store. If your at a slow store it will be a bad experience because you do have monthly quotas to reach.
good,Benefits Training and Mgt were first rate. Earned trips and other incentives for reaching sales goals
good,A typical day was working with cellphone customers. I got the best of both worlds... I got the opportunity to work with the public and technology.
good,Radioshack as a company has so many focuses that will keep you on your feet at all times with its fast pace environment. That challenge alone has been wonderful in so many aspects in helping me with exceptional customer service skills and acquiring much better selling skills. The people I was able to work with were also very helpful and we all learned from each other.
good,Had a lot of fun working with the customers and teaching my employees about the products that we sold and how to sell those products to the customers. I learned a lot about working in and managing in a retail environment.
good,i thought it was a great work environment and the people were great as well
good,Good place for tech geeks who build from scratch or people who like cell phones.
good,"a typical day at work includes updating price tags, dusting, cleaning off dusty products, and anything necessary to keep the environment clean and welcoming to customers."
good,This is a great place to work if your college student or you need a resume builder for a sales background with some technical work. The company will work with your schedule but it is difficult to make a decent living at the company unless you are at the district manager level.
good,My coworkers were very helpful and fun to work with. My manager taught me a lot about the company and procedures. The hardest part of the job is dealing with upset customers.
good,Most days went by fast because the constant flow of customers. The working environment was fun and enjoyable. During my time at this job I really learned a lot about electronics.
good,"Decent place to work, good management, decent benefits. busy workpplace."
good,"I loved my co-workers and the way thins ran at Radioshack. There is only one thing I did not like about the workplace and that was the District Manager (DM). I know every workplace has that one person that you don't like, but in this case no one liked him. He was rude, shallow, and very discouraging. He didn't care about your personal health, or the fact that you go to church on Sundays and cannot work on those days. He was very disrespectful to everyone there in every store. I lost my job because I was 20 minutes early (like I always was), and he brought up write-ups, that he publically announced that they were to be removed and trashed, against me to fire me."
good,"A day at radioshack was interacting with customers, selling electronics and offering other services and products. I learned to meet needs of the company as well as the customers, My coworkers were very friendly, though we were all competitive. The hardest part of the job was trying to complete daily planograms as well as handling the many customers. The most enjoyable part of the job was interacting with the many different people."
good,Quick advancement for the right individuals. Once at the manager level not many more opportunities.
good,i like this company. i would work for them if offered a position. pretty good benefits and job security
good,Radio Shack has been a great learning experience for me. Overall good job.
good,"I really enjoyed this job i got to work with different things as in labtops, different cell phones, radio. I met so many different people who came in and out radio shack"
good,"very goal oriented, able to move up in the company. liked working with customers establishing their needs and wants"
good,Good while it lasted. The customers were great. The management was good. Over all the experience was all that I thought it would be. If you like customer service then you’d like radio shack
good,"An Okay place to work. Everyday you sold company merchandise. Handeled customer complaints, return. I learned how to balance the register, wonderful and fun workplace to work. Left us short handed often as result became difficult to handle busy hours with only one employee being in the store."
good,"No Review. The company  closed all their business on the islands and most of the U.S."
good,I learned a lot about how to use the cash register and about retail. I helped customers answer their questions and I helped get them the right product they were looking for.
good,"It was a love hate relationship. But I was with them for 12 years before the final BK."
good,There was never a typical since you would never know what customers would come to the store to shop. Hardest part is being on your feet during your entire shift
good,"Unfortunately, the organization is only available as an online storefront. Customer service employment opportunities are no longer existent. Nothing more to input."
good,"great place to work,  fun atmosphere ,  commission plus base pay"
good,I loved working with my coworkers and learning the tech. My manager wasnt the best but I didnt see him often. Most of the time I worked with a shift supervisor. I loved talking with the customers that came through the location.
good,Everyone was very nice. The corporation was going under. I was part of the reduction in force prior to the Sprint buy out. Overall it WAS a nice place to work until again they wen out of business
good,"It was an average job to get thru college. Pay sucked, management was harsh. Wanted more from employees with less pay. Competitive companies paid more"
good,"mucha presión de ventas altas, atencion al cliente, ventas y cobro en caja."
good,Company is no longer around. Definitely helped me in advancing in my career and giving me management experience. It's unfortunate that decisions were made that impacted the company negatively.
good,I was able to gain full knowlege of the 4 leading cell phone companies. i was able to clarify and explain the in and outs of all apple products we held in store locations.i was a great manager before the store location close
good,RadioShack environment was very much simple and gave you the opportunity to care for customers and their needs. I was able to learn how sale products to customers that needed assistance with other products.
good,"Fun work environment. Not an insane number of customers walking through the store at any given time. Let's you spend more time with each customer and also get to know your coworkers. "
good,Very enjoyable place to work at first but once the manager had decided to leave to manage  his own business things seemed to change for the worse. Went through 3 different managers while employed there.
good,"The job itself was great, managemet was great. There was no typical day at work persay, in that we were allways tryng new things in order to improve our buiness model. It truly tought me the meaning of multitasking, and thinking on your feet, as we didn't know exactly what was to be expected on a a day to day basis. It was a truly  challenging experience, and extremely fast paced which I enjoyed. The hardest part of the job was not nowing what the future held for me, and for my employees whom I tried to realax and to  help them  have faith, which is not easy to do when you yuorself have doubts. No one could really tell  what the future of the company was to be, especially with online sales trends, and our exttremely high overhead with 4000 stores nationwide, but it was fun while it lasted, and I got to meet some great people. Which was really the most enjoyable part. That I got to work with some really positive people who made my job easer and more much more enjoyable."
good,while I couldn't work there forever due to the wages this had to be one of my favorite jobs to work for since it dealt with DIY electronics I really enjoyed Talking to people about their technology needs. It is definitely a good stepping stone job.
good,"I had no issue with working there when I was there but I left to take care of my children. "
good,"Very competitive work environment that helps you learn teamwork. There was always something to learn regarding electronics and customer experience. Unfortunately, this company is out of business."
good,It was a relaxed job. But also fun. The manager was a cool person. A typical day would of been trying to sell as many phones as one could. The maintenance of the store was easy too.
good,It would get very stressful from time to time but was overall a fair place to work at. You will have to learn really quickly to sell sell sell beacuse that is what you will be doing pretty much till you quit
good,"I worked for salary and commission there fore the job was very competitive and cut throat. I learned a lot about technology, electronics and customer service."
good,"As with any retail job, many people have to rush to a customer and make a sale. I don't recommend working there if you are not a quick learner. To bad they all closed down."
good,"it was a lot of fun working here, you learned so much about electrics and tools. it was great getting discounts on phone bills and the newest cellphones."
good,a typical day at RadioShack meant business and sales. Customer satisfaction and building a strong connection with our employees and everyone walking into our doors.
good,"It was a very good place to work. My co workers were awesome, my manager was awesome. We got fair commission based on what we sold. I left because  we were short staffed so i had to work 50+ hours a week."
good,"Radio Shack was a good company to work for, the hours were easy and the atmosphere brought in many amateur inventors with new ideas daily. The problem was that they had to close over a fifth of the company and that included my store."
good,it was different.learned a lot. had fun at times.. that's pretty much ithad fun had fun had had fun had fun. listened to music all day. helped customers with their problems
good,9 hour days . not enough payroll hours to properly take care of the customers . loved the job an the opportunity to offer my knowledge and do some training
good,Company as a whole was pleasurable. Towards being delisted and purchased then bankrupt again the job had many insecurities. If the company had lasted the job would have been one of my favorite places to manage.
good,Typical day at work Open the store help customers. What I learn everything the sligo was you have questions we have the answer we had to know a lot and learn new things everyday. Management before I became a manager they where helpful and willing to lend a hand. The hardest part of the job was to try to make the month every time and all the time. The most enjoyable part of the job helping a child with there science project with all the little nick nacks they needed.
good,"Radio shack does not exist any more do to lack of sales. Good benefits, great people to work with.Promised vacation pay accumulated during closing months added to final paycheck"
good,"Great start up or school persons job.Not great pay but will learn a lot about good work habits.You will be doing stocking,displays,cleaning,dusting,vacuuming,windows,mopping,sales with a goal to be meet,opening and closing the store,banking deposits and customer service."
good,Was relocated to take over Las Vegas NV.  After 3 yrs there the company decided to make a lot of changes and cut back on long term employ and cut back on higher wages.  they let go almost all 20yr managers and any district managers who wee high labor cost.  cutting Mgs salaries by almost half.
good,"I learned a lot about electronics, and my manager was very helpful. However, I did not like the the fact that my hours we so random at times. It made it hard to get adjusted to working there."
good,I did contract TV and electronics repair so I wasn't that involved with the rest of the store operations but I was there a lot. I would say that aside from low advancement options and benefits it is a great place

good,endroit ok dans le commerce au detail. peu de vacances
good,"Learning how to manage a small retail store, managing daily reports, such as profits and sales, sales plans, and overall customer support, by giving customers their needs and wants."
good,Not much room for advancement to a full time position but overall a great place to work.It is fast paced but once you get the hang of it your set to go. Learning all the products in the store takes about 3-4 months.
good,My employment was a pleasure and they are now filing chapter 11 so therefore I am trying to get another position due to corporation failure and it was not job performance related. I exceeded all job duties.
good,salary is enough to survive every month. a lot of working pressure like have to all the customers even they dont enter our shop. customer wants different things but they sold items that customer not really wanted but they ask to push the sales.
good,"Daily challenges kept things interesting, it was never the same issue to solve for customers, always a different situation. Management allowed employees to spend time with customers to answer all questions."
good,"originally a great place to work, until a finance company purchased the company changed the culture and ruined it. They closed stores and laid off many people. They knew nothing about retail."
good,"I typical work day included opening duties, making a plan for the day, brief inventory, cash handling, preparing my team, and getting the store ready for business. At Radio Shack I learned how to coach, lead by example, run a business, read a P&L/Expense Summary, complete coaching reviews, and much more. I enjoyed working with my team and developing people. The hardest part of the job was the quarterly inventories that took 8 hours to conduct. The most enjoyable part of the job was making a difference in peoples lives."
good,Overall it is a good place to work. Good working environment just wish that some of the managers wasn't so noisy to their fellow employee's personal businesses
good,Stocking shelves was a challenge. Vacuuming the floor was easy. Point of Sale transactions were tactful. Upsellilng was mandatory. Workplace was clean
good,"Great people to work with there is not much room to advance or to make more money. "
good,Sale technology to costumers. If you like to convince costumers to buy products this is a good job for you. If you do not like to force to sell merchandice to costumers this is not the place for you .
good,"I started out as a sales associate  part time. After all the online training, I started to rotate around 3 stores per week (or 2 store per day) within the district. I was nice meeting all the managers in the district and its what got me my promotion to Manager In Training. I had to train myself since at the time, there was no store manager at the store that i was stationed at as a manager in training. I was always the top sales person at every store. Eventually, I got promoted to Acting store manager and then store manager within the same year. I been through a lot District managers, most were alright, but only one was cool and nice. "
good,Radio Shack is a great environment to learn and understand the market in new technology and get more connected with the latest gadgets that big name companies have brought to us in todays day in age
good,"Working with anything that has to do with electronics. We are taught About the Newest phones, phone plans, and the separate phone companies. Also on anything in the store down to the right battery to pick for the smallest things. The goal for the company is for the staff to become well diversified for everything they sold. The management is okay it all depends on the location. Co-workers are great always willing to teach. The hardest part would be remember everything in the store. If you like electronics learning new things makes the job enjoyable."
good,Typical Would Consist Sometime Floods Of People Coming In Looking For Different Utilities. Management Would Never Be There So It Was Very Poor Manager Was Never There To Show Face. Co-Workers Were All Pretty Cool Never Bad Employees We Will All Get Along. The Hardest Part Was Getting Rid Of People One By One When You Were Alone And Having A Sworm Of People On Line. The Most Enjoyable I Would Say Was When I Was Nominated Employee Of The Month 3 Months In a Row And Received Prizes And Bonuses.
good,"I've been employed with Radio Shack on two separate occasions. The first time I worked for them, I enjoyed it, I became a key holder, fairly quickly, and I felt myself on a fast track for success. Many people would comment ""I thought you had to know a lot about electronics to work there."" Well, while electronics knowledge is a definite plus, I had little experience with most of the items we sold, but I was trained well and felt confident in my sales. I would also walk the store and review the products I was less acquainted with during slow times, which helped with future sales. I left due to personal issues of my own, but I returned two years later because I had enjoyed it. Things did change of course, but for someone looking for that competitive edge, willing to work hard for commission sales, this job is for you."
good,"A usual day at Radioshack was spent by replacing price tags and fixtures,  and learning new sales plans. My knowledge of electronics helped me determine the item that most customers were looking for and to explain how to use it. Management was usually well handled, however there were times that it wasn't. It was not a very hard job at all. At times there were irate customers, but they usually had reason to be.The most enjoyable part of the job were the coworkers, whoever knew something that could help would."
good,"You are always working fast, always have to stay organized and help with any challenges a customer comes in with. Over the phone help as well as in person. Team work is a must at a job like this"
good,"I enjoyed this working at this position for the period of time I was employed with Radio Shack. I learned may customer service skills and how to run a register. Also, I learned how to properly stock shelves and keep track of orders. Greeting customers as they entered the store and finding the right products or needs was also another duty I was trained in. My co-workers were very helpful and made my training easy and fast."
good,"A typical day at radio shack consisted of studying new technology. Every week there was a new phone or gps or tv etc coming out to learn about to better your sales. I spent everyday reading about cell phones and how electronics worked to the point where I now can fix broken electronics and tell you exactly how cell phones work per service provider."
good,Shame they gone! customer will miss this place lots of products that only Radio shack sold but this is expected of a big company                                                                                       .
good,"I charged customers accordingly. Helping customers find the best cellular network and plans were a daily activity. We would help with AT&T and Sprint plans as well as T-Mobile, Boost Mobile, Virgin Mobile, etc. Working with these co-workers was fun and they were all very helpful. The hardest part about the job was working for the company and dealing with their needs. The most enjoyable part of the job was satisfying the customers by finding solutions to their needs when it mostly came to cellular plans."
good,It was a good job. It got very stressful at times but it was a good job. It was very manager dependent as far as your quality of life went. With the right store manager it was great.
good,"Fun place to work . Awesome staff, great work hours, never a dull moment. great product. It was a bummer that Radio Shack closed down so many stores."
good,"Accept shipments, send out recalled and returned items. Make schedule, compare profit and loss for current year and prior year. Planogram the floor. Price weekend sales. Trained employees."
good,company was enjoyable to work for but the internet market was more competitive.  Management was fair and I enjoyed working where some incentive was paid to my selling ability
good,"I enjoyed my time working there, however there is a reason this place is going out of business, out of date products that are overpriced."
good,Great place to work. I learned a lot about selling techniques and handling customer issues in a positive way. Hardest part of the job was meeting sales targets
good,Mainly a customer service job that focuses selling to many times repeat customers.  The customer service training is unsurpassed.
good,"Mostly just used for a stepping stone for getting my foot into the working lifestyle, wasn't too happy with management and personal advancement with the company"
good,one of the best jobs to have but poor management decisions causes it to go bankrupt. I would recommend this to anyone who is able to deal with change on a constant bases.
good,"Effectively manage teams of 4 retail stores to operate profitable businesses for RadioShack. Effectively managing store operations utilizing corporate strategic skills to maximize sales."
good,"IF you like electronics, Radio Shack is a good place to work! Lots of fun tools and projects available."
good,"Everyday is different in retail.  I have built a strong staff by leading by example.  Mangers that are successful if they don't manage,  they Lead.  The hardest part of this job will be letting go. The most enjoyable part of this part of the business is the customer interaction that have turned great relationships."
good,"Go in, study the product, help the customer. It's as simple as that. I've learned so much in 6 short months. I get the satisfaction of knowing i helped customers get what they need and I learn something useful everyday. I never would have thought I would know how to solder six months ago."
good,"A typical day for me would range from filing papers from the day before, looking over all contracts of phone sales, counting the money for over/short, ordering supplies and/or product for the store, training staff to optimal efficiency, uniform inspections, cleaning for optimal presentation to customers, light maintenance, budgeting spending limits based on last years reports, set sales goals for the store and employees, inventory control, basic story security and theft control, delivery outstanding customer service, aid customers within and outside the best of my abilities."
good,"This was my first job as a young adult, I enjoyed the experience! Radio Shack gave me the opportunity to work on my customer service skills...witch is very important for most jobs. I also gained knowledge of various electronic parts, how to promote, and sale them. I felt as though I was limited as to upward growth."
good,"it was new position at radio shack at the time.  What i did was stock shelves, put prices on items and help complete floors.  Also organize and count any merchandise in the back and in the basement.  Hardest part of my doing a lot of work and having to stay to finish what else is left to do by someone else.  Easiest part was just showing up."
good,Working at Radioshack has been good experience. It is a great place to work. With recent business financing Radioshack has been struggling. Radioshack is trying to fight bankruptcy. With that said job security is not there.
good,i dont think i got paid enough at this job as much work as i put into it...
good,"Good job that allowed me to work with the public and understand it. "
good,"Responsibilities Included:"
good,"A typical day at work was very productive we got a lot of operations and daily sales strategies implemented and executed.I learned how to control and monitor payroll ,lead a team to success ,understand P&L ,conflict resolution, and some human resource. My district manager was very hands on and always made himself available. My co-workers were aged 18-35 they were all different so i had to learn to adapt to all their different learning styles so at the end i could have an educated and sales ready team.The hardest part about managing at radioshack was the 6 day work week, and when i was off i wasn't really off ,because i was also a team leader so other stores that didn't have managers would call me with questions on my day off.And lastly the paycuts due to the previous manager inability to overcome the sales year.The best part of my job was when i was recognized for all my work and when any of my assistant managers would move on and become managers as well."
good,I really loved working for RadioShack and helping out customers find solutions for their problems.  The only downside is we would constantly change what we had to focus on pretty much every month.   They also constantly change how our warranties work which upsets the loyal customers. Its only good as a first job because you learn many different things.
good,A typical day of work revolved around sales. My number one priority was exceptional customer service while increasing sales. The management was great and always expected nothing less than 100 percent. The hardest part of the job was to balance life and work.
good,My customers were the whole reason I would get up and go to work everyday
good,"a typical day at work was who could sell the most phones and batteries, it was always a friendly competition. i learned that you if you get past your pride you can become open to accomplish some great things. management was very organized and trained well. the hardest part sometimes were the competitions but it pushed everyone to do there best. the most enjoyable part is setting your goal and accomplishing that goal."
good,"RadioShack is truly a haven for those interested and invested in retail for consumer electronics. While the life to job ratio may vary for some, this career leaves a lot to be desired in free time. Customers are the most enjoyable part of the job, as well as the perks that often pop up, ie. reduced cellphone bills, discounts on vital merchandise, etc, however the style of management might need to be revamped."
good,I am looking for a job with either a pay increase or better hours in the field i most enjoy
good,"focused on wireless"
good,"You come in 15 minutes before opening, since its very easy to open the store and turn on the lights. Very simple assignments but can take a long time to do at the same time as you are helping customer so you need to multi-task always. What I love the most about this job is interacting with customers and helping sales consultants achieve their monthly goals. As with every business one must have a owner mentality to do great in any sales position since they are commission based with lower hourly pays. My advise for someone looking to work in retail is to find what they like to do and match their strengths to that field and always know their products or services because that is very important. Management will always be interested in your performance since the more you sale the more you earn and if you are driven to help customers, this will be the perfect career for a person to pursue."
good,Each day is filled with having a little fun while we deal with customers. My co-workers are fun to be around and learn fast. The hardest part of the job is dealing with the attitudes that come in the store thinking we are supposed to bow down to them.
good,Flexible hours. Reasonable compensation/incentives and benefits.
good,"It's fun to be around all the electronics, but the knowledge expertise has decreased in recent years because everything is being designed towards a ""throw away"" culture of just buying something new when the old one breaks, as opposed to learning how to use circuit boards to make your own."
good,They are very organize in what they do. Making easy sales for everyone.
good,"A typical day at work consisted of an eight hour shift, involving either closing or opening the store with one other employee. At the beginning of each day I was expected to update myself on promotions and goings-on of the corporation through the email system. Throughout the day, I was expected assist customers in any way possible, answering questions and trying to sell them on the ""full package"" as opposed to just a single electronic device. I was also expected to assist in the daily operations including stocking and rearranging shelves and maintaining a clean store. I learned about many consumer electronics from audio equipment to media devices to cell phones. The management (at my particular branch) was poor at best. The hardest part of the job was cell phone activations for the three major carriers (Sprint, Verizon, and AT&T), purely because they backed up the checkout line and took a lot of time. The most enjoyable part of the job was always learning something new, and being on the cutting edge of technology. Also, helping customers was a fairly satisfying profession. The commission was nice too."
good,This job is more hands on no training just get out and sell. If they would take out more time and do extensive training it would help morale.
good,"Overall I enjoyed my 12 years with RadioShack. I built several long term relationships with customers over the years because of my dedication to customer service. The company has had it's share of ups and downs but has managed to remain competitive with the big box stores by focusing on excellent customer service of which I was extremely proud to be a part of. "
good,"I enjoyed working for the store and learned a lot about cell phones, power cords, and electrical parts. I'm part time and I felt I just wasn't getting the help I need to be successful from management. My coworkers are great people I enjoy working with. The hardest part of my job is being part time and not knowing what changed for all the cell phone companies, and our computer system. My favorite part of the job is working with customers and see them satisfied when they walk out the door."
good,"A typical day at work would consist of going in and doing simple tasks like putting out inventory for the store and making sure things looked good.I learned about working with cell phone providers such as Sprint, AT&T and Verizon. I also learned quite a bit about electronics. They provide good information in order for you to know about your work and what to expect and new things that are coming out and how to best service customers.  Management was great, had understanding managers. Hardest part of work here was making phone sales on a slow day. Most enjoyable part of work was making enough sales and making extra money by doing so. when it accumulates it makes a difference in how much you make per month."
good,Consulting clients and closing contracts. The company does influence employees to become managers. So to grow with the company was quite nice. 
good,"Radio Shack creo que es una empresa que esta tomando forma ya que hay muchos hueos en sus procesos pero que permite el desarrollo e implementacion de tecnicas y procesos para el mejoramiento de su operacion; ademas es una empresa que te remunera en base a tu trabajo y esfuero  que te permite crecer como persona y como profesional a niveles que tu decides, pero que de igual forma te exige y al estar en expansion no hay tiempo para errores."
good,I was very productive in my days at work with Radioshack. Managers were very goal oriented and wanted to assist as much as they could to reach company goals . We completed complictaed task on a daily basis all whille providing exceptional customer service and having fun
good,I've learned much about electronics and headsets I previously knew nothing about. Management and other employees were very helpful in the development in learning the product. Figuring out some of those products were the hardest thing about the job but it was a challenge I looked forward to. I enjoyed everythin about the job and things I will learn in the future.
good,great company to work for that taught me alot of lessons on how to become a better manager and also how to make my employees better at there jobs.
good,ana verage day would include opening the store 30 mins early to set up registers and turn lights on and set the goals of the day for my associates. normally pushing phone sales and attach which commission is made on. keeping up with the district manager on the stores metrics. by four or five doing the bank deposit and dopping it off where the stores deposit box is located.
good,"sales! sales! sales! learned a lot about electronics, tvs, cameras, wires, laptops, and cell phones"
good,Company needs a change. Still working with old Tandy ideas in a Best Buy world.
good,"I would wait for customers to come in, address them, try and figure out their problem or what they came in for, try and sale them products such as, phones, internet, mp3s, iPods, insurance. The manager was good, he was on top of things, but he was never really clear of what he wanted to be done and how. My co-workers were awesome. They were easy going and when it came down to it they got their job done. They hardest part of my job would have to be waiting for customers to come it. It was slow in the area. Also, it was hard when there was only two of us on the floor and we got a rush. We'd have to try and speed through sales and attending the customer. The most enjoyable part I'd have to say was interacting with the customers."
good,"Interacting with customers in downtown Seattle is an experience in itself. I've never learned so much at a job in my life, having walked into the store with little to no understanding of the products. The management was very dedicated, but you definitely come across those who are careless. There are a few very driven employees with amazing work-ethic, but they are a bit hard to come by. The most difficult part of the job was probably up-selling, because most of the people who came into the store already knew what they wanted and didn't care what you had to say. Things have changed lately in the commission/benefit area, and it has done nothing but bring on arguments and unhappy employees."
good,"Typical day at work was spent on the computer - filling out incident reports, investigation reports, completing inspections, scheduling training for each department. Learned to create badges, program some of them for access to different departments, CPR, how to use an AED, keeping track of many types of reports & investigations. The hardest part of the job was coming out of my comfort zone and getting to know the people that worked in different departments within the building. There were approximately 200 employees and approximately 100 temporary workers within the building."
good,"The retail with commission was good, but they practically eliminated it over the Christmas season. Still pretty typical of a retail store environment."
good,"Radioshack is a great place to work, however they expect too much from their manager for too little compensation."
good,"Open the store, made sure all products were customer ready. count the money. Help employee obtain the sales goal, to help the store reach and pass it's sales goal on a day to day basis."
good,"Awsome place to work. Lots of fun, great people. Would have stayed forever if the pay was better."
good,"I'm a full time key holder that makes me responsable for many duties. Witcha involves me answering the phone, solving customers problems or complaints. Making sure that I do all that I can to make all customers happy and satisfied and knowing they will come back to visit the store again. It can be very busy and productive at days, but that's all about working in a retail business. I wouldn't change my work experience for nothing else in the world!"
good,"My location was a small location, so all five employees became familiar with each other rather quickly. If someone wasn't sure about information concerning a product or the store it self, some else was there to help you out."
good,"Good for students, and basic skills in job entry level. Trainings are mandoatory, but informative and paid. Sales job."
good,They did not pay me for any of my commisions. At the end the told me they couldnt pay me out
good,"4 different depts to organize, aside from contributing my full attention to my department - Home Appliance Dept."
good,I worked here when I was much younger and was a good first job. I left because I was offered a better pay.
good,I enjoy working for Radio Shack but I am not able to move up into management.
good,When I worked there it was an opportunity to achieve by hard work and honesty
good,I enjoyed the customer service experience and increase sales.
good,Was working here during school and taught me a lot about leading a team.
good,Radio Shack helped me to be a stronger leader. I loved helping customers and solve there problem. Being a team leader made me confident to lead.
good,The management team were awesome they were willing to train me which I thought was a plus if I was not already ready to do everything it was an amazing process for me
good,It was a great place for college students. People with little work skills. The company went out of business . I don't think it was because of the employees.. they made bad executive decisions.
good,It was fun while it lasted. Too bad the company went belly up. It was my first real role in management which provided the the necessary skills to get to where I'm currently at.
good,I enjoyed this job during my time there. It helped me improve on my face to face customer service skills. Ii also learned to do inventory as well as receiving some managerial training
good,It was a good six years working at Radio Shack climbing the ladder to become assistant manager however there was no benefits for room for advancement after I receive the assistant manager position. I got to hire some pretty cool people along the way and I enjoyed that but when the store told me it was closing it was pretty devastating.
good,"Learned a lot through the management training program in Knoxville, which I attended many times. Typical work day was taking care of all the stores needs. Management was great. Co workers and environment was good. Dealing with irate customers. Most enjoyable part was the co workers."
good,Another business that closed. It was a fun and great business to work for. I would have loved to have been able to further my career with the company.
good,This job was great when i started it was just like being a car salesman except you received commission for everything you sold so it was easy to build a nice check. only thing is it was very competitive. Then  they became no more.
good,It was a great company to work for in the early years. There was always opportunities to learn new languages and tools. Felt like in the later years as senior management lost focus on where to take the company.
good,"Leaving Radio Shack was not my goal, as I loved working for the company. As a store manager I worked every day open to close for 3 months straight, and the salary was equivalent to 9.00 an hour."
good,Working for radioshack was a whole bunch of sitting around hoping customers would come in. On the bright side you get a lot of time to build and play around with new products.
good,Slow paced so not enough customers and not enough pay or benefits. Conveniently located next to Best Buy. Not the best location. Currently closed down.
good,"It was great to work at the Shack. My fellow employees as well as my superiors were very friendly and easy to get along with. That made collaborating so much easier in the long run, which kept us on top of everything the world had to throw our way. A combination of sales and customer service kept it a pretty quick-paced store, which was an enjoyable work environment for myself. It's a shame it went out of business, as it was a wonderful place to work and I looked forward to clocking in everyday."
good,I was working at Radioshack this not too long before it was closed due to the company itself losing too much money. I'd likely have stayed there if it didn't close. My boss there was great.
good,"Growth oriented place to work with good opportunities to advance, the pay is commensurate with the level of commitment. Excellent place to learn about customer service, sales, promotions, business strategies, learn about the latest consumer electronic technology, and business management."
good,"I gained most of my management skills, customer service skills, sales knowledge, and many other management tools while working for Radio Shack.  The store owner and his wife trained me to run the store and be successful as a manager as well as future endeavors."
good,"A very good place to work at, you get to learn a lot about technology. Now since Radioshack stores closed down im not too sure about how is it since Sprint took over the stores."
good,"I really enjoyed dealing with the customers of Radio Shack. You got to meet a lot of interesting customers, in fact, that was how I landed the job on the Railroad. "
good,A typical work day would be opening the store and getting everything ready and set up for customer. Doing morning paper work until another staff member came in. Usually dealing with the Shipments and counting products. Once opened handling all customers needs. What i learned from this job was how to lead a team and train them. My manager was always helpful and on top of his game. My hardest part about working for RadioShack was the upper management not being there when needed and always having anew DM. My most enjoyable of moments about this job was how well my team and I work together. I always new my team wouldn't let me down.
good,"This company is no longer in operation but before I left, I loved interacting with the customers and my fellow co-workers.  Each day we strove to do our best and to make the customer happy."
good,Great place to work while store was open. Learned a lot as New Store Manager in the World of Retail. We always maintained a fun but challenging atmosphere.
good,great place to work especially if you are a hustler. Too bad the place closed down. used to get 30 dollars for every new customer phone sale. upgrade 14. prepaid 5 to 10 dollars commission. every month someone is getting a new phone or upgrading.
good,The job was fun for those who liked electronics and helping people. The hours were flexible and they allow for the advancement to management. The pay isn't all that good.
good,"It was a summer job that paid well, but lacked creativity. The corporate heads did not think outside of the box on trying to get new customers into the store."
good,"Store management and other employees were good, but corporate wanted to sell stuff no one wanted, and thats why they went out of business, if they marketed stuff that best buy had, or just general consumer electronics, they would of survived."
good,Radio Shack was an enjoyable job being able to make customers happy and had many different duties. Even though they are no longer here it was a pleasant job to have.
good,The job itself was pretty good. Fun friendly workers helping each other. The job teaches not just the customers but the workers themselves too. Store closed down. Great job to build confidence!
good,"Before the store i worked at closed down it was you're typical electronic store. We had a number of responsibilities including helping customers, handling cash transactions, unloading our merchandise, opening and closing the store, cleaning it and having it prepared for the next day. I learned a lot about electronics."
good,"I was a freshman in high school when I worked this job. It was my second job i ever had. My manager went by the nickname Trap. He was one of the nicest, honest, hardworking gentleman I have ever met. He took me under his wing and showed me all I needed to know to do my job effectively and efficiently, plus more. I enjoyed helping others find tech that they were interested in at the time. I also sold and repaired phones, so it was always nice to help out in anyway I could."
good,"I learned so much about technical components and hooking up systems like home theater, sound systems, radios, RC racing car assembly, repairing cords (splicing and attaching a new connector), etc"
good,There is no need to really do a review on this company being that it is now out of business. What a shame that they could not change with the modern technology.
good,Depending on the store you can make more sales.  My store had a lot of theft so I felt I had to be more cautious in watching out for item being stolen rather than selling them.  Job was fairy simple overall and simple process to sell cell phone plans
good,"This was a great starter job. Even though I wasn't there very long, everyone was so wonderful. From teaching me how things were done, to helpful tips, to even providing me a ride home before so I wouldn't have to walk over a mile."
good,I learned a lot more here than I have ever learned at any other job. Many little things that workers have already experienced from others jobs as well as from learning on experience with customers. I have learned from my employers and customers life lessons I never knew before.
good,"I liked radioshack too bad it closed down , i didnt know much about electronics when i started but i got the hang of it . I liked my team members they were patient and fun ."
good,"Store lacked needed product due to lack of DC sending requested needs. Work was fun, hired great sales people who where very knowledgable. Most enjoyable part of the job is solving a problem for the customer."
good,This was the best job I have had thus far in my life and the one I held onto the longest. My co-workers were friendly and the store itself felt like family. My manager was willing to work with me and helped me train and guided through what I needed to do and helped me better myself and the work I did with a healthy and positive work environment.
good,I began my employment with the company as a technician but was moved into management. The company was very good to work for until they made a change in upper management. To many poor decisions in product development and increasing company exposure in computer repair caused loss of profits and eventual reduction of company profits.This caused closure of all but one facility.
good,"The low marks are because the company is going out of business.  Nobody should be looking for employment there - they are in bankruptcy and laying everyone off."
good,"Es buena empresa te apoyan en todo, buen ambiente laboral"
good,"RadioShack may not be that popular now, but was great when I worked there 3 years ago. Everyone was hands on with helping getting task done but seem to fail short in the competition world."
good,"A typical day will be you come in, clock in, go over daily communications, then go about your daily tasks of facing the shelves, back-stocking, printing new tags and putting them up, putting up a new shipment and a few other things while helping all of the customers that come in. Every day I would learn something new about electronics and components within them. The culture of RadioShack is really open, welcoming, everyone I met was accepting of any type of diversity, tattoos were okay, hair colors were okay, a very relaxed culture. Management was always flexible and understanding. The hardest thing about the job was probably time management and balancing daily tasks and customer service perfectly, especially on busy days sometimes a daily task was left for the next day or held us past close. Otherwise on a whole its a very relaxed job, and you get to play with the toys and speakers in your downtime."
good,In the 15 years I have been with the company I learned so many new things that I will carry with me for years. I have had the ability to meet new and interesting people and become part of a family. RadioShack was more than just a job it is my life. I enjoyed being able to work with amazing team members and management to develop myself and my knowledge into who I am today. Being able to assist customers and provide them daily with knowledge I have learned was satisfying.
good,"Buen ambiente de trabajo , sueldo promedio no hay comisiones"
good,"This opportunity provided great compensation, great management team work, great training, great communication flow and great environment to work in. Liked the performance trackers showing the other stores in the district % to goals!! Our team had some very profitable results!!!"
good,"A typical day included, greeting customers when entering the store and assisting them with their shopping. While learning new ways to better assist each customer and learning about new products with the customer in a friendly laughable environment to keep customers feeling welcomed."
good,Not a big place and everyone knew every ones business. The manager hired her brother in law and was always giving him more hours. The hardest part of my job was fell phones because I had to teach myself how to activate contract phones.
good,"Great to work for, good benefits, the management was great to work with. pay with commission. great training programs, wish other employers had the same."
good,"I actually liked this job and there were some great processes at work here. Unfortunately not every store was ran the same way so, the company suffered because of it."
good,"Overall, nice company to work for, flexible hours and nice management. Job security is low, with any store able to get closed at any minute."
good,"Easiest job I've ever had, but way to much down time. There are times where I wont see a customer for a few hours or more....money isn't great but what do you expect from a job where you sit around waiting on customers all day"
good,"The job environment was very relaxed. The manager did want us to push certain items, like most sales environments."
good,"Great Job, Except the horribly rude Cell phone customers. Typical day consisted of opening and closing store and assisting customers with sales and returns."
good,Obviously there was some job security issues but I had a great time while my store was open! I was hired by an amazing manager who took a chance with me and it paid off!
good,The location that I worked at for a seasonal positions was great. Management had great attitude and co-workers welcomed new comers.Everyone was opened to any question.
good,"A typical day working at Radioshack is primarily helping customers, usually troubleshooting an issue they have with an item they already own. But you also get paid to take time to learn about new products as they come in. Down time consists of cleaning the store, making sure the shelves look good, putting away shipment, and answering phone calls."
good,"Perfect place to move up in management "
good,To much pressure put on employees to sale magazines and get credit card applications. People are hurting in America the job market is down and a lot of people are with out jobs. Being from Texas the oil fields have shut down so don't make people go more into debt.
good,"comense como entrenamiento,teniendo conocimiento de los productos que vendemos como tablet celulares accesorios de computo etc. despues pase como vendedor ya con conocimiento y tratado de darle siempre la mejor informcion del producto al cliente."
good,"Working for Radio Shack was a fine opportunity to learn about technology,cell phones, sales and people interaction. The job was not fun in my last three years as the company downgraded and went bankrupt."
good,great to get you out of your bubble. talk to random people and open yourself to great conversations. learned a lot about cell phones and how the contracts work. got my own approved contract due to this job
good,"overall it was a great learning point as we had to learn new technology on a daily basis, as well as all the little parts and pieces of the rest of the business."
good,"I enjoyed the opportunities for advancement in this company"
good,"Overall I enjoyed my time at Radioshack. Sales were enjoyable and the wages were more than substantial. Working with a team like that was very enjoyable and I have even made many friends. Management in the first store was beyond proficient and I learned a lot from him. Although the other store I worked at didn't necessarily have management, we as a team proceeded to work as a unit in keeping the productivity of the store flowing. It was unfortunate that I lost my job due to the company closing stores, however I am happy to have had such a great experience."
good,"Fun environment for a workplace. Store culture is the best. Yet there is a lot of work to be done on the corporate level. Bankruptcy and new owners have led to the downsizing of store personnel and making the store manager having to do a full timer, part timer, and manager duties all in one with minimal compensation."
good,"No rest in between orders that had to be pull, kept to myself really, did my job, management was good, had good team leaders, a lot of good co-workers, nothing was hard about that job, and I do not go to work to have fun, I go to work to work."
good,"My typical day at work would be assisting customers with all questions and radio shack purchases. I learned invaluable customer service skills that I can apply with everyday life situations. The management was in turmoil, leading to a lot of store closures and people getting laid off from their jobs. The hardest part of my job was dealing with angry customers with major attitudes over minor things. The most enjoyable part of my job was coming to a pretty laid back work environment and working with my employees. They made the day easier to deal with especially if we had an irate customer to deal with."
good,The management was horrible!  but the overall job was wonderful. I didn't get as much training as I would have liked and since I didn't it hindered my sales opportunities.
good,My first Radio shack location was fun but unfortunately it was shut down. I was transferred but it wasn't as good as the place I was at. Less hours had a co-worker that was weird kinda nice but just weird...I could tell he had a lot of pet peeves. Manager was a try hard. Other 3 people I worked with was cool laid back. In conclusion I had fun at radio shack. Even though my last couple of days was kinda lame.
good,"I really loved ringing up customers and giving change, and just being around such amazing people and giving quality service."
good,The reason why working at radioshack is fun is because you got paid to do almost whatever you wanted at work. The managers didn't care and weren't getting paid enough to care. As long as everything looked good and your basic duties got done you basically sit around and talk to people about electronics. Corporate is constantly going to be trying to tell you to sell more but theres only so much you can do with 4 customers per hour coming through the door. All in all great people made my experience great. Management doesn't care what you do as long as you don't blow the place up. Hours are poor but that is retail. Pay is pretty bad but that's retail. Company is bankrupt now and sold to sprint so I'm not sure what has changed
good,"I'm kind of a techie nut and using my 55 years background in electronics helped serve our customers needs, especially with regards to choosing electronic parts."
good,"Stocking the store, handling money and going to the bank, scheduling, associate reviews. Learning how to make sure the store ran ans ran in a productive manner. My fellow co-workers all worked together to make sure things ran the way they were suppose to, and in a professional manner. I always did my best to make sure every customer was happy upon leaving my store."
good,I must say i miss my co-workers they was very nice to me. I was the youngest working there and they help me a lot on whatever i didn't understand. They made my job so easy for me
good,"I liked working here because of the knowledge I gained on  the lastest technology, but the pay has to be better. the benefits were great and the percentage the paid on behalf of their employees."
good,"Typical work day would consist of working with the public, stocking merchandise, counting money, taking enventory. By working at radio shack i learned how to deal with different types of customers, i learned how to research information and finding product for customers.My Co-workers were very pleasent people to work with and we always worked as a team to get things accomplished. There really was not a hard part to this job. The most enjoyable part of this job would be dealing with the customers. Enjoyed making people smile."
good,"A typical work day at Radioshack consisted of getting to work 30 minutes before the store opened. Booting all computers, making sure the store is presentable before customers arrive. "
good,"Helped customers with their electronics, worked the floor with a crew of no more than 2 at a time, maintained a clean and functional work environment."
good,"Typical day is helping customers find products they need and leading them towards essential products. I have learned many new products while working for RadioShack, including how to build your own remote or robot. I work with like minded co-workers, we help each other out whenever we can."
good,"Because of the fact that this store was essentially a mom and pop shop, we had a bunch of local customers. The owner was very well known in the neighborhood, so he had frequent regulars that would come in almost daily. Our cell phone and computer knowledge would also bring a bit more clientele in. I loved this job because I felt like I had actually helped people."
good,i really loved the job i was doing and the people i was working for were really awesome the pay was kinda dismal though. also the company has really taken a turn for the worse.
good,"The seven years at university location was a delight."
good,"Focusing On Sales & Operation Management "
good,"A typical day at Radio shack will consist of greeting customers, asking if the need any help on finding a particular item and if so what features they are interested in.In the time that I've been working at Radio Shack I learned all about different technologies such as phones,tablets,headphones and computers. Most importantly i learned the different types of customer experiences you can have with just any customer and that in some way made me understand their needs and actually help them in a way i didn't know i was able to. In my opinion management has been very well organized and productive that has helped the company be functioning for such a long time and making customers happy with their purchase and their experience at shopping at Radio Shack. I've had a lot of different coworkers from all different backgrounds and that has been something I enjoyed dearly because it has led me to interact with all types of people and work together as a team which is something some jobs don't offer.Till this day i still keep in touch with some of my old coworkers just because we have built such a great bond from working together and all the experiences we had. The Hardest part of working at Radio Shack has been mostly just dealing with the bad side of a customer such as their demands and thinking that you're wrong and their right just about everything they are telling you in which is mostly not right because i do know about the product i am trying to sell you and i have been taught the right way of how to provide you with the services and features you are looking for. But in the same aspect"
good,"Although advancement is very limited in this company, the environment amongst coworkers was very comfortable and relaxed. I learned a lot of customer service skills here, including how to diffuse angry customers and build rapport."
good,"I worked in learning and development which was a great department to work in.  The work life balance was ok, nothing to really complain about.  The pay however is a little less than other companies in the area but due to budget constraints I can not fault them.  I worked at the corporate office so this review does not reflect what goes on in the actual stores."
good,"Answering peoples questions, setting up and activating cell phones. Working with computers and other devices. We didn't have a lot of employees"
good,"Greeting customers and finding out their product wants and needs."
good,"Radio Shack, albeit they are now going out of business, was a great place to work. My co-workers were wonderful, and so was my boss. Upper management were a little stiff, but that's their job I suppose. Pay was definitely decent and commission relatively easy to earn. I had a great time at RadioShack."
good,"I have work at this company for about 2 years. I am sorry that the company is closing, but it was a company where you got to learn a lot about electronics and customer service.  I will  be sad but will have wonderful memories about this company."
good,Great company overall. Managers that I worked for were very nice and pleasant. Never had a problem or issue with co-workers. Always made friends and had your regular customers come in and great you almost everyday.
good,managed inbound/outbound email on product and shipment status's within the DC. Interacted with DC management staff.
good,"Over all my experience was good plenty of opportunity to make money with commitment ect. Easy good work place. Cant say management is great but I have seen worse. I was mit and basically did more if not my managers job, but I will say my team was great!"
good,My tasks each day were different from the next. A variety of customers and situations to deal with every day made my job more enjoyable. I liked the fast paced and competitive sales environment.
good,The company started off great. I started as an assistant manager and within 6 months I was promoted to Store Manager in Hales Corner. I also filled in at other location through out the district that had no acting manager. .
good,"Working for RadioShack has been wonderful. However, I believe the company is taking a turn in a direction not optimized for my desires and needs."
good,"This company has a vast amount of knowledge for their employees. On a typical day, you cover customer support, sales, cell phone activation's, promotions, merchandising and store maintenance. This job will get you ready for growth in a company and can teach a dedicated employee a little bit of everything. RadioShack requires the ability to multi-task and keep a smiling face even in the most hectic of times. The most enjoyable part of the job was the happy faces on the customers when you've went above and beyond to provide full solutions whilst teaching them how to use the products they purchased."
good,"A LOT of Pressure from everyone high up to SELL SELL SELL. Its all about cell phone sales now, nothing more."
good,"A typical day at work includes offering the customer ""a complete solution.""  At radioshack we go beyond what the customer is in for and we offer them the accessories to get the most out of their product or device. Working at radioshack taught me how to trouble shoot basic everyday problems that comes with having mobile devices. The hardest part of my job was learning everything and what every device did but once i got past that it was very enjoyable."
good,"Decent work environment, fairly slow paced in a lot of stores so very relaxed. Too much focus on selling useless warranties and batteries, also too focused on cell phone sells, Radioshack is about all electronics and DIY products, not just cell phones."
good,I loved these jobs and i would have stayed longer if it wasn't so far away from the city. It was hard for me to take the drive all the way to Primm.
good,"Great job, but must love electronics. Great hours and environment. Must have thick skin with some customers."
good,I learned a lot at this job about both hardware and software. I guess you can say that it was the best part of the job. Managers where cool and the co workers the same. Costumers made it difficult. Especially that thought they knew everything. But overall cool job. Just wished they paid a little more.
good,great experience overall. manager was great. learned a lot about technology.
good,"I would come in open the shutters,cut on the lights and computers, and then start our day up. Typically some days are faster than others we would have to meet these goals everyday. 5 replacement plans and at least one post paid phone. The hardest part about that was that customers did not want the warranty neither was there pockets deep enough for an 800 dollar phone. But the most enjoyable part was making the numbers through working extra hard."
good,"Assist customers with questions about there electronics"
good,"Work days consist mainly of assisting customers locate the products they need, explaining how things work, answering questions about in store products, and phones, phones, phones. Most of my job is helping people activate, reactivate, swap handsets, and decide on which phone and service to purchase. My co-workers and I work well together. Some are more productive than others, but that is to be expected. The hardest part of the job is that sometimes I will be trying to help too many people at the same time. I am a good multitasker, but I tend to overwhelm myself from time to time. Helping others is my favorite part of the job.  I love my job, but I wish it paid more and was full time."
good,"Great place to work, but really hard work and with less and less payroll to support it."
good,"Radio Shack is a great company. still catering to the parts guy all the way to the tech geek, Wireless phones, tablets, & laptops are quickly taking over. Customer centered focus. Great training, evenif you know nothing about the industry. Pay structure is lacking in the management field. full benifits including medical,dental,vision,life,AD&D,401k"
good,Every day presents new opportunities to learn and grow.  Challenges abound.  Strong and visionary management team.  Employees are loyal and long-tenured.
good,"Radio Shack was always an adventure. You never knew what you would be faced with, because you dealt with different people and different attitudes on a daily basis. But, overall, I enjoyed this job because I love meeting and serving people, trying to make their day less stressful. I learned here that no matter how horrible another person say their day is, no matter how bad a person attitude is, always smile and speak nice things to them, because you never know who life you might touch. Management was good. I loved my co-workers. We always encouraged one another and try our best to make sure what ever the day may bring, we wasn't going to allow it to effect us. Their wasn't anything hard about this job. The most enjoyable part about this job, one again, is serving the people. I always wanted to make sure my customer was happy at all times."
good,Great Company.  Needs Work...   Many aspects of this industry are changing with online competition and big box advantages.  People within Radio Shack need to get back to the community level that made them the icon of American Culture they are.  Focusing on community and people should be their top priority.
good,"Inform and educate customers on different technology advances in phones or broadband devices"
good,"Serving customers from the time you open, till you close. Customers are very fun and friendly to serve. The store manager I had was a hard working guy who liked to get things done the right way which was great. Co-workers including assistant manager were very lazy and didn't really want you complete their task. Hardest part of the job was keeping an eye on everyone while the store was busy. I enjoyed working there with my co-workers and helping out the customers."
good,"First part of the day is operations then I head to the floor around 12 to wait on customers and perform daily tasks that need done, such as fronting, spacing, pricing and cleaning."
good,"I learned how too lead and train associates, drive sales, interact with customers. I had the chance to build my staff, so my co-workers and I had the same mind set, which made easier and created a relaxed work environment. The toughest part of the job the constant changing of the store's floor set. The best parts of the job or working with people who have your same mind set and the smile on the face of satisfied customer."
good,"Had a great time and years working at RadioShack, really challenging for me which made it more enjoyable."
good,"My manager was excellent. He was cery fair and intelligent and was more than happy to teach us. My co- workers were all highly capable. A typical day at work intailed me doing displays, answering phones, handling customers. The hardest part was phone sales that didnt run smoothly. The most enjoyable part was when I did a large sale with several attachments not only did the customer leave happily but  my manager also went home happy."
good,met sales goals and well people oriented. had to make sure my customers left with a smile on their face.
good,Worked in warehouse pulling orders and packed trucks to be shipped to local retailers
good,Extremely busy work environment. Learned how to communicate with numerous ethnic groups while providing impeccable customer service while earning a rewarding commission on wireless sales. Management was great as they prepared all employees for every individual work shift. Employees interacted well with each other. The most difficult part of the job was going home because the work environment was exciting and rewarding. the most enjoyable part of the job was interacted with so many different customers on a daily basis.
good,"They are a good company to work for but they don't really give the training that one needs for electronics, they are too pushy about wireless sales that they have lost focus of what their company even began as. I am pretty sure if you ask most employees where the company got their start. They don't even know the answers. Radio Shack employees push wireless sales so much that I have seen people walk out of the store refusing to come back because they didn't come their to get a new iPhone shoved down their throats."
good,I just love help people out in things to bring them closer to the future. I enjoy makin people happy.
good,working at radio shack was a great experience. I have build a lot of relationships working there.
good,"I had fun working for RadioShack. Not only was it fun but there were a lot of things to  know as technology progressed. I learned how to interact with customers even when my or their day wasn't going so well. I learned about different technology, how to work as a team and "
good,"Great place to work, but commission came out to be just above minimum wage on a typical week."
good,"Typical day at work is you clock in and see what was on the agenda whether it was receiving an order or putting away an order. You would then do planograms to make sure everything was up to date all the while waiting on customers."
good,"A typical work day for me would be making sure I let the other associates know about our companys  ""game plan"" and making sure all of our shipments are packed and received correctly, & catering to our customers. I learned so much from  working with for Radio Shack, far as ""mobile sales"" and I got use to doing weekly trainings wich were pretty fun and knowledgeable. I was the Assistant Store Manger for Radio Shack. My co-workers and I got along pretty well and I was able to lead by an example for them with my skills and expertise. To me no job is really hard as long as you have the right training and team members to help. The thing I enjoyed most from working with radio shack was being able to be hands on with our customers."
good,"Radioshack was a very fast paced business, At Radioshack you had a large amount of goals to reach each month in many different categories, This created a good work atmosphere where the employees wanted to succeed and reap the reward. A normal day of work consisted of helping many customers solve there needs, answer questions and teach them more then they knew coming into the store. I learned how to really engage with customers. This was my first sales position and it taught me everything i know about business customer relationships. The management was always there willing to help in anyway possible. The hardest part of the job was selling more to the customer then they had originally had in mind. For me the most enjoyable part was the experience of sales. It really showed me that with a little work you can really shine in a giant industry."
good,"Working for Radioshack truly helped to enhance my experience in sales and customer service. I would start the day by making sure our sales floor was in order (sales tag, cleanliness, processing orders), following up with my clients and checking our daily goals. The job had a lot of standards that had to be met for sales, metrics were a huge part of it meeting over 15+ metrics for the month. Our main goal was definitely wireless sales and I practiced my transitioning to wireless during every sales. My coworkers and I also knew the value of teamwork even though it is designed to be a competitive field we respected each other well enough to assist in sales and helping to get our customer setup and comfortable with their products."
good,"Radioshack work was from 9am to 9am usually.  Due to lack of hiring other personnel to fill the other hours.  We trained intensively on Company SOPs, procedures, and techniques.  Co-workers were respectful and diligent about their duties. The hardest part was working 11 hours straight, no breaks, standing on your feet. last manager was a super micro-manager.  The most enjoyable part was helping customers get what they came for, making sure they also were informed what else they needed to get the best experience from their purchase.  The healthcare benefits, the vacation benefits and the fellowship of the company overall."
good,"great job to train for a future in sales, mainly if you plan to sale wireless or electronics."
good,Most enjoyable part of the job is meeting new people and helping them with their problems. I learned more about sales and technology.
good,"A typical day for me was all day on the sales floor approaching customers with my sales pitch to get them to upgrade or start a new line with verizon, sprint, and/or at&t. I used many different computer programs and services to accomplish this. I learned confidence, how to talk to customers and solve problems. I also learned the importance of appearance and many sales techniques. My manager was wonderful, always showing me new things and encouraging me. Pushing me to do my best and helping me whenever I was unaware of something. I didn't really have other co-workers- our location was just my manager and I. The hardest part of the job was rejection, or zero days. Best part of the job was certainly being able to control my wages. the more I sold the more I made. And also the people I got to meet and help out on a daily basis."
good,"Customer service is key in retail jobs and so is hard work. Restocking sales floor to performing several sales transactions, Radioshack allows you to gain the experience needed to branch out and further one's career."
good,Was a great place to work while home from college with a fun manager
good,"Helping people find what they need and want to make their days and lives a little easier. People skills and problem solving while making money was always a plus. Many of my co-workers were attentive and knowledgeable. Best part?, getting paid to help people, and a chance to stay on top of the growing technology market."
good,I love my job and all of my co workers. we act as if we were a family and also my customers were very loyal
good,"Radio Shack is a household name in consumer electronics. Though, we all know retail sales outlets like these are struggling against the mega companies, like Walmart, as well as the internet. A company in this situation really needs to streamline their processes to be as efficient as possible. America is in an age of services, and people require consistency. "
good,"A typical day at work would be I would open the store every morning, and greet each customer that came in, asking if they need help finding anything or if they had any questions. I learned a lot of things from radioshack, I learned how to be a manager, it is challenging but can be done. I learned new things almost everyday with this job, and I loved being an assistant manager, I got along with my coworkers for the most part, there were a few people that we did not agree on some levels, the hardest part of this job was being put into a store manager position and nobody showing me how to do it, I had to learn it all on my way, and also leaving the company was kind of hard as well, the most enjoyable part was making the customers happy and just going to work everyday."
good,Nice commission if enough wireless phones are sold. Commission varies depending on type of sell.
good,The company is a good place to work and it is exciting to learn about all the new things that come in and out. There is barely any room for growth in the company though. You are assigned daily tasks that have to be completed and working as an assistant manger i had to delegate tasks to the employees. Daily paperwork and store operations. 
good,"A typical day at work consisted of dealing with opening the store. merchandising, pricing, organizing, selling to customers, training, reporting and meetings with district or regional managers, and helping other store managers on occasion."
good,"It was a fun place to work, the coworkers I had were a fun group but I did feel like the compensation lacked a little bit. I was selling about 30-40 phones a month which was also the most being sold in the district. Plus we were the only store regularly hitting there unrealistic sales goals and we were not receiving our bonus pay (one time it was   over 1 penny)."
good,"Help customers find what they need, show and explain how the product works and demenstaright. "
good,"A good place to work if you have an interest/knowledge of electronics and are good with people. New things are always being introduces to you, and the training program is very all encompassing, so if you apply yourself you will be well prepared, I enjoyed the educational value, and most of the people I worked with"
good,"The job mainly consists of customer service and customer problem resolution. There is a strong sense of security however there is little room for advancement. Best part of the job is the ability to use and demonstrate all the latest in technology for customers. I can honestly say that I really like my job, I just wish there was more room for advancement and better compensation."
good,Great company for part time or first job as for a career not very good
good,"Good for people who are just breaking into the merchandising world, but not where you would like to stay."
good,this company is hungry for sale phone sales and you daily goals must have been made or conference calls from the night into the morning. my staff bust there tail to insure we made goals sometime we fell short sometime we crushed them. the hardest part of the job was selling phones specially because we were in the middle of a AT&T store and sprint so customer rather go to them then us. Its a tough job
good,This job is great if you have flexible hours. Radio Shack provides a fun and comfortable environment to work in. Training can be tedious but ita about the hardest part of the job.
good,"Did commercial photography, and design work. i enjoyed the pressure and creative challenge."
good,If you like to sell you would do well here. Making minimum wage is a pain but you can easily pad it with the commission they make. The managers are usually pretty good although there are so bad ones out there. Radio Shack has an ever aging customer base and does not do a good job to try to reach a younger customer base. This company will probably not be around in another ten years.
good,The job was great and the people were even better. They cut my pay so I was forced to find different employment.
good,"On a typical work day I would clean the store, check stock, sell products, sell sprint phones, order things when needed, two days out of the week process orders, and Open/Close the store."
good,Count out your draw before the start of every shift.Most days its slow unless its during the holidays. Make sure all new products are out on the floor to be sold. Assist customers with product knowledge and extra information that they may not know of that product. Jobis fun yo get the satisfaction of meeting new people and even though your the sales associate you also learn nea things on the job.
good,"Hourly wages+ sales = great pay! Trust me, its not very hard to sell a cellphone."
good,"Working for RadioShack for over 5 years provided me enough retail experience to look beyond its borders. Aside from the annual shifting performance quotas and selling behaviors, the electronics industry doesn't really compare to the one-on-one experience that I've gained from working here. In my experience, the ""customer is always right"" is no longer made to appease an ignorant customer but a platform to raise their understanding of a product or service. Though I have seen other associates take advantage, that is strictly upon them and it shows from their sales, customer returns, and complaints about how necessary their product/service is needed."
good,"A typical work day consisted of me helping customers with all of their needs. Selling phones, and other merchandise related."
good,"To much cut throat,you are on commission,you learn alot. I learned alot about audio and visual."
good,"Got to user, build, repair, and display computers. Also had the opportunity to teach others, great fun."
good,I fit in at radioshack because I was able to utilize my social and people skills along with my sales ability and love of electronics.
good,The ability to be placed is a store within the district was frusterating. I travelled a lot while waiting for my own store.
good,Fun place to work while your still in high school. Great work around schedules!
good,I was a friendly environment where I grow as a person and as a professional. The company is a serious company were they train their employees how to do the job and give them enough information about each product in the store.
good,• Coached employees to help them excel in a business that is commission based
good,"Always a busy day at work, never a dull moment,full with fun activities and meeting different customers"
good,"Clock in, check the rotation schedule for which posts (Secuity) will be assigned to and at what hours to rotate to next scheduled post."
good,"I enjoyed solving problems, and I was good at what I did everyday. I liked inventory days because it meant we were getting new products. The hardest part of the job was meeting the quota. I don't like being pushy, but if I believe in a product, I will encourage others to check it out."
good,I loved my job-the interaction with people and other team members and the job duties. Unfortunately my store manager wasn't adept at people skills and was often surly and rude to customers. He managed the store as far as the numbers and inventory but he couldn't manage his employees ...
good,A typical day at work is very active. We learn a lot from our customers and managers. The only hardest part of the job is when sales are low. The most enjoyable part of the job is when we reach our sales goal for the day because that means we are making more money. This is a great company that provides numerous opportunites to their employees ( hourly rate plus commision).
good,Radio Shack has help me into retail market. As well into the job market.
good,Co-workers are easy to get along with. Great environment to work in
good,Had a great time at Radio Shack. I met a lot of people while working there and it really help to get a bigger customer base for my massage therapy business i was doing.
good,"I would have loved to stayed on here, unfortunately I got very little training and when I 1st started was still juggle school as well. I did not get I very good work life balance I was excepted to be available at all hours. I feel that if I had better training I would still be at this company."
good,"Company where employees are equipped with proper traning helping them to develop their electronic, household, audio/video, telecomunication, security and more skills by helping consumers from various industries. Company provides service and solutions to all consumers personal and Business electronic needs. One of the largest electronic Retailor in the Nation and a Fortune 500 Company, where they value all Employees, Customers, Vendors and Investors."
good,"I really enjoyed working at Radio Shack, it was just it went out of business. I was required to assist all customers with products. Products ranging from soldiering equipment, fuses and technology."
good,"Working for Radio Shack company at the time was great for myself. The management in my area was great to get along with, and the work environment was enjoyable."
good,"Capacitaciones muy lejos, promociones o ascensos suelen tardar mucho. No tienes mucho tiempo libre"
good,"Great company with a lot of history, unfortunately poor decision making led to it's downfall, I would love a chance to go back and proudly work for RadioShack to keep the tradition going."
good,"Radio Shack was a fun place to work.  The customers made working there, awesome!!  After 1 month of training, I got my own store.....so you can move up the ladder pretty quickly!!"
good,I like how they treat you as a person and not as number in the company and offers to better the store with great service within yourself and your coworkers as well.
good,"great first job, went from sales associate to assistant manager. training is mostly done on the job. you will be asked to push certain items on customers. good learning experience."
good,I learned how to deal with customers in a different way. I learned how to better listen and problem solves in a way that I did not know. The culture was great because it was diverse. The hardest thing about my job was working under poor conditions. The most enjoyable part of my job was two-fold: 1) seeing customers who were previously upset for bad services they received happy after leaving my store. 2) Helping to transform the lives of my employees through better leadership.
good,"Working at Radioshack was better than your typical retail job. You were expected to have an in depth knowledge of the products and technology in general. This has been the philosophy of the company for decades. To the point that customers would expect more from us but also treated us better than your average retail worker since our opinion was held in higher regard."
good,"Radio shack helped me develop the sales tools and techniques that I use and also tought me more about every day technology that we use. Our days would consist of working out any new product we recived and making sure our store looked clean and presentable. Since stores were relatively small, work teams seemed to work better with each other and get along better which made the job more enjoyable and much easier around holiday time."
good,"My experience with Radio Shack was short but within that time frame I was taught a lot in regards to customer service and working within a store. I was given the opportunity to work with a very good manager sometimes on a one on one basis whom I learned a great deal from. I enjoyed learning a great deal about parts, technology and running a business."
good,"It was alot of hours of work do to lack of staff, but that time was alot of fun do to the people who did work there. Most of the managers where amazing people that took a personal interest in their employees at and outside of work. I also enjoyed the work I did when I was with them."
good,It is a fast-paced environment where all sales associates must try to sell as much as possible to make their quotas. The manager always helped each and everyone under her management in order to strive for better goals.
good,"Fun day at work very enjoyable "
good,working with all the staff was each and fun most the time even though it was a competitive work environment i was sad to see them close their doors as i use to shop regularly  there prior to working there i gained so much experience and knowledge for my position with them that i will forever be grateful. i advanced quickly in the company and the   had support threw it all
good,Not a place to work pay is minimum wage is unbelievable i cant belive its like that it  should not be possible management customers ill no be with themes
good,"Working with radio shack was an unforgettable experience. Hands on training on how to talk to the costumers, and help them solve problems every step of the way. Not only was I entrusted to open and close the the store but was also entrusted with delivering the money to the bank.being a part of the radio shack team is an incredible experience."
good,"There was extensive sales requirements, and we had inventory management. I also helped with store opening and closing.  Customer relations were your keys to succes"
good,"I started out with them building Radio Stores, then they got into the big box stores which was my specialty. After about 4-6 yeas they found out that bigger retail stores were not as productive as their smaller ones, so started downsizing."
good,"the company switched to a more phone oriented business rather than an electronic business that i wanted to be apart of, I was the only person in the store who actually understood circuitry."
good,RadioShack provided a great opportunity for me while still in school. Management was intentional about training and providing opportunities for those interested in leadership roles. I highly recommend RadioShack for entry-level prospects wanting to progress in their early careers.
good,When I was working at Radio Shack everything was very fast moving. There was always something to work on or get ready for. When I was working at Radio Shack they were very focused on the phone sales. There were many incentives to sell and a 2% commission on every dollar made.
good,RadioShack will allow you to latter be taught and achieve sales goals you are so be affiliated with new technology and products. Wish they were still around
good,"Comfortable place to work, just not many hours, if you are willing to work hard, you will catch on very fast on the training, always room for improvement."
good,Opening and closing store. Schedule varied and have to work nights and weekends when necessary. Complete bank deposits at end of night. Complete inventory checks and provide great customer care.
good,"Had to sell different cell phone plans, and many other items sold in the store. Had to sell batteries, insurance plans, also learned how to communicate with different kinds of patrons. The workplace culture was fun because I enjoyed the people I worked with. The hardest part of the job was selling four major cell phone companies a month. The most enjoyable part of the job was holiday sales and the people coming into the store."
good,This was a great company when I first started out in retail although the company is pretty laid back the pay is not so inviting; but overall is a great place to work.
good,"Slow paced, entry level sales associate position with little room for advancement. easy work environment in a small, standard workplace setting. Great place to get experience."
good,This was a nice job with great potential to earn alot of money and make many lifetime customers. The discounts were decent. Many training sessions to learn all the products and promotions were welcomed.
good,"Flexible scheduling based on store and employee requirements. Typically friendly and laid back environment, dependent upon store and customers. Overall pleasant."
good,"Everyday was relaxed and never stressful, I learned much about customer service and how to work with people. The management made everyone feel comfortable and they were trust worthy.  The most difficult part of the job was learning the technology background of some of the merchandise sold. The job is slow placed and easy to work at and I highly recommend working there."
good,Working at RadioShack I learned a lot about technology and about Mobile carriers I didnt know exsisted. I enjoyed being apart of a small circle of coworkers. We were like family.
good,"Very sad to see what has become of this.    When the phones were going good, it was incredible, but then phones became ""everything"" and we ignore ""core"" customers who likes what Radio Shack was known for - parts, electronics and expert service."
good,Very basic sales job. Hours were fair. Coworkers were friendly. Money was low unless able to sell an unreasonable amount of goods in a short period of time.
good,"i had alot off fun and learned alot from working at this company, pay was great. I started off as a sales associate then quickly rose up to management in less then a year."
good,"learned so much on how to build relationship with customer, and thrive in a commission base environment . was a great experience on growing as a leader and as a manger ."
good,"Worked up to store manager. Had several great district managers, until the last one. Had trouble relating and picking up on  nuances. Overall a good place to work"
good,Friendly customer oriented sales environment great for Cellphone Technologies and Electronics ..  Fun Fast paced environment direct interaction with customer.
good,"The only downside to this job is the pay( lower than most other retail establishments and the knowledge you need is greater), the fact that its still retail, and decisions from higher management make you think they're incompetent. Most of your days you spend answering basic tech questions for customers."
good,During my employment at radioshack I enjoyed working there. I was able to gain much experience in different products and well as gaining customer service experience and management experience. I liked working for commission as it would drive me to sell.
good,"I had the best manager I ever have had.  I did think that I was going to work everyday, but just going to see a good friend.  We often got together outside of work as well."
good,I got the job about a month before all the stores started closing before that time we were slow and boring. By the time we were closing the place was busy and packed with a lot of questions. I felt like I was my own manager because there were only the two of us and I was doing Manager required jobs.
good,Job requires working with many different situations and helping many different kinds of people.  This job also includes shipping and receiving as well as stocking and customer service skills
good,"Well my friend was my boss at first he was fair when it went under new management the job turned for the worse the job was easy and I did okay with it but they did push too much on selling warranties too much. "
good,found it boring not a lot of customers even before they shut down the vast majority of stores to try and save the corporate workers bank account .........
good,Radio Shack had a great work environment and competitive commission based compensation. I can't speak for their current state of business as the company is in the process of being closed for business.
good,"In the beginning when RadioShack was a thriving company, there were many opportunities and great security. But as the company suffered financial losses, new management did not course correct. In fact I would say they tried to hard to reinvent the company without focusing on what really needed to be done to succeed financially."
good,"Flexible schedule with an amazing supervisor.  Fair place to work for.  Good, hardworking employees.  Managing all East coast leases and learn something new each day."
good,Working at radioshack is a fun experience especially if you enjoy helping people but the corporate management is very flip-floppy and has no communication with each other causing things to get very confusing with associates
good,"I have loved my 3 years with the company its a fair one to work for. I have always enjoyed my job its one of the few where i can honestly say i have enjoyed each day, and have enjoted getting up knowing it's what I'm about to spend my day working."
good,"selling cell phones, meeting quotas, most enjoyable moment is competing with my coworkers, Learned how to be a well rounded sales man and learning about the 4 major phone company."
good,"From the CEO to everyone who works in the corporate office, they are all amazing people and treat you with the up most respect. Pay is good but has opportunity to pay a little more to keep great talent on the team and minimize the turn over.  I regret ever leaving!"
good,"long gone. Was the place to get answers, service by professionals, parts, in stock or ordered. Some of the best toys for kids, FAST cars, electronics, tvs, and computers. Too bad there is absolutely nothing left of that company now."
good,It was your average minimum wage job. I liked the managers and the way everything was handled. Scheduling was always correct and if not it was always addressed immediately.
good,"I disagree with some of the policies and marketing techniques. THey tend to try and compete with Big Boxes like Target and Best Buy. But when people come into RadioShack they kinda expect a more techy aspect of electronics, not so much consumer stuff. (I'd much more readily purchase an external hard drive or network cable from RadioShack than I would a flat screen TV) Interactions with customers were pretty satisfying as again, most were tech buffs."
good,Very slow but you got to use your brain and meet some very interesting people. Upper management was very out of tune with the current economy and what they wanted from an electronics store.
good,"While it wasn't the busiest store in the world, Radioshack is what helped me learn to do better with people skills, and that's some of the best experience a person can have."
good,"Growing up, I would walk our local mall and marvel at the electronics, and well dressed employees.  My manager was amazing.  He gave me ample time to train, and even encouraged me to go further than just the required 13 core training programs.  I went on and trained in all of the material.  I walked away confident in my knowledge of the product.  This helped when there cuts.  I had a higher sales rate than the others, and they kept me instead of the person that had a longer seniority.  I eventually went into the management program and ""graduated"" with the highest grade in my district.  Pretty much all of my co-workers we eager to teach me things.  We believed in play and have as much fun as you want, as long as the work got done.  The hardest part of the job was actually getting ready for inventory, witch we did once a quarter.  The most enjoyable part was inventory.  I love inventory."
good,"Great place to learn about all kinds of electronic. Customers were very helpful and understanding. Employer was a great guy to work for, never had a problem if you needed help."
good,I've had my ups and downs with this job but in ways I did loved it but the pay and the hours and the whole bankruptcy situation went downhill for me I'm glad it still around but its not the same company I use to work for since its owned by sprint but during my time it was straight forward sales got introduce to new things in phone and tech which is my hobby plus dealing with customer service and learning new stuff and understand how to help in difficult situations  management  was cool  but I couldn't advance due to other reasons but other than that was great
good,"enjoyed coming in every day and helping customers find what they were looking for. Stocking merchandise every Monday, cleaning the store everynight before we left."
good,"Operate cash register once a sale has been made, manage inventory, order stock and even stock shelves. Price products and update shelves when a new product comes in or if the price of any item changes."
good,"Buen ambiente de trabajo, aprendi a manejar otro tipos de programas, otras formas de utiliza una caja para cobrarm inventarios. Compañeros buenos apoyan en equipo, lo dificil pues no encontre ninguna dificultad, lo que mas me gusto es la forma de trabajar en equipo."
good,"I really enjoyed RadioShack. I enjoyed the people, my location, and even the customers. All the workers got a long. Hours was provided for everyone. The managers treated everyone fairly."
good,"Working at RadioShack can be boring at times, many customers come in looking for product that we just don't carry or we have been out of stock on for a long time, management at store level is great they make the work environment a bit more fun, while corporate doesn't interact with their employees."
good,"Was hired at 19. Management was great all the way through. Had a perfect balance between work and personal life. Pay was decent, started at 2% commission then dropped to 1% commission. Overall easy job. Unfortunately, the company hd financial issues and closed 95% of the locations in Cleveland."
good,"Typical day was started with fronting store putting out sales tags for at-time current promotions. Coworkers were fun to be with made the days better, hardest part of the job was trying to close on time. most enjoyable part was being able to be successful and top 2 in the store"
good,its a fun job. you meet a lot of different people. Pretty relaxing. you make commission too. Nothing too too hard. all you need is a high school diploma
good,I enjoyed the new experience with electronics and meeting new people. My supervisor was a really great guy and helped me to learn a lot f new things.
good,Ambiente con mucha dinámica y me gusto trabajar en equipo y llegar a la meta trazada de dicha empresa
good,"Sales-driven employees and revenue-centered."
good,I enjoyed working at the Radio Shack District Office. This is where I was introduced to the retail world. It was very interesting and fun. I met a lot of great people and learned that the customer was always right.
good,Need to be self motivated and able to balance customer interactions with day to day operations.  Ability to meet sales goals to increase your income.
good,"Phones, phones, phones. I truly enjoyed my time here. I learned more in my time with this employer than any other I have had."
good,"It was the best place to learn about electronics, to interact with customers and become a good salesperson. Great working atmosphere."
good,"Since RadioShack filed for bankruptcy in Feb 2015, job security was nonexistent. I enjoyed my job and the people that I worked with, just wished that I could have made it a career."
good,"For the most part the work was excellant, not to hard, not to easy."
good,"Easy days, with little to no red-tape politics.  Easy management with support and learning assistance from management and fellow associates. Hardest part was stocking parts drawers while easiest was stocking everything else."
good,"Working at Radioshack, taught many skills in which I can apply in any position. One of the most important for me is to be self motivated since I was second in command in the store."
good,"I, or another key holder would open the store every morning. Each day we'd make sure all pricing was correct, the store was immaculately clean, all merchandise fronted and stocked, and that excellent customer service was provided. I learned a lot about electronics I never knew. My manager was a really nice guy and a pleasure to work with. When I had a terrible car accident, he worked with me to keep my position open for my return. My coworkers were all fun to work with and also taught me more about technology than I'd known before. The hardest part of my job was having to meet sales quotas daily, weekly, and monthly. The most enjoyable part of my job was the people I got to meet. Sarasota has a lot more international visitors than Oklahoma. I met tourists from France, Sweden, & Germany. I met the entire Estonianian Youth Orchestra and discovered Sarasota had an Amish population."
good,"Radio Shack, before going out of business, was a great work environment with a fun sales team that challenged each other as well as helped each other out on difficult to close sales."
good,"During my time at Radio Shack I learned a broad range of things. I not only gained my first sales tactics, but everyday I was learning something new about rapid changing technology. The most fun I had at the job was being hands on with the latest and greatest technology in computers, cellular communication, and other new electronics."
good,It was temporary job position; I left because every branch started to shutdown because their currently filling for Bankruptcy.
good,"I like working at this location; since it's a small store I rarely become overwhelmed with responsibilities. My manager is really friendly, understanding and easy to talk to. He's flexible with my busy schedule and runs a tight ship. My co-workers are laid back and friendly as well, they make up for a relaxed but productive work environment."
good,"Typical work day includes helping customers with various situations from cell phone to trying to connecting someone's phone to a Bluetooth speaker or headset."
good,A typical day consists of helping customers with questions and providing complete solutions based on their specific needs.
good,"Make activities for kids"

good,"Radio Shack  was a great place to work."
good,"Provided an integrated platform for managing corporate strategic initiatives for multiple product lines and strategic plans driving the market development. Create schedules that incorporate all activities required to successfully launch product, including aspects covered by marketing, operations, advertising/promotion, distribution, training, packaging, licensing, legal, etc."
good,RadioShack is an excellent place of employment with an exciting culture and history.  I will always value the experience gained.
good,"World class corporate facility"
good,Radioshack has been a great place to work through out college for me. The hours are very flexible and the job is not very stressful. Management has always been reasonable but relatively distant from the rest of individual stores. Radioshack has been a great experience for me but I am looking for new opportunities and the pursuit of a new career.
good,"The company is falling on some hard times right now, and some serious reconfiguration. A lot of changes are starting with mid level management, and as such its a bit chaotic right now on the lower level side of said management, but still it's a company that has a great atmosphere and tries to have fun and keep a uplifting spirit. I would say its a great way to get your feet wet in management."
good,I enjoyed the laid back attitude of working for this job. I had great management and great goals that were met and exceeded. The hours vary which is a discouragement.
good,Radio Shack was a fun place to work. the management was knowledgeable and the staff was friendly and accommodating. It gave me a lot of experience working with the public. I would recommend this company to anyone who is looking for a job.
good,"I have dedicated the last 9 years of my life to RadioShack, it has been a great experience however I believe it is time to move on."
good,"The job was easy in the aspect that anyone with common sense could excel at this job, but it was a lot of manual work. I worked in the lumber and building materials dept. but wasn't limited to that dept., I would also work in paint and cover any other dept that need the coverage. My managers were nice and had a level headed mindset. Many coworkers were slackers, but the slackers never lasted long. The hard working coworkers were often moved up to management positions. Working there taught me a lot about home repairs, and improvement."
good,"District Sales Manager: RadioShack, St. Louis, Missouri"
good,Its an environment with many challenges but also opportunities to better my work experience overall.

good,Take care of the customers; run the cash register; close the store. I have learned a lot about customer service and activating new phones.
good,"great place to work but minimum wage for inventorying a store with x amount of products most of them being the size of dimes or smaller. I understand they aren't the biggest store, but they are a small store with many small products, i was paid more to do nothing but sell phones at wireless zone. Great place to work though great place to learn to sell items and to get some technology knowledge. i enjoyed it for the most part."
good,Worked here for a few months out of college. It was a decent gig to get the bills paid. Nothing I would advise for the long haul.
good,I was able to learn a lot about electronics and work under an amazing manager
good,good company to work for new challenges every day keeps me on my up date with technical skills
good,"My particular store was a failing location, and drastically affected my ability to keep my position. Their sales relied heavily on the quota system, and you were paid minimum wage unless you had multiple key category sales, in which you were paid commission (if you attached accessories or service plans). If you were fortunate to work in a high volume store, this was no problem, and you could receive large paychecks . However, if you worked in a small store, or were shy/introverted, not only did your paychecks suffer, but your job security dropped significantly. "
good,I would go in and do paperwork from day before and file all the paperwork do a high dollar count to make sure the count matched what the inventory said we had. Go up to the front of store and do a cash count to make sure it balanced out correctly and then I would go to the bank and get change if needed. Open the store for business at the proper time. Greet the customers as the walked into the store and check in orders that came in and put the order away or help the staff put it away. I would accept the order into my inventory and go on helping customers. I would be helping customers and answering phones when every it rang. Help with the training of all new associates. I enjoy working with people .the most enjoyable part of the job was getting a lot of people and getting to work with a great team of employees.
good,"Great company! Loved the culture, and the higher up management were great! Store manager not so great. Pay was tricky but pretty decent. They always make sure customer problems are taken care of."
good,Very good job if you're still in college. hours are very flexible and working could be fun if the team chemistry is there.
good,It was a good workplace for me but not enough for what i want for my life.
good,"i have learnt a lot about technology and other electronics, that experience i was uttermost grateful to have comprehended."
good,"As a Store Manager, a typical workday consisted of inventory reviews, effective communication with management, staff, and lateral network, (to include emails, log entries, phone digests/calls, etc.), goals review/establishment, and financials and scheduling -as needed, etc."

good,very fun opportunity to meet people being able to help customers
good,"The job never gets boring, and will need to understand lots of operating systems."
good,Very good place to be for sales and to make commission. Very good at promoting within.
good,"When I worked at my first retail job before Radio Shack, I really enjoyed the electronics area. I remember the one day I used my customer service techniques to convince a customer to purchase a $1000.00 DSLR camera versus getting a simple point and shoot camera. I am passionate about the technology and very knowledgeable and easy to talk to. However my paycheck didn't agree with the same success I had with my sales. So I decided to find a new job that had commission based income along with selling cutting-edge technology. This is what Radio Shack is about! So at the time when I was hired, it was very fitting for me and it's a fun place to work."
good,"As a RadioShack employee I was expected to take part in most store activities. My daily duties included opening and closing the store, making bank deposits, and reviewing the year-to-date numbers, and projections. I was also expected to review our store's profit & loss statements to determine ways that we could run more efficiently. This was my first job that felt like a real job. I was encouraged by my manager to be a better sales-person, and to become an assistant store manager. I had a good relationship with my co-workers, but was often working in the store alone, and needed to know as much as possible about our range of products, as well as being able to effectively manage customer flow; all while making time to stock shelves, implement pricing, and execute new plan-o-grams, which required re-organizing a section of product. Keeping all of those things in balance was a difficult, but rewarding experience. The best part of this job was the camaraderie with my fellow employees."
good,I do electronic and cellular phone sales. I also help with activations and customer service
good,I really enjoyed working here specially with the people. They were all very supportive. If I needed help with something i didn't have to ask because they were always there for me. The manager was really supportive if a customer was rude to us or made inappropriate comments he would always tell them to back off. He always cared about his employees.
good,The hardest part was trying to sell the extra warranty programs.
good,"very good place to work fun place. management is great, "

good,commission and hourly pay. You learn something every day. A great place to upgrade phones.
good,Whether days are slow or busy there is always something to do when the position  as assistant manager is taken.
good,"The hardest part about this job was learning all of the various components to electronics. Although you had a base salary, you could make more depending on your drive to sell."
good,"A typical day at Radio Shack would be pushing cell phone contract sales and insurance's. Maintaining store upkeep and helping customers with any inquiries and concerns."
good,"Always learning something new, the manager is constantly mentoring me to learn about the Radio Shack brand. The coworkers are great, but the pay/compensation are too low. I love working with customers and I have developed many relationships in a short period of time."
good,"I do customer sales and give technical advice to people"
good,I had a lot of fun working there. Had the unfortunate experience of having a terrible manager that did not teach us well. Ha to learn everything myself and was eventually fired for my lack of knowing a specific policy. Otherwise great experience. 
good,"Over all i would say Radio Shack wasa fun place to work. Not only was it fun but there were a lot of things to know as technology progressed. I learned how to interact with customers even when my or their day wasn't going so well. I learned about different technology,how to work as a team and responsibility. It was a joy seeing the babies, to the elderly,smile when they got what they came for."
good,working for Radio Shack was fun.  Got to help many customers find the technology they needed.  Learning about new technology was also fun.
good,"a typical day consist of sales. greeting customers, making sure you find what they initially came in for then going beyond their needs to guarantee a good experience. "
good,"Cleaning when customers weren't in the store, and greeting them when they walked in. Helping assist them in finding the products suited best for them. Taking care of banking, and other shift leader duties."
good,"Everyday working at Radio shack was challenging for phone sales, I learned a lot about sales working there. I worked with some very energetic and wonderful people we tried to make everyday a positive day. The hardest part of the job was not meeting our sales requirements for the day. The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting new people."
good,I had a lot of fun working at Target Mobile when it was run by radio shack in the first 2 years. You used to be paid a base plus commission. But when they got rid of the commission all the good managers left and the company fell into ruins. Now it will be run by a new company starting in the spring of 2013
good,"Start with clean up of the store. Review newest news. Co-workers are in the young 20s. Hardest part of the job is having multiple focuses (Wireless, Apple products, TVs, Laptops, Electrical Components). Most enjoyable is flexible schedule."
good,"A typical day at work consists of putting away shipment, selling/activating phones, cashiering, and customer service. Can be fast paced at times. You must be able to multitask or you will not survive. As previously stated, I work with great co-workers and an exceptional employer who expects much out of you. You cannot be afraid to work hard as well as come in for additional hours if requested. I enjoy the comradery with my co-workers the most as it resembles a tight knit family."
good,"At Radio Shack its pretty much about Customer Service: building a relationship with the customer and qualifying the customer by solving their problems and finding their needs. It also requires product knowledge of the products and accessories, services like service plans (extended warranties) on products, deliveries and the latest promotions. My Job as a Manager consisted of being a mentor and leading my team to success by leading by example. At RadioShack I ran my own store by my self, customer service, coached my team by directing sales, prepared schedules, sent and received shipments, watched my own budgets, inventory, profit and loss reports, accepted my own deliveries and changed my own prices and signs etc. The hardest part of the job is working 55 hours a week and Managing your personal time with your family.

Worked on monthly inventory counts, restocking merchandise and assisting customer in finding what product would help complete their projects.

good,"Radioshack mobile phone company has been around for almost 3 years now. As with any company starting out, it has made numerous changes to the way business operates as well as the employees' compensation plans. Room for growth is very minimal. Some managers have been there the full three years with no oppurtunity for advacement. I do enjoy the sales aspect of the job. Company strives on providing excellent customer service.

The most enjoyable part of my job would be customer service, once a customer is satisfied and happy with the store."
good,Stand at the stores lease line and try to bring in traffic to the store. I learned I do not like a sales position in a low traffic environment. management was absolutely wonderful to work for. Most of the co-workers did not have a team mentality. Approaching customers walking by the store and trying to talk wireless/ bring them into the store. Building the customer rapport/seeing repeat customers.
good,"Troubleshoot and repair consumer electronics products to component level using available resources such as schematic diagrams and measuring/test tools, analytical problem solving techniques and diagnostic strategies to complete repairs. Provid customer support service."
good,"A typical day at work would start in the morning with the early shift preparing the store. Throughout work, I learn better and more persuasive techniques to close a sale. My manager would strive for the team to exceed our daily goals and push us to sell more which would qualify for commission. The hardest part was getting more hours, on the other hand I frequently received more hours then others."
good,"A typical day at work would consist of: Making sure all sales tags were put out, making sure all previous cleaning duties from the night before were done, running cashier, putting away product, running customer credit checks for internet/cell phones, and having fun!"
good,"Typical work day consisted of helping patroons with finding the right cellular phone and cellular phone plan that works for them, electronic sells, maintaining stores apperance during down time."
good,The hardest part of the job is making sure the customer is always happy. The easiest part would be talking to the customers. An my co workers are really nice to work with.
good,Working at Radioshack was like having a family. Everyone was very close to one another. I never had scheduling conflicts because my manager always worked around my schedule.

good,"Siento que los empleados no están bien capacitados, y que mi capacitación no fué la mejor"
good,"I was immature when I started. There was a lot I wanted to be done. The opportunities were unlimited but my personal experiences of using the resources was limited by personal experiences . I learnt iin time to flex with more attributes to my field.  I knew they met with other people. As a kid, I did not talk about my parents in terms of work. So, I did not always get information with community contributions until later with studies in other majors. Art was my focus but I had less depth in the personalities around the inspirations to a daily task.I understand not everyone is interested in the same things as a daily answer. I felt guilty about other peers."
good,I learned to handle tough customer questions and find a solution. Management assisted with daily work and helped me become a better representative. I really enjoyed interacting with returning customers and helping them find what they were looking for at RadioShack. I did not encounter any challenging or tough circumstances while employed at RadioShack. RadioShack helped me become a better sales representative and pushed me to expand to other job opportunities.
good,Co-workers and customer base often had a variety of things to learn from to help future customers. The only down side to working was the low pay rate and minimal commission made.
good,"Radio Shack is an excellent place to work, with great benefits, a friendly & helpful environment, and a great way to help customers with what they came in for. Their mission statement, to demystify technology for the masses, is an excellent goal,which I took pride in practicing."
good,I worked for RadioShack many years before my location shut down. I was offered a manager position but I know the company was going under so I declined it. I wish RadioShack did better in this economy.
good,"I worked for this company almost 20 years ago when the cellphone companies were about to take over. Radio Shack used to sell Verizon and Sprint phones, I just had a blast making money while it lasted."
good,"Went into this job knowing nothing about electronics but was taught most things in a very patient manner. Good work environment, decent pay. Good managers."
good,"El aprendizaje en cuestiones de tecnologia, telefonía, electronica y todas la areas incluyentes son muy buenas."
good,I enjoyed interacting with all of the different cultures of people I met. It was nice to hear from customers how pleased they were with how I was running the store.
good,"Buen ambiente "
good,It was a nice place to work at the time. I wish that they were still in business however the company is no longer there. The management was ok and the people I worked with were great.
good,"We were a commissioned based company with a per hour pay as well, it felt like we could have a bad day and still have money in our pocket. Our company has meetings for thanksgiving and christmas to prepare us for the seasonal rush."

good,productive fun work environment filled with toys to display and test to customers to promote and drives sales very interactive and enjoyable while fulfilling job duties.
good,"I don't know if my experience was everyone's, but I loved my time at Radioshack. I loved the job, I loved the company, and I loved my discount. It wasn't perfect, but then, it was a retail job. It's by far the best retail job I've ever worked, though."
good,"My time was fun, but confusing. I worked at one of the stores that was on the list to be closed down. All of our part time employees quit. I had given two weeks notice so that I would be free to take final exams. On my last day the DM called me to tell me out Manager had called the night before and quit - he offered me a little more an hour and a big bonus to stay and close it down."
good,Job can be very rewarding especially when it came to helping customers and learning the products. Their is a lot of freedom. The best day is everyday at Radio Shack.
good,"Enjoyed my time with RadioShack, a fun job to have.  Management works very heavy hours especially at higher volume stores.  Too bad many of the stores have closed down."
good,"I enjoyed working here.  I was always a big ""Techie"", and this was really right up my alley. I also learned a great amount of my customer service skills here."
good,Got to use my skills and my performance was recognized and I was treated fairly. Bonuses and kind management. Training on the job and fun environment.
good,Productive and fun environment. Interacting with different culture and background. Learning about new products and new technologies. An enjoyable experiences.
good,"Fun and competitive environment if you are interested in sales. Can make as much as you want to make, relying on how much you can sale. As long as management reinforces quotas ad makes it fun, money is easy to make."
good,learned how to offer profesional and great customer service as well as how to interact with customers and open up as in being talkative and communicative
good,"the average day consists of selling products, and tending to customers needs. its a very relaxed place, slow paced at times but it can pick up at random intervals . management at my store in particular was alright. the most enjoyable part of the job was testing new products."
good,great place to work knowledgeable coworkers. involved district management. ample room for growth and promotion. competitive marketplace and great clientele
good,It was always interesting and in certain ways fullfiling.  It required and immense amount of customer service and interaction. There was never any shortage of something to do .
good,"Radioshack was always a place I wanted to work. Being interested in technology my whole life, I always wanted to work in a place full of cool gadgets. My time at the shack was short because the company fell apart after about two years but I really enjoyed my time working there. Great people and a competitive and fun environment."
good,Good workplace pay was acceptable great hours not fast pace gets boring sometimes the managers was very nice in treated you fair i would rate this as a good stater job.
good,Buena Comunicacion entre gerentes de zona con los Gerentes de tienda y muy trato al personal
good,"You are constantly meeting new people and getting the chance to help the new customers as well as your current clientele. Being a manager puts you on your feet alot, checking pricing, and communicating with your staff as well as customers. There is always room for growth within the company for hard working individuals who are willing to put forth an honest days work for an honest days pay. My favorite part of my job was training people and watching them gain and grow into their potential. The worst part of my job was to find that someone I hired and trusted was stealing from the company. having to introduce the repercussions of that situation is never a joyful moment. The fun part of the job is all the newest electronical gadgets, and toys that start coming in around Christmas. Flying drones, and driving the rc cars around the parking lot! The store is usually pretty laid back until Christmas season, then it is kind of a sink or swim situation! If you get hired as seasonal help learn as much as you can as quickly as you can. Roam the parts drawers, and learn the cables. It won't always be the big stuff the customers come for! Always offer batteries. Best of Luck!"
good,Learned about the new phones or new technology every week. It is a place where you are constantly learning something new. Constant meetings to learn new procedures and new launches.
good,Nobody really goes into these stores anymore so the environment was incredibly sluggish but that just more time to get paid to just chill. Commission was really good too
good,"Being that I began courses at DeVry in Electronics and Computer Information Systems, this was the perfect place to work.  I was able to learn and try out things with some of the products in the store.  Sad to see the company deteriorate because with surviving almost 100 years, there was still a need for such a store.  I don't think management held it down as they should have."
good,"Same as General Wireless Review.  Worked there for 25 years.  Good place to work.  Don't have any complaints. Culture was okay. There were rough days.  You would expect that working at one place for so long.  Again, I was just grateful that I was given a job."
good,"Must be able to multi task and transition from one department to another without hesitation."
good,when I started working for this company I knew it would be an awesome work place to grow with the company.   We grew together through out the years  I was working loved my co-workers
good,Although the stores have closed it was a great job and I enjoyed it for many years. I started as a Sales Associate and ended as a Senior Sales Manager and Regional Liaison.
good,Back before the large electronic stores of today Radio Shack was the place for all your electronic needs.  They had a great training and management team that provided me with the tools to be successful.
good,"very much liked the workplace setting and other that i worked with, always felt that you could talk to management to resolve issues immediately, fun fast paced with good friendly people"
good,"this company allow you to grow and have great manager that teach you great customer service skills , it help you motivate not just at work but in life too"
good,"Challenging and diverse environment, great sales and customer service experience.  Employees and staff are typically fun to be around.  Always something to do"
good,"It was a great place to work for many years.  However, with the changing economy and the increasing online sales in the electronics business the company took a downturn for the last 5 years."
good,"Good place to work at "
good,I had an awesome and upbeat team that I worked with. The store management was family orientated and made efforts to work with our schedules as long as requests were minimal. The store was a bit slow pace for my liking but was still overall a great work experience.
good,The greatest part about working for RadioShack was meeting all the different people during my time there. Both customers and employees are so diverse and being able to help everyone was always fulfilling.
good,"Buen ambiente de trabajo buenas prestaciones, la empresa casi no ve por el trabajador"
good,"atencion al cliente,facilidad de palabra"
good,Overall I loved my job and although they gave us a raise they did cut our hours. You learn new things and they always push you to sell products as you do get commission.
good,"the day is very productive "
good,"I gave this company ten years of my life.  No regrets.  I did put in long hours and many holidays away from family but I was not alone."
good,"I would get to the store 30 minutes before the store would open. Count down the Register, make sure to have change. Check my goal Key Performance Indicators (KPI) set goals for my staff, make they are aware of the deals and special offers , they can offer qualified customers. Address emails, and help every customer that walks into the store. I would always get a satisfaction knowing I helped someone out; it could be as small as an battery to as large as a new T.V. Some of the hardest part of the job is not having what the customer want, and not  able to give them what they came to my store for. The Best of the job, was hiring new Employees and help train them and watch them grown."
good,"Great place to work, to bad the company went out of business.  Radio Shack went under due to not meeting the demands of the customers.  They are now run by Sprint and I have no knowledge of how it is to work for them."
good,"mucha unidad en el equipo de trabajo, buenos gerentes siempre ayudando al equipo a ser mejores en el trabajo de diferentes maneras posibles para u mejor desempeño, capacitacion constante a traves de la gerencia para estar actualizados en tecnologia, excelentes estrategias de ventas para generar mayores ventas y obviamente mejores ingresos a cada uno del personar en tienda, trabajo en equipo..."
good,The job was great if it wasn't for the manager i had at the time i would still be with the company the manager and the district manager i had were complete jerks the manager tried to make a pass at me and the district manager just shrugged me off
good,My experience working for radio shack when i was younger was fun it was my 1st job at the time it was based on commission it was a little difficult for me my 1st week after that i caught up to speed.
good,"It's a job.  If you approach it as just a job, you'll do fine.  Don't get too attached to anyone because they most likely won't be there long."
good,The people I work with are great. They are helpful an informative about what is going on in the work place. The hardest part for me is talking with the customers. However in doing so I'm able to improve my communication skills.
good,"Providing guests cutting-edge solutions in a friendly, confident and knowledgeable manner, other responsibilities included but were not limited to product displays, team leadership and stocking merchandise."
good,"Production based job"
good,a typical day at work is cleaning and organizing the merchandise. Helping customers with their needs and questions. I only had one coworker that was extremely lazy and nothing was done about it.
good,"I enjoyed working at Radioshack especially being able to answer questions and help customers resolve technical issues. I would rank management as very good and supportive at the store level, fair at district level and poor above that primarily due to not soliciting or listening to feedback from front line sales associates."
good,Tons of training and skill advancement available but difficult to predict scheduling depending on management. Overall a good part time job.
good,"Very different environment "
good,"Company atmosphere and people were great"
good,Promoted within and everyone had equal opportunity for advancement. Radio Shack is a true equal opportunity employer.
good,"good environment to work in with interesting people to work with. Very productive for the most part. Some time there wasn't much motivation to move-up. But, there was always alot of information to be learned !"
good,"Great Manager, Great co workers, friendly work environment, Had the chance to learn about new product and how to sale and meet each customers needs. I was always excited to see what each day would bring with learning about the different type of technology."
good,The environment was great had me settling in very well. I was able to learn a number of new things about electronics and worked on my people skills. The learning curve on sales was not a bad experience and learned a lot. The store was rather small and made cleaning up or adding items back on their racks or shelves a breeze. My colleagues were helpful and dedicated. The company had a high standard when it came to quality customer service and we all were able to meet this.
good,"Daily duties such as making sure everything is done in the store, It's also to be sure every piece of merchandise is correctly labeled and tagged with correct price. Make sure that the counters are clear and that the systems are fully up , loaded and ready for use. Make sure that any problems any customer has is resolved the best of  my abilities. Every customer should leave the work place fully satisfied and have knowledge to any questions or concerns they have."
good,i learned to move from one place to another do more than one thing at atime work with others i learned to propertly pack and soard i learned to qc use a scaner and search up products in the computer
good,"The workplace was fun ad fast and I loved the people I worked with. Unfortunately due to business decisions that were so bad they don't make sense even on a basic fundamental level, the company filed for bankruptcy. During the bankruptcy process the company did not treat employees properly; Poor workplace conditions and impossible goals were pushed to motivate employees to quit so as to avoid paying unemployment."
good,"The upper management have more support at the store level since the new company came out of bankruptcy. "
good,Great place to work. Sold consumer based electronics and cellular and internet devices. It was an awesome experience because I love electronics.

Learned how to count safes, registers and do bank deposits. Some scheduling experience as an assistant manager training."
good,"Family and camaraderie"
good,"After Radio Shack went through their whole bankruptcy scandal it completely changed the mood inside the store and in the public eye. People around the area who normally go to us have just stopped, people really believe that we closed down and stop showing up, and with that the business slowed down. It gets so slow and boring that for 8 hours you're just greeting in window shoppers."
good,"Helping customers. Demos products. poor commission structure."
good,"I was exposed to the world of typical retail along with commission sales,  I enjoyed the experience and I also was a key holder and trainer,"
good,"a typical day at my job would be opening up shop and counting our register. I managed our store for 2 weeks while our manager was away, which turned out to be rather simple. My co-workers were really reliable and relatively fun productive people. The hardest part about my job was letting it go."
good,"Radio Shack started out as a wonderful company to work for. They paid a base of minimum wage, but the comission rates were more than enough to make up for that. As the company now sinks into their bankruptcy further, they are treating their employees very unfailry, and sadly my time with the company is coming to a close."
good,"learned how to add and upgrade line on carriers"
good,I enjoyed working there for the fact I could sell there regular products but also help sell cell phones and plans. I enjoyed the manager there very much but the money wasn't what I was looking for because I was starting a family.
good,it was a good job. Management was good and the store environment was good as well. Co- workers were also good to be around positive attitudes.
good,"o	Managerial duties such as Shipping/Receiving, ESS orders, conference calls to ensure team growth, associate evaluations and improvement reports"
good,"- open store, sells electronics, put away inventory, close store "
good,"The work was easy, I never worked TOO much (except for my first week, I clocked 55 hours because I wanted to get training out of the way) I made decent commission, worked with my friends, and had fun. Truth be told, I never sold a contract phone while working at RadioShack."
good,Overall good starting job if your looking for overall experience in the electronic world. Your learn to manage the whole business and know what you need to focus on to make profit.
good,I had some great managers while working here loved the fact that they would teach us about new technology it helped me advance myself in other careers
good,"I was basically a salesperson and store representative.  My typical day at work included helping customers, making sales, running the cash register, maintaining the stock and display areas and keeping the place clean. I usually could spend sometime working with what we sold so that I was competent in using it.  There was some turnover in management and that could make things difficult.  My co-workers were cooperative and hard working.  The hardest part of the job was doing a full inventory.  The best part was helping people decide what they needed."
good,"Team huddle, complete payroll, Coaching, delegations, Floor walk. All my agents wants to remain with me and the hardest part is to see an agent go. ( I feel like I have failed him or her). The most enjoyable part of my job is meeting all my team stats."
good,"•	While being one of the youngest working at RadioShack, I was a Sales Associate. This position required me to be able to meet and greet customers and have great customer service. I also had to be able to restock inventory and input information into the computer as well as be a cashier."
good,"I have worked at RadioShack Corporation for 31+ years.  Overall, it has been a very pleasant experience.  The last few years have been stressful.  I have learned at lot from this company and have moved up in position, since I started.  I have worked with some very wonderful people, which is what I will miss most of all."
good,"Working at Radioshack is very proactive, you come into a store that is ready for sales. staffing is steady, prepped, and good to go. Typical day entails working with familiar faces and having regular customers that you will remember and the other way around. The job is entertaining and I love educating the young about emerging new technologies."
good,"Business Planning"
good,"The Job is great.  Bad thing is that they have poor Higher ups.  They don't understand what customers wants.  A typical work day is always filled with customers coming in and asking question about electronics and products.  When I first started, all I knew was the basics (examples: how to connect speakers, installing cables wires.)  Now, I know how to set up customer cell phone services, troubleshoot cell phone issues, and explain small component parts.  My co-workers are pretty cool.  Some of my coworkers are harder workers while some are very lazy.  The hardest part of my job is explaining to customer why some products won't work or explaining why certain products are better than the other product.  The most enjoyable part of my job is knowing that I have helped the customer to the best of my skill and knowledge."
good,"Average days consisted of working 8-10 hours, ordering products for store, managing employees, organizing and cleaning the sales floor, restocking, customer service, cash-handling, processing bill payments for customers. "
good,"Most days are enjoyable, quiet, and quite busy.  I've learned a lot about the business behind the stores.  What it takes to get a store up and running and what it takes to keep it running. I've loved my Managers.  All have been very easy to work with.  Especially when my children were little and I needed to be out more than usual. I love all my co-workers.  There are only 8 in my group and we've all been together for 10+ years.  There really isn't a hard part to my job.  Stressful? Yes. But nothing I would consider out of the norm for a job with monthly deadlines.  The most enjoyable part of my job is the friendships made during my 14 years here.  I have loved what I do and who I work with."
good,"The best part of working for RadioShack is the people. The staff and the customers are what makes this job great and interesting on a day to day basis. Each day you come in not knowing  get to help solve a customer's situation and offer them the complete solution. Many times you may not know the answer right away but helping the customer and finding the answer and going above and beyond for the customer. Not only does that build a special customer base personally, but also you learn something in the process. I love the fact that each day I learn something new and I can interact with customers on a daily basis and help solve their problems. Having great coworkers helps create the environment where customers come in and ask for associates by name. our customers get to know us and in turn we get to know them."
good,Productive and fun workplace. Great customer service. The hours were long. The customers are great. You always would be doing something different each day. Great benifits.
good,Fun is a busy environment helping customers and pushing at the same time private brands to increase company profits.
good,You are forced to obtain your commission otherwise you job is in jeopardy. Manager is kind but lacks knowledge. Inventory is limited. Sales are stolen occasionally.
good,"Job Work/Life Balance:My first two weeks were spent behind a computer in the back training. When we were at full staff, it was easy to get  days off but, at the end of my employment with RS, it was only me and my Store Manager because the DM wouldn't approve the people we were interviewing."
good,"Greet customers and address individual requests for service; open and close store ensuring standard operating procedures were followed; performed audit and inventory of merchandise for sale; assist customers to resolve complaints and issues of dissatisfaction;  supervised and trained sales associates in customer service standards and store procedures; performed human resource functions; reconciled cash and credit sales; performed store bank functions and daily cash deposit; supervised shipping and receiving department ensuring proper procedures were followed, documentation, and accountability."
good,I learned about many different elections and grew my customer service skills. Always got along with everyone
good,"Usually depends on the day, if we are busy it allows us to get in contact with customers and help with their needs and we also keep store presentable. On slower days we do opportunity log calls or clean areas of the store that need touched up."
good,"The company was a great place to work. I learned how to produce the most out of individuals in different fields and make them more effective. "
good,The day usually consisted of me managing a small crew of individuals through the production of electronic devices. I was blessed to have a strong motivated team eliminated the difficulties of the job.
good,"A typical day at work is reviewing time cards, Checking in shipments,ordering merchandise, Daily paper work, helping customers find what they need, helping the associates with sales, and finding the right merchandise for the customer."
good,"Opened and closed Facility; managed daily cash and inventory."
good,"RadioShack only had few people working at the store, this allowed me to get to know the people I worked with well. When I first started working there the manager I had for the majority of the time was great at his job and kept the staff motivated to do work. There wasn't a hard part of the job, when I first started you get hit with a lot of training which isn't fun but it is needed, helped me with a lot of the daily task."
good,Busy at times but for the most part very good company to start in the technology field. No huge requirements to get hired here.
good,"We got to see all the new products before we placed them out. I learned a variety of things and different products such as cell phones to diodes. Management was great, they changed managers as I was leaving. My co workers were a blast to be around, very friendly. The hardest part of the job would be learning everything. All in all it was fun to play with the new stuff while achieving sales goals."
good,"Working at RadioShack was indeed an exciting field with new types of technology at every turn. Being a enthusiast of the Tech industry. It was a fun company but lack of customers due to larger retail & discount stores, a decrease in compensation was unfortunately an issue."
good,"Typical work day usually either fast or slow paced with business, customers were mostly needing assistance, employees willing to help customers with great attitudes, though sometimes employees could get unprofessional around other co-workers."
good,Good positive environment that always put the customers first.  I learned how to interact with customers as well as up-sale.  Hardest part of the job was doing the tags.  Best part of the job was interacting with coworkers.
good,I get to meet new people and help them with anything they need electronical. I have learned a lot about electronics which I didnt know before I started working at Radio Shack. I enjoy the people that I work with. We are a team and work accordingly. I feel that the hardest part of my job is remembering the plans for each cell phone carrier. The most enjoyable part of my job is knowing that the person I help left satisfied and happy
good,If you plan to work here then plan to sell mainly off commission with the minimum hourly wage. You will have to know about smart phones regardless which isn't bad but you will need to work on your sales pitch if you want your paycheck to look good.
good,"Everyday I would open up the store and count out the drawer, look over previous days sales, set up daily sales goals for each associate, overlook store's organization and straighten up any displays, trouble shoot cusotmers problems and direct associates sales, do the bank deposit and oversee closing proceedures. Learned how to manage my own store and how to deligate work to others. The hardest part of the job was to handle customers who tried to get something for nothing by twisting advertisements wording/meaning and trying to return items past their return date."
good,A typical day at work would include cleaning and doing floor plans to organize the store. I would receive shipments and deliveries and ship out shipments and deliveries. Customer service is handled on the daily and some days you might have to act like a technician to solve customer service issues.
good,"Just like any other retail store, you have your fair share of grumpy customers. As long as they are taken care of, their mood changes to a satisfied attitude. Customers come in for a variety of things whether it is for batteries, a landline phone, cell phone, accessories etc."
good,"I like working here. In order to be successful you must be energetic, cheerful, and willing to learn. There are many opportunities for advancement."
good,Every day work at RadioShack is a new experience. Interacting with customers has made me a better active listener and showed me the value of empathizing with someone (especially if they are upset). My manager pushes me which I really appriciate and my co-workers are always ready to listen and help me improve. The hardest part of the job is also the most enjoyable part of it which is the customers. They keep it interesting and I'm never bored
good,"I was voted number one salesperson in Alberta, It was an amazing feeling. I was always the top of my co-workers."
good,Helping cx's on one on one best thing ever. Selling phones and setting them up. Getting the right advice to cx and selling the correct product.
good,"Durante el dia se hacia el recorrido gerencial para detectar problemas de falta de mercancia exhibida o cambios de precio con la finalidad que se resolbieran en el moemnto por parte de las asesores de ventas los cuales tenian un area asignada de la tienda, posteriormente se realizaba los depositos de las ventas anteriores asi como preparar la papelieria para enviarla a corporativo en mexico d.F una vez terminado loa dministrativo se relizaba el inventario de alto valor para detectar posibles desvios de mercancia, una vez realizado todo esto se salia al piso de venta a atender a los clientes todo mediante el servicio al cliente deigual manera prospectar clientes por telefonoo para incrementar las ventas y llegar al plan diario, se realizaban eventoss promocion de ofertas con microfono y sonido lo nesesario y prudente como volantear en colonias cercanas a la tienda volantear en la plaza todo para conluir el dia exitosamente"

good,"Good place to work. Friendly down to earth customers And co-workers. I trained new employees, and took care of customers and inventory. Opened and closed store at reasonable hours."
good,Radio Shack is a great place to work. I learned alot of things and different selling skills at radio shack while becoming ceritfied in Moblity and Consumer electronics. A typical day at work is coming in looking at my task for the day and help customores with all of their needs. It was very easy to build relationships with shoppers because we always get the same ones and they like us because we are always honest and straight up with them. My co workers were always great. I've been here for going on two years and I never got into and trouble with a co worker or shopper. The hardest part about radio shack is inventory. The thing that makes this hard is if the scan gun messes up and we have to scan the whole store all over again. What I enjoy he most is just being able to helping the shoppers and seeing there face when I fulfil their needs.
good,"A typical day consists of cash management, meeting daily sales goals, and mostly customer interaction. Radio Shack has enabled me to hone in on my selling skills and learn how to effectively manage and lead a team with a common goal and uniform approach. My co - workers are wonderful and we look out for one another. The hardest part of the job is dealing with very difficult and angry customers, which rarely occurs. The most enjoyable part of the job is the satisfaction of delighting the customers and exceeding their expectations."
good,"Arrive about 45 minutes before opening, check closing shift sales numbers, and compared to monthly goal. Determine we the sore needs to stay on track. Spot check inventory both n the shelves and in the back room, especially high ticket items. Question closing shift is necessary. Determine what merchandise will get the store closer or well above our goal and push it.Always in checking for any employee that needs my help, assign lunch depending on how busy the store is. The hardest part is getting the store ready everyday and surpassing previous year's sale numbers. The most enjoyable was the pay."
good,Radio Shack is a great place to work when your just starting out or need to gain experience in management. My DM was great! Very supportive and gave me many opportunities to grow within my position. I would work 50+ hours a week but wasn't getting compensated as well as I should have been. This is the reason I left Radio Shack.
good,"Flexible, great workplace, meet new people"
good,"A typical day at work consisted of clocking in, logging into the computer management system, checking for any price tag updates or fixture updates, assisting customer with general retail and/or sales based wireless transactions. "
good,You had your typical customer that you couldn't please but over all helping them with what they need is a huge accomplishment. Staff and management were very professional.
good,"Store managers helped build my strengths and improve my weaknesses.  When I started the path to Store Manager, the District Manager helped me accomplish this by having me aid and train under different Store Manager (i.e. I spent a couple weeks with the manager specializing in profit sales, then I spent a couple weeks with the manager that specialized in back office paperwork and training, etc.)"
good,Management was a bit difficult but staff and customers made the experience enjoyable.
good,"Proceed to the store an hour before opening to ensure the registers were appropriate in daily count, ensure store was clean and presentable to associates and customers, ensure no new activities needed to be completed (IE price changes, new displays, new products to put out, etc...)."
good,Learn all types of new electronics and training in store management for anyone interested. All types of people to work with and transfers all over the US.
good,"Ill get my day started by logging in my computer followed by inventory. Then ill count cash and make sure brochures are in order and everything is clean in the way it needs to be. I will call my customers to make sure they phone or plan is fine. By doing that I was able to either add features, add another line or upgrade a second or third line. The job was good, alot of customer service. But over all easy work."
good,"Was a good work environment with good co-workers.  Learned alot from this job as it was just like running your own business.  I was in charge of product ordering, inventory mgmt, interviewing and hiring, payroll and sales.  It did get to be a little stressful working 6 days sometimes and having daily numbers to meet but thats with any retail mgmt job."
good,Productive work place that offers commission on sales. Offering opportunity to advance. I was able to advance in the company fast.
good,"Typical day includes meeting daily sales goals, visual merchandising, addressing customer concerns"
good,"Fast paced environment, with exciting new technology product opportunities. Energized sales teams that work well together to achieve sales targets and growth opportunities."
good,"I worked at two different Radio Shacks, both had great managers, and co-workers. I learned quite a bit about dealing with the public, and customer care."
good,"Its a nice job , We have a lot of down time , Its easy helping the customers . The managers are really down to earth and helpful , Our co-workers are friendly . The hardest part of the job is when there is nothing to do down time makes time go really slow, I love the job because its in a mall so its always something to do on break."
good,"In my case, there were not too many ""typical"" work days, as priorities could shift at any time. This fact was not a bad thing, as it usually kept things interesting and often resulted in team-efforts to accomplish one goal. Management at most levels was typically professional, respectful and easy to relate to. My co-workers took their jobs seriously, yet tried to have fun at the same time. Certain product launch schedules could become taxing, yet most of the time you had plenty of management support to help with the resources needed. The most enjoyable part was knowing that I was ultimately protecting brand reputation and satisfying customers, while being recognized for my efforts. The general respect for diversity was also impressive over the 14+ years I spent with RS. I'm a long-haired musician and was never asked to cut my hair and was frequently invited to high-level business meetings."
good,The company overall isn't the best company but for a young person looking to make a better pay than just minimum wage was great. By the far the best manager i could ever ask for. The best co workers. It was a complete unified nation.
good,"A typical day at Radioshack was, for the most part, enjoyable. My first week was spent in the back room to complete training and after that I hit the sales floor. It was all about your numbers by the end of the day. How much you sold, how many customers you had and were satisfied, etc. I got along with everyone and definitely made friends in the work place. It was hard at first but once I got the sales pitch correctly, it became easier. "
good,"A typical day at RadioShack can be slow not that busy. But working there you learn a lot and about different things everyday. I didn't know half of the things I know now about different electronics. Management could be better, my coworkers are also fun to work with. The hardest part about the job is really nothing. I enjoy working for RadioShack because of the customers and the environment  of getting to meet someone different and the ones you have built that friendly relationship with."
good,A typical day at RadioShack is to sell and advise phones and phone buyers
good,"Maintaining a clean department in the store and keeping it organized and priced. Assisting customers with electronics and cellular devices and finding ways to help them with any needs they may have. Unloading and loading shipment that goes in the store and managing the cash register and partaking in money interactions for customers, also, handing credit card, phone bill, and other electronic payments."
good,"Work duties as manager of small business involved scheduling,  managing and training staff employees in order to understand the wide variety of products and how to sell them.  Also, skills required to create and maintain store displays, selling, maintaining inventory as well as process daily financial reports to submit. "
good,"There is always room for advancement at RadioShack. I invested a great deal of time into the company, and in return I was promoted quickly. It's definitely not the job for someone who just wants a check, it's a job for someone who WANTS to work."
good,"As working at Radio Shack, I was always looking forward to going to work because at Radio Shack they so many electronic devices which means learning the features in them. After learning them, then giving information to the customer about it... it makes you look good at what you do. I also loved doing wireless sales and showing the customer the benefits in there purchase. Throughout when i was working here, it gave me the confidence to sale more and more. I give credit to my co-workers and manager, they were always there to help me when i was doing something wrong."
good,I learned how to use many computer products while working here and even learned how to manage wireless phones.
good,I learned so much from this job like how to prevent fraud and how to provide the best customer service possible. I have the best co-workers. They are fun and make the job interesting. They are like my second family.
good,"Great learning experience, come with a lot of benefits, and also you pick up good communication skills"
good,While working for Radio Shack Ive learned a lot of things I didnt know about electronics
good,Management team is very knowledgeable. Dependable work schedule with flexible options.
good,"I learned how to succeed with people, making jokes and small talk."
good,"I enjoy my job at Radio Shack, but I am looking for my career, and I cannot do that with this company. It is a great company to work for, but since I am in a more secluded area of the country, I am limited to how much advancement I can actually achieve, plus the manager of the store I work for is not the greatest manager in the world. For this reason I am looking for my career and starting my future with my lovely girlfriend, and soon to be fiancee. The company itself is a great company to work for but more for a college student."
good,good learning sales job. decent pay. good job security. fun working enviroment.
good,"Working at Radioshack was a great work experience getting to help all different kinds of people mostly the elderly. Most days were slow because of location. Mornings were when people actually came in. A typical day at work would be selling watch batteries or alarm system batteries. The hardest part of the job was doing inventory because you had to scan every item in the store.The management was ok we had a new manager every couple of months. My co-workers were great i loved all of them we all worked as a team help each with sales or anything we didn't know how to do. I have to say the best part of my job are the customers I have met some great people along the way. Radioshack has taught me a lot of things how to handle customers better, handling money, and how to sell."
good,"I loved working here, I sold more contracts than anyone else in my store, I made great money, had a great time with helping the customers, made my store look fabulous, and worked very well with other employees. I was promoted three times in a five month period of time and was literally a month into my training to be a Store Manager. Then my Store Manager actually came into work one day and handed me his keys and walked out, quit right there on spot, another two employees followed him that week, and it was me ""a Manager in Training"" and two sales employees. I was told to ""act as Store Manager"" until the position was filled. Meanwhile I was not able to make sales, phones or general products, I handled all returns, shipping, repairs, customer issues, conference calls, stocked store, updated planograms when neccesary and still assisted sales personnel when needed. I never obtained the title of Store Manager although I did the job, I was never compensated for the managerial tasks I had undertaken. As a matter of fact, my pay rate while I was selling contracts was approx. $13.30/hr, that's Minimum wage (7.40)+Commission. While I took on ""acting Store Manager"" my pay decreased to my base pay of 7.40/hr due to being unable to be out on the floor with customers. I did this for about a month, and asked my District Manager when the new Store Manager was going to be hired and manage the store so I could continue my training. I was told it could be three more months before someone took over. Within the week I asked for a demotion back to a sales only position and was denied. If I had been"
good,Get to own your own business - at all levels. A great job if you are willing to give it your all.
good,"The only thing i didnt like about the management is that they didnt appreciate when you did good, but was always worried about that you did bad."
good,"Good place to work, reasonable opportunity for advancement, good pay if you have the motivation to sell."
good,Radio Shack is a good company for anyone who wants to learn about being a sales person. whenever a customer comes into the store they are given a greeting and asked what it is they are looking for. Whatever it mightbe you sell them an item that they are looking for and try to either upsell or sell them the item that they were looking for. working at Radio Shack is an education in it's self you'll learn about how a battery runs to what a diode does because they make sure you are certified in anything that is sold at Radio shack. Not every manager is the same but they do worry about their bottom line and if you hurt the bottom line they don't want you around. whomever I worked with we try to get along. selling is the hardest part of the job because if you don't have the foot traffic you can't sell. the customer experience is the best part
good,"working here was a good experience, with a friendly enviroment and good pay"
good,"Working at radio shack was a good experience with hands on customer service. I will go in to work, interact with customers and make them feel comfortable. During this experience Ive learned how to interact with people on different levels. The management was great and so was the employees. The hardest part of the job was leaving. I enjoyed it alot but I had to leave due to my pregnancy. I mostly enjoyed working in the diverse environment I was working in. Nothing personal, but I got to know alot of others from different cultures while working at Radio Shack."
good,A typical day at work was intense and competitive. This job is totally sales driven. Confidence and product knowledge were the keys to be successful as a Radio Shack manager. Management were very professional and good at training employees to generate sales. The hardest part was when you had days that it was difficult to make a sale. What i enjoyed most about my job was the financial rewards of a successful work week.
good,Radioshack is always a fun place to work. Everyday you will learn something new from the great weekly training that they provide. Management is very on top of things and make it easy to get your job done. This job is commission based so its always important to give 100% because YOU MAKE YOUR PAYCHECK
good,"Alot of product knowledge, Great co workers, Pay was good!!"
good,radio shack was a fun place to work for me because i enjoyed working with electronics. i came in and clocked in and made sure that the store was clean and everything in its proper place. i assisted customers and sold various electronic devices. the management made sure that we were on top of our assignments and met quotas. my co workers were easy to get along with. i learned how to multitask and how to deal with different types of customers.
good,• Open/Close Store
good,"Answering phone, customer service, inventory, playing with new phones and gadgets that come in"
good,I would help people as soon as they walked in the door. I learned about cell phones and technology. We changed management a lot for some reason. I loved my co- workers because we worked as a team. My favorite part of this job is working with people.
good,"Great learning experience, had great opportunities, and very flexible around schooling"
good,Nice work enviroment. Friendly Co-workers. Great trianning process.
good,"Manager was wonderful to me, I was successful because he let"
good,"A friendly workplace where the manager of the store has great knowledge, "
good,"Great place to work, wish they had not been bought out. I was paid a weekly 40 hrs. per week livable wage close to work. built team work with fellow employees Up beat friendly atmosphere ,respectful of employees and customers. assist customers with complaints, about defective mdse. replaced when defective. reviewed stocked merchandised in warehouse for displays. handled the retail marketing dept. as mgr."
good,the location closed down and was replaced with a sprint store. it was a fun placed to work though and i had a great manager who really cared about his job and his employees.
good,"It's a great place to work. People are friendly. You can learn about new technology. Great place for tech geeks to work. Stock share options and salary is either hourly pay or commission, whichever is higher."
good,"Before I worked there, I wasn't too aware of what RadioShack sold. Now that I have been employed by RadioShack, I have to say that it was an incredible learning experience. They had everything, from plugs and batteries, to cellphones and drones. Also, they had the most important point: the knowledge on how to use them. "
good,The job as a Store Manager was great. The company struggled with direction and didn't listen to the store employees until it was too late. Poor upper management caused the popularity to die out which eventually killed the business.
good,"I was responsible for a Commercial sales team of 12-20 associates.  We handled business sales for RadioShack that included; government, education, fortune 500, small and large enterprises.  We had a monthly sales goal as a team.  Our team had to make 40-50 prospecting calls a day to their current and potential clients. It was tough and our company started suffering overall, but we worked our hardest to achieve our sales goals.  The rewards we received for meeting our sales goals were the best part of the business."
good,It was a good job to start off with to help out while I was in college. The hours worked with my schedule and i was able to have money while I was in school.
good,"Responsible for all areas of retail location from opening the store, ordering merchandise, inventory, hiring, training, recruiting, cleaning, stocking, day to day operations."
good,"If you like dealing with the public and resolving a relatable challenge, this was a great place.  The focal point for this job was to assist customers reach a complete solution; even if that meant sending them somewhere else for other needed products."
good,Sales associate in a retail store.Good store managers. Corporate had it's management problems which ultimately bankrupted the company. Management didn't keep up with the times and ran the company into the ground.
good,It was a great experience working for Radio Shack. Great Team Work environment and high management gave recognitions to those who achieved or exceeded company goals.
good,"I really enjoyed working for radioshack and was very upset when I found out all the stores in my area were shutting down, I wouldnt have left otherwise."
good,I learned how to process and set up phones and the accounts. I actually always had fun here and would of definitely stayed if they did not shut down the business.
good,"Been with Radioshack when they were placed inside Sam's Club, and then moved inside Target, but final cutting the cords with them and switched to full corporate stores. Been promoted to all stores around the new orleans region and loved every moment of it. Working with my District Manager who was promoted to Area Manager closely and learned a great about to help mold me into the better salesman i am today. Miss the cell phone sales which achieved so much in my time and wish to continue it"
good,"I would answer all incoming calls, Entered all repair tickets in the computer system. Called customers with estimates on their repairs."
good,"Radio shack was a big company, they had a lot of stores but i think they went bankrupt and had to shut down plenty of locations.but before i left radio shack it was a great place to work friendly people and plenty room to grow."
good,Great place to find things but they are all closed now and will never be reopening. So don't bother/ Was fun place to work with great benefits at the time.
good,Working for Radio Shack was truly an experience I will never forget. I enjoyed my day to day responsibilities. As an employee I was taught how to troubleshoot most electrical devices and assist customers as they came into the store.
good,Excelente clima laboral con personal capacitado para el liderazgo de la empresa
good,Radioshack was an enjoyable place to work.  Upper management had a clear and obvious goal.  They gave managers the flexibility to run their locations how they saw fit.
good,Computer parts were their specialty but unfortunately they filed bankruptcy. No other business offers what they had in products. I just wish the company adapted sooner to stay on track with technology advancements leading to lower costs of products.
good,"My immediate supervisor worked hard to help us succeed, and was great in giving us tools to keep the store making a profit. Upper management was terrible, and didn't seem to understand what really sold in stores and what was needed to succeed."
good,This job taught me everything I still know and use at any other job I later worked at or a future career. The managers in the area were very knowledgeable and understanding of many circumstances.
good,"work is fast paced competitive, paid for performance, but lacked customer service due to fostering a relentless sales focus. Hours were good and allowed for work life balance."
good,"They are flexible, friendly, professionals. Great compensations through the work. insurance was great low co-pays. I love it there. if you were need it in an other store they would pay for lunch and gas"
good,"Floor sales: electronics, cell phones,  cell phone accessories,  cell phone chargers computers, TVs, radios, CBs, clocks, fuses, chargers, batteries, toys,  computer accessories"
good,"un lugar con un ambiente de trabajo amigable, aprendi a llevar estandares y objetivos de venta."
good,"I was a manager of a store. We work with customers, sales goals, restock the shelf's. It was a fun place to work and sadly the stores had to close. Overall a good place to learn great people stills."
good,Regal sourcing system within this company there were many areas of growth within the company at the time. The major lay off in 2006 didn't give way for most of us to indulge
good,this store is closed. went out of business. does not no longer exsist. how much more can i say this? how can i describe it? the store no longer exsists.
good,Customer service was a must working here. We had to make sure we knew our Electronics because customers looked up to the employees to look for what they needed.
good,radioshack was one of my favorite jobs I have ever had. it was a working environment that allowed me to tackle consumer problems head on and gave me an opportunity to really familiarize myself with customer relations.
good,"I really liked this job.  I made the weekly schedule and sold electronics.  Cell phones were a big plus, there."
good,Great job to learn from and to further advance you if you desire to move up in the cooperate later. Great hours to work if you have a family to care for.
good,"RadioShack was actually one of my favorite jobs. I was able to learn more about electronics, which was a huge plus because my daughter is very interested in STEM. However the parent company went bankrupt."
good,"Great place to work at, laid back atmesphere, good management, treated employees with respect, would still be working there if they were still in business"
good,RadioShack always was a positive place to work and you know it gives you the opportunity to grow and make more money it's up to you to know how much you want to make.
good,"RadioShack was a friendly, face paced networking and customer satisfaction work place. There is opportunity to advance at every angle from sales to management and corporate recognition depending on your performance level"
good,A slower pace job and more of a customer service job. Provided me with information about different electronics I never had before and also gave me the opportunity to work independently
good,"I’m thankful to my previous company because I have learned a lot of things from there, and they provide to me full support from the company and my workplace team."
good,"I received excellent training and skills at this job. We received hourly wages and commission on the products we sold. I went through several different coworkers while I worked there and enjoyed each and every one of them. I enjoyed my first manager greatly but the second one was a tad more tough on us. She got our store into much better shape though and did her job quite well. We did, however, start receiving more complaints from customers about her and her attitude, which was really disappointing. I had to leave though because our particular store got shut down when radioshack went out of business."
good,"I didn't work at Radio Shack for very long, but found it to be a friendly and fun place to work.  Pay was basic pay plus commissions.  It was great being able to interact with customers."
good,"Radio shack isn't a bad store, it has everything you need, but just a little pricey. If you can handle all of then you should be fine and enjoy the store as anyone else!"
good,This job had its good points but not many. I found the work to be very boring. Which made the hours go by slowly. The company had good benefits but the pay was not really that great. All of the raises depended on store profits.
good,"It was great to wear with them at the holidays and the best thing is with the discount that you get for being employer, it was a grey store because you can pay your cable or your kind of bills."
good,If I did not move and it close most of its stores I would still be working there. I became assistant manager after just a few weeks due to the current assistant manager leaving.
good,I really liked working here. You get paid hourly plus commission. It's a great job for a college student who needs to make some money for a couple of bills
good,If it had not gone bankrupt and closed i would recommend this job to anyone you meet interesting people and u get to learn new things the manager was a good person as well
good,The typical work day is to open the store and complete task such as inventory and counting the register.  Making sure everything is up to date for accurate sales.
good,"The most enjoyable job that I have had by far. Everyday there was something different. I learned so many things about myself that I didn't realize before working for RadioShack. Customers came in many shapes and forms. Some were eager to make my day brighter and some in need of me making their day brighter. I was happy to oblige. Sales can be quite rewarding. Aside from the great people I met, There were many incentives."
good,"This was a very good place to work, alot of good people running the company, sadly they went out of business but overall i spent a long time with this company and treated me very well"
good,"I was working while going to school. It was one of my first jobs, where  learned how to deal with people from different backgrounds and different attitudes."
good,"Always something to do and new to learn about. From new technologies or old. Someone would always no more than you. Be it a customer or a fellow coworker. And if not, you could always teach someone willing to know, how certain items worked and leave them with a smile. I learned many new things."
good,Was a great place to work and advance my skills as a sales associate as well as customer service. Great working enviorment as well as associates.........
good,"Good company to work for. Great employees. Covered parking is nice.  Headquarters is part of the Tarrant County College campus in downtown Fort Worth, Texas."
good,RadioShack was a competitive yet relaxing environment. It had plenty of healthy competition and gave way to some great friendships. Unfortunately RadioShack is going out of business as they are going bankrupt.
good,Enjoy every minute of it. My manager was great. Hours were very flexible. My reason for leaving was due to me being in College and having to spend my time and attention to my classes rather than working
good,"Radioshack was once an excellent company due to multiple bankruptcies it has been transferred to sprint. Therefore, I wouldn't recommend anyone to work for Radioshack."
good,"RadioShack was a flexible place to work with competitive pay, but it has closed it's doors all over the world. It was a good place to work while it lasted."
good,"Radioshack is no longer in business. When it was around it was a great place to work. THere are no more RadioShacks in the Philadelphia, Delaware or New JERSEY areas."
good,"Assisted clients on approval for cellular phone service Verizon, Sprint and Nextel. Sales Rep with extensive formal training in strategic selling store products, and computers. Learned how to deal with customers and solving problems. No hard parts on job, Enjoyed working in the Mall."
good,Radioshack was a great place to work. They allowed me to flourish and hone my medical skills. There was place for advancement through the hospital to grow into a leader.
good,Long apps. were done over Phone. I liked learning more on home financing here. My manager was nice & easy going. He addressed any ?'s we had in a nice way.
good,Learned to be able identify customer's needs and then be able to show them the best options they had for whatever they were interested in. Was an exciting place to work while in high school specially since I've always liked electronics.
good,"Assist the Retail Store Manager in planning and implementing strategies to attract customers.Coordinate daily customer service operations (e.g. sales processes, orders and payments).Track the progress of weekly, monthly, quarterly and annual objectives"
good,Over all this was a great working environment with great opportunities to move up the ladder! Learned about everyday products and meant sales goals while doing it.
good,"Started off being fantastic, great compensation. Loved my co workers but the turnover was a bit too much and the compensation decreased dramatically over time"
good,radioshack was not a bad company at all to work for before they actually shut down people in their were nice and comfortable for who you are as a person. management was flexible the hardest thing was to kick people out after getting caught stealing something and trying to play it off like they didn't put something in their pants or shirt. The best part of the job is the environment and meeting new people inside.
good,Get it don't stop make your dreams come true do what you can until you can't make the most of your dreams follow your own destiny not a book's that was written by oppressors...
good,After about a week I was fully trained and already part of the family the store had going for it. I would have stayed a lot long if the store had not closed down.
good,I loved working at Radio Shack. there just wasn't enough business there. they didn't have enough hours to cover all the workers. wish they didn't close down the store.
good,"Overall, a day at work was civilized and mellow. I learned that giving in to customers' demands is not always justified. My manager was a very understanding individual, and the culture is very Millennial oriented. The hardest part of the job was dealing with difficult customers, but the most enjoying part of the job was being able to play music throughout the store, choosing artists like James Brown, Depeche Mode, Ray Charles, George Benson, AC/DC, The Police, The Eagles, Pink Floyd, The Ohio Players, Led Zepplin, etc."
good,"I absolutely loved working at Radio Shack. It was right up my alley, my coworkers were enthusiastic, sales goals were attainable at times. One of the things that irked me the most, however, is how upper (Corporate,almost) management DID NOT communicate as to which Radio Shacks were closing. It was a big inconvenience to me, as I had only two weeks notice before they told us we were closing. It was ridiculous. I highly advise anyone seeking employment for the remainder 100+ stores to be careful, and not expect this ship to be sailing much further."
good,Radioshack does not exist any more do to lack of sales however sprint bought them out so a few radioshacks still are open. In this company you have to meet your sales quota.
good,"Making sale in all products on the sales floor, Greeting customers is a priority as soon possible.  "
good,"Good 1st job for working with customers. Unfortunately, there were corporate issues and company could not survive.  There were too many locations, may be reason."
good,"very busy, always had something to do. loved dealing with problem customers, they would come in angry and leave satisfied from my customer service and always seen them back."
good,"At RadioShack, I worked as a Sales Associate and checked out customers as well as stocked and cleaned. I think one of the most enjoyable things about this job was meeting the different customers and learning about different technology."
good,Working for Radioshack was fine.  It was a fairly laid back environment with achievable sales goals and no true high pressure sales requirements. It required a little more technical knowledge than most retail as it was built on repair and pieces for fixing older systems.
good,"fun place to work, customer variation can vary from day to day making every day at work seem fresh and new, there are probably no more shacks open anymore so this may be pointless"
good,"I cut my sales and management teeth at RadioShack. I learned what it means to open, close, and maintain a store without daily supervision. We handled inventory, daily cash intake and deposits, and all internal personnel issues in house as needed.  Unfortunately, this company has downsized its storefront presence significantly."
good,There is plenty of opportunity your experience is solely what you make it as long as you work hard the opportunity to grow isn't that overall Great Place
good,"RadioShack was a great first-time experience in the work-force. I enjoyed interacting with my coworkers, befriended my manager, and learned a lot about the community."
good,"Very fair management,  You always knew what was good and what need to improve.  It is a shame the company is going out of business.  There are many hard working people in Radio Shack,  if your looking to hire don't hesitate to give them a call."
good,It was a good place to work at. The store i worked at specifically was not very high volume so it was never to hectic. Management was fair and respected the workers.
good,"I never had any issues working here. RadioShack had a great environment, the people  were great and friendly. Managers were also great very helpful with their employees"
good,"I loved RadioShack. My boss is one of the best bosses I could ask for. But that's obviously not going to be the case at every RadioShack. I was the Assistant Mobility Manager before they took away Sprint. It's a really lax job. My boss would like me take care of the sprint stuff and he would take care of the RadioShack stuff. It consisted of Sprint operations, cleaning here or there, keeping stuff tidy, knowing promotions, knowing product, and selling devices. Knowing my customers options is the most important of my job and making sure they didn't walk away with a device. But there were snags like the customer wasn't approved, or they had a large down payment they couldn't afford, or weren't approve for more lines so they went elsewhere. It happens and it's part of it. BUT the flip side that RadioShack doesn't know they are doing. They are running their company in the ground from poor decision making. Now they STAR program no longer exists and Sprint is no more in those stores so I no longer had the pay I once did."
good,"very good place for work, but most for someone who is in college. they don,t give you a lot of hours ( in case that you're a part-time) and full-time it's only 30 hours a week"
good,"check out customers, help them find the right product. sold cell phones. easy going place. lots of training. great customer service"
good,Great company to work for. Hard to move up in the company. I left the company to have more of an ability to grow. Overall a goo experience with bonus and commissions.
good,"Work days run very smoothly, seldom a problem. Locate the item the customer is looking for or derive what they are looking for by piecing parts and cables together."
good,My experience with the company has been a pretty good one! They have been very understanding to any concerns I have had. I has been a joy honestly! I advanced quickly with the company showing my hard work paid off
good,When i started radioshack the old manager and crew including the DM at the time we're amazing people they always inspired to achieve  a higher position within the company
good,"It was a great place to start, as a part-timer it was well balanced, and leaves you some time to study at school. Overall it was am awesome experience"
good,"Buen hambiete de trabajo, pocas oportunidades de crecer dentro de la empresa, me llevo bastante experiencia."
good,It was fun place to work but I needed to grow in my career. it is a good place to start working life. Management was professional and caring for its employees
good,This was a fun place to work. Everyone had fun when we worked and we had a little bit of a competition to see who could sell the most. It was a nice retail experience. You get motivated to sell with the commission on top of the base hourly pay.
good,"Good co-workers, always something to do, it was a great environment to work in. Managers were good and the costumer service was good and was above and beyond."
good,Coworkers and manager were great and friendly. Company itself was not great and like you to be kind of pushy towards customers.
good,"I learned about all the little parts and how things worked as well learning how to sell products like cell phones, dish services and electronic equipment.  I was one of the assistant store managers and I was in charge of opening and closing the store, bank deposits, payroll, stocking and most of important Customer Service.  I always made sure my customers was always happy and taken care of as I would want to be."
good,"The commission was good , and the ability to sell easily was always available because customers loved coming to radioshack. The management noticed you for your capability and work ethic."

good,I learn how to multitask. Bow to deal with a very busy enviroment and angry customer but at the same time provide my best posible help to calm the customers and find the solution for them. In many situations i didnt find the solution for them but i was able to have the customer happy and explain or appologized about the inconvenience. Very good experience.
good,"Great time there and it is beneficial to me. All of my co-workers give great vibes, we bond together. They taught me thing about the job I did not know about. For example, what each item do and what it means. The job is not hard at all. Easy to maintain."

good,"I was working in a busy location in jersey city, NJ "
good,Open the store and make sure all my drawers are ready for the day. Wait on my customers weather it be from a new wireless contract to a new otter box or a screen repair. I would pull drawers to make sure everything was accounted for through the day. after the last customer was helped I would then count my drawers and drop off the deposit and lock up.
good,This company was amazing. The staff was great along with the managers. You learn something new everyday working for this company. The hardest part of this job was leaving everyday.
good,It's a fun place to work and has a flexible schedule for school. It's moved from the hobbyist to more of a retail store but you still learn a lot.
good,"I wish most Radio Shacks were still open, because it was good place to work. I learned a lot, and developed people skills."
good,I found that relating to customers and founding out their wants and needs is a natural ability I have. This job was basically the first job I had where a bell went off and I thought I found the absolute best thing I am good at.
good,"I sale all kinds of electronics, cellphone, stereos, radios etc... I get along with my co-workers. I do have a lot of items to sale in the store. I like making commission, when selling electronics"

It allowed me to thrive in a field I enjoy working with customers to achieve great customer service. the most enjoyable part of my day would always be seeing the exceitment on my customers faces when the purchased  the item they came into the store to buy. I learned just how important it is to maintain a great attitude at all times when dealing with customer concerns.the management team encouraged growth within the company, my least favorite part of the job was when i didnt reach my sells goals for the day"
good,"Normally, the business is slow, after the bankruptcy only thing customers come in to ask about is when we are closing. If you like making little commission on slow business, which amounts to very little then this is the best place. If you need money like most people, then I wouldn't suggest it."
good,"Nice place to work at because it was in the mall. And good co-workers, everyone seemed to really love technology. People in general were also hard working and everyone tried to help each other out as far as getting quotas met."

good,"A typical day was like an ordinary day at the office. Get to work promptly, do your job and go home. The electronic boom was in affect yet, everything was still analog, apple wasn't a big hit yet as well. The only thing needed to learn was pricing adjustments or promotions.  "
good,They were a good company to work for. Commission on cellphones and descent pay. They workers were fun and loved to be around them.

good,"I enjoyed working the store as the store manger The inventory was ""right on"" the employees were well trained and eager to help keep the store efficient and friendlySceduling and payroll was fairly simple. My sales were quite good.  I was terminated while I was in the hospital suffering from a stroke in which time the District Manager was tranferred and the new one did not know my track record but only saw that I was absent and replaced me with one of his friends.Of course it did not matter  when I confronted him and remained unemployed for some time later."

good,"Radio Shack worries about theft, yet they won't install cameras inside the stores who don't have them. They want the employees to sell anything they can and remind us that the company is in our hands. However, management is great. They are understanding with students and work with our availability."
good,"I worked an open to close schedule 6 days a week at the end of my term for RadioShack. It was about making sure the store was clean and perfectly merchandised and running smoothly operations wise. Follow up calls and emails, making schedules, recruiting, employee training, cleaning the store, setting products with others related, shipping and receiving, filing contracts and employee paperwork and more."

good,"I learned how to do upgrades for Sprint, AT&T, Verizon, & Boost Mobile."
good,"Being a part of Radio Shack was very rewarding.  I became "
good,usually younger college kids are employed part time here so it's a nice place to start off as your first job as opposed to fast food.
good,I love this job learned about a lot of things I didn't know anything about I was under great manager and surrounded by people who helped me along the way a lot
good,"While working with RadioShack I was able to run two different departments. One would be for Outbound Production and the other was the Receiving Department."
good,RadioShack was a great career move I made 14 years ago. It gave the ability to advance with skills I possessed. The typical day at work was fun and energetic full of excitement getting paid to interact with customers.The culture was built on customer care with great compensation in wages. I became very knowledgeable of their products through the tools and training that they provided along with my on with pursuit of success. I entered MIT program because of the outstanding sales I generated. The most enjoyable time of RadioShack is when I became manager of my on store. It was the beginning of a long lasting career. One the hardest thing about being a manager of RadioShack was the change of competitive pay. I lost great associates because of the reduction of commission rates. The best salesperson was no longer available at RadioShack. It was like erosion you couldn't see it at first but it was deteriorating over time. Overall It has been a successful career. The day has sadly come to and end due to closing. It is really just the signs of times.
good,"RadioShack pays minimum wage to all of their employees, and a pretty low wage to their managers as well. The catch is that they make commission on most things they sell. This encourages employees to actually interact with the customers and give them the best customer experience, so they can get good numbers. The store I worked at was very slow, so this was easier. But at some of the busy stores, this was a little tougher."
good,"During a typical day I would place items on the shelves if an order had come in, help customers find what they are looking for in any of our departments, talk about sell and activate contract and prepaid cell phones, ring out each order as the cashier, clean up when necessary, and lock up the store when my shift was over. Over the year that worked for the company I learned my customer service skills, these skills, no matter where I end up in 5 years will be beneficial. The upper management was very young and new. Radio shack has been restructuring its infrastructure in the hopes of dragging the company out from negative. The most enjoyable part of my work experiences was my coworkers. because we had a small store the most people that would be working in any one shift was three. This meant what you where able to get to know your coworkers very well. By the time I had been working there for 5 months, it felt like I belonged to a new little family. The hardest part of the job was learning all the rate plans, and activation methods for each of the wireless carriers we serviced."
good,"This is where I started my retail career, I worked my way from a FT ASM to SM to DM and regional sales director and regional marketing manager."
good,"Had fun working here, I was young and it was one of my first jobs."
good,"Empezaba el día llegando a la tienda a las 8 de la mañana, encendía todo, ponía música y empezaba a ordenar todo lo relacionado con papelería de ventas de un día anterior ya que estaba ordenado salia al banco mas cercano a realizar el deposito de un día anterior, regresaba y escaneaba la ficha de deposito y la enviaba a las oficinas de la empresa posteriormente desayunaba y en punto de las 10 de la mañana abría la tienda para empezar con las ventas. ya en punto de las dos de la tarde llegaba el gerente y otro compañero. el gerente era el encargado del cierre de tienda. mi hora de salida era a las 5 de la tarde pero algunas veces me quedaba mas tiempo si era necesario. Los días que descansaba el gerente yo era el encargado de tienda y trabajaba todo el día al igual que cuando yo descansaba el gerente se quedaba todo el día. Me gusto este trabajo por que había interacción con la gente y nunca se me hizo pesado. la parte mas difícil de trabajo era los fines de año por que hacíamos cambio en la decoración de la tienda y a la vez teníamos que dar una adecuada atención al cliente."
good,"a typical day at radioshack consisted of cell phone sales and promotions, cell phone payments, sales of electronics of a large variety."
good,My typical day included assisting customers with finding products and assisting them with any questions they may have about it. In our free time we would clean the store or eat at many of the fast food restaurants in our vicinity.
good,"I arrived 30 minutes early to open my store. I walked the floor to assure everything was done and in its place. I checked emails and reports . I attended morning meeting if available by phone. I set up registers and briefed my employees on their tasks for the day I helped the employees set up goals for the day. I then stocked or did my paperwork. I went on the floor to monitor sales and employees as well as sell myself. I helped merchandise and fix displays. throughout the day I made bank deposits and checked register. at the end of the day I checked all jobs by employees for completion and closed out registers. employees straightened store and I inspected. everyone left together for security reasons."
good,Coaching employees on a daily basis on sales. Have to be able to time manage very well in order to get operations as well as sales where they need to be. Have to be willing to work with customers through out the day to ensure customer satisfaction.
good,"Radio Shack has been a fantastic company to work for. The employees and management were outstanding and the benefits and opportunities were more then desirable.However, the pressure of meeting metrics on day to day basis caused an unstable and worrying work environment. While the reassurance of success from the management team was welcoming, it was also quickly forgotten when that same management threatened your position to gain more sales and better metrics. Overall, the experience was great because of co-workers, friends and the customers. The benefits were fantastic."
good,Benefits were great. Raise every six months. Great management. Great sales incentives. Slow on some days but overall good. Nothing else report. Co workers were great and easy to get along with

good,"Greet customers entering establishments."
good,"You always have something to do, or always having customers come in and wanting more information on something. "
good,Helping customers solve endless problems is a typical day at work but I enjoy it. I love my co-workers and have become great friends with them. Some of the management is not all that great but we deal with what we have to. The hardest part of the job are those customers that think you should have the solution to every problem and have an attitude when you are trying your best. The most enjoyable part is making customers feel satisfied by taking time out of your day to genuinely help them. They love it!
good,"There is competitive wages and with room to grown, fun environment"
good,With Job advancement this is a great place for a person to get their feet wet in supervising employees
good,I Loved working for food lion it was a wonderful company i worked at multiple stores it was my first job and a great company to build with and grow to higher heights
good,I am the over seer of a great staff of 4 selling cell phones. My work load provided by my fare & just manager consists of preparing downloaded markdown paper work & assist with the execution of merchandising & operational function to my company's standards within the specific department. The tedious task is insuring specific markdowns yet it's also rewarding to know my job holds such specific detail of the overall company's capital. This improves on my attention to detail skills.
good,"Being that RadioShack has a variety of products in their stores it made working with the company enjoyable and entertaining, You did not get the same customer twice, meaning it wasn't all based on just one product but a variety of them, which gave challenge in learning, discovering, listening, paying attention and identifying what it is that every customer comes into the store."

good,"Cool co-workers, stocked the merchandise and helped customers."
good,Oversaw all new business development plans for the wireless department in over 50 RadioShacks region wide.

good,Most people had one section to tend to. There was three people in the women's section. I was the only in the men's and also had to run two other sections and at the end of the night i had to help in women's section.
good,"a typical day at work for me is make sure the store is clean and up to par. make sure I talk to every single employee that work that day and talk to them about what radio shack expects out of their shifts. In this business I have learned to run a store on a daily basis. my co workers here are very friendly and respectful, they listen to me very well and do the task I give them. the hardest part of my job is keeping dust from building up over the night. what I enjoy about my job is that every day is challenging. its not just clerking, you have to find a way to meet your daily goal, there for you have to find a way to sale customer what ever they came in for plus more. so turn a dollar sale into a 100 dollar sale."

good,One of the best retailers for which I've worked.  Exceptional management and effective directives.  Advancement for dedicated salesmen and women.  Very team oriented; recipe for success.  Good commission.
good,Everyday is different when coming into Radio Shack. Some days it would be all about reorganizing the shelves and on others it would be getting new products out to the floor. Everyone of my co-workers was friendly and supportive during all the shifts that I worked. The hardest part of the job would be having to set up an account on a system that  wasn't used often. The most enjoyable part of the job would have to be when a customer purchases a new phone.
good,Great company with great benefits and pay.  Potential to move up may have to relocate.  Management always ready and willing to help so are the employees you work with.  Home depot lived by a group of core values that made the company what it is today.
good,"RadioShack takes great effort and pride in offering knowledgeable sales staff by providing, as well as requiring, sales staff be certified in all branches of their product line.  The opportunities don't stop with sales, however.  They have career opportunities in virtually every aspect of consumer electronic chains.

good,"fun if you like electronics, and helping people with there problems because you never know whats going to get asked"
good,"I am part of a team that feels more like family than coworkers. I will be sorry to leave, but I need to find full time employment."
good,"Going to work was the highlight of my day! Learning new marketing strategies, interacting with the public, competing with co-workers for commissions, and learning the culture of the company made me strive to be better.  Management either absolutely wanted to help you succeed, or blatantly wanted to stunt your progress.  Some co-workers were playfully competitive, which made the workplace even more enjoyable. Others were too caught up in their own agendas and egos to even attempt to enjoy work. "
good,"Easy, outgoing co workers, makes company fun to work for. Very productive work place"
good,I enjoyed my time at Radio Shack. It was fun and enjoyed working with the crew I worked with on a daily basis

good,"Long drawn out boring shifts. Discount was great, love working with my coworkers and selling phones."
good,I learned a lot and the company offered a lot of room for advancement.  My manager was amazing and he taught me many things about the retail industry.  I can now safely say I know all about smart phones and the advantages of each one.
good,I liked the job because it was it was laid back and made extra money just for making sales. New items are always coming out so therefore we had to learn about them all. My co-workers was awesome we worked good as a team. Sometimes we wouldn't make any sales and that wasn't a productive day at work. We made the store a fun place to want to shop at.
good,Every day was a good day. My co workers were the best. I felt like i needed a better job.
good,This company is a great place to learn to sell and the people they hire and management they use are first class.  The only problem is they usually only pay minimum wage and they've lowered the commission to make it difficult to bring in very much.

good,"Very busy days at work selling electrical and electronic gadgets and products. "
good,"Overall working at RadioShack is a good experience, because you get to interact with your customers even if they don't buy nothing and your coworkers are always available for help when needed. The hardest part of the job would probably be doing inventory for the whole store. The most enjoyable part of the day is actually attending the customers, you get to interact with them, relate on certain aspects, and get know each other for a better customer buying experience. On a typical day we use team work to organize the store and greet every customer within seconds of them coming in with further assistance if needed. "
good,"The job was a lot of fun with challenging goals and good staff members to work with. A typical day included setting up sales goals for you and your staff, following up on required tasks and trainings and most of all providing 5 star customer service to all of your customers. RadioShack taught me all about the small electronics world everything from how to solder to how to rebuild a home theater amplifier. Upper management was typical of a larger corporation, however the support you got from fellow managers was more than enough to make up for that. The hardest part of the job was watching the company change its business model every 2 months, this is not typical of large corporations to do and at time it became a little overwhelming, however it was part of the job. The most enjoyable part of the job was the promotion opportunity I went from Part time Sales Associate to Assistant Store Manager in 6mths, and went from ASM to Store Manager in another 3 months."

good,"busy day usually, learned a lot about electronics and accessories. Management was good, helpful, and worked with the employees. Best staff ever, fun to be around, and helped each other. The hardest part was was shipment, because of the boxes. The best part was meet new people"
good,"* A typical day at work is opening the store every morning, making sure inventory is correct, accepting shipments that come in, making sure that we reach our monthly goals, helping guest with what they need."
good,I started working in an electronic store as a sales rep and quickly got promoted to assistant manager.
good,"The work it's self is great! The way they do management is pretty werid, they will since a brand new manager into a store without proper training. I've learned alot, I love working with cell phones and working with customers."
good,"A typical day at work would be fdast piece cause i was working while attending high school. I learned alot about electronics and fuses. My day at work would go by pretty fast cause there's usually music playing, customers coming in and out it was a pretty good job."
good,"RadioShack was my second job after a work study one I had my first year of college. I was new to the sales associate job and although I had never considered a job in sales, I manage to do really good. I have learned many things including: handling difficult situations, multi tasking, meeting deadlines, and management. As a keyholder I had to make good decisions and motivate my co-workers on doing good and assisting our customers with a positive attitude and in satisfying their needs. I really enjoy working in a fast-passed and busy atmosphere."
good,From the time I started as assistant to becoming a manager was challenging but well worth the experience.
good,"It was a good job, the customers were always friendly, and it was a fun time chance to learn sales and commission."
good,Learned a lot about customer service and face to face as well as commission sales. I have also gained multiple line telesales experience there
good,Easy going and very good place to work. Always able to present ideas and be heard. Benefits are good and management is always there to help you out. Hardest part of the job is meeting the expectations when you have slow times. You have to take advantage of every customer that walks in your store. The most enjoyable part would have to be my employees and other co-workers. They make it fun and competitive.
good,Able to learn a lot about the job and it's related benefits.
good,"Greetings, helping customers, and offereing sales and new promotions, also meeting new sales goals."
good,The work is easy helping customer in their electronic needs. Gives you a a satisfaction in making customer happy.You constantly learn new technology everyday.Co-workers are like your family. Hardest part would be when a system is not working properly.Enjoyable is when you open deliveries there is always something new.
good,Good work enviroment. Simply a great place to work. Lots of room for advancement.
good,"Selling, Merchandising, Inventory, Contracts, Running Credit Applications, Copying, Faxing, and 10 key knowledge required."
good,"When I started the job, I was already, for the most part, up to date with the most current technologies. I loved being around electronics and explaining how the technologies worked to a customer. My favorite days were when a customer would come in asking about our laptop computers. The hardest part of this job was trying to push to sell an expensive item to someone who I knew would return it within the refund period. However, this was still one of my favorite jobs."
good,I was very successful a reaching my goals every month but my work load was hard to complete with very limited employee
good,"This job was my favorite, if they didn't revamp the managment team I would still be there. They reconize hard work, and you get moved up with in the company, they would give you the chance to move up before they gave it to the public. Benifits were good, and the managers were great!"
good,Radio shack a great place to work if you ever get hired keep your job. There is a base pay plus commission. You get to play and work. Being part of Radio shack team you get to see new items before the public
good,"I really enjoyed my experience at Radio Shack with my company as a whole, nothing but good times and laughs at work. Everyone has ""those"" customers, but who doesn't. never really had any bad ones though. Management was as management is, sometimes there sometimes isn't but when you have the right one you know you do and your numbers show for it. Great incentives and great people to work with."
good,Selling Cellphones and mobile care and showing the customer how to use the updated technology
good,I had a great time working here but the pay was horrible. Only minimum wage and the only way to get more pay is to become a manager.
good,I like working here. It has a fun and upbeat atmosphere and i enjoy the competitiveness.
good,Temp job during college but the management was friendly. My student schedule didnt allow me to stay as long as i wanted to but i love it nevertheless!
good,Radioshack is a great place to work. they are friendly at always willing to help you achieve your goals.
good,This company has done a great job in preparing me for dealing with clients in a more professional setting which will pretty much be involved in any profession I get into. The hands-on selling basics you learn will transfer over to any job.
good,Caring and commited company that cared about their employees.
good,"Fun place to work, gained knowledge of new electronics, able to control how much my paycheck was going to be depending on my sales performance"
good,i met alot of people and learned alot. i would like to work there again if i had a chance to...radio shack is a fun place to work
good,I loved working here there was always something to do and awesome people to share the opportunity with.The schedule was to over the boards not steady but other than that working for this company was very rewarding and I have no regrets.
good,"I was working for radio shack on and off closing one store first, then a second one. A year on unemployment and then back to the branch in Brentwood for a year until the company closed forever."
good,"This job was competitive. This was great as it always kept me engaged with making sales for a higher commission. However, this did cause some abrasiveness between the sales staff. "
good,I enjoyed my time working with Radioshack. They had great management. Work environment was easy going. Great balance between work and social life. Company willing to work with employees for scheduling availability.
good,"los horarios eran un poco pesados, pero el ambiente de trabajo era bueno y ganabas en base a tu desempeño"
good,I enjoyed working for home depot. Its like working with family. employees and management know how to get along  and have a good time. pay is decent benefits are good
good,"This company is no longer in existence, which is too bad. My time with RadioShack was awesome. My original manager was spectacular. After she was replaced, my new manager was not as knowledgeable."
good,"The job was enriching and taught a lot about customer service and technology, Sales and quotas were unrealistic and expected you to harass the customer.  Commission degraded every few months until it was almost nothing. I watched as corporate went downhill and struggled to find a purpose while pushing employees harder and harder to make sales for a dying company that barely got business."
good,I was a sales associate and cashier. I help customers with any technical questions they had and sold 4 different cellphone carriers. It was professional and a well balanced place. There were quotas we had to meet and I never had a problem meeting them.
good,"A good place to work at, I learn a lot of skills that I can apply to my life now. This was a good place to work at, I enjoy work everyday. The management team was up to par, the workers were also up to par."
good,"Radio Shack used to be a great company to work for.You could find many electronics parts and tools for hobbies and  electronics projects as well electronics like radios, speakers, TV's etc.But  there is not much more to tell that matters now since it went out of business"
good,Well at the time when I was working at RadioShack it was pretty much a great way for me to start off in the mobile industry world. And if RadioShack was still active as of today because you barely see RadioShack's around. Then you know it would be a great place for me to recommend to a person just starting off in the mobile industry world.
good,It was a great learning experience for me growing up and into my career.  I learned many things and was able to advance my career because of what I learned there. They are now out of business.
good,"Trabajo  serio con responsabilidad grandes y retos importantes los cuales cubrí y logré al entrar a la empresa de Radioshack un ambiente de trabajo sano y fuerte relación laboral con compañeros y trabajadores como cedis, promotores,y gefes como distrital ,gerente regional."
good,the managers and environment of the job was so good down to earth and fun. helping the customers was fun and was definitely very rewarding it was a good place to work
good,"Our area supervisor at RadioShack was very pushy and not well trained. He did not know how to talk people. Im sure he was not supervised properly. other than that, I believe the pricing was fair, the pay not so much. The products were good but they were not enough, there just needed to be those extra special things you could only get there. Other than that, I was satisfied for a while."
good,"RadioShack is no longer in business.  They filed for bankruptcy, sold the Company name, logo, and some of the stores.  Another entity is operating under the RadioShack name."
good,Develop and trained all managers and assistant managers. Held meetings monthly on sales and product training. Created a Winning culture within district.
good,"I was a store manager at RadioShack. I made the scheduele, organized events, set up sales,worked all holidays, etc. I liked everything that I did there. I never had any problems with management. It does help to make the schedule, too."
good,"this place was good because i have two good managers . then teach me alot we work in a team , we have allways a meeting and the main office every month ,"
good,"While I was employed for Radio Shack I was lucky enough to be paired with an amazing staff, and a very knowledgeable manager who taught me an abundance of different things. My typical day consisted of 9 hour shifts where I helped customers with their electrical needs an questions, or setting them up with a new cell phone through their cellular company. This job was hands on while at the same time kept my mind extremely active, and kept my computer skills sharp. I can say I loved the job, unfortunately Radio Shack was going out of business so my time there was much shorter than id hoped."
good,"For me it was always slow working at Radio Shack. It just doesn't get as much business as back then. I learned a lot about electronic merchandise we had in the store. The management was awesome for me. Even when he wasn't working that day, I could call him for anything, and he would answer right away to help me. The only hard part is when a customer asked me a question about something I didn't know or learn just yet. The most enjoyable is that I got to play games, watch TV, and goof off with my other employees since we didn't get much business."
good,"RadioShack at the time wasn't a busy store, so it was hard to keep myself busy with work. But when I see a customer, I approach with a smile and show the customer what we have on sale. I use my experience to help customers with most of their problems related to their phone and other electronic devices that RadioShack sells. Management was organized and really caring of their employees. The workplace was more phone focused rather than what RadioShack was about. The hardest part of the job is to figure out errors in our system, when customers are eligible for a phone upgrade. The enjoyable part is the friends I made working there, working together with co workers make the time go quicker."
good,"Es una empresa que esta al día con la tecnología esta en constante inovacion con sus productos aquí tienes que hacer mucha labor de venta buscar que tipo de producto busca el cliente dependiendo sus necesidades muy buen ambiente de trabajo ya que con mis compañeros se respetaban la venta a tu nombre si no te encontrabas en esos momentos, lo mas difícil para mi fue conocer los distintos cable  que existen y lo mas fácil  la atencion al cliente"
good,"Excelente experiencia como directora regional del Caribe , estuve a cargo de tiendas en PR y en Islas Virgenes (St. Thomas y St. Croix). Pude manejar ambos mercados con culturas distintas y pude implementar diferentes estrategias para el manejo de personal tan diverso."
good,"Working with Radio Shack gave me new exoeriene of learning new technologies such as learning how to add a phone device. They teach you electronics such as specific devices for batteries, switches, computer technologies, and hands on technologies."
good,It was a great place to work at! The manager was amazing and the work load was so much fun The pay was a little low for all the work someone has to do
good,I had a pleasure working within Radio Shack as a sales associate. The management was perfect and understood the conflicts in my past schedule and worked with me. The only negative aspect of my time working under this company was due to bankruptcy.
good,"Now, all the stores in the area are closed or converting to Sprint stores, but when I worked there, we were pretty classic ""Radio Shack"" with parts and remotes. It was laid back, but I learned a lot that most ""millennials"" don't know."
good,Having this sales associate job as my second job was a great experience for me. I learned a lot in the customer service side of the business and also the sales.
good,i enjoyed my time working here. very peaceful and maintained environment. not a very busy area but there will be some traffic flow. i enjoyed meeting new people.
good,i worked hear for about a year and a half and i loved the environment here i made a lot of friends here and im sad to see it go. the only cons were that there were no benefits for part time associates and trying to move up was hard because not many manager positions would open up.
good,I've worked at RadioShack on and off for years. I've always loved it. I've had the best managers there hands down. It's also lead me to down a great career path! I would always recommend RadioShack as an employer
good,Es una compañía que fue adquirida por Officedepot de México cuya compañía tiene unos estándares y procesos muy bien establecidos siempre con el fin de llegar aún buen común así como el constante crecimiento de la compañía
good,Working at radio shack you were responsible for navigation multiple carrier website and there was a lot of online training that had to be completed before you were allowed to begin receiving commission. The one on one training between you and your manager was very minimal
good,"You really have to be self motivated and theirs always something to do."
good,"This job was a great learning experience for me. Introduction to pressure sales was an adjustment for most employees. Growth opportunities were about average and performing at a higher level was also challenging. Career promotions often lacked supportive training and company suffered many top level executive changes and business model changes, causing trickle down effect of constantly changing expectations. Only one leader in my tenure saw the deficiency of manager's personal growth and focused much of his time teaching store managers about how to grow their assigned store and employees."
good,The front line of RadioShack are very capable individuals who put the customer first. I learned a lot about how customers operate and the proper way to handle various different situations involving them. RadioShack really pushes the idea that the customer must be satisfied when leaving the store. The only real complaint that I have about working there is that the company was going bankrupt during my time with them which didn't allow me to move up in rank. The fear of the company closing for good caused a good amount of my co-workers to become stagnant and fearful of job security.
good,"I very much enjoyed working at Radio Shack. Learning new things and staying up to date on current electronics was fascinating. However, going into management was challenging as the higher management of the company did not provide much support to their store managers. I ended up working open to close, 18 days in a row with virtually no employees at one point. It is difficult to balance home life in a management position with this company."
good,Fun place to work with knowledgeable employees. Everyone works together well. It's easy to grow with the company and there are plenty of opportunities to earn more.
good,RadioShack was a local place to get your needs. At this store I was trained to give product knowledge to customers about products that we had in our store. Open and close the store was another task on the list. Able to handle activation with phones to new and old customers. The hardest part about this job was that there wasn't too much coverage on the floor so therefore I had to handle each and every customer on the floor by myself. The most enjoyable part about this job was connecting with the customers and hearing their stories.
good,"Amazing staff and opportunity for commission. Everyone works together as a team and gets along. Hours are flexible, and they offer some benefits."
good,"Sales and customer service and the occasional contract with cell phone providers. There was also help customers solve their electronic needs and problems"
good,worked there from an associate worked my way to management in less than 2 years. i learned many things growing there as an associate to manager.. too bad radio shack closed
good,"Working at Radioshack in a daily bases was first help the customers and make sure the store is clean and working.You will have to help people that enter the store find what they need, and figure out the electronics problems. now sometimes you had to deal with people that are not pleasant, but you learn to deal with people like that sometimes you can turn some of this people around and that was fun."
good,Radio Shack had a laid back work environment with good management at the ground level. Enjoyed working with most of the employees. Pay was not that great but was made up for by the people you worked with. Looked forward to going to work every day.
good,RadioShack was a great organization to develop business acumen.  The job was both challenging and rewarding.  The ability to multi-task was a must.  The store level personnel were the lifeblood of the organization.  The field personnel were part of a highly dedicated extended family.
good,"RadioShack had a wonderful culture, and a good work-life balance.   Compensation was pretty good, but less generous in the later years, due to financial difficulties of the company.   Resource management improved over the years, so that we had very good managers at the end.  The interesting work, and wonderful co-workers were the most enjoyable part of the job.  The hardest part of the job was to see RadioShack dissolve in bankruptcy."
good,"Typical day at work is receiving new merchandise, learn about it, and put it on display.  Price check-up everyday."
good,This job was a lot of one on one with the customers.I learned a lot about the tech side of how everyday objects work . The management at Radio shack was really motivating. we had our goals every week and we were pushed to make them.
good,Very business like place to work for.  No questions left unanswered  about your benefits or pay raises.  Nice to be recognized for ones accomplishments and hard work.
good,"Provided guidance to customers on consumer electronics"
good,"I usually work in the afternoon, as soon as i get off school. The environment is great, i meet people from all over the world, since we are close to the Cowboys Stadium. My cowokers are amazing, its like we are family. We sell what we can and try to reach the goal for the day. Every customer that comes in looked for different, so we have to be knowledgeble in different areas. What i like the most is that every customer is different and i learn from them. The hardest part of my job, is trying to understand customer when they have an accent."
good,"A good work day is when you can provide the most comprehensive customer experience possible. Typically, we have customers that don't know what they need, but are looking for solutions for their problems. In my experience, I have found that by simply listening to the customer you are able to solve almost all their problems, even if the answer is ""no"" or ""that doesn't exist"", as any answer is always better than unknown questions. "
good,Worked off of commission I enjoyed the opportunity to excel depending on my productivity
good,Nothing like the DIY enviornments. Great co workers.  Everything you need at one place or made available.  Great prices and rates.
good,Working at RadioShack has given me many opportunities to show my skills that I never had thought I would have. Being around electronics gives me that passion to sale even more to potential customers. Having a small team working at RadioShack builds stronger bonds and you get to know your co-workers on a deeper level. Management is also a good thing there because they help you to their best of the abilities.
good,A typical work day will consist of various duties needing to be accomplished throughout the day. You may come in with a list of things planned to do but always know that list will double or even triple by the end of the day. Personally I have no issue with this. There is always something to do and some moving part to be involved in. My coworkers are fantastic. We help each other whenever we can and it truly feels like there is one team/ one dream on our floor.
good,"A typical day at work consists of opening the store. I would set up each register for a typical sales transaction. A backup sales agent will come in around 2 hours after my arrival. Throughout our day we will receive shipment, perform a couple wireless sales as well as some returns on products in the store. I may also have a scheduled conference call during that afternoon with our District Manager and the other 17 store managers in my district. Upon closing, I will count the registers and make my daily deposit as well as performing daily closing duties."
good,"Era un sitio en el que por lo menos a mi me parecía que iba a trabajar, mas bien era como pasar un buen rato, aprendí muchísimo de tecnología, a la par de saber llevar una tienda con las responsabilidades que esto conlleva, mis compañeros fueron geniales, formamos un equipo de trabajo en el que todos cooperabamos para el funcionamiento y éxito de la tienda"
good,"I really did honestly like working for this company, I worked there for almost 2 years. I loved being there for customers to ask me questions, I loved being the 'nerd', and loved helping customers do what they wanted to do, as well as teaching them about applying technology to their lives."
good,"always something new to learn from a customer."
good,"Apertura de tienda venta informes del día y manejo del personal a cargo puntualidad , aseo personal,detalle de los ingresos depósitos de la venta del día anterior venta e informes.Tiempos para que personal a cargo tenga su tiempo de refrigerio sin tener problemas de personal."
good,Fun environment. enjoyed talking to customers answering what their needs are in technology.
good,I enjoyed working for this company until they got away from the core values of the retail business by removing all the parts and accessories and going more into the wireless business.  This action disappointed a lot of my customers and caused many to stop shopping at our stores.  That is why they are where they are today.
good,"A typical day at work consists of checking the stores number and personal rankings. Throughout my time at RadioShack, I've learned that I have a passion for selling and customer interactions. The store manager has trained me to become an assistant manager. He is known throughout our district as one the top ""Manager-Producing"" managers. I've worked at this current location for 15 months and I've worked with over 10 different employees. This is due to the stress that a sales job puts on some people. I've learned that if you follow the tools management provides us with, the job becomes less stressful. At times during slow months the job becomes extremely difficult but when the quantity of sales isn't present, one needs to focus on the quality of sales. my most enjoyable part of the job would be selling phones. I'm very comfortable offering and selling phones to customers."
good,I learned so much about electronics and sales techniques at this job. I felt like I really caught on quickly and took a lot away from this job.
good,It was great to go to work each day helping customers with what they would be needing
good,loved the job just not the pay. co-workers were great people to work with. The manager was awesome and fun to be around.
good,"Typical day:"
good,"A typical day at work, while working for Radio Shack included assisting both target and radio shack customers, informing customers about new phones and completing sales, and ensuring  that customers were satisfied with the phone of their choice. The management their was pleasing but it just was not as organized as i thought it should have been. The hardest part of the job was simply persuading people to upgrade or even buy a new phone from our company. The most enjoyable part was working with different people each and everyday because i am an overall people's person.."
good,"customer based environment, fun to work.  normally you would be engaging with customer to meet monthly Phone sales, and other expectations. Co-workers were fun and out going learned to train new additions to our stores team to be more out going and engage in sales strategies. Store sometimes got very busy and it was difficult to try to maintain a balance between customers and keeping up with inventory and keeping items on the correct pecks being that customers would often move them around. My manager was not the most productive manager tho I respected her as my manager she would constantly be on the phone with friends and would always have her personal friends and or boyfriend in the office making it uncomfortable to eat lunch or other necessities the office was used for.  "
good,Great company with strong values. Exciting store to work for. Great employee programs. Distirct leadership and Regional management not very focused on store level.
good,"RadioShack has changed over the years, less radios, more cell phones. This is mainly a sales position in which you must meet a sales goal to keep your job. If you pay attention and work hard you can learn a lot from the few ""Classic RadioShack"" customers that still frequent the store. The most enjoyable part of the job is the people you get to work with. Because you are working with such a small group of people, you get to know everyone pretty well and make some lasting friendships."
good,"This job has installed many values in regards to sales and management. Dealing with such a wide range of people, including employees and customers, has prepared me for any situation in the work place."
good,Always stayed busy; even when my part of my job was finished. Too many hours. (Never get off on time)
good,A lot of angry costumers are hard to deal with when they don't understand something. But once you get the information through to them it's quite easy to explain. Every day was a surprise.
good,Interact with customers
good,I started as a general sales / wireless sales associate and moved up to a key holder with the same responsibilities as the previous job title.
good,"Radioshack was a very fun job to work at, the pay was good if you could sell."
good,"Typical day usually starts with checking for important emails from the District Manager which is followed by cleaning and facing products on shelves. Usually we try to sneak in updating a panel of products if we can. Customers usually keep us busy though. Management is fair and understanding as well as easy to reach and talk to. Coworkers are like a second family, and there is never any tension or drama (such as coworkers dating, or unfair treatment, etc etc). Hardest part is defusing a tense situation between a customer (or customers) and a coworker. The most enjoyable part is knowing that I made someone's day."
good,"Radio Shack requires you be flexible to meet its scheduling needs. Pay can be good, but when I worked for The Shack, it cut way back on commissions during the holiday season."
good,"As manager, the day starts with a small amount of paperwork and following up on the previous day's sales. After that, the fun part of engaging new people starts. Sprinkle a few more papers to sign, a manager call here and there, and a few tasks like handling payroll and making schedules, and you have a well rounded job that keeps you on your toes!"
good,make sure store shelvings were stocked up and help customer with finding what they needed. management was good . my job title was sales which also included checking in inventory that came in. the over all job was very fun and fast pasted which was enjoyable
good,I liked the people and the job. The quotas and comission was very fair and everyone was treated equal.
good,"I enjoyed working at Radioshack because we are trained to be a well-rounded person....but Retail business is struggling and they have been doing a lot of different programs which I don't mind but urged me to look for a stable job, if the programs will not eventually work. I am also hoping to use my accounting skills and trying to find a company where I can grow old with and will give me professional growth."
good,Radio Shack is a company focused in the changes of the market. They react very quickly to the trends. They had great communications in all levels. Give the tools the employees need to be successful.
good,"RadioShack was a great company to work for, where it help me provide great customer service and great sale development skills. When having any questions or needing help they made sure there was someone knowledgable and well inform of the company."
good,It liked working there but if you are not a good sales person it was not a place for you. The company pushed cell phone sales and you could loss your job over not making enough sells.
good,excelente cuando trabaje en esta empresano tengo ninguna queja
good,Radio Shack was a fun place to work. Flexible hours easy to request time off. The management I had was great except for the DM. They could have paid better. Employee culture was great and we all supported each other.  They mostly pushed for cell phone sales.
good,"I was a very good salesman at Radio Shack and loved working there for most of my time with the company.  I was trained to be knowlegable with the products and how to deal with customers.   "
good,While I enjoyed working for Radioshack they have gone bankrupt. So finding an actual open store is very limited. They are now owned by sprint so i recommend trying that route.
good,"Day focused around selling and upselling to customers. I gained proficincies in technology which had proved invaluable. My manager at the time was an excellent example of a motivator,instructor, and salesman. The competition fostered between associates was always friendly but still kept us at the top of our game. The hardest part was the days when selling was poor. The best was when their was lots of success."
good,"As a Store Manager at RadioShack for over twenty years, I was able to adapt and appreciate all the skills that I have attained from my lengthy experience. During the process, I have learned to handle different types of needs of customers and to find beneficial solutions for every conflict. While adapting, the most difficult part of the process was learning to manage an entire store, however, after learning about the job position in depth, I was able to overcome all the new responsibilities and became significantly adaptable."
good,Great job with wonderful hours .they closed the store I was working at . Due different condition I would still be there . The best work space to with.
good,"RadioShack was an enjoyable work environment, with a relaxed staff that was always available to help customers and each other. I think the hardest part of the job was dealing with customers who want to get everything on Amazon."
good,"RadioShack was a good place to work for. There was a lot to learn with the products that we had to offer and within the job itself. There was room to grow in the company, but the second bankruptcy unfortunately took a large toll on the company and all of the wonderful workers"
good,The company had some financial issues which lead to its closing but  it was a great work environment with plenty of new things to learn about and opportunities to move up the company latter.
good,"Very relaxed work environment. My personal store manager is amazing and very approachable. Corporate associates are daft and make terrible decisions. The new CEO is running the store into the ground, though it had great potential."
good,"A typical day at work is greeting customers and assisting them with their electronic needs."
good,"It was an excellent experience, great for learning and to make money, develop different skills and career advancement."
good,"Investigated all customer freight and freight claims, including settlements and denials.  Replied to all customer emails, letters and answered all calls.  Worked mostly independently, very little supervision.  Also answered customer complaint letter to the Attorney General Office and BBB.  Support for internal departments like legal, compliance, media relations, customer service and many other departments.  Maintained data bases."
good,Es un trabajo pesado pero en donde aprendes a atender al cliente y en donde tienes que esforzarte para tener mas ganancias
good,Typical day at work is one of relaxation due to the environment of students asking for assistance. I have learned that most students only have in mind one solution and before they leave the establishment they will have excessive amounts of information about their problem.
good,"I would open the store, count down cash box to make sure it was at its proper amount to start the day with, help customers to find product and also answer questions on the sales floor. Answer phones to also help customers with questions about product, look it up on the computer if I couldn't find the correct answer for them, Clean throughout the day, stock shelves, manage store."
good,"Loved working for company, never had any issues. As a PT i did lack the hours desired but came to the conclusion of the more sales i did the more hours i got as well as recognition. Moved up the ladder at a very fast pace."
good,"This is a place where you know you will have a challenge every day waking up. The job is difficult but rewarding."
good,The only reason I went to Radio Sack was to have a better balance between work and family. One of the better things that could have happened to me was working at Radio Shack. The district manager I had was excellent mentor and leader.
good,"I started as temporary Christmas help, where we sold more cars annually (RC of course) than GM, Ford, Toyota & Chrysler combined, and we did it within a three month period.  I have many long lasting relationships with friends and coworkers still to this day!  Work-hard and if you don't mind your personal Christmas in mid January, a perfect fit!  End of year bonus's based on your commissionable sales (Management) allows you to control your own destiny.  I enjoyed the training and still troubleshoot from the modules learned here.  I was a senior leaders club manager prior to leaving the company in pursuit of my own business or I'd still be there!"
good,Radioshack constantly changes things and the company is doing a downward spiral. Feel like the security of my job.
good,"El lugar de trabajo muy agradable horario fijo de lunes a viernes, aprendi en general sobre los CEDIS mis compañros muy agradables, me gusto mucho el area de inventarios y atencion a clientes internos externos y preveedores, en general el recibo de mercancia."
good,"GREAT place to work. can advance far if you work hard enough. Your work ethic is noticed and tallied regional VPs and up the corporate ladder do pay attention, and will offer further advancement. Only real problem that I had with this company was the pay."
good,The typical day involves assisting customers with their electronic needs also maintaining the stores sales appeal by making sure tags are properly placed and correct sales tags are displayed and correct every once in a while you might have to rearrange the stores products    to make room new products or products being taken off the shelves. Setting up cell service assisting with cell issues.  If you are looking for a job also with flexible hours then Radioshack is good for you because you can work with your manager with a schedule that suits your needs especially if you are a college student or single parent.  Benefits could def use some improvement.  Co Workers are usually friendly could get some bad apples due to it being a commission driven job.  This company love promoting from within so within a matter of months one can go from sales associate to a store manager
good,Nice place to work in with very accommodating colleagues. The only hard thing here is you have to always be updated on mobile phones where competition among communication providers quite significant. Management gives full support to sell its product through staff training and advertisement and great deals on the store.
good,"Working at Radioshack has been an absolute blast! I genuinely love coming into work because no two days are ever the same. We do have our local customers who we build relationships with, however, we also assist a bevy of new customers every single day and with that comes brand new experiances. I usually hover around our sales associates when I am on the sales floor making sure they are maximizing all opportunities and making sure they are using all the proper methods to maximize customer satisfaction. I carry out role-plays with my associates to keep them sharp, and I also coach them to make sure they are up to date with products and prices. The hardest part of my job is that unfortunately we cannot please every single customer, there are times that we have to follow store policies and the customers at times do not understand. The most enjoyable part of my job is that I meet new people every single day, I work with a great staff and I welcome the challenge to make sure they are all well informed and fully equipped to assist customers."
good,"Radioshack es una empresa en la cual puedes tener buenos ingresos y un desarrollo labral, es muy flexible y puede ser muy humanista ya que tienes trato directo con los jefes"
good,fun place and make you aware of how to treat customers and products that you were not familiar with before
good,"Se aperturaba tienda siempre antes de10 minutos era  una de las normas de la empresa, aprendi mucho acerca de tecnologia , audio y video , siempre estabamos en constante capacitacion  ya que estabamos expuestos siempre a evaluaciones por personas externas contratadas por radioshack, mis compañeros siempre estaban dispuestos a dar lo mejor en cuanto al servicio  teniamos intervalos de 15 min para descansar durante el dia , aparte del horario del refrigerio, la parte mas dificil era dar solucion a detalles tecnicos del producto , pero al final terminaban agradeciendonos ya que le dabamos solucion a  sus  dudas o quejas , algo que nunca olvidare es que siempre  nos hacian saber es  que el cliente era lo primero y  tenia la razon aunque nosotros pensemos lo contario ...."
good,The company overall isn't the best company but for a young person looking to make a better pay than just minimum wage was great. By the far the best manager i could ever ask for. The best co workers. It was a complete unified nation.
good,"Radio Shack was a great place for me to work. I was able to use my sales skills, as well as my management skills. The store manager there was very intelligent and capable, and utilized my skills to his, and the store's advantage. I worked there while I was a student at Musicians Institute, and my schedules never conflicted."
good,"It's a great place to work and learn salesmanship. It's energetic, sales driven and time can go by pretty quickly. "
good,I enjoyed working with Radio Shack. Very small cozy place to work. I learned a lot about electronics and their innerworkings. I loved the meetings when ever there were new products coming out. Over all I enjoyed staying up to date with new products and services. 
good,"I loved working for this company, fast paced , challenging."
good,Learned how to create and keep a good customer base by following a very thorough guideline on how to engage the customer.
good,Learned awesome sale tactics and helped me better at my customer service skills.
good,It was a great opportunity that gave me the opportunity to enhance my communication and customer service skills. I enjoyed working with such a supportive team of employees and a strong management as the backbone.
good,"Working for RadioShack was great, until they closed the stores i was managing, the Company was going in another Direction."
good,* A typical day is usually busy: doing planograms and cleaning the store when your not helping customers and always learning something new.
good,A typical working day would be face to face customer service with all different kinds of people. Certifications in various store merchandise. Co-workers and Supervisor were great people to work with.
good,A great place to work to help customers
good,"When you're looking for security and stability, Radioshack is a good choice. It was a great job."
good,"I really liked my co-workers at Radio Shack. Everyone is always helping,giving a sale to a co-worker a sale when, I have made my sales for the month.my managment team was ok she wasn't really there when i was. I learned a lot about phones,tv,mp3 players. I pods and a lot of other things. i mosted enjoyed selling phones and showing people how they worked."
good,"A typical day of work was quite busy. I answered incoming calls from radioshack stores nationwide that had issues processing wireless phone transactions. In the wireless department I learned an extensive amount of knowledge regarding their P.O.S system, and how to properly insure stores understanding of how to correctly process transactions."
good,"I have worked for the Radio Shack Corporation for just over three years now (at my current store located in East Setauket, NY as well as a store which is located in Roosevely Fields Mall, in Garden City, NY). Since my hiring, I have moved up the ranks from Sales Associated (part time and then to full time) to Store Manager in Training, I have even been offered two stores to manager (the East Setauket store and the East Patchogue store; both of which I declined because I was currently enrolled in school and could not balance managing a store and taking graduate level courses). I have learned so much from working for this company, about electronics, about recruting and hiring techniques, about what is involved in becoming a great employee rather than just a good one. The most enjoyable thing about my job is being commended on a job well done by my superiors, at least once in a while. That kind of commendation is always leaves me with an uplifting feeling which does motivate me to keep up with the good work. The hardest part is trying to meet goals some months which seem difficult to achieve, especially since the East Setauket store is so small. Even so, my manager, my team and I always seem to pull through when it comes down to what needs to be done."
good,"I always had a good time when i went into work. I enjoyed the job, enjoyed helping people and working with the public. I enjoyed working with and around electronics."
good,"I worked at RadioShack in an era before the iPhone and before everyone and their mother depended on the internet in some way shape or form. I would sell stereos to Mexicans, cell phones to elderly russian people, and tried to convince people of the importance of owning a laptop in 2005. Before everyone had iPods we had the headphones and accessories but we also had electronic parts like breadboards, LEDs, potentiometers and resistors. RadioShack catered to the tinkerer who could build a computer from the ground up but the complexity of technology was moving far beyond the average everyday consumer. But management was solid, co-workers were good people and the most annoying part was the instructional videos all the associates had to watch."
good,A typical day was filled with fun.
good,"Helped customers with their needs whether it be a product they were buying or something they brought in from home for us to fix. Had to offer wireless to every customers. That's how we made most of our commission was selling Verizon, At&t, and Sprint. If new planograms were out, we had to update wall panels and merchandise. Also, we had to make sure every product was priced and filled empty pegs. When my manager was not working I had to verify with associates what goals were for the day and sales that needed to be hit. I also, did over-shorts which is counting the drawer and did deposits. We had to accept orders which normally was about 10 boxes, put merchandise out, then break down the boxes. Anything that was already out we had to stock in the back room. At the end of every night we had to vacuum, take out trash, and make sure windows and counters were clean."
good,I loved working here and getting rewarded for reaching sales goals and receiving bonuses for selling cell phones. My supervisor allowed us to sell and help in our own way and was always around if we had questions. I loved working here!
good,"I was the manager which allowed me to build my team at my Radioshack location. We established goals and worked hard to achieve our goals and make our month year over year. The company also provided a good work to life balance which is very important, and the products we offered our customers seemed to be very reliable. Overall great experience, and fun."
good,I loved this place. I started as a sales associate with in 6 months had my own store. I took this store to over 1 million in sales. I ran many more stores and grew each of them year over year. I was then choose to do the District Leader training . I left  the company as a District Leader. i will say this company taught me everything from P&L training to how to run your own Business. I have nothing bad to say....
good,"My experience at Radio Shack was very positive. I made pretty decent money for retail sales! Cell Phone spiffs added up quickly and the employee discounts were awesome! Unfortunately, Radio Shack as I knew it doesn't exist anymore."
good,"A typical day at work consist of a lot of intranet computer work finding whatever customers need.  Your on your feet a lot, so it pays off to have good shoes. Employees must be kind and friendly to clients.  Employees must be able to answer all customers needs pertaining to the stock that Radio Shack carries."
good,"Good place to work, Weekends are aRequired 3 out 4 weeks of the month.  You only make good money if you earn comission. Most of the store are now owned by franchises."
good,Gran lugar de trabajo. Podía hacer tiempo y terminarlo luego. La gerencia era excelente.
good,"Opportunity to get sale experience. Learn how to deal with customers in the proper manner. Buliding the basket, making our customers know what we have to offer also to provide maximum growth for our company."
good,Loved my manager the job was fun enjoyed the customers.  The workers u worked with were nice and it was an awesome opportunity
good,"I had a great job here as store Manager, I started this job as a sales rep and moved through the ranks very quickly. I made very good friendship here that have lasted a lifetime, I loved being a store Manager the responsibility was worth it I was able to give mt daughter and I a great living, the Company is great with family and the responsibilities that go along with raising a family as a single parent."
good,There aren't too many left but it was a great work place. Learned a lot there. From cell phones to computer components to home theater systems setups.
good,the job was selling cell phones and plans to customers and customer service. laid back selling environment. management supportive. flexible schedule
good,Opening the store counting the cash register approving manager daily reports insuring all stock received has been put out
good,"My job was great honestly I worked with great people . My team was a great team we always helped eachother with customers calls , cleaning anything that was needed . The hardest part of my job was when customers wanted a item and we didn't have it and we could do anything about it because some of them was not in stores anymore they used ti get really upsets and they hardest part was that we couldn't do anything about it"
good,"I worked at Radio Shack for four years total.  I was assistant manager for two years, and manager for 2 years.  I enjoyed working there. "
good,I would be the cashier and do inventory as well putting items on the shelf.
good,"I love having to work with the new technology, that we get in daily, I give that an a+! The management here is very understanding about mostly everything. My coworkers, I love them, theyre the ones who make work fun and interesting, with all the knowledge they all know. The hardest part is telling customers, "" we dont carry that anymore"". The face they give you makes you want to have what they need in-store."
good,"Store Manager "
good,"a typical day at work:Being a sales manager, I sell also act as a sales rep plus do cleaning, scheduling, etc"
good,"RadioShack is a great company to work for, especially if you have a passion for costumer service.  The management and coworkers are exceptional people as well.  The pay isn't what keeps me coming to work.  It's the customer.  Being able to help someone really gives me joy."
good,Loved working here great pay & benefits. Endless advancement opportunities. 
good,"It is fun to go everyday to work and encounter yourself with a diversity of personalities to deal with. Making sales and connecting with the public is really challenging, but fun."
good,"All in all, the company was well worth the time. The only complaint I have for it, would be the decrease in commission pay. Considering where I live, it wasn't enough to cover cost of everyday living expenses. That, and the frequent company changes & innovations. I'm all for change, but too much at once is ridiculous."
good,"I was able to move up in the company fast. I went from associate to assistant manager in 6 months and then I was a manager after a year and a half of working there. They will train you whenever you need it, if you need to travel they will compensate you and we had meetings to make sure you had all the help you needed to run your store. I wish they didn't go out of business because I would love to work there again."
good,"this job was the most chill, laid back job, i love electronics and technology and helping people that had questions about it was just a bonus. everytime you sell a phone you also get comission"
good,I began working here and I didn't know where to begin.  My managers continued to believe in me and therefore I tried to be come a student. I recognized my potential and I grew. I noticed that the customers that came inside were loyal customers that have been coming there for years which said a lot about my managers. It provided a comfortable healthy environment for me to enjoy and have fun inwhile maintaining a professional work environment.
good,"made life long relationships with customers and coworkers."
good,My work day would start and I was still in training so I didn't get to see how it functioned properly. The work was very laid back and the store was kept organized. hardest part for me was getting used to the cash register. most enjoyable was when I was able to organize the merchandise.
good,"good company to work for, you always get train. The most enjoyable part of the job is team member, every one help you out when you needed."
good,Small Work Environment Were My Coworkers Are More Like Family Also learned how to sell AT&T SPRINT and VERIZON phones and services
good,I enjoyed going to work everyday. I got along with everybody.
good,"A typical day at work for me would be greeting customers as they come into the store. Also, I work on the keep up of store's appearance by doing whatever is assigned to me by my manager. The management at Radio Shack are wonderful. They make it easy to work with and always have an open door policy. The hardest part of my job is overcoming the obstacles of customers who think that Radio Shack is a little ""pricey."""
good,"Every day started and/or ended with paperwork. I started off as a sales associate and just advanced as I learned more. My co-workers were awesome, I really enjoyed meeting a lot of them. I was sent to Texas for manager training and that was an experience itself. The hardest part of my job came when I lost some employees and was working open to close every other day. It seemed like a lifetime for as long as it lasted, but I tried my hardest to keep it interesting. I honestly loved my job, I liked and enjoyed everything about it."
good,"typical sales environment, we had to demo everything we sold which led to some great antics with romote controlled toys and plug and play games"
good,"I enjoyed my customers and building up a larger customer base through caring and good customer service."
good,The store closed down so that’s why I had to give it up because I was gone be becoming the store manger there . I loved the job we got paid hourly plus commission and I even got commission for my workers sells also and I always wanted them to push the sells of the week
good,"I gained most of my customer service skills here and also a bunch of payroll. I learned a lot about sales and cellular activations, I learned how to be competitive. I was hurt when they went bankrupt"
good,Maybe not be a little bit so laid-back train management better instead of just having them watch videos on a computer to train them train them hands-on I have management travel to see new products that you can keep in your store
good,"This was a great company to work for while they were in business, but they are no longer in business. Sales bonus's were huge, commission structure was honest and the people for the most part were great to work with. "
good,"You have to have great communications skills when working here. Being able to sell your products is a must. Commission is great but if you're a shy person, this isn't the place for you."
good,great and fun environment to work. shame the stores had to close. the staff seemed to come and go quite frequently so there were always advancement opportunities
good,I loved working at radio shack as a seasonal employee. Made lots of phone calls. Set up phones. rang up costumers. Helped label tags.
good,Compensation was acceptable. full insurance for a part time job plus a 401K and dental. I liked my Managers.
good,"I loved working for Radioshack, Learning about little parts and other things that we had in stock, always trained every employee to know everything we had in the store and made sure they had great customer service. Had an employee that stole so management had to get rid of him, another employee found out and made a scene, cursed me out and walked out, told district manager and said to let him go, employee was fired when district manager was on vacation, that employee was the district managers best friends son and so happens he started to make my life a miserable for letting him go when he had agreed to it. kept telling me he had shoes older than me and that he put his butt on the line because I was young ""21"" and no one though i could do any good. My store was always #2 in the district in sales. I reported him to hr a few days later he was in my store with another manager and told me to give in my keys and that The regional manager needed to see me, they couldn't fire me because of the investigation but that they were trying to find something to let me go. They talked to my employee's asking them if i was stealing or anything else that could have me fired. they even promised a store to one of my key holders if she lied. (i know because she told me about and actually had a store and then was let go after a few months.) the district manager was let go after a year i was fired, apparently he was doing that to other employees and was protecting his best friend."
good,"would open store, do scheduling at the end of every weeks as well as perform employee reviews, bank drops, inventory check, weekly orders. hardest part of my job would be all the paper work at the end of the week because my store manager would leave me all his work from the week. the most enjoyable part was having a good rep or with my new and current customers because to me great customer service is everything"
good,"Learned so much while working here, the environment was great. Great job for bilingual people And those who know a lot about technology. If you can't sell don't bother working here, you have to make the sales goals of the day."
good,"This company has now merged with a major cell phone giant -Sprint, as a strategy to keep their company afloat. Previous to this employees had the advantage of earning a minimum wage salary, plus commission benefits, by selling basic electronic equipment up to high end cell phones through non -contract and contractual cell phone plans and services, along with accessories."
good,Making sales is really easy here and it is definitely fast paced setting. I highly recommend if you like multi-tasking and enjoy selling various devices.
good,i enjoyed working here. but once i had gotten my health issues the district manager didnt seem to care. company was always getting new managers nobody really stayed.
good,"loved my job of talking care of 24 radio shack stores and watch banking, hiring and firing people"
good,The environment was fun and the people great. Working for an independent Radio Shack there were no benefits. 
good,"Your day would start out slow and would slowly pick up past...."
good,"Being in management, my day usually begins at 9am.  Start out with sales forecast for the day and track monthly sales to ensure on track.  Counsel sales staff and ensure there questions and needs are addressed.  Maintain profit increase per day and high end inventory counts per day.  Daily interactions with customers and upper management,"
good,One of my favorite places of employement but i feel like a review isnt necessary considering the place doesnt exist at all. So im really just trying to fill the box
good,"Everything was great, I had become assistant manager and finished my managers training in time to take over the store when we got a new district manager and she placed someone who was very under qualified in all areas in the store as the manager. I had a regular associates pay but did ALL MANAGERS TASKS."
good,It's a better place to work if you are fond of cell phones.I was called into work every week and was more then willing to work for people who called out a lot.
good,I want a opportunity to show more and work more. When this company give me the opportunity of working they promote productivity and now don't pay for production.
good,"They are gone now so it does not matter what I say here, however while I did work there it was a decent environment and an ok place to work. The staff was easy to get along with like we were family."
good,I enjoyed the smaller environment because it allowed me to work one-on-one with customers.  The training program was excellent; providing thorough product knowledge and sales techniques.  The commission sales often provided for healthy competition but the low pay scale made it difficult to maintain a productive staff during slow sale periods.  The most difficult aspect of the job was dealing with upper management as their primary focus seemed to sway away from customer satisfaction and more towards profit.  Working one-on-one with customers and hands on with my employees was by far the most enjoyable aspect.
good,You get what you put in if you're active and willing to standout from the rest you are able to advance job security is based on performance and team members availability to benefits is not very good
good,The RadioShack we grew up with no longer exists.  A new company - General Wireless has purchased the rights to the Name. I have an incredible love for the old company. I am not sure of the the future plans for the newly created company and I am no longer a part of the process and the plan.
good,"A very fast pace job were your always moving and working , but great co-workers and management. There is a small room for advancement due to not having a high turnover rate."
good,I liked working here because every day was something different. You get to meet new people and the regular customers and it was a great feeling being able to help the tech illiterate people. I learned how to deal with a customer that was impatient or just rude. My coworkers were the best and made the day go by even faster while still being productive. the hardest part of the job was nothing because it was an easy going environment. The most enjoyable part of the job was the big sales because that meant a bigger check.
good,"Typical day is trying to meet and surpass my sales goals not too happy with the people i work with but i don't allow it to stop my work. I learned even more how to prioritize and maximize sales, as well as more sales techniques. The hardest part of my job is enjoying what I do so much and not having the hours that I want or the compensation I feel I should be getting considering the responsibilities and duties expected of me. The most enjoyable part is doing what I've always known and loved doing selling!"
good,"I would assist customers with clothing and home decor. I made the daily deposits and completed the paper work, assisted with inventory every 6 months. My co-workers was very friendly and caring. I loved the enviorment I worked in. My manager was understanding and a great role model.  "
good,Its an interesting job for most people it will always depend on how you like what your doing for others and yourself. Not every job is the same the work eviorment is great managment is always there to help you or other in anyway they can.
good,Buen trabajo en equipo con los compañeros y jefes.
good,It may be out of business but it was the best job I've ever worked at. It was slow morning's and night but there's always that one person who walks in right when the doors are being shut.
good,Hands on dealing with customers and inventory. Had a great time with the crew and helping people solving their problems. Had a great time working in that environment.
good,"Was a wonderful job to have during college, I was able to get some homework done in between helping guests find the right battery. Not much else, they went bankrupt so, idk why this review is needed."
good,"It was a great job until they closed. Fun to work there and solve customers problems, great people skills needed and upselling a must. I would have worked there forever"
good,I had a great time working for Radio Shack and will miss working there. It was a fun  job and the products were great. The customers were a big part of the fun.
good,"As a GM of RadioShack, it was an amazing experience building quality relationships while having the opportunity to grow with the company. I would've been so happy if they hadn't of gone out of business."
good,It was an awesome experience but the hours were crazy and alot of things go enhanced when we stop having att and Verizon our business started to slow down and eventual went out of business
good,It was amazing learning different knowledge in new electronics and just learning more stuff about technology and learning how to use certain things that will help you in all aspects in work fields computer skills
good,This was a salesman's job and paid on compensation of sales made. It was a satisfying employment to use my electronic knowledge to help customers make wise purchases.
good,Radio Shack was a great place to work.  I learned a great deal from working at a very progressive company.  I regret that it did not survive and continue to thrive.
good,Managers were awesome.  Regional and district managers were fun to work for.  Best part of the job was the friendships made during my time there.  Too bad they went out of business.
good,Good job that provided oppurtunites for advancement and learning new skills. Team oriented atmoshpere and very goor employee benfits. Safe working enviroment
good,"A typical day was making out orders, and checking off orders almost daily but you were never bored which was a good thing."
good,"Full Time Wireless Sales Expert"
good,"Hard to write a review on your own Franchise Business. Learned the retail trade from managing people, ordering product, marketing the business to the consumers, learning the product for 12+ years. It was an enjoyment to help the customers get the right solution for the problem they were having. I worked long hours from 7 am to 6 pm 6 days a week. It was hard to lose the lease on the building and to decide to close the business. It would have been very expensive to move to another location and based on the current sales we were having it just didn't pencil out to continue on in a new location."
good,"floor sales and ring up customers, always upset on new products and move older items n clearance. Customer service with a smile and going above and beyond"
good,Loved working here. Liked the pay and training as well. Customers were friendly and so was management and the employees. Would recommend as a place to work at.
good,A new way to enter the sales business.  Always learning and adapting to new sales procedures.  Always new products and aftermarket products to learn and sell
good,Working in the corporate office was a great experience for me. Lots a great people. Everyone was always so helpful and made the environment very friendly.
good,"As long as you sell, you could make ALOT of money. They paid commission with hourly which allowed you to make huge amounts of money and not pay extra taxes. At 25 hours a week I was making 800 dollars AFTER taxes."
good,"Radio Shack was a great job"
good,spent most of my days organizing my cell phone wall and setting up phone plans for new and existing customers who are in store to upgrade and buy new devices.
good,easy fun job that gives you basic sales man skills. the company just did not want to adjust to mondertimes.some managers did care and some did not it was a job where you did not take seriouse if u did not care.
good,"Radio shack was great especially for nerdy people such as my self, however the pay was pretty low and it was just a dead end sales clerking job. I left when I moved. Radio shack is now closed for good every where"
good,Over the air that I have work I would have to say my review on them as that is a very fast pace clean organized could be professionally ran but some people slip through the cracks. Learned a lot while working there along with some new friends so that's a was a good experience overall
good,i hate these things how many do i have to do to just let me go on they are closed were good to work at the bosses were good they vared about theere  employes
good,"Radioshack is an awesome environment to work at! it literally always has the world's coolest tech geeks on the planet as their employees, and you will normally end up having a great conversation with them."
good,"Fun work environment, if you love helping people out this is the job for you, I was able to learn mire about electronics by the paid training they provided"
good,It was a good job with lots of commissions and pretty much super easy got to play with electronics all day and not do much real work at all total pie job to the fullest.
good,i use to love coming in every day to help people out with there electronic devices. i learned to order store product and how to ship it out. i also learn how to activate phones and tables through the companies they were with.
good,A typical day a work was exciting and educational. Having the opportunity to listen to your customers concerns and designing a solution and leaving them satisfied and confident was my daily goal.
good,The Radio Shack I was working at was one of the last privately owned dealer stores.  We handled everything from home to industrial electronics.  I am not going to add much to this review because the experience I had there is likely nothing like the work experience someone would get in a corporate store these days.
good,Greeted and Interacted with Customers providing solutions to their electronic needs. Maintained inventory of sales floor ensuring customers had access to full selection of products. Reorganized and displayed products as per cooperates instructions.
good,Work here was sweet. Bring a sales associate I was making my own money off of my sales so 5hat definitely was the good part about being there. And everyone was friendly.
good,"Like any retail job you have good days an not so good days, pleasant customers and not so pleasant customers. It was satisfying to have a customer come in the store with a problem and been able to offer a solution."
good,They train you very well an take the time to call you back..great hour..good place to work an learn different thing..the best thing about the job is to work with people who is concerned about you an your family.
good,Loved working here paychecks every two week was 600 which was great to help me pay off my bills very customer friendly took time with each customer to help them with what they needed or guided them in the right direction of the product they were looking for.
good,I enjoyed working as a sales associate at Radioshack.  I have always loved electronics and I enjoyed helping people select the right products for their needs.
good,I enjoyed working for radio shack nice and clean work space good team of associates overall everyday i learn something new everyday teaching customer about  product information how can I get the customer a better deal the culture was wonderful many different  races of people it was fun learning different languages .Hardest part was commuting everyday trains were not working as good but i made it my business to leave early for work
good,Radio shack no longer exists. Writing a review is pointless but apparently I'm required to do it to move on so here's 20 words
good,Worked in the warehouse unloading trucks and palletizing merchandise. Everyone worked together as team. There was really nothing hard about the job. Most enjoyable part of the job was working with the team.
good,Professional and structured work environment. Great management and support to sales staff. Achievable goal structure for sales staff to achieve. Would still be there if the store did not close.
good,This technology filled company was such and enjoyable experience. The will for upper management to train associated to be able to obtaining a management position was impeccable.
good,"I loved this job, i loved selling phones and gadgets and electronics, and answering peoples questions. There is nothing else to say except i am sad they went out of business."
good,Great company. Awesome crew. Great pay. Very flexible. Never a dull moment always something to do. You can advance pretty quickly.
good,"Fun job. great manager terrible corperate. rarely saw our reps. but its a completely different business now."
good,I gradually worked my way up in positions. Had a lot of fun working here. Met great friends. Customers loved every part of the store. Learned a lot about the cellular BUISNESS.

good,Just had to meet sales goals.. and hope you don't get robbed almost every other night but I think it got better...
good,Typical day at work was usually an introduction to a new product. Knowing about every new product was important to the job. I learned that there are many innovative products that customers can use to make life easier for them. Management was very aware of his employees and their knowledge of every product in the store.

good,technology enriched environment. Learn new things from extensive everyday use of technology. Management was very friendly and involved everyone as a team meet daily quotas. co-workers were eager to talk about anything related to the newest and future technological advances.

good,RadioShack was an interesting place to work at simply because we dealt with electronics. I learned something new everyday at work and I was excited to go to work.

good,Radio Shack was a great place to work.  Enjoyed assisting customers and employees through out my tenure. Each day was always different.  New and returning customers.
good,It was a job I still drive by and see closed down and remember the years spent there. It taught me everything I know about customer compassion and doing what it takes to make a solution from any problem. I'd work there again if given the chance.
good,Radio Shack was a great place to work. Fast paced. Competitive. If you thrive off commission... it was worth being a Wireless Consultant.

good,The company is a very fast paced environment that requires a lot of technical know how. You learn a lot about how to sell electronics and cellphones.

A typical day entailed greeting a customer and completing and surpassing their needs.

After my many accomplishments in sales goals i was the go to guy for every sales associate and became very known. the most difficult part of the weeks was no time off for family and affairs due to the high demand in assistance for management. I really enjoyed helping customers in their time of need it gives great satisfaction of helping others.
good,When it was open I loved working for the company. The team I worked with were all eager to learn. I honestly think if it wasn’t for the management I had I wouldn’t have stayed there as long as I did

good,"Buen ambiente laboral en general, un poco cuadrados para procesos"
good,"The environment here was great but the crew was close-knit and really supportive. The job itself can be challenging, learning all the merchandise and getting used to the sales floor. Employee discounts were decent but the pay was too low to survive"
good,"A typical work day at Radio Shack is either fast paced or slow paced. It depends on the day. I learn a lot from various of customers about the product I am not too familiar with. The workplace is great and entertaining. Believe it or not many different foreigners come in because they go to school in New Paltz, so I get to talk to some customers and learn about their country. The only hard part about the job is telling someone we don't something in stock and they get mad at me for it. Other than that, Radio Shack is great!"
good,Although Radioshack went bankrupt. It was a decent experience working in their retail store. I had an awesome manager whom worked with our schedules if we had another job. And our scheduling was based on our performance which gave us the incentive to do our best each day.
good,"Outstanding benefits and support with the right Leadership. Direction provided and creativity encouraged in the position of Director. Unfortunately, the wrong CEO's were hired that lead to demise of the company in the 2000's."
good,I loved my store and being a manager I was able to really makes things flow nicely and bring up sales. when they say you make your own paycheck they aren't kidding!  You have to sell cell phones if you want to make anything. I was in a bad situation my regional manager was stealing from his stores and blaming managers. many were fired and many left over this incident.
good,Great place to work. Good people. Very sad it is closed. They take very good care of their employees and even had pinic's for families to attend. Monthly safety bonus was great.

good,Operations were akways key in Radio Shack way of life. Knowing your inventory and what products are in stock gave you more information on delivering what the customer wanted.
good,"I feel like there was too much work load for the low pay rate. I am all for reaching sales goals and doing the work, but they could pay more. I was discriminated against advancement due to being friends with someone that management did not get along with."
good,"Each day I went to work, I needed to be on my game as an associate and an IT professional. Each time a customer came in, it was my duty to help find and understand what they needed to fix the problem they were faced with. My co-workers were all excellent at their jobs whether it was for sales or for figuring out the best solution for the customer. The hardest thing that I have to do at work is handle that I will soon have to leave the shop and find a new place of work."
good,"9-6 talking to customers and helping with technical problems"
good,"work was always a fun place, but also intriguing.  A customer would come in trying to build a project or fix something that was around there house and they would kind of know what they were looking for but not sure, so I would show the customer a couple options that they had and kind of educate them on what they were looking for and the other options that they had.  The managers were always fun to work with they would assign everybody a goal for the week and would help us when we were not sure about how to do something so it was a good balance of help as well as education on what we needed help with.  Co-workers were fun to work with and we would find ways to help pass the time at work by stocking or doing inventory.  I cant really put a finger on anything that could make the job difficult.  and the most enjoyable part of the job would be helping customers find something they didn't know existed that would help them complete a project or to educate the customer on something they show interest in"
good,"Enjoyed it, loved the experience. A typical day as an associate is fairly easy. We offered protection plans and batteries to every customer, we made sure the customers were happy, as Management it was my job to ensure everyone was offering all of our products to ensure customers happiness. We had time to talk and enjoy ourselves it was a great environment. I met so many people and built so many relationships with repeat customers it has been great. The hardest part of the job was the hours however."
good,I performed several different types of work. I installed and serviced Dish Network and Directv systems. I installed and serviced Hughes Net satellite internet systems and TXOL wireless internet which is located in Radio Shack. There was something different everyday and the learning never stopped which made it a great job!
good,had awesome coworkers and liked working there. I enjoyed interacting one on one with the costumers but wish it was a little bit more fast paced. My hardest part in this job was trying to get to my goals but with my coworkers as a team we would always achieve every goal.
good,A typical day at work would start off coming in turning on all the TV's and reading updates on any new phones that may have come out that day or the day before. I learned how to be a great sales associate and customer service rep. Our management made sure we had fun on the job and with our customers to make them feel comfortable and welcome. We all had great team work and even better friendship. The best part of the day was helping our customers find everything they wanted and watching them leave with a smile on there face.
good,"On a typical day at work I communicate with management on what my daily goals are in order execute them. Throughout my experience at work I have learned that the more I know about the products the better I can service each and every client that walks through the door. I keep in constant communication with my management team in order to keep up to date on product knowledge, weekly goals and daily focus in order to reach our maximum productivity. My team is a great support system whenever the store is at its busiest point and when it is time to clean and organize at closing hours. If I had to mention what the hardest part of my job is, I would have to say it is traveling to other stores locations to restock on items we are sold out of, as it can be inconvenient since it takes me away from the floor where I feel I serve the business best. However I am grateful over the fact that I get the opportunity to use and learn about the latest gadgets which I have to say is my favorite part of the job."
good,"I loved meeting with the new customers, and seeing familiar faces. I learned a lot about electronics. My manager was awesome, so understanding and willing to teach me anything I had a question about. The co-workers made it an enjoyable place to work at."

good,love the atmosphere and team. learn the newest devices and products early.
good,a day at work is good we all got along my boss was great she understood everything. I learned how to manger a radioshack my boss left for about 2 weeks and I had to take care of the store. mmy co-workers was great we cover eachother shift when they couldn't come in I love the people that work with the money and hours I was putting in was not worth it and place I was getting a car I need to move up.
good,"I loved it at radioshack but they were very unorganized. I got hired about 3 weeks ago, and now they are telling me I might get cut off because they don't have enough hours."
good,Radio Shack was a very fun place to work and we got to learn about a variety of electronics. We had to know a lot about cell phones and be able to assist customers with all their electronic needs.
good,"A typical day at work I would open the store, turn on some music and get the store going at a regular pace. Working at RadioShack I learned a lot about electronics that I never knew before. The management at RadioShack was a bit extra cause the manager was never around to manage the store. I loved my co-workers I could not have asked for better ones. There was not a hard part to the job other than getting questioned about something I had no clue what it was or looked like and the most enjoyable part of the job was that my co-workers made our working hours fun."
good,"I dont deny that Radio Shack played an integral role in the beginning of my sales career, it also taught me alot of the negative aspects of how their business culture was ran, which i personally did not agree with and lead me to leave and find a new position."
good,i enjoyed working here. it was a fast paced family enviroment. the management was friendly and very understanding. the co workers were very knowledgable and family oriented. i felt at home here!!!
good,"i enjoyed my job, worked with great people who helped me learn alot about electronics. i loved helping the customers find the right cel phone that was right for them, the hardest part of my job was keeping up with all the latest electronics that were coming in every week. it was challenging but a great experience !"
good,Requires vast product knowledge
good,Good bonuses if you can sell. Good incentives for benefits if you stay long term.
good,"From creating sales goals to managing stores, this job taught me a great deal about the intricacies of electronics."
good,"I sorted the back room for most of the time, I also helped costomers when they needed it. I learned that there were alot of good and bad days. My co-workers were really good to work with and if I needed help with something they were always there to help. The hardest part of the job was sorting the shelves and the most enjoyable part of the job was being able to work by my self."
good,Everyday at work was quiet not busy and slow.
good,RadioShack was a great company to work for. I enjoyed working for this company. The only reason for me leaving was due to the company closing nationwide.
good,"Radio Shack was a great place to work. They allowed each RLPM to manage their own business. There was autonomy to do what needed to be done without having someone looking over your shoulder. At the end of each week, the work product spoke for itself."
good,"The benefits were great, compensation was above average but lacking for the responsibilities involved.  It was overall a good workplace but company went out of business."
good,closed retail clerk retail manager handeling day to day operations of store and customer support  along with supporting my sales employees to success was a great company until the closing would love to work for a company this positive again
good,"funcion capacitar al personal en tecnicas de venta y conocimiento de producto, el concepto de esta empresa era el ganar -ganar."
good,"Es fácil integrarse una vez que comienzas a trabajar."
good,"Managers were required to work many hours especially during the golden quarter (October through December).  We were constantly changing displays, maintaining our P & L."
good,Typical day at work :
good,Loved every minute working for the company until I had to find more of an advancement and with the future closure in mind that could happen it is sad to see them go.
good,"Not too stressful and pretty evenly paced, Not too fast and not to slow. If you were looking for mainly fuses or anything of that sort, I would recommend you to Radio shack."
good,This was probably one of the best jobs I've ever had! Granted it didn't pay extremely well but the overall atmosphere and the people I had the privilege of working with made it worth while. Management was phenomenal and always there when you needed them. It was truly a tear jerking moment when we closed the doors for the last time and said our goodbyes.
good,I was a floor salesperson at this position helping customers with electronics and phone sales.  this was an ok position.  Not something I had ever done.  I was good at it.
good,"It was a great experience with nice co-workers, good management and a competitive culture. Although I didn’t work there that much I really like the job environment and the people I worked with.  Sadly Radio Shack is no more."
good,"With friendly and supportive management and co-workers. This was a great place to get me started in the retail environment. "
good,I loved my time with Radioshack. It is a chill job and management was usually super nice and willing to work with your schedule. I really miss working here actually.
good,In my time at RadioShack I've had a lot of fun met a lot of great people. The customers or a great we help them find great solutions to many problems. For anyone who likes a fast-paced up-tempo upbeat workplace this is a place for you.
good,"over all this company has provided the skill and abilities to run your own store. maintaining control of loss and profits numbers in order to pursued sails gain and educate employees on sales technics are some of the things that makes radio shack a unique company to work with, complete interaction."
good,"Radio Shack is a fun place to work, however, it is hard to make a living at it. The hours are good, at best. The products are fantastic and the people you meet are great."
good,Great job to work at perks along they way. Great vacation days they work with you. Working for this company made u wanna come to work they were all about their employees and there customers i felt that this company was a great choice I made and I would work for them again of they would have never went out ta business.
good,"Grato ambiete labora, dias bueno como otros muy agitados. jefe muy proactibo y de gran trato."
good,Great if you love selling and talking to customers. Job is not hard as long as you push the sales. The more you sell the bigger your check will be from commission.
good,With constant growth of technology comes new knowledge of products. RadioShack and its employees held a small fraction of the electronics retail industry that educated consumers of new technological innovations.
good,I came into Radioshack not knowing anything about technology to becoming an expert and I feel like if I would have been able to stay I would know a lot more by now. From the few months I worked there I learned a lot about technology and how I can help people find the right equipment for what they need.
good,"Typical day was started with fronting product, putting out sales tags for at-time current promotions. Coworkers were fun to be with made the days better, hardest part of the job was trying to close on time. The most enjoyable part was being able to be successful and number 1 in the district. I hated the new compensation plan, micromanagement, lack leadership, revolving door upper management, and no consistency what so ever"
good,This is a pretty laid back job. It takes a while to learn all the product and the powers that be get annoying when you don't sell specific items; but overall it's pretty easy. I work in a low-volume store so much of my time is spent on my phone.
good,Really liked working here. Small group of employees makes it easier to communicate. the customers are nice and you learn a lot from them. they teach you how to sell which will pay off later.i enjoyed my time here.
good,"I would open the store and count product.  Manager employees work schedules.  Help customers find and understand the product.  You develop many personal skills such as Leadership, customer service, patients, and time management."
good,helped customers with the electronic needs. Management was very flexible with hours and understood school was a must. Coworkers like to help and made sure the customer was happy.
good,"Great place to work at with a great staff. Learned a lot from the company and I am very happy to have started my experience of working, at Radioshack."
good,This was my first job after high school and I loved it. I was a great learning experience and I learned everything at fast and steady pace with a great employee team we worked so well together.

good,"I learned a lot about customer service and Cell phone sales. My Co-workers where the absolute best I've worked with. The hardest part of the job was keeping up with Quotas on sales. The most enjoyable part of the job I'd have to say was the Environment, this by far was the best job I had. I had to leave and move back home to El Paso, TX cause my father was very ill."
good,I had the best District Manager that helped me grow and get promoted to a District Manager myself. The stability with the company is what is making me move on.
good,"We got to play with electronics on our down time (for demonstration purposes) and we received an exemplary employee discount, what's not to like? The job security was poor, as many Shacks closed down nationwide..."
good,daily interactions with customers over the phone and stores looking for items and orders.  Set up installation appointments for Direct TV and training classes.
good,learned about all new technology. management was very professional and efficient. co-workers are friendly and competitive. hardest part of the job is inventory auditing the most enjoyable part of the job is closing more sales the all other staff.
good,"A typical day at the store is one where me and my teammates get to work together to help customers find the phone of their dreams or the items needed to take full advantage of their new products."
good,"As a Sales person and eventually an Assistant manager I was quite happy most of the time working at Radio Shack.  I greatly enjoy assisting people as they are trying to make an informed purchasing decision.  The ability to demystify technology was one of my stronger abilities which made me very happy on the occasion when a Grandparent would come in and ask about something new that their grand-kids were asking for."

good,Well trained employees and a great exciting environment. My co-worker are the best I wouldn't trade them for the world.
good,"everyday is the same. learned the basics of selling. management are pretty strict but can be better. co-workers are very enjoyable, hardest part is to satisfy metrics on a slow day. enjoyable part is exploring the zoo."
good,Was nice having the owners realize that I know electronics and back me up when or if there was any problem. I was with customers most of the time there. Showing them what parts would fit their needs the best. Owners never pushed to sell more expensive items just to have more money in the register. Owners where some of the best people I have ever known and still talk to occasionally today. They treated everyone equally and all the employees could see that they truly cared for them and not just the business.
good,my co workers were humble loving and nice helping customers the hardest part was picking up boxes is hacing poeple to be so nice and  helpful
good,I have learned from this company is to go the extra mile for your customers.
good,"I enjoyed this company most of all. The people were kind the atmosphere was about providing great customer service and having a great time doing it. I was the assistant manager for almost two years. I open and closed the store, stocked shelves and helped with many computer problems for guests."
good,I liked working for radioshack because I learned alot about electronics and I moved up into the company.... It helped me grow as a person and as a manager.
good,I loved the challenge this job had. There was always something new to learned. I loved the clients that would come into Radio Shack. I loved the responsibility that came with the job.
good,"I throughly enjoyed my time at RadioShack. Though we had high goals and busy days, it was a very fun atmosphere. All of the employees, including myself had a regular customer basis who would often ask for us by name. At the store location that I was at, we all worked very well as a team sharing tasks and responsibilites."
good,"Great place to work, pay incredibly low. Need to find a way to secure jobs and pay employees a decent rate"
good,"No day was the same, worked with a great bunch of people, and manager was great.  Not enough hours though"
good,"decent job for a college student who needs money"
good,"A typical day at work would include calling customers that are available to upgrade their phone service, with Verizon; Sprint and at&t. I learned how to work all the cellular services online systems like the back of my hand. I learned how to manage accounts to ensure customers were getting the best service with lowest possible plan they could afford. my coworkers were awesome we helped each other out in many ways when it came to providing the best experience for our customers. the hardest part of the job was none I found the entire job very easy and quick to learn. most enjoyable part of the job was helping my customers set up their brand new devices and show them how to use them and etc."
good,Very laid back and fun to work at. The hardest part was activating phone and how long it took.
good,"Could be seen as stressful to some, very harsh deadlines and quoatas to meet and keep up with."
good,"open store, cut on electronics, do paper work, help out with customers. I learned how to make a schedule, assign tasks to employees. the employees that stayed around where fun to work with they kept the store alive the hardest part of the job was changing the store around  and trying to maintain numbers"
good,I met my best friend and some others...... I made a ton of money it was just great
good,"I loved working here! I got some cool benefits, but it wasnt all that it was cracked up to be. You have to keep your numbers up, but other then that, its a good company!"
good,"A typical day at Radio Shack consists of setting goals and trying to reach them. The goals are based on what the company's goals are at that time. There was strategy and role playing involved to aid in reaching said goals. I learned the importance of doing your best at a performance based job and with the right management, can be very well taken care of. In my time there, I worked under 3 store managers and 2 district managers. Both district managers were excellent and my original store manager was as well. The other 2 in my opinion still needed coaching. The hardest part of the job is keeping up with company standards but is not impossible. They give you the tools to succeed, it's all in how you use them. You build your own paycheck and Radio Shack gives you what you need to make a good one. I very much enjoyed my time with this very wonderful company."
good,"writing up employee reviews, hire/interview new"
good,Great Management and employees fun work atmosphere and also great benefits package
good,"People and managers are great to work with, they truly guide you every step of the way."

good,I enjoyed working there we made commission so that was nice the more you sell the better your pay. It's a very easy job easy to learn and the hours are perfect for someone who is juggling with school and work
good,"Radio Shack WAS a great company to work for, however, the company never advertised their most profitable products; cell phones, TV's, etc. "
good,Radio shack was once a good company to work for but in 2008 they had a upper management change and then drove the company in to the toilet and are no longer in business
good,"first job, learned a lot to prepare me for my next job. learned to activate cell phones. Learned to help customers with needs. radios hack gave me management experience."
good,company is closed.  while is was opened it was a fun and fast paced environment.  Advancement was attainable if you worked hard and had people skills.
good,"I really enjoyed working at Radio Shack, the people employed there were very friendly. A lot of opportunities to learn and grow with the company. There were chances to make extra money by completing training and testing on new products."
good,great for the first 30 years then the company went out of business.The company started closing locations about 4 years ago and now have closed all locations
good,"Productive, fun place and friendly team work,co-operative manager,helpful administration,hard worker staff, motivational work atmospher, have a good, smart vision and missin."
good,Radio Shack was in the process of beginning to close it's stores. I was taught to be a manager there and received exceptional train from my local district manager.
good,It has been too long since I worked there. Im not even sure they are still open they had to close most of their store in that area. But it was a good place to work..
good,Our manager was an air force vet so he kept us really organized and well informed; our district manager also held monthly district information meetings that kept the whole district on its toes; there weren't so many women employed at radioshack in those days so I interviewed with the district manager three times before he hired me! It was great to learn all the electronics in the store to be able to explain them to the customers;;both the manger and asst. manager were ham radio operators and knew a tremendous amount of knowledge that they could teach me plus there were weekly sales that we re-merchandised the store for; There was never a dull moment. The hardest part for me was not being able to sit down all day! And the three month inventories of the complete store!
good,"Radioshack was a great place to work it unfortunately closed down. There was always advancement opportunities, relaxed place to work in not a lot of pressure but everyone needed to focus on our own metrics."
good,Working for radio shack was a rewarding job based  on sales and public opinion.  Customers like customer service as to help the individually to solve their issues of what they needed and would buy.
good,Working here at RadioShack has taught me host skills and helping others with technology in a timely matter. Also enhanced my skills of being a cashier. I loved working with my fellow team members.
good,"Had to travel over night at least 3 days a week."
good,"Before I started at Radio Shack of Canada I knew nothing about electronics."
good,Fun place to work. Allows you to interact and play with new products making it easier to sell. Great store manager. Allowed breaks
good,I really missed working there i was very comfortable with my team and product support we gave to customers loved the one on one service i had with client/customers giving them the best support and understanding of all product
good,"I liked that it was also commission based and that i was helpful to Spanish speaking clients,i also got promoted to Key holder and was left in charge sometimes. Which i liked because it gave me a sense of responsibility and my manager was very friendly and took her time making sure my fellow employees and i were all on the same page, doing the work that needed to be done."
good,"RadioShack is a fun, easy, friendly place to work. Building relationships with customers is easy as long as you are nice and care to their needs. Company is filled with friendly, amazing associates who are easy to get along with and easy to learn from. If you need a job to start at out of high school while you are going to college or just need a job that you can gain customer service experience from, this is the place."
good,Straighten up the store to make sure it is clean for when the customers come in.  The management was very pleasant to work for.  The hours were very flexible.

good,Being a store manager introduced me to lots of skills i can use moving forward. i also got to learn a little about alot of things from selling phones to fixing a radio
good,Positive attitude in the workplace. Good management ideals. Most enjoyable part of the job was helping employees advance in the workplace.
good,"Filed for bankruptcy and let my entire team go. Beyond that, I thoroughly enjoyed the company of my co-workers and leads. Some points in management were rough but beyond that I loved my time at the Radioshack Worldwide Headquarters."
good,Radio Shack has offered me a wonderful work experience in a team environment that can be competitive at times. During my employment I was constantly learning new things about the products we sell and the creative aspects on how these products can be used. I made it a point to stay up to date on the latest and greatest in cellular and technology.
good,"Learning how to repair phones, helping customers and having fun selling. It is a fun place to work with the right team. Any job is fun if you make it fun."
good,"I love helping people find exactly what they need, and at radio shack thats all we did. problem solving is a great skill of mine"
good,Was one of my favorite places to work. I loved the management and the customers
good,I loved working at RadioShack. I learned so much about retail and wireless sales. My store's manager was like a mentor to me and taught me a lot. RadioShack as a company has been struggling and I want to make the transition to wireless sales and to a company who is more stable and more of a challenge.
good,"I've worked with the company for several years and have learned many skills. "
good,"I got my start into the field of electronics through the interest created from working at Radio Shack. Beside the low pay and extreme demand to sale they will always be remembered by me as the place that created my career, and will always be viewed positively by me."
good,The only thing I didn't like was going to Jackson for company meeting and taking tests to learn more about new products.
good,"Everyone was friendly, In all aspects of order pulling, and stocking, packing and inventory control . All aspects of basic warehouse work,I learned how to work well with others.  I also  learned how to follow directions. I don't remember any part of my job being hard."
good,"Overall in the 2 years i've worked at Radioshack i have learned how to have cutting edge customer service and also learn how to deal with many different obstacles requiring problem solving and critical thinking techniques which i have excelled in. I Also have grown as a sales associate providing the customer a complete solution leaving them satisfied and building clientele. I finally have learned a vast knowledge in the best and new technology on the market !. A typical day would be opening and closing the store, ringing up customers after fulfilling their needs, also changing price tags and audits ect."
good,They believe in customer first policy.  Good organization to work.  Customer friendly organization.
good,"I have a very positive experience, and my manager is awesome, we are like a family we all get along yet always keeping it professional and about the work we need to get, i never have a problem finishing something i start."
good,"pretty laid back, pay sucks but management was pretty good. the job was easy but it's based on what you can sell, after a year working there I was recruited by a major wireless retailer."
good,"I loved everything about my experience while being employed at Radio Shack. But my overall best experience was the competitions between all the employees. We competed at everything we did, whether it was seeing who could get the most cell phone sales, to who can sell the most replacement plans. we pushed one another to work harder and that's what made us stronger as a team."
good,Cool to work there but can always use more money. Discout is ok to if you like electronics.
good,"open and close duties"
good,Fun place to work being surrounded by electronics and constantly learning new things. Helps me to be current with all new technology
good,"Every day was about sales and giving the customer the best possible solution for their issues and needs. I learned a lot about the electronics and how to fix and resolve them, Learn all the gadgets and what they do and it was great. Had a good manager, flexible hours which was great if you had church or school. The hardest would be learning all the electronics as once, every week we would receive new electronics devices, which range from toys to wireless cell phones to cables so it was hard to keep up with all those items."
good,"From working at RadioShack it enhanced my customer service skills, and allowed me to build my interpersonal skills as well. The co-workers made me feel welcome, and we helped one another with difficult tasks."
good,"Provide exceptional customer service through the delivery of company policies resulting in the sale of products"
good,Working at Radioshack was a very fun experience. Helping someone decided what device best fit them was the best part about being a sales associate. It feels good to have customers come to you based on your expertise and its even better to actually know what exactly they need to know. Working with just one manager and you being the only associate was difficult when it comes to scheduling. Overall i loved the job and grew a very big cliental.   
good,Great place to learn a lot of information. If you enjoy technology you will love working here !
good,"Great learning experience, turn sales into a game and you will have fun."

good,Unlike most workplaces I had enjoyed the time I work at Radio Shack. I liked the fact that when I went to work I enjoyed working with and around all the other employees that also work there. That to me made me work harder and made me want to come in and stay longer each and every day.
good,I enjoyed working at RadioShack. I was able to grow my skill set and I appreciated management and their directives.
good,"I am a PIC at work so when the manager is gone i take on his duties. Every time i work there is at least one issue, whether an irate customer or an alarm sounding. You just have to calmly get through it and work together. I learned how to break things down, some people may not understand something the way you do. Breaking it down lets everyone understand and that way there is less room for error. I love the interaction with people the most."
good,The overall company is great but the managers especially the district manager of saint petersburg is very unappreciative of the work people put in for her. I managed 3 different stores for her and when she found replacements for those stores she demoted me back to assistant manager.
good,"Typical day at work is helping customers with their needs in selling, electronics."
good,"Being a sales associate at radio shack allowed me to help costumers, giving them outstanding knowledge on our merchandise. Also, gave me the opportunity to listen to the costumers needs and see what i could do to try to fix there problem so that i could make there radio shack experience incredible."

good,It was a great job at the time a I learned a lot from this place.
good,I really enjoyed working here. The pay was good at the time. We would receive an hourly base pay along with commission and bonuses from the Wireless Companies.
good,I learned a lot in this company and advanced rapidly I really miss working at this company and wish they were still around they were a great company to work for and I'd definitely do it all again I went from knowing little to nothing about most electronics to being a store manager and doing quite well
good,Every day was customer service. I enjoyed helping people how to use new electronics. The company had great training. It had some competition but it was more team work focused.
good,Working for Radio Shack you learned something new everyday and no two days were ever alike. The Company liked to promote from within and offered to anyone interested training to grow.
good,A typical day at work would involve helping an individual coming in and needing assistance with anything. Management was good. Very competitive with trying to sell anything for commission.
good,"Radio Shack was a busy job that letted me interact with at least 40 people a day from different places and nationality. It help me get better with customer service and the ability"
good,"If the company board of directors didn't make a few bungled company choices, I feel like the company would still be around.  It felt like a giant family-- I still miss the company!"
good,"Working here was the best time I have ever had. I just wish Radioshack didn't close I would still be working there as of today. The GM sucked but all the other managers that I worked with which was only 1, was the best."
good,"El ambiente es muy bueno, hay buen apoyo con todos"
good,Great starter job with some advancement opportunity. Owners are nice.  Advancement stalls out after reaching so high though. Owners are not used to having managers and you may clash on ideas for the store. Overall a great place to work and build your character for your next career move.
good,"In order to succeed you need someone to push you to your potential. This company gave me the extensive training needed to, become the best customer service associate possible. Great place to work as individuals as well as team. They really stress that team work is crucial for the company to succeed. This company also has routine meetings, to see where everyone is at as well as voice your opinions as to how they can better help you."

good,I worked at RadioShack for 2 1/2 years. I gained a lot of experience in customer service and had a lot of fun working there. After my first year of working there I got promoted to Assistant Manager and also gained experience supervising. RadioShack has been one of my favorite jobs.
good,A sales associate at Radio Shack should have a warm courteous approach for customers coming in the store. He or she need to greet and be able to help customers for any device or merchandise a customer needs. He or she should also have an updated knowledge of digital trends as well as its prices.
good,I absolutely love radioshack. It hurts me til this day that they had closed down as a company. I made so much money and had a great time doing so with the crew and management together.
good,Overall during my time at this specific job it was nice to be able to help and educate costumers with general questions about the latest gadgets that were coming out. My co workers helped make the hours fly by teaching me new methods with pricing and inputting product information.
good,The job was a great job I over looked other employees made sure that all my inventory was in order. I opened and closed the store I worked 60 plus hours a week. I worked with individuals that was team players and that worked great as a team. The hardest part of my job was being away from my family. I went to a lot of manager meetings and learned so much of what it took to be a manager of my own store I had a lot of responsibilities.
good,"I loved working at the Shack.  I did hate the training mechanism, though I did learn a lot from it.  It is just there are so many.  I loved running three stores. Great employees and some great co managers. I can't and won't bad mouth a company that I highly respect.  They noticed and rewarded good behavior and good sales"
good,"I learned many computer skills while working here."
good,"My workday would include providing cutting-edge solutions to customer. Being confident and friendly at all times. Meeting the standards of the store including stocking, cleaning, merchandising ect. I learned a lot about technology working here, computers, cell phones, and security systems mainly. Management was outstanding they motivated me as a sales representative. The management always recognized my performance as one of the top 3 sales reps in our district. The most enjoyable part of the job was learning new things everyday and helping customers."
good,"Great job great co worker great manager  but our hand manager had a very disrespectful to me , one of my co worker took some money out of the draw and he address me off it and I didn't even take it and than he address another African American and it was a Latino girl and I just felt that he always came at me and my co worker but never the other so I left"

good,Great place to work. Felt good helping customers find solutions to their electronic problems as well as finding the products they were looking for or ordering exactly what they needed.
good,"RadioShack retail stores had a natural turnover rate as is normal with most retail stores, especially electronics retail stores. However, the corporate offices and supply chain operations were staffed by long tenured, dedicated, and exceptional people.  In my opinion, the reason RS failed was due to the public buying shift to e-commerce, detrimental decisions made by former CEO's, and the consequential effects of Asset Based Loans. I loved working for RadioShack and will miss it immensely."
good,Great Management and team player was very productive in all area of the business. Hold all associates accountable for there day to day activities.
good,"llegar puntual y de buen animo"

good,Management of security was always sensitive to personal needs and time off requests. The team was always friendly and willing to help out when asked. A typical day consisted of working one of several posts where traffic entering and exiting  was monitored at all times. Every person that entered the property had to show identification. Each employee was subjected to metal detector monitoring as well. The hardest part was learning all the codes and alarm codes. Working with a great security minded team was the best part. This position offered a lot of new experiences and good pay with benefits.
good,"The managers and work environment are great at RadioShack. However, I am looking for other jobs at the moment due to the fact that RadioShack may be going out of business soon."
good,"The atmosphere is really amazing, i get along really well with my co-workers. The job itself consist of selling product, there are sales goals made and you must meet them."

good,I taught Physical Education at the school for four hours once a week. I loved working with the children and watching the progress throughout the year. The rest of the faculty was wonderful.
good,I loved working for Radio Shack it gave me more experience than working for myself.
good,"RadioShack was a formative job for six years, but I left once the writing on the wall became clear that benefits and compensation would be reduced. Now it is my understanding that RadioShack does not pay well, and overworks their employees."
good,I Had a lot of great experience when I worked there learned a most of what I know of customer interaction thanks to my wonderful supervisor. I also made great friends who to this day I still keep in touch with.

good,"A regular day at work would always be a day full of challenges."
good,"I absolutely loved working a the shack. I actually traveled to different locations while employed with them. ive learned a lot by working for this company and have a few certifications that have helped me pursue my goals. the only down fall is the lack of communication between DM, RM etc. and employees. another one is that they are not quick to move you up in the company because its so overly populated."
good,"I enjoyed working for this company as a teenager, I never had any problems working here, the management was very proffessional and made sure everyone took thier break or lunch. I would work for this company again."

good,"I've worked at RadioShack since 2012, and every day is usually fun and exciting. I enjoy meeting new people and staying busy, so being a sales associate really gives me that opportunity. Usually I go into work and start my basic responsibilities. I begin helping customers and continue fixing product placement and sales signage. Every week I learn something new about consumer electronics, from new merchandise to new technology. The managers of the district are all very well connected and communicate openly with all sales associates, so you end up knowing who everyone is fairly quickly. I love when a customer has a difficult question or a tricky conversion they are trying to accomplish (""I need my video camera to play the files from my ipod through my projector system at work""). It really tests your knowledge of electronics and encourages you to try new things."
good,"Learned how to fill in profit and sales report "
good,"learne a lot about electronics and other gadgets, fun work environment, great co-workers"
good,"A typical day at work consist of knowledgeable customer service and using a selling system to upgrade technology and adding service plans to protect devices, and making sure the store is always presentable and organized. At least once a month we took trainings on new technology which kept me refreshed and able to talk to customers about technology with confidence. My coworkers and I worked as a team combining our knowledge and helping customers choose the technology that is best for their personal lifestyle. The hardest part of the job was achieving sales goals on slow months but the most enjoyable part was educating customers and the reward of having people tell me they will come back to see me specifically again."
good,"minimum wage paying job, but fun atmosphere. If willing to learn, you can pretty much run the facilities on your own."
good,"Gained a lot of knowledge on consumer electronics working at radioshack.  The management is excellent, i can always go to them for guidance. Co-workers are great, when I had just been hired they took it upon themselves to make me comfortable in the new environment.  The hardest part of my day is dealing with the rs portal, it really needs some redesigning.  The most enjoyable part of the job is working with my fellow employees, we all can make a shift fun along with doing our respective duties."
good,Manager was an awesome guy. Made things fun! Always had something to do.

good,"A typical day at Radio Shack would be fast paced and unpredictable with their wide array of items. I learned how to activate cell phones, money management, and how to be pursuasive in sales.

The most enjoyable part of the job is exceeding customers' expectations, resulting in them becoming regular shoppers with us."

good,Sent me for a lot of training on management skills on HR skils this comapany invested a lot on me 
good,From radioshack you will learn how to do cross sell and learn everday about new techonolgy and customer intraction and problem resolution 
good,"I learned a lot through sales in RadioShack. It was a smaller store environment and I recommend anyone who wants to learn communication, sales, and inventory skills to start there before moving to a larger store setting as I find more ""Big Box Retail Stores"" tend to be hard on employees expecting way too much out of them. RadioShack offers much more in the way of management training opportunities and trust employees to open/close the store."

good,Excellent Company/ associates relation. Excellent work life balance.
good,Assisting Customers with their purchase
good,"RadioShack is a place where goals are important, and motivation is key. I've learned to communicate and sell with much integrity. The hardest part of working for RadioShack would be full product knowledge. RadioShack carries a wide variety of products, ranging from all aspects of the electronic world. One thing that appeared a bit difficult for some is being able to transition and pinpoint focus on the most important thing to the business which would wireless sales. I enjoy most being able to build customer rapport, and actually help people learn about things in the technology world that they probably would not have learned on any given day"
good,"I was a seasonal employee, I worked from Thanksgiving through Christmas. We unloaded trucks, stocked inventory, sold products, & we were payed by commission.We had alot of fun working together, we laughed together & It made the job fun. It upset me that my job was going to end after Christmas. The one thing I learned was that I made a good sales person, I stayed in 1 of the top 3 every week over 10 other sales clercks."
good,The management is awesome. This company has great management skills.
good,This sales position has given me the ability of selling myself as well as products in consumer influence and manipulation of choice. I enjoy my co-workers and the customers who ask for my help.
good,A great customer service job. You really got to know your people and got recognized when you did well. I was promoted within 90 days of my employment there because my sales were so good!
good,"In my experiences with RadioShack, I have found that everyday is fun and enjoyable but also very tough and rigorous. You are held to a very high standard, both in knowledge and application. The team members are fun to be around and make the day enjoyable. Management does a fairly decent job to help out, but usually stays in the back room. The sales path leading to cellular pones is a very hard part of the job, yet it is achievable through practice. They train you very well so that you may be the best at your job."
good,"The most important part about is that im making money and that im getting to no new people, i love my co-workers there."
good,reason for leaving was at the time there was not enough hours.
good,MY job was to sell their product. RadioShack taught me how to have people to people skills. Working with older people that were my role models of how a worker should be.
good,"Radio Shack is a fast paced environment. No two days nor are any two customers alike. Every day I would walk my store, a two foot section at a time, noting what needed cleaning or reset."
good,This company has room for advancement as long as you know how to sell. That is their main focus and they get on you if you aren't meeting goals.
good,"it consisted of general store running procedures of stocking and doing inventory to making up schedules for employees, along with general customer service and register operation. we help customers on a multitude of levels from finding and special ordering items to repairing and instructing on how to use products weather they were from our company or not. i learned alot about managing a store and how to properly interact and help customers and employees alike. my favorite part was helping customers with products or finding something they couldn't find somewhere else."
good,"Stressful but exciting"
good,Management was very informative and understanding. The hardest part of working there was the device malfunctions. The most enjoyable part of the day was a productive day.
good,"Great place to work! Fair compensation plan, excellent benefits.  Very competitive in all aspects, products, offers, commissions, training, customer service, etc."

good,"Great teamwork among all employees and management, fantastic training and coaching, great hours, great communication between everyone that worked with me."
good,"RadioShack out of all of the companies I have ever worked for, it was by far the best atmosphere and environment I have ever been apart of. Customers would come into the store on a regular basis with questions about all sorts of electronics. Retro Systems, Old Clocks, Modern day technology such as cellphones, tablets , car systems, anything of electronics. Our job was to aid and assist the customers to the best of our knowledge while also suggestive selling the customer to increase store profits."
good,Radioshack was a fun place to work fastpaced always learnig and teaching customers then the dynamics changed and the only thing radioshack cared about was wireless
good,RadioShack is a fun place to work. If you are into sales there is a great opportunity to make some good money with great perks and pay bonuses. Management was great and would ensure you know how to sell and would coach you to make sure you were getting your spiff. (bonus for sales)
good,I loved my experience working here. I loved getting to play with all the newest phones and newset tech. Had the best manager as well and coworkers. The work and hours were very fair along with the pay. 100% would work here again.
good,"Aprendes muchas cosas, desde cómo funciona un equipo hasta cómo lograr que tu cliente se valla satisfecho con tu asesoría."
good,"RadioShack is where I started working at the same time I started school for Computer Engineering. It was a great company to work for in most areas. The only thing I did not like about RadioShack, is that we were in the phone selling competition. That took RadioShack away from what it was. Most of my job was supposed to be focused on selling phones, but when customers come in for electronic components, I get excited and forget all about phones. The majority of our phone business was those coming in to pay bills. The majority of our business though was dealing with all the other electronics in the store."
good,"Overall it was a great learning experience and met some great people. Learned a lot and was able to do what i do best, customer service, planograming and store appearance."
good,"responsible for daily shipments incoming and outgoing"

Even on its busy days it was still the most enjoyable job I have ever had. I learned how to thrive in a sales environment from this job thanks to my managers.
good,I started at RadioShack right before they filed for bankruptcy the first time and we just filed again last week.   I would not change a thing as I have met some of the most amazing people and have learned a lot about myself.   I truly believe in this brand and hope it lives on forever.

good,"RadioShack was a great first job for me that helped me build my social skills as well as helping me practice my Spanish, which is my second language. I learned how to greet and approach customers, finding out what they need and how it works, as well as learning how to manage a store. My manager was great, he very knowledgeable, friendly, and easy to work with. The hardest part of the job was being the only associate there at some points due to the lack of staff, which meant dealing with several customers at a time while being alone. The most enjoyable part of the job was helping customers understand our products, and showing them how it would benefit them for whatever they needed it for. I had many repeat customers who would come back to seek my assistance because of the great job that I did."
good,Working for Radioshack was very rewarding. The job allowed me to gain an in depth knowledge of electronics and all things technologically based. I worked with dedicated staff and management.
good,"A typical day at work is eventful and exciting. I learned and bettered my communication skills, customer service, and knowledge of technology. Management was fantastic. They were very understanding and helpful during my training process. The co-workers I had were supportive and often shared their knowledge with others.

The hardest task on the job was when inventory was either short or over and we would have to re-enter all that information into the computer. The most enjoyable part of the job was helping customers and doing planograms. I enjoyed being around my coworkers because if their wasn't something I couldn't do they would help me."
good,"the Hardest part of the job was in a low income area so sales were harder to come by, but we did our best to make sure we met ur goals."

good,"era mas que nada asesorar al cliente."
good,"RadioShack was my first job, I was lucky that the Manager gave me a chance when she did. I learned a lot, I had been there for going on four years, and was continuing to learn. It wasn't always the easiest job, but I enjoyed myself meeting new people, learning new things, and spending time with my awesome co workers. The hardest part of the job, was honestly not being able to help those that had broken their phones or electronics due to some company polices I hated turning people down, but it was part of the job. The most enjoyable was definitely on Friday's we got new shipment, that we had to put up, looking through all the cool stuff and seeing what the customers would like."
good,Hardest part was trying to convert all customers into a potention cell phone sale. This company was really fun to work for and I'd totally recommend it to anyone who is going to school because they work with your schedule.
good,"As store Manager I opened the store, counted the daily cash. Started the POS servers, create sales plans for sales associates. I kept in contact with my district manager daily reporting sales gains. the most difficult part of my previous job is random shipment deliveries. It always came at the wrong time. I really liked that working there I learned a lot about technology."

It was a fairly simple job once you learned everything there was to know. I worked with amazing and supportive people. I hated to leave my job but I had to move!
good,"A typical work day consisted of greeting customers and dealing with their issues. However I learned a lot working here, as it was my first job, such as working in a team, and having reachable goals every month. Co-workers are always a little different at every job, but you learn to adjust to meeting new people and having different personalities on the job. The hardest part of the job was dealing with customers who knew how to do my job better than me. This is a relatively easy job to do if you love electronics, making it the most enjoyable job for me."

My Manager is very understanding and he gets things done."
good,"A typical day at work consist of taking payments from customers for their cellphone service, cable service, or credit card with Radio Shack."
good,"When I worked for RadioShack the company training line was WIIFM:  What's in it for me?  I thought this was excellent because it was right to the point.  The job included commission sales and the best way to motivate employees to do their jobs well was to explain WHY they should care.  I had a great team working for me, I had excellent management above me.  This was a job that I placed great value on.  The drawback was that I had a baby and my priorities changed.  I no longer valued working 60+ hour weeks, including every weekend and several evenings a week, above my free time at home.  I learned a great deal from the years I worked at RadioShack and I'm glad I had the opportunity to work there.  "
good,Training is great for the job but each store has a different style of management and a transfer to a different location might be necessary for a good fit.
good,It was a great workplace with a good team. We all work together to reach our goals and the pay was very good. I enjoyed working in this company.
good,Very uptempo and up beat. Working in a fast pace environment you have to learn to adapt quickly to the needs of the consumer. Knowing all the right things to say at the right moment.

The hardest part about the job would be trying to maintain friendships in the work place over selling cell phones to customers. It's like a rat race in that place!"
good,Fun working environment! Learned a lot about electronics and their components! Very goal and team oriented!   
good,"Got to work at 9:30 AM. Store opened at 10:00. I got my register ready, made sure everything was tidy and opened the door. I enjoyed this job very much as again, I really enjoy working with electronics. After a while, my manager made me his assistant manager. The hours were long but it was fantastic to know I had a great job and a wonderul boss who appreciated me. I only worked with my boss and maybe another couple of people who I enjoyed working along side with very much."

I have a team that is cooperative in acheiving goals and the most dificult thing to do at work is to compete with others, but thats where i proove to be good at."
good,"What more is there to say...I loved the people i worked with, i love the costumer service i got to provide to all kinds of people"
good,I love working with the customers because I'm a people person. I enjoy any type of job involved in Retail or Sales. Radio Shack pays well our service is excellent. All customers are not the best but we are trained and getting paid to deal with that. Thank You Radio Shack.

good,Oh bitter sweet memories. I absolutely loved the company when it was still around. It was a very sad day when I shook hands with them and walked out for the last time.
good,"I have had many jobs and never have I been treated the way I am treated here. The company runs on trust and transparency and this provides a feeling of mutual respect for everyone in the company, regardless of position or rank. There is an open-door policy that makes me feel like I can express any concerns I have and I know they will be heard and considered instead of ignored and shrugged off. The team-building exercises we do each month also really help to connect us as a company so we are a team working towards the same goal instead of separate departments ignoring one another."
good,"I enjoyed my time at Radio Shack , I enjoyed the freedom they gave us to do our jobs . The Director and Divisional were very supportive in the Loss Prevention side of the business as well as the sales side."

Holiday season brings lots of RC toys that we are able to play with and demonstrate for customers which gives a better chance of selling it its a great place to work and to just be
good,"Loved my job at RadioShack! If it was still in business,I would still be there as a manager. They did cate about their employees.You were able to put in your opinions without being criticized."

good,"no longer in business it was a good company overall, sales were great and i love management. Hiring and managing my own team i enjoyed and take my training somewhere else"
good,Muy buena empresa para crear carrera laboral y excelente ambiente de trabajo
good,Iv'e suffered through 5 layoffs and Radioshack was one of the most upsetting. What a great job. God only knows what will happen to the old men who need electrical bits.
good,While employed with RadioShack I was given the opportunity to work in two different departments. I was given the opportunity to market for the company. The work environment was exciting and fun. I was trained in many different skills that allowed me to perform my job to help customers find what they needed.

We always sought to add to our customer's life by offering solutions to all their professional needs. Cell phones, electronics, and software were our primary products for sale. We often met as a team to ensure focus on our daily sales goals and monthly. I was often top of the leader board and a highly competitive salesperson."

good,Went in at 8 and worked until 5. I learned how to scan documents there. I had 2 positions there. I started out as a file clerk and moved to the scanning dept.
good,Helped me grow into a better person and worker. I really enjoyed working there and enjoyed everything I learned to be a better manager and a better business person
good,"A normal day at work was not very stressful and very relaxed. You took their guided information and suggestions on how to run your business, and made empowered educated decisions. They focused on hiring and promoting the smartest and brightest individuals to guide the company forward. You always knew that someone ahead of you or in a position of leadership was ready to hold your hand and teach you what you needed to do to be a success. They always treated us as their star power players, and made sure we had every bit of support behind the scenes to be healthy, happy, and ready to push the company forward. Their only fault... was being stuck in the Marketing and products that made them famous, and being afraid to move forward with customer demand. Becoming old and inferior led to their death. And led to us all leaving."
good,Radio shack was once a good company to work for but in 2008 they had a upper management change and then drove the company in to the toilet and are no longer in business as of now. I only stopped working there because I  got into a bad accident out of work and couldn't come in for over 5 months . My manager was great and we had a great work bond .

good,"I really really miss this place. I loved each an every co-worker I had, all 5 of them. Really did hurt once we had to close the store down. If I could go back to a RadioShack I would in a heartbeat. I had one of the best Managers you could ask for at your first job. She saw the potential I had an gave me a shot at a job there. She eventually felt like I competent enough to be able to become a Key Holder, I made sure not to let her down on the decision either. If we never closed I would have been pushed up to Assistant Manager as she was moving an the Assistant Manager at the time was gonna move up to her spot. We had the some of the best deals on cell phone services and really good deals on items in the store. Really missed the commission that I would get with any sale, could really see when I was trying my hardest an when I wasn't."

good,I really enjoyed electronics and especially enjoyed music. I didn't have a stereo at home so being able to listen to musica at workk was really a plus.

Then evaluating who needs my immediate attention on there metrics and addressing it before it becomes bigger issue in the future. I'm always looking over the store emails of my District or Regional  manager has sent out for the day and setting  up a schedule for those duties to get done for the day. Radioshack has taught me a lot about how important customer satisfaction is to it's customers and my team. As well as how to really understand how important it is to listen to the customers needs. Just by doing these two customer satisfaction needs, it opens up a wider range for you to be able to sell the customer anything. By asking the right questions you could easily find there needs, as well show them the other needs they originally didn't come in for. For an example, they walk in for a HDMI cord but after talking to you who asked open ended questions they realized they might need more then just a cord. It's not like your pushing sales onto your customers no not at all, your just keeping them aware of these amazing deals they might missing out on.
