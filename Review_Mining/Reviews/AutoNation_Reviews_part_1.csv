rating,review
good,"Very helpful employess, fast paced job, lots of benefits, flexable hours. Management is great and very helpful. hardest part of the job, was possibly working the 2nd shift which was until midnight"
bad,"payplan sucks. 100 mini. management is never on same page with each other. manager vs manager.  its a circus run by the clowns. pay is low due to cut throat mentality and hard to sell cars.  low inventory on new, carmax pricing structure on used so no haggle results in lost customers daily. they want to act like carmax having 1/8th the inventory to choose from to switch customers to. ecomm dept is the pits. lots of leads.....bogus leads. i would say 50% of the leads are valid. this is the most bell to bells i have ever worked for a company on a monthly basis.  12 per month to be exact !  dont work here. dont tell your friends. its bad."
bad,Horrible and no customers so no money  work hours and compensation aren‚Äôt worth it. You can‚Äôt sell anything because no customers come in. If you do sell something you barley get any money
bad,Miserable all the time. Management is horrible.  Company only cares about making money and not rewarding employees enough. Terrible work environment!!
bad,Mgmnt only cares about their own $$commissions$$.........they dont care about employees that work hard to earn them those high commissions........!üò†üëé
bad,This company is horrible to work for. I have been here for awhile and haven‚Äôt received a raise. They do not care about their employees they treat us horribly. I would never suggest anyone work here unless you want to be treated bad
bad,"Very toxic place to work at stay away. Lots of discrimination from the majority of ""cubans"" working there all the way to management. And, certainly too much favortism mostly towards all cubans in this dealership along with bad business practices..üëéüëé No room for advancement or growth lack of diversity you can only make it there if you one of them ""cuban!"" üëéüëéüëé"
bad,Communication is horrible and management is a non factor and getting things done is a job in itself there is no loyalty for no employee that works for autonation you are just a number!
bad,"Would not recommend going to work for Autonation period.so happy I finally left."
bad,"Horrible, vengeful department to work for.  Training is the worst I‚Äôve experienced.  If you are not in the ‚Äúclick‚Äù group within the department, you will take the blunt of work.  VERY, VERY, VERY micromanaged!"
bad,Please do yourself a favor and don't work here. It's a nightmare. Typical work day includes thinking about applying to other jobs as soon as possible..
bad,"People if you don‚Äôt mind working a flat rate mechanic job,then this job is for you. But if you do mind the flat rate then run to another job cause dealing with this company especially the whole flat rate sucks big time. I would never recommend this company Cadillac Autonation to nobody. This place the manager straight up lied to me about my pay"
bad,Please don‚Äôt waste your time working at AutoNation in Johnson City.You had Managers that would be Drunk on the job.Would berate you and always change your Schedule last minute.
bad,Save your self from working in a place lile this. Managers will treat you like a piece of trash. They have a few friends that they like that have been here forever otherwise they talk down to everyone new. Gm is a complete blank and deserves to get fired. Lazy and cheap self wont spend a dime on the store
bad,No one will help you. Everyone is out for themselves cause they wont make money helping others. No advancement and management treats everyone like they are no one.
bad,"Management doesn‚Äôt care about you only numbers god for bid you get sick, hurt or have a family problem then your jobs being threatened, very rude and unfriendly"
bad,"Service technicians regularly damage customers cars and write it up as if the customer I did it with the support of management. This company is absolutely crooked and it should be investigated by the FTC."
bad,"If you are young, a woman, lgbtq, or and ethnic minority working for this company is difficult at best, hostile at worst. Very Conservative, racist,  laissez-faire management, and poor conditions."
bad,"IF you love to stand around and do nothing and either get paid for it or not thats your choice, their is nothing but favoritism in that building, most days you mop the floor and clean up after the higher technicians, none of the entry level techs have any tools so i hope you like to lend out everything. the service manager is so selfish and doesnt know how to put his foot down and demand respect. actually you could disrespect him, mess up a car, and he will still find a way to blame someone else who didnt do it and make it their job to fix it."
bad,"Awful place to work at, horrible management, horrible coworkers, constant stress and judging. And the place itself looks awful. Do not recommend one bit"
bad,Been in the car business for years and this is by far the worst place I‚Äôve ever been in. They have a GM that can‚Äôt even show up on Saturday mornings and run the only meeting. The GSM is from corporate and can‚Äôt get you a new car menu. They have more managers then sales people and talk down to everyone that‚Äôs not in management. I literally quit this job mid delivery of a car deal due to terrible management.
good,"Very helpful employess, fast paced job, lots of benefits, flexable hours. Management is great and very helpful. hardest part of the job, was possibly working the 2nd shift which was until midnight"
bad,"Terrible management.  Only care about numbers, does not care about employees, employees are a number to them.  Unless you are a big wig in the company, you are nothing."
bad,"See ads for this porter position every week at the same 2 places and its very clear once you work there why the turnover is so high. Youre treated like a slave for about 20 different people in the service department getting orders barked at you from all angles of the building, No matter how fast you run laps around the building looking for misplaced cars that are parked clear across the property or running around for 20 mins looking for keys that an advisor misplaced for a car that is blocking in a pregnant womens car with a kid in her arm on a 100 degree day, Youre going to anger atleast 5 employees at any given shift because you couldnt possibly do what they DEMANDED,not asked at a reasonable time. If that wasnt miserable enough, You have random angry costumers sitting in the parking lot for 30 mins getting mad at YOU just because you have the company uniform on because a service advisor is too ""busy"" to deal with them for whatever reason."
bad,Trying to negotiate the old brick and morter approach vs. a complete digital presence.  This is a tough place to be in and will make a huge enterprise like AN make some drastic pivots over time.
bad,"In my time at autonation I saw a larger corporate dealership consume a very popular local dealership, fire almost all the sales staff and service technicians, eliminate a convenient late shift service window, and hire on young underpaid teens to replace the experienced staff. It was clear that autonation did not care about it employees as long as they were paying them the bare minimum to work. The turnover rate was very high considering service techs discovered they could be making 20-40k a year more elsewhere, and sales staff discovered  they could be making commissions instead of a $10/hr rate TO SELL CARS.  Also when they finally gave us benefits, the benefit package was over 1/2 of our bi-weekly paycheck. It was an absolutely terrible place to work."
bad,Nothing to add here. If find it very funny that this is optional survey however there are section of it such as this one that requires you to say something.
bad,The management is terrible. They do not pay you for the amount of work you are doing and the managers never take the blame for their mistakes. They blame it on the employees. Constantly talked down to and belittled. Do not work here. Do not waste your time.
bad,"I have worked for AutoNation for years "
bad,"Very stressful work place and low compensation compared to other companies and corporate in the industry. No actual good benefits. They work the he‚Äôll out of there employees and when they used them the most they make a HR case or something to get rid of them before the longevity check is handed out as its a noticeable number for some people. Overall not everyone there is honest and professional. "
bad,"Terrible management, corporate has had to step in.  New GM in place, but shouldn't stop there. Deep management problems, mean spirited and vengeful.  Causing people to leave, so far over half of staff has left."
bad,At AutoNation you get paid semi monthly (10th and 25th) which is not reasonable for me personally. Management is absolutely terrible. The lady who works over me is extremely messy and petty (she talks bad about everybody like she‚Äôs in high school) and the manager didn‚Äôt seem to care when I told him that. The pay sucks and they WILL take advantage of you. I will definitely be going to corporate and HR to make a complaint. Do not work here!!
bad,"This is by far the worst job I have ever had. The pay is terrible if you‚Äôre an hourly employee. They overworked the h*ll out of me! (for example I worked 102 hours one pay period and my check was only $1000) Think about that. Management is HORRIBLE they don‚Äôt care about you. As long as you‚Äôre benefiting them, they‚Äôre satisfied. STAY FAR AWAY 0/10 will NEVER recommend!"
bad,"Was service advisor for one week and quit bc I was fed up. Never worked for a more dysfunctional company. First week i was told to shadow people who basically made me an errand boy and didn‚Äôt take the time to explain the system. I was just expected to figure it out. Manager is never around, doesn‚Äôt even take time to help you learn the system or software. Didnt even have computer access til 3pm my first day. Manager also has a group text where everyone smack talks each other during and after work hours, it doesnt stop. Knew going into it the hours were going to be long, however I didn‚Äôt expect to be told I would be working 6 days a week and 70hrs for the foreseeable future. On my first day I was told at 5pm that I needed to be in Atlanta for training the following three days, which is 2.5hrs away. So needed to rush to get a hotel booked, and figure out the expense report system that the manager had no clue how to use! Overall, I am too detail oriented to work for a company that runs that poorly. No one cares to teach, no one cares what your schedule is, they just expect you to drop everything and work whatever they tell you to work."
bad,"It doesn‚Äôt matter how hard you work, management always puts you down and treats you as a slave. Managers act like they‚Äôre gods and corporate approves of that. The work environment is very toxic.  I‚Äôve never seen so many wicked people in one place. You get bullied everyday by the management and HR does nothing to help. That‚Äôs AutoNation, worst company ever. They don‚Äôt care about the little people, management is the supreme."
bad,M√°nagers are terrible they want to have you as a slave my supervisor had me and my Other co workers as of we where nothing dont recomend this place at all look somwhere else
bad,"1. Management does not care. Do not waste your time voicing ideas or concerns, you will be seen as a problem and treated as such."
bad,"Poor pay, poor Managament, poor hours; you are either over worked or not enough."
bad,"I have been in automotive retail business for over 20 years, this is the first time that I have ever work for autonation organization and it has been the my biggest regretful decision ever made. Have I known more about this organization, I would have never made the decision to work in here."
bad,"I worked in the parts center in Centennial for two months and that was all i could take. Management (like most) are clueless and have unrealistic expectations. Also on a side note, my direct supervisor came at me aggressively as if he wanted to fight. Besides the long hours, low pay and horrible organization within the company, THAT was the straw that broke my back. NO ONE should have to work in a hostile environment."
bad,Immoral employees and managers. I hated going to work. The pay was not as it was described in the interview. I was lied to and was in a bad time of my life to leave
good,"Very helpful employess, fast paced job, lots of benefits, flexable hours. Management is great and very helpful. hardest part of the job, was possibly working the 2nd shift which was until midnight"
bad,HR & Mgrs aren't Fit for their roles. So much behavior ignored swept under the rug like bullying. Under paid over worked. Retiring employees get fired
bad,"Autonation sucks don‚Äôt work there, over promise and under deliver. The management is stuck up and ineffective plus their facilities aren‚Äôt very good. Super clicks run the place."
bad,No comment...not happy with this employer at all. It's very male oriented business and the management lacks the necessary skills to deal with people. I'm really sorry I cannot be more positive and say great things about this employer.
bad,"If your looking to get get treated lower than a piece of dirt, and dont mind management making you feel stupid, then by all means go work for Autonation Chevy"
bad,the management is not the type that likes personnel that know more than they do. they pick and choose who they move up and  promote based on who kisses whos rear end
bad,"to much negative don't know where to begin. The current service director has destroyed service moral, continuous pay plan cuts, severe micro management. Just look at Auto nations stock value in the past 2 years it has lost 30% value for a reason. The worst management I have ever seen in my 37 years in the car business"
bad,"The location I was at was amazing before...then it all went down hill. A lot of favoritism going on. Felt like high school with cliques. The current manager bought on half of his family...we all know how that goes. You are promoted based on who you know and how hard or how excellently you perform. A lot of unscrupulous activity going on. Managers picking on employees and belittling them every chance they get. You will always get talked to in a condescending way... ‚ÄúI used to be a salesman before and I sold 20 units, you guys can‚Äôt do that‚Äù is just an example. I firmly believe in What Autonation is trying to achieve but they do tend to select very very bad apples to work for them. I just wish there was a stronger vetting process as to who gets promoted."
bad,Great first job moving to new town loved the coworkers for helping one another out and made you feel welcome.  Bosses could do more to make you feel welcome and part of the team
bad,"The work is what it is, but when the incompetent manager makes things worst by bullying and creating a toxic work environment, it‚Äôs time to go.  People don‚Äôt quit companies, they quit poor incompetent managers."
bad,"The management at auto nation was poor and didn't treat employees well. The pay was low and never gave pay increases, you worked long hours ,only to get around 10 hours commission paid."
bad,No one works together management has no experience.. they show favoritism when vehicles are handed out to work on if they even hand out vehicles to many people in one building
bad,Nasty company to work for  no matter how long  you put the time for them one mistake  you make it‚Äôs like you stole from them .not even a chance just fired you on the spot  anybody that works for that company you are nothing you just a number. I will not recommended anybody to work for AutoNation
bad,"Not at all worth it. Hostile work environment. I never trusted coworkers or management, Too many hours, too hard to make money. Extremely poor morale."
bad,"Work more hours, get less pay. Not everyone is a team player. If you are a hard worker others will back off and let you do all the work. Did not care for the shifts they rotated."
bad,If the person that trains you don't like you or your are not in her age group the training is bad.  They do price adjustments to raise the costs to where customers come in for an oil change and end up paying over thousands of dollars that the techs say they found other things wrong and these are on new vehicles.
bad,"This company does not believe in giving raises; You will work your self to death with no reward. The only way to make more money is by switching job position when available. However, my co-workers are amazing people."
bad,"Terrible place to work, terrible management. They expect you to survive without giving leads. They only gave leads to their favorites. I would never wish the nightmare of working here upon anyone."
bad,"The lack of management is astounding, work constantly misses deadlines but no one seems to really care, management has clear favorites that they will go above and beyond for them while burning everyone else in their path. The only thing anyone cares about is their own pay check and no one does any of the extra steps that may be needed to complete the car. Cars are constantly delivered not completed or with issues to the repairs"
bad,"Centralized management not relevant to market"
good,"Very helpful employess, fast paced job, lots of benefits, flexable hours. Management is great and very helpful. hardest part of the job, was possibly working the 2nd shift which was until midnight"
bad,people are rude and disrespectful and it is acceptable in managements eyes. write ups here are ridiculous they are based on what you are wearing not on behavior.
bad,"Not a good place to work Management was very bad."
bad,"Working as a tech was very stressful. The team leader will take the highest paying jobs, it was constant battle to get paid fairly."
bad,"No work/life balance. They took away commissions and want everyone in sales to live off 2500/month salary. They bring in managers from other dealerships or hire managers, they do NOT like to promote from within."
bad,"Poor management, no advancement opportunities, Management makes promises they never follow through on, unrealistic service advisor sales goals, really low commission pay"
bad,"I couldnt even begin to describe how poorly this company is run, how worthless they make you feel, the amount of hours they expect you to work, the poverty level income you'll earn.........I could go on & on......"
bad,It is a corporate ran hamster wheel with no direction and unrealistic expectations. The company has created a high stressful environment and every employee I currently work with is actively job searching.
bad,Autonation Honda at Miami Lakes is the worst place to work at. Place is extremely slow so you won't make much money. Team leaders get all the good work or pass on the good work to their buddy. Not a good place to learn if your new to the automotive industry.
bad,Rude/poor management. No career advancement opportunities. They tell you they are going to promote you to another job title and build you and make you work harder and then ultimately you get nothing.
bad,"Where to begin with this? First off, I'll start with the management: "
bad,"Overall you have some people that are great to work with here, it‚Äôs just the managers they don‚Äôt care about their employees. No overtime, less pay, hardly any vacation days."
bad,Never work there if you can prevent it. Autonation in general is a shady company.  Managers dont care and employees slack off alot.  I bougth a truck from them and cant get a salesman to call me or service to schedule an apointment.  Its like puling teeth.
bad,service manager is a great person but upper managers and HR needs a lot of work.they do not listen to workers. HR will not call you back if you have a problem and will not try to work nothing out if you are not upper manager you will be wrong.
good,"Very helpful employess, fast paced job, lots of benefits, flexable hours. Management is great and very helpful. hardest part of the job, was possibly working the 2nd shift which was until midnight"
bad,Would not work there again. Not a good place to learn. Not any money to be made. Better off at Jiffy Lube. Better off at Pep Boys. Better off at a movie theater.
bad,"They are the worst company to work for. Also, if you're sexually harassed by an employee who works there longer than you they won't do anything just to protect that employee. If you want harassment, mistreatment and terrible hours and pay then this is the place to work for you."
bad,"Selling cars is not the job for me. Some people love the job and should seek it out. However, there are long periods of time when all sales people just sit around for hours waiting for a potential purchaser to arrive at the store. I prefer being constantly busy."
bad,"I work very hard every day, perform better than most employees. and yet no matter how hard i try i still get ridiculed and harassed by my manager. sometimes words such as ""you're a worthless good for nothing technician"" and that was because it took me longer than 2 minutes to grab an old set of wiper blades from the trash!"
bad,I worked for AutNation for about a year and They changed the method of payment for Service Advisors twice in that time. each time the Advisors lost money and the company numbers increased to help their profits. When people live paycheck to paycheck losing money is not an option. several advisors had to get second jobs to make up the balance. This is not right and they only care about the company not the employee.
bad,"There's nothing I can say that's good about this company. It's a high turnover dealership that's including management & every time they replace a manager, they sucked as bad as the last, if not worse. I resigned because I couldn't handle the manager."
bad,"Poor management, not willing to take the time to properly train new employees.  Long hours during month end, and not enough pay. "
bad,"this job wasn't for me, they expect everything from you but they help you or guide you like they supposed to. also they change the way you get paid from commission to 0-9 cars is $25 and 10-11 $50 and so on"
bad,"Bad culture, poor pay plan, stressful environment, long hours, low profit margins, no job security. Autonation is a corporate run organization that is evolving into a business model similar to that of Carmax."
bad,Autonation is one of the worst companies to work for as a Salesman. The health care sucks and management is the worst of it all. I would not recommend.
bad,"Wouldn‚Äôt recommend my enimy to work there. They demand your soul, only have 2 holidays off a year Christmas and thanksgiving huh !!! If you quit by giving a 2 week notice , will still hold a grudge a won‚Äôt rehire you"
bad,"I do not recommend that anyone works for BMW of Vista or Encinitas.  Highly unethical work environment and management.  Forget getting promoted from within, because, by that time they have changed management so many times, no one will remember what your accomplishments were. Stay away from them as employee and customer."
bad,"the most enjoyable part of my job is drive a different types the car and lear more about it, the more hardest part is I never get good rate on my pay check on the winner time"
bad,"Manager was constantly giving my jobs to another employee and looking for ways to get ""prettier"" advisers. I thought it might have been just where I worked but, a little research showed it is a company wide issue. Their culture is fundamentally flawed."
bad,Unorganized rude employees dont know how to act professional especially in front of customers will go down as THE WORST JOB I've ever had pay didn't match the duties they want you to do.
bad,Theft and politics at its best... Upper management not transparent. Lots of palm greasing and self authorized bonus programs through upper management.
bad,"There is a high Turnover rate, Management is both unprofessional and impersonal. Would not recommend anyone who is looking for something more than a temporary position to invest their time here."
bad,Do not trust anybody there all backstabbing cry babbies. Management is two faced and has a lot if favoritism.  Working conditions are poor they could not provide a fan in hot weather. Very micro mannaged and unprofessional
bad,If you like to work with cars it is a cool place. Management was not all there. I can not work at a place with bad management. Would I go back......no.
good,"Very helpful employess, fast paced job, lots of benefits, flexable hours. Management is great and very helpful. hardest part of the job, was possibly working the 2nd shift which was until midnight"
bad,I will never recommend this company to any one. The management is horrible. They make you feel threatened if you have to call out of work. They expect more than they pay you. I hate my life working here
bad,The hours here are long and the pay isn‚Äôt what it should be I feel as if all Autonation cares about is you being a ROBOT 24/7 they don‚Äôt care about you.
bad,Autonation tried to ruin my mechanic experience will never ask anyone to work there . If you are dull minded and dont have an opinion and you kiss a** thats perfect for you. Now you know why I had to leave
bad,"nothing to add at this moment/ no comment. "
bad,Don't even think about it. This place is absolutely terrible to work the service writers don't know anything about cars in the service managers don't either.. they go through management quicker than underwear in the south.
bad,"Same as the other over promise and under deliver, parts is an issue, paint is an issue, body work is an issue and mechanical was impossible or never done..............."
bad,"You get no raises. Work is distributed by team lead. Which better like you. Also you are gauged by your productivity, But you do not get enough work for the 100 percent productivity they want you to make.You get hired on as full time, but they send you home early when they run out of work. "
bad,"This is my third temp on writing a review being they won't even post them. Lol. All in gonna say is its a lie, a joke, and a complete waste of time for someone looking for a honest career. Transparency?? Good luck! This place is a joke. You sell cars for minimum wage. And if you have a split deal its $25. Lol !!!!!! 25$ for selling a $60,000. Dollar car!?? People, look up screen 10 percent on 60,000. Or better yet look it up at 30k average car.. keep in mind most other dealerships will pay you on the front and back of a deal, spiffs, and other bonuses. Also giving up to 30 percent on a vehicle. This place is a joke. That's all."
bad,"You will rarely if ever see a female in management. Most are banished to a BDC closet with little if any ability to make decisions or implement changes necessary to generate income. Sales are paid a salary and a per car bonus, management is paid on total gross. "
bad,I went through a lot of stress knowing that people that work there are racist. I am a Latin woman and was treated like a low-class citizen. I do not recommend this job.
bad,They are a cookie cutter dealership factory. They only care about moving units and tend to play the sales staff against each other. They hire anyone to come in and make a few sales then let them quit or fire them. they say you will make money and sell you on the company but then give away they cars for as little as they can to get the deal. That means you sell a $50000 car and make a $100.
bad,"If you want to work long days with little pay, this is for you. Management is NOT friendly or helpful. Very cutthroat culture. No teamwork at all. Very disappointed."
bad,"Company had a serious lack of knowledge on how to staff store management.  I was expected to do the work of two managers on a poor pay plan.  From what I understand the MP has been replaced. "
bad,"to many clicks with management, dishonesty, long hours at the end of the month.  Everyone that works there seem miserable. No team players, everyone looks out for themselves."
bad,"Weak Managers, all about the back end never a concern about carrying any gross on the front. The worst service center ever. All around terrible place to work!"
good,"Very helpful employess, fast paced job, lots of benefits, flexable hours. Management is great and very helpful. hardest part of the job, was possibly working the 2nd shift which was until midnight"
bad,"AutoNation is absolute garbage in my experience. For those looking to work in a company who has moral values and treat customers right, DO NOT WORK HERE. They have unrealistic expectations and management treats you like you're nothing. "
bad,"This is not a bad company there is a lot of things that could have been changed and better managed, there were a lot of changes made for the good of the company."
bad,"you are just a number when you work for Autonation,  There is not work/life balance.  The hours are horrible, the vacation pay is not what they promise, the salary is low for the amount of work you put in"
bad,"Customer comes first, company second, employees are a distant third. "
bad,"not recommended, way to many hours and the job has no fun to it.   just a terrible pay plan, that makes you feel like you pay them to work.  management continues to micro manage and is always on top of you."
bad,I left a very good position at to go work for Autonation because I had to have more money. I was told we would be working around 40 hours a week but I get there at its 55+ and jobs constantly threatened. They expect you to work your off days if you have not sold a certain amount of cars even though all of the good leads go to the internet team. You are just a number to them not a person.
bad,"Not the biggest fan of this job, I was a Sales Consultant. The biggest issues I had their was that management was not the best to deal with. A lot of wrongful doing in the place, it just wasn't the best working environment."
bad,"- customer is always right, even at the cost of YOUR JOB"
bad,They are only concerned about their product and not there employees. They pay the manager a great salary but non manager are paid horrible. They need to look at everyone as a whole.
bad,Stay away! I would NOT recommend it. This place is a very stressful one with very long work hours and low pay. You will have to kiss customers' butt in order to get a good review which will also impact your paycheck. No training and employees quit every month that's why they are hiring all the time. Stay away!!
bad,I do not have anything to say about this company. They cleaned house and fired everyone with 10 plus years of employment. They have no heart only selfishly driven by money
bad,working for auto nation is working for a big corporation where the big wigs dont get invloved  they have area managers who protect themselves and there pay. when you work in the service department as a service advisor if you can upsale they will change your pay plan immediately . very cut throat atmosphere . as you can see they are always hiring.
bad,"I work for this company the management is the worst I have seen.I have worked in the service industry since 1998 . This company treats their employees like they are doing us a favor by us working there. Most of the managers have  NO experience  how do their jobs (very bad leadership) My manager was never in the office, he has his favor group of employees and he lets them do what ever they want. I would not want my worst enemy to work there."
bad,"They don't care about you, they over work you and don't expect to get anymore money. They take people as a joke when they ask to go up and move to different positions. Management sucks and definitely favorites other employees then others."
bad,Management sucks from The GM to the manager below him they don't have the skill set to run a business they just throw anything to fix any problem can't even manage a work schedule lol
bad,Horrible place to work. Managers don't care about their employees. Service director talks bad about everyone. Hostile environment and harassment occurring from managers and service advisors.  This is why there is a huge turn over here off employees. You don't get paid all the commission you work hard for. Dont waste your time here.
bad,This job did not work for me I felt as though I was not getting paid enough for all the things that I brought to the table. I did not like the work environment I felt that I was wasting my time. I did not like this type of sales. The pay was to  up and down for me.
bad,Doing everyone's job and not having time to do yours they betray you as one title beware you will have over 10 titles and the money is not worth hours nor headache
good,"Very helpful employess, fast paced job, lots of benefits, flexable hours. Management is great and very helpful. hardest part of the job, was possibly working the 2nd shift which was until midnight"
bad,All I can say is Autonation management is the WORST. they do not care at all about their technicians and this store before it was bought out was one of the worst shops Ive ever been to.
bad,"Worst place I ever worked.  Unprofessional leadership followed by even worse HR leadership.  Unethical practices.  As an HR professional you are stifled and limited in all areas of your job, questioned about everything then cursed at.  I don't recommend anyone working there- least of all in the HR department."
bad,"The mgmt here isn't experienced in auto body work & are on a power trip. If they could handle the positions  I o authority, they wouldn't be on that kind of power trip. They't know structure or quality work. Full of bull to employees AND customers. They just sit on their butts acting like they know what their doing and that place is a trainwreck. A manager with some knowledge could go into that place & turn it around but they are dumb, lazy morons."
bad,"Executive management change after former executive retired, left us an uncaring, unnscrupulous leadership with no concern for employees or customers. Documented, paper facts are the proof."
bad,"AutoNation is the worlds largest auto retailer. As a company, this was some of the best pay, training and benefits iI have ever had. They promote a fun inviting environment for the employee and customer alike."
bad,"The lies are that you will make a good salary when in fact you will starve trying , people dont care if you eat as long as you show up for work, they dont care about you"
bad,worse place to work they do not care about you do not care if you get work and cant pay bills to much drama and benefits suck and favor employees
bad,Is very unorganized had problems with payment and hourly payment had issues with scheduling and had issues with overall employment they tell you one thing and it's the other this job is very unprofessional and they couldn't show me how to become a proper salesman this is my first dealership I had no experience!
bad,"Terrible management,work environment, no structure. I could go on all day managers argue out in the open also have. No structure, no processes in place to help resolve issues. They only care about the money flow if it has nothing to do with that good luck getting help with other issues that need to be resolved even for customers."
bad,keep looking elsewhere. drama drama drama. and backstabbing. you are better off working in a different place. They will promise you the moon and give you dirt.
bad,"If your thinking about working for this corporation i would advise to keep looking! Is a typical car dealership in many ways, however the pay structure at Autonation is the lowest in the industry (while charging customers the highest prices). Top that with expensive benefits, long hours and a lousy work environment were everyone is unhappy. If considering a job in car sales i would strongly advise to keep looking!"
bad,"If you are looking for a company to build or continue your career, RUN from this one as fast as you can!! Autonation will tell you whatever they have to just to employ you. Then the nightmares begin! There is a serious lack of training. They have the worst IT department imaginable and their computer systems and procedures are horrible. They allow their employees to do almost anything as long as they produce good numbers.Employee turnover is obviously a problem with Autonation and they truly do not care about anything except putting up the numbers. Not a good company to work for!!"
bad,"I was lied to from the gate. 1st dealer ever worked at and would be the last. I worked at Honda Dulles in sterling Va for 7 months which 6 of those months I was looking for a new job for the last 6 months. GM....JOKE!!! SERVICE MANAGER AND DIRECTOR....JOKE!!!! MANAGEMENT DIDN'T HAVE THE SKILLS TO RUN THIS DEALER OR EVEN IN A CIRCLE. I DON'T KNOW HOW  I WAS ABLE TO LEAVE THERE WITHOUT CATCHING A CHARGE. Lie about pay, paychecks were always wrong, slave hours, lying techs, lying advisors, we were instructed to charge $150 per hour labor rate. Advisors would steal tickets, techs would lie about recommendations, we were instructed to change emails to obtain good surveys. The only thing that was good there was the few people I met. STAY AWAY NOT WORTH THE CUP I  URINATED  IN TO GET THE JOB!!! Autonation is a joke. HONDA DULLES SHOULD BE CLOSE DOWN. Nasty cold sandwiches every sat, nasty cold pizza every other Saturday, no Christmas bonus. Service Manger and director would have been great at a different position like, parts stocker. RUN AWAY FROM HONDA DULLES.  STAY CLEAR HONDA DULLES"
bad,"Enough Said.  This place is the devil.  Do not work for this company......................................................................"
bad,Overall not worth working for this company. Corporation only concerned about their overpaid execs. Better off working else where.
bad,"I would not even know where to start how much of a unpleasant nightmare it had been working at this establishment and feel my voice needs to be heard that someone needs to hear this. I worked at this establishment for 6 months  I started working in November of 2015 Was very excited to have a job working for BMW that this would be great start for my career little did I know the 6 month nightmare that I had in store. I am 26 and been in the Car business since I was the age of 15 starting as a porter working my way up to a manger of my own business which was family owned and unfortunately came to closing in the summer of 2015 so coming to this job I was hoping to grow in my career even if I had to start back from the bottom. This establishment is run by young kids I was appalled at the lack of management that goes on in this store. I was verbally harassed by my coworkers and treated with no dignity or respect. I followed all the channels to make complaints with HR department. Who then made empty promises to take action on the employees who surprising were not terminated due to the complaints that I made and even admitted to disregarding a previous complaint due to budget cuts! "
good,"Very helpful employess, fast paced job, lots of benefits, flexable hours. Management is great and very helpful. hardest part of the job, was possibly working the 2nd shift which was until midnight"
bad,"~ 8 years of cross techno-functional experience in IT domain across various phases of Functional black box testing (SIT, Regression testing, UAT).

Well acquainted with Software development life cycle, Software Testing Methodology and Technique, Software Testing Model, PDP (Project Defined Process), Configuration Management. Good interpersonal and communication skills. Well diversified experience in supporting various client engagement and their successful delivers."
bad,"This company has to be the worst in the business,  I have worked in this business for 25 years and have never seen anything like this they take your compensation away when your sick and say it was a leave of absence.  The pay plan I signed never said that. They cut your pay plan if you make to much. They hire gms who have either never been a gm or are a average at best,  they put a rule in place that says no sales staff should work more than 45 hours a week and I worked 70 . They will give a customer a 5200 dollar loss on a car but an employee has to pay retail and give there trade in at 4000 behind book. Horrible company no process, no customer service, no loyalty to the employee's they are a group of share holders that have no clue what or how to run this business the right way. Whatever you decide to do about employment do not drink the kool-aid of this company,  also when you leave they will do everything they can to tarnish your reputation because you stood up.and said no I'm not going to take it. Also they refuse to cancel and refund the customers for service contracts that are pro rated and should be returned or at least used towards there down payment on there new car. They steal from everyone. They certified cars that have been wrecked and have bad car faxes. Most of the manufacturers do not want to do business with them and no other company will for sure. The turn over rate for employees is the highest I have ever seen 1 out of 3 leave within a month."
bad,All about making money for the organization with little to no care about employees lives. Used to be  a much better place to work in.
bad,Very secretive about everything.  The pay plans are garbage.  Upper management does not have a clue.  Wouldn't waste your time looking at working for Auto Nation.
bad,This company had the worst management team I have ever met. A total waste of my time working there Would never recommend them to anyone
bad,"I handled customers with their vehicle's while they were in for repairs, working with warranty companies and kept a client base"
bad,"work long hours , no family life, worked 80 hours a week"
bad,"First and foremost don't buy a car from this place they will shred you in financing. Secondly I recenty worked for this company (AutoNation Nissan Southbay) and I have to warn people this place is not a good environment for you mental, physical, and social well being. The days are long, the pay is questionable, and the management is only concerned with their own agenda. I wouldn't recommend anyone to work or buy a car from this mega corporation. Sadly all the people aren't bad, but the energy and aura in general is what will zap you. If you don't mind verbal abuse, disrespect, and missing/late payments then by all means work for AutoNation. Don't be fooled by what they tell you!!! Don't buy what they're selling you!!!"
bad,"Hollywood Honda: You're not treated fairly, I was accused of intentionally messing up transactions. Every move I made was tracked and God forbid I spoke to anyone for 2 minutes after work, everyone started spreading rumors about me. Just like high school. And my superiors never did anything to control it. They actually fed the situation. I have never seen people talk so much trash as I had in this place and I felt like if I wasn't a part of it, then I would have issues with the people. I got sucked into it and ended up being a horrible person. Which is partly why I left. 95% of the staff were telling me how horrible it is and when I asked why they stay they would say because they were there 20 years ago when it was good and even though it sucks now, it is an easy job for them at this point and they more or less can do as they wish and there's no point leaving. I might have had 3 or 4 people in that whole place that were good people. The rest are true scumbags. All they care about in service and sales is the dollar no matter who they hurt, how much they lie, and how much advantage they take of people."
bad,"It's a horrible place to work I recently just quit from this BMW and I worked there for a year before I joined the military and when I got back to work I was accused for so many things that didn't have any proof for the GM at the moment is Erick ziginbierh and he was the one that was blaming me for everything and when he talked to me in his office. I asked him for proof and he said he couldn't get any to blame it on me. He has his favorites and obviously I wasn't because I ""became a treat"" to him because I was to confident as he said. So if you want my advice do not work here I repeat do not...from a former employee"
bad,"Service management changes are a regular event. This changes often create a hostile work environment where co workers are all but encouraged to take each others clients. Expectations of work performance measurements change with the management and, even then, sometimes on a weekly basis. Work hours are long at best to the point that average Service Advisor earnings amount to less hourly than minimum wage."
bad,Management is not supportive or helpful.  Goals and quotas are impossible to achieve.  No teamwork between departments.  The most unprofessional environment imaginable.
bad,horrible compnay in every way would not suggest anyone work for them
bad,A typical hire and fire car sales company. dont plan on being here for a long time. . firing from the bottom down. when many problems come from the top down.
bad,"No communication I am fairly certain they have illegals working in the warehouse. no overtime pay, constantly lied to about movement in to other departments. Having manager cover for employees they are friends with outside of work, clocking them in when they weren't there and covering for them."
bad,One of the wost companies that I've ever worked for. Managment was all over the place and very unorganized.
bad,"I have worked there for nine years...i have never seen.such crooked things that go on there..ford should pull all of there cars.and close the doors.on this company..i have never seen such a disfunctiinal company in all,my life..management.has no concept.of whats reslly going on...i tried to stay on part time..but they just wantef me out...found a  better job.more money.less hours..feel sorry for the warranty companys..they get taken advantage of..dont do any bussiness with these guys"
good,"Very helpful employess, fast paced job, lots of benefits, flexable hours. Management is great and very helpful. hardest part of the job, was possibly working the 2nd shift which was until midnight"
bad,I learned at this job that the training was no good and they dom't try to help you in no kind of way.
bad,"This place is terrible, the upper management only cares about their pocket. There is no work life balance, you are required to stay here from 7-7 5 days a week with no break and horrible pay. The only thing good here are the coworkers, they are the most down to earth people."
bad,"Horrible company to work for! Stay away at all costs. No room for advancement, corporate more worried about their pockets getting fatter while employees keep getting pay cuts. The SSC in Irving, TX"
bad,"A regular peyton place worked with very young girls who would run time ex: punch in for each other, leave early no teamwork and rude. expressed to upper management with no results got fed up after 3.5 months and walked out . they called it dispatch, never dispated a single tech"
bad,"I recently applied at Autonation and started receiving automated telemarketers calling. DON""T APPLY HERE THEY GAVE AWAY MY PERSONAL INFORMATION to some company in OHIO."
bad,Constant Management Change
bad,"I'm thankful for the opportunity I had to work at AutoNation, but I'm happy to no longer be working there because I certainly needed a fresh start. There was not any room for advancement and I don't feel that this company has the best interest for it's employees in mind. I did get opportunities to work with different technologies that I think will be beneficial in the long run. However, the fact that multiple projects were thrown in my direction without the ability to work overtime was very stressful and not conducive to getting work done properly and efficiently."
bad,"This company is not very employee oriented. Turnover is rampant. This company does not value it's employees. If insurance is wanted, the company does NOT contribute anything. The employee is left with paying all of the insurance premium, which is exorbitant. Pay is minimal."
bad,The culture there is ridiculously horrible. When you hit your goals they change pay plan. I have had the pay plan changed on me four different times. Not once was it for the better. You're making money for the corporate machine and they do not care about you.
bad,Management does not have the customers or employees in mind. Profit is the absolute driving force. Everything else including the safety and satisfaction of employees and customers falls to the wayside.
bad,"Too stressful, numbers count even after you just get back from a week off. Way understaffed and takes hours to do oil changes. After market products pushed over vw parts."
bad,"After 6 years of working 55 hour weeks as a Sales Manager with no weekends off, and multiple General Managers I along with all long time sales associates over the age of 50 were terminated without cause. I was terminated by new GM as she wanted her friend to assume my position. Sales cut in half under her weak leadership."
bad,Great people on the sales staff . Sales managers good too . General Manager is like a dinosaur from the past . Old school that only cared about numbers . Very high turnover employees constantly brow beaten and made to feel small without value. I am not a complainer but tthis has to go . The pay plan has been changed four times in two years . Each time getting less and less . That's just tip of iceberg .Best advice is don't go there. It appears that they are reducing the pay so that can pay minimum wage . Bring in desperate people .The silcon valley is an expensive place to live .If you work here better get a second job.
bad,"They make empty promises! I was hired on as a ASM, and told ‚ÄúI could easily make 60k a year, that their worst ASM makes 50k and some make 100k+!‚Äù LIES!! They constantly mess your pay up, and look for ways to cut your pay wherever possible. Recently we all received a new pay plan. We were LIED to and told the new commission structure would be in our favor. Well, many pay periods later we are all seeing anywhere from $400-600 less per paycheck. Needless to say, the turnover rate is astronomical!"
bad,Bad attitude from store management in treatment of sales staff. High turn-over of sales staff. Never had indication of training and follow up of performance of management and any time during employment period. Had impression that management was sales staff is necessary evil. Few if any improvement in treatment of sales staff during the period of employment. Never had communication that store was reaching objectives.  Sales staff was never considered in feed back on how improvements could be considered - everything was always blamed on corporate by store managers.
good,"Very helpful employess, fast paced job, lots of benefits, flexable hours. Management is great and very helpful. hardest part of the job, was possibly working the 2nd shift which was until midnight"
bad,"If you're going to be on flat rate, make sure you have some kind of guarantee. Physically being there 10 hours a day and only flagging 2 hours, is not what I would call sustainable way to make a living. They forgot to pay me once. Also, receiving your paycheck on specific calendar dates of every month, is a great way to get behind on bills."
bad,Dont work here its terrible. Underpaid and overworked are the two core points of Autonation's employee handbook. Our shop was bought out a year ago and half of the employees quit or were let go. Things have continued to go down the drain as they squeeze every employee for all they are worth.
bad,"Pay was very low for skilled labor, and expectations were high.  Managers made money hand over fist and employees weren't compensated well. Very stressful, emphasis on CSI score for dealership which gives managers bonuses and low scores takes money from employees pay.  Awful company."
bad,They give you incentive bonuses but you never actually see them. But thats how they buy you into working their salary that doesnt actually pay what you would like/expect.
bad,"You are just a number in big corporation. Nobody really care about you. However, they will compare you with others. There is no any direct, communication. No leader, no boss in FL office. "
bad,"I just had a completely bad experience all around. No time for family, talked down on by management, mishandling of paychecks, work drama, an absurd amount of salesman on the floor."
bad,This is a place that will work you to death and not care about you. They don't want to train you to do your job or give you the tools you need. They are quick to get rid of you for lies
bad,"No good ethics here and it started at the top.  Also, they do not allow for a good work/life balance.  This is a very dysfunctional company to work for and not recommended."
bad,There was absolutely no room for growth in my role at my dealership. It was definitely not a place to work if you like structure and professionalism. I enjoyed getting to know my customers but the inconsistency of communication made my role very frustrating.
bad,"This job is for an already retired person that just wants to get out the house.NO OverTime , NO pay raise , Treated unfairly, Will work 6 months just to get 4 Days off and only accumulate 4.66 hrs every month you work. Drivers do all the work but never awarded. Its an easy job just not a career."
bad,"Culture:The managerial staff that works there is unprofessional and rigid. The workers there are either buddy-buddy with management or are afraid to say anything if there is any funny business going on. "
bad,Long hours with typical sales people in this industry that will take your sale from you in a heart beat. Always have to watch your back. 
bad,"If you're honest and care about the quality of your work  -stay away."
bad,I helped the GM learn his job and was eventually let go because my position was eliminated.  Neither Corporate nor local managers had a clear idea of how to run the business
bad,"Management is so unprofessional, a lot of yelling and none of the team members are happy in the collision center. I wish I had reviewed the reviews before accepting the position."
bad,"Don't waste your time horrible management , bad management with time and inventory they don't care about employees only care about what benefits them. NO TEAM WORK."
bad,"I have worked at 2 other dealerships prior to working at Auto Nation. This company is by FAR the worst company I have ever had the displeasure to work for. It is full of blatant favoritism, desk managers that do not know how to do their jobs, no support unless you are in the "" good ol boy club "", rampant drug use ( even though it's against the policy ), worst pay plan conceivable and my all time favorite; constant belittling and scapegoating. Welcome to Auto Nation..."
bad,"I was promised a relaxed culture, and customer focused business. Nope. The want you to mislead consumers. In my book that's unethical and down right dirty. In addition to asking you to tell their lies, they will lie to you. I was promised a 5 day workweek, I got 6-7 days a week at 60+hours a day. When you break down the pay and hours you're at minimum wage."
good,"Very helpful employess, fast paced job, lots of benefits, flexable hours. Management is great and very helpful. hardest part of the job, was possibly working the 2nd shift which was until midnight"
bad,"heart breaking and gave it my all"
bad,"Horrible management "
bad,"Best description of the store a a whole is a ship about to go under but is managing to stay afloat."
bad,Management sucks!!!! There's favoritism. They work you like a slave. Absolutely NO room to grow and move on up. Pay sucks!! Open 7 days a week; you pretty much don't have a life working here. No time for your kids and family.
bad,"I spent 6 months working there  as a service advisor  after turning down another offer that was further away.  From the general manager to the service director to the techs, the place is a complete joke.  The working conditions are primitive - propane heaters in the winter and open doors in the summer - a real 'breezeway'.  Porters that cant get out of their own way and techs that can't fix a sandwich.  The customer base, as a whole, is 'credit challenged'  but you need to SELL.  You have to watch every ticket you write because all are open game to steal - with no recourse or corrections from management.  Buy yourself a metal detector and hunt some coins -  you would be better off."
bad,"Very stressful, poor management.  Poor morale among co-workers, constantly fearful of loosing my job.  Best part of the day was leaving."
bad,"No appreciation at all, no increase, no benefits and the most bad language that you can ever hear in you life."
bad,management needs to be on top of what needs to be done. Don't wait to last minuet to tell you this has to be done. To hot or to cold in shop.
bad,"Like being in high school and not in a good way."
bad,"When interviewing for a position at Autonation the hiring manager warned me that Autonation is known for ""chewing people up and spitting them out.""  I should have taken the advice and ran.  I worked as an SSC Coordinator under the direction of the ""Controller"".  There was no formal training program and what advice that was given by coworkers was inconsistent and often times incomplete.  4 weeks into the position the lack of training was evident.  I approached the Controller about training, I was assured it would be addressed.  6 weeks later the ""training"" was given, by this time it was 10 weeks into the position.  3 weeks into the ""training"" I was called into a review, and was informed that I should be further ahead in the position, and I had two weeks to make no mistakes or I would be terminated.  The Controller informed me, she expects people who work for her to work at 100% accuracy, 100% of the time and she also expects them to give her 12 hours of work in an 8 hour day. Autonation is missing the mark with competent educated employees,  because they lack a consistent training program and the unrealistic demands and expectations such as mentioned above. It is pertinent that proper training is provided in order for an employee to carry out their job successfully."
bad,"Wrong people in HR, Employees are threatened to be fired. Sad work enviornment."
bad,"Upper management are mostly young and inexperienced aside from a couple weeks of training at auto nations in house training facility. Huge disconnect between upper mgmnt and the rest of the ""common employees."" Autonation is the Walmart of auto groups. Only difference is they buy stores that are high functioning with a good reputation and turn them into junk. Stay away if you can."
bad,"Co workers were helpful but either than that low pay,takes forever to be compensated or given a raise when earned, no room for advancement unless you knew someone way higher up. Even if that person was incompetent as long as you knew someone you got promoted. You were capped off as far as you could go and get paid. Alot of free work and fixing ppls messes long hours. Everyone complain about management!"
bad,"Used to make good money, benefits were decent now cost is rediculous. Autonation has a issue of getting sued all the time. Then issues a new pay plan, and or changes everything after the lawsuit."
bad,They did nothing to help u learn and move up. the company just used you to get car done and would scam customer to buy not inspected car. came to learn they were under paying me and people there were disrespectful.
bad,"Besides the good training, I can‚Äôt think of any positives. Pay is mediocre, hours are long, management is ‚Äúok‚Äù.. if you have a life occurrence (kids, medical, etc) just kiss your job goodbye unless you are in tight with a member of management."
bad,"The pay is low, raises are a joke. The Parts Manager definitely does not like women. Pressures you to work even if you are sick (contagious). Supervisors are stealing parts and stealing time. The good old boy mentality is the way of life."
bad,"THE WORST PLACE IVE WORKED IN A LONG TIME. I would never want anyone to deal with what I‚Äôve been put through. the sales floor is flooded. they don‚Äôt pay you right. None of the cars have money in them and you get paid on gross you can‚Äôt control then get yelled at for trying to sell something else that isn‚Äôt aged. Then, any money that the deal has is hidden from you until payday. No spiffs on anything. The managers don‚Äôt want to help you and, deal take forever 3-4+hours. They blame the salesman for finance not being able to perform and would rather the deal blow out on the sales person then put them in the box. The gm calls saleman liars consistentlyand the managers create a hostile work environment and no one does anything g to stop it."
bad,"The immediate managers were wonderful to work with, unfortunately their leader is inadequate to manage such a position. The business is slow to promote advertising that would benefit it's commission-only pay plan and will rely on you to build your own customer flow. Overtime then becomes mandatory for your only way to have enough commission/income at the end of the month, unless you have worked there for many years and have referrals send you customers."
good,"Very helpful employess, fast paced job, lots of benefits, flexable hours. Management is great and very helpful. hardest part of the job, was possibly working the 2nd shift which was until midnight"
bad,"If you are complacent staying in the same position for years with the same pay, then this job is for you. In this job you will experience the exact same problems day in and day out with no resolution. Coworkers are also unhappy in their jobs and you can tell when it comes to interacting. Morale is low. If I would have known any of this before hand I would have tried and dodged a bullet."
bad,"Service manager flat out lied about how many hours technicians were flagging per pay period in order to convince me to  take the job - and they can't understand why it's so hard to find technicians. Working conditions suck, the worst workflow management (dispatching/scheduling) I've ever seen, and small parts inventory add up to pathetic productivity."
bad,"Upper management is pretty much just there to make their money. My direct manager was great. This is very important to keep in mind, if you are bilingual don‚Äôt say you are, they do not pay you any differential and you‚Äôll only be working more than your co workers for the same pay. The explanation for their low compensation ($$$) is that they offer bonus if you hit the goals, but every time you are about to get a high bonus you don‚Äôt get it because apparently overnight your percentage went below"
bad,ALL BUSINESS NO WORK LIFE BALANCE. Dog eat dog life with constant changes to management both. Senior and mid-level managers change like people change socks
bad,"Very stressful job. No room for advancement, no training. I was told i could not be promoted because I had worked with the dealership for so many years."
bad,"If you‚Äôre reading this before applying or accepting a position as Cashier/ Administrative clerk, I‚Äôd advise you to look elsewhere. Poor management and lack of communication with their employees. They are out of date with most of the technology they use in office and have no professional  cashiering system implemented, they don‚Äôt even use a register to cashier. It‚Äôs so un safe to be counting large sums of money with no privacy..you‚Äôve got customers coming in and out at all times. The hours suck you‚Äôll literally have no life!"
bad,"I worked for 2 separate stores. The company takes incentives & bonuses away when you meet them. They will rarely inform you of the inventives. 17% of my commission paychecks were incorrect, took weeks to print a new check for me on almost every occasion. Has a history of lying on vehicle inspection reports. Vindictive management and finamce teams, even when new people are hired on. The culture breeds a fundamentally toxic environment and has a history of shady business covered up with donations to breast cancer research."
bad,"Worked for Fox/Autonation for 30 years,great while it was Fox.new manager about every year or two,they hired anyone who applied.I put up with a lot because I was making 6 figures,the last straw was when they took away longevity bonuses for body shop employees only with out a word they lied to my face about it.STAY AWAY"
bad,"If you‚Äôre lazy and great at getting away with things, this is the perfect place for you!! NO HARD WORKERS THOUGH AND DON‚ÄôT THINK YOU‚ÄôLL GET A RAISE!!!"
bad,"Worked here about 5 years and you don‚Äôt have a life. Nights, weekends forget it! Also if and when you do try and take vacation it is frowned upon! Schedule changes at a drop of a hat so if you are an organized person who likes to plan personal time DON‚ÄôT WORK HERE!! You will be disappointed and quit soon. Training is good though. I learned a lot about sales and customers."
bad,Autonation only cares about the bottom line and not it's employees. They hire incompetent people and put them in managerial positions. Their service writers lie to customers just to take money from the warranty companies.
bad,"Management is poor from top to bottom. no support or encouragement, no career path or adequate training, the process plan for day to day would help the organization build its employee tenure"
bad,"I spent a few years with the company and became well acquainted with the highs and lows that came with working in a fast-paced, high turnover environment.  The team changed constantly, which is normal for a dealership, but with the change of management came a lack of leadership. The care for employee morale is extremely low and within a company that counts on motivated employees, this not only affects the environment and quality of customer service, but also the MONEY and the SALES. "
good,"Very helpful employess, fast paced job, lots of benefits, flexable hours. Management is great and very helpful. hardest part of the job, was possibly working the 2nd shift which was until midnight"
bad,I haven't worked for AutoNation in about 4 years now. The company pays salesmen with commissions from selling cars. depending on the car sold depends on how much money you make.
bad,"I worked at Autonation for abou a year as a director of finance. It was with out a doubt one of the worst work experiences for me. Work load was a lot the store was a revolving door for sales and finance managers the culture was very negative and the general manager was extremely unpleasant and micro managed everything in addition pay for the work put in was extremely low "
bad,Management is very poor. I mean extremely poor. Autonation Honda is a very unpleasant place to work. The pay is below what other car dealerships pay. They treat you horrible if you aren‚Äôt doing anything to benefit them. Worst job I ever had!!!
bad,Underpaid and treated with no respect no matter how much effort was up into the job and daily duties. managers would ignore all and any concerns any employees had.
bad,"very dishonest dealership, modern day slavery where you work only to make them money and go home and scratch your head, get loans to pay your bills :("
bad,"I made the mistake of standing up for myself and from that day forward, my controller and account manager went out of their way to make my work life miserable.  Thank God, the two other controllers and account managers were great to be around.  Unfortunately, I was not on their team."
bad,"i started as a cashier, then finished as parts shipping and receiving. the 4 years i was there i went thru 4 service managers and 4 general managers. Whenever there was a manager change there were also drastic changes to how everything operated. If your willing to work with the new manager and their changes work can be fun. the customers are awful like i can imagine at most dealers, no one wants to pay for the work that was done or pay for a diagnosis charge, and are never happy because the car had been left there for more then a week and never even looked at!! "
bad,"Willing to let you go at anytime. Like being in high school with the dramatics. Poor pay for similar positions, management is a blame you first environment with excessive threats and vulgarity."
good,"Very helpful employess, fast paced job, lots of benefits, flexable hours. Management is great and very helpful. hardest part of the job, was possibly working the 2nd shift which was until midnight"
bad,the culture of screaming GM cursing yelling like an immature child throwing a temper tantrum.  The other managers try to do their jobs however this guy won't recognize the talent around him.  This could be a great place to work. But it will take some major changes.
bad,Vacation use to be the year you worked then the changed that you have to work that yeah now 401k is a joke they still your money match is a disgrace .1 percent first 3 percent .health insurance what a joke ..if you smoke extra .if you drink extra .if you don't fit into the scale of Wight extra. All the do is charge you extra and keep putting the screws. Training .they just to pay you you average then you work 10 hours pay you 8 at your rate no your average more screwing .
bad,Lousy management. Ridiculous work load and unrealistic job expectations. My position/ workload  was actually 2 jobs melded into one and therefore not possible to achieve.
bad,"management was rude and hateful, do not know how to treat employees or customers. g.m. agreed on the management cussing out there sales professionals. but i did hear they have hired new managers and a new general manager."
bad,Poor environment for learning a complex job that pays it's employees a very low wage while overworking them. High turnover. Department rivalry. Favoritism. Managers lack effective communication and no one takes ownership for mistakes.
bad,"12-14 hours days were the norm, business direction seemed to change weekly, dishonesty everywhere. In all fairness, the real issue was with the GM which is now gone, and may not represent the culture of Autonation."
bad,"A typical day for a finance manager is from 7 am to 10-11 pm. The day is filled with washing deals, closing deals, teaching the desk managers how to structure, teaching the sales team how to sell, getting screamed at for the salespeople under performing while the desk managers are busy updating facebook. They promise the world and can not deliver. You WILL be expected to work long hours and if you are not in the top 1% you will make garbage money for your efforts. RUN!!!"
bad,"I worked there as a temp to hire for 9 months. I was told to email my supervisor my resume because they we're fixing to hire me on permanent. Two weeks later, conveniently after I helped them get through month end, I came home from a long day only to receive a phone call at 6:30 pm from my temp agency telling me they were letting me go for ""performance issues."" Funny thing is I made SLA's every day and helped other people all the time on their work. I was never late and often worked over to help out. Guess they would rather have someone who uses their computer to plan their wedding or look at Facebook, than someone willing to do any job and eager to be trained in other jobs. Their loss."
bad,can't take the corporate greed. pay plan sucks.Your bonus for the month are affected by the service departments customer service scores which I have no control over. I used to enjoy my job and coming to work but they keep making it harder to work here. .benefits are too expensive.
bad,This establishment is the worse place I have ever worked when it comes to work morale and management. Most of the managers here were terrible and did not care about customer service. A lot of burden was put onto receptionists (when they were not paid adequately) to clean up the massive issues and ineptitudes of the personnel for the different departments in the car dealership. Customer service is tragically low. About 90% of the people working here never wanted to take accountability for their actions. The location was about an hour from my house so it was definitely not easy making it to work. My co-workers for the most part were not professional. I do not recommend anyone take a job here.
bad,"Work was easy, management was pretty bad. Co-workers seemed miserable. The hardest part of the job was little to know training and slow and outdated computer software to do the job."
bad,"As you will see in the many reviews on Yelp, Autonation Toyota Scion does not have a great reputation.  They do not take care of their customers, nor do they take care of their employees.  "
bad,The last thing they care about is the employee. It's all about company profits. Gave my life to this place for years and ended up getting screwed. Don't waste your life working for them. In the end you will find out you really are just a number.
bad,"You need to sell things not necessarily needed in order to actually make any Money. Great place if your willing to compromise your morals to HIT all the ""spiffs of the month"" goals, which will change each month. Definitely a feeling of just another number coming through, you will constantly be made aware of how you are replaceable if you don't make them the $$ the want. Stay away unless your just looking to get your foot in the door. Just hope you don't get trapped! Lol"
bad,The Managers here are nothing like the managers at the other store locations and run the concept in the ground! If they got rid of this guy and his henchmen the customers would come back!
bad,the technician and services writers are great management in most stores suck and have no clue how to run a business. They do everything backwards. And in my store racism still exist
bad,rather not go into detail....there needs to be big changes though.
bad,Not having structure and regular production meetings mad it hard to keep customers updated with their repairs to their car. There was not enough accountability under current management and that also made it hard to perform my job duties.
good,"Very helpful employess, fast paced job, lots of benefits, flexable hours. Management is great and very helpful. hardest part of the job, was possibly working the 2nd shift which was until midnight"
bad,"If you've been in this occupation for any length of time you'll know that you don't join the car business for quality of life..But Autonation manages to take this fact to a whole new level. If you enjoy the worst quality of life possible whilst recieving little to no appreciation from a corporate entity, then Autonation is your dream opportunity. Decent $ if you're willing to work your life away for it. "
bad,"You are a number to them , i ran their franchise for two years when they acquired us , we knew they only bought us to sell ( we were part of a package deal) they promised us everything from the start if we stayed then changed everything including pay and then threatened us with personal lawsuits if we left. They actually sued several ex employees for leaving . Absolute garbage company"
bad,"Drink the koolaide, or prepare to fail.  The customer is always wrong, even when the dealer has clearly made a huge mistake.  It‚Äôs borderline criminal."
bad,Repairing the vehicle correctly is not a priority. It is very sad. It used to be a great place to work. Job duties are vague at best. Management is incompetent.
bad,As a tech you must find you own paycheck and will horrible service writers you never get any work sold and warranty work always gets cut times and if you don‚Äôt write a good enough story they will flag your hours and won‚Äôt pay for the work that‚Äôs was preformed. There pay grid doesn‚Äôt benefit you as a tech at all
bad,"Management curse like sailors.... Customers are called BOGS for ""bogus"" Meetings every morning and many times during the day on how bad everyone here sucks except them... If you don't like it theres the door. Don't deal with these ""people"" Honest to God run away!!!!"
bad,Got hired on only to find out that there wasn‚Äôt enough work for the technicians that were already there. Not sure why they would hire more techs when there wasn‚Äôt any work. Just because you hire more techs doesn‚Äôt mean you‚Äôre going to make more money at the end of the month. If you don‚Äôt have any work don‚Äôt hire people with false promises and disrupt their lives.
bad,"Management was great when I got there, then they got rid of them and hired two others that are terrible, one smiles in your face and paints a pretty picture then stabs you in the back and the director is nothing short of nasty, he throws fits and screams and is very spiteful..."
bad,"Small people with big titles began to make the work environment miserable to the point of it being hostile. Managerial incompetence in both managerial and positon related tasks made the job unbearable to the point where eventually turning in a notice was the only option. If you enjoy working for bosses with a mediocre grasp of the subject matter, no managerial skills, and big egos who intend to really do nothing this is the place for you."
bad,go work for a different dealer they will treat you better this store has been involved with the dealer board more times than I can count and holds no one accountable for their actions
good,"Very helpful employess, fast paced job, lots of benefits, flexable hours. Management is great and very helpful. hardest part of the job, was possibly working the 2nd shift which was until midnight"
bad,"Paycheck barely covers cost of living & expenses, currently drowning. Management is the biggest joke, no overtime or raise cuts into their bottom line."
bad,"I will not recommend this company to anyone, the training is trash, management only cares about their money. They're not professional at ALL! Even discriminate their employees and making fun of them, my best advice to you is do not ever consider to get this job because you will regret it. "
bad,Not a bad place to get your feet wet.  Large company with a lot of stores.  Like I said a good place to learn the process and with some decent training can move on to bigger or better
bad,"Not a good place to work.  Noone in upper management care   its about making money   They don't care about customers or anyone"
bad,"It is high stress in the service department. They pretend to listen to your suggestions or concerns, and never follow through with them.  When you ask for help, you really don't get it. The hourly pay isn't nearly enough for all that you do. They don't appreciate you at all."
bad,"No consistent direction,Consistently trying to economize their way to a profit . The culture is lacking in employee retention or adjustment.Hardest part of the job is trying to read between the lines"
bad,"Terrible micro-management .  Constant threat of firing.  They force you to make twice as many appointments as the shop can handle. They treat the techs like animals and don't care if they leave. "
bad,"Wouldn't recommend, very excited about the company and position. Made to feel degraded and pushed around. No management, unprofessional, tense environment"
bad,"If you like the corporate world, this may be for you. Everything will need to be processed the Autonation way. If you are looking to make money, especially as a manager look elsewhere. Used car managers make about 3K a month, because even if you could make money on a deal, the AN process and regulations will prevent this. I know new car sales managers who work tons of hours for barely covering their health insurance on their paycheck. Tons of micro managing from the top down. No flexibility or individuality there. "
bad,bad company bad insurance upper management take no responsibility in how company is ran ready to dump on the lower production.  long hours are never appreciated and
bad,"My tenure with Autonation Toyota was short and I left of my own accord."
bad,Just a number...no matter how much you've served the company and the many hours placed.  They wont hesitate to walk you out the door so mngt covers their
bad,This was the worst company that I ever worked for. Autonation bought out the dealership that I had been working for and refused to give the employees a pay plan ater two months. Management would not communicate with the staff and left everyone in the dark. They gave me no choce but to resign and find other employment where I could actually earn a decent living.
bad,"I have worked at several great dealerships over the last several years. This is the first dealership that I have seen the General Manager have no say in the way the dealership is run. It is run by the Comptroller, who is clueless and the division president who will tell you what you need to hear to keep you there. Unreal that this man can sleep at night."
bad,The employees are cool and willing to help out but managment is pathetic. You have to know people high up to keep your job or have your nose up someones butt.
bad,AutoNation Direct is a slave job! Management is nice but lost. A nice concept but flawed. You have 6-7 people that make quota. The other 60 make it 4-5 times a year.
bad,"Management was often talking down to us and discouraging workers."
good,"Very helpful employess, fast paced job, lots of benefits, flexable hours. Management is great and very helpful. hardest part of the job, was possibly working the 2nd shift which was until midnight"
bad,Yes I was working here for three years in the accounting department  office is located in Buena Park on auto center drive  it is close by knotts berry farm
bad,"Poor management, low pay long hours. Avoid this place if possible, you're treated like dirt & expected to work like a slave, 12 hour shift sometimes with no break. Management is a joke that lowers the pay rates on what they want fairly often."
bad,"Autonation consists of many middle managers that play games like the NFL. So, if your skin is the proper tone or your clothing is extremely tight fitting and professional in it's appearance , this is the company for you."
bad,I've worked here for some time now and the managers here are terrible. One manger here has a criminal record and everybody here knows it. He also smokes a joule pipe while on the clock in front of customers and he's known for being reported to HR MANY times but obviously he's still here because HR doesn't do their job either. The other managers always pick favorites with everything. Basically if you don't benefit them in any way you never have a say for anything. Their management here is sooooo unorganized. I'm quitting soon. A lot of employees already have because of the management.
bad,"Management is nice to you only until you do everything for them, one day you can‚Äôt do what they need or you can‚Äôt work the hours they need you to cover they will turn into enemies. They will make your life miserable! Also check your hours, once you go over the hours they will change them so you won‚Äôt get paid OT"
bad,"the hardest part of the job was not having a permanent work place, and the require tools to do the work, I had to be borrowing tools from other techs which was tedious sometimes to deal with some of them."
bad,"My dealership was closed down in 10 business days due to labor law violations and i was told that i would be transferred to a location with a comparable commission. Not only did they lie about the high volume of customers I would get but also the overall % of commission (2.88% for labor ONLY). I used to make 6.6% on parts and labor, needless to say the cut in pay forced me to walk out mid shift when the manager yelled at me to be grateful that I still had a job."
bad,Everyone is always in a funk late dispatching just wasn't the experience I thought it would be boss was very rude a lot of unprofessional workers no stabity
bad,"They were so unorganized from start to finish, I was never properly trained. Management was very unprofessional. Everyone was always late, it would be a great company if everyone wasnt so lazy"
bad,Being from up north the work ethic is different in the south. Management is poor and decisions are slow when a question is asked. Everyone is so worried about surveys that the human element with the customer is overlooked and quantity is more important than quality.
bad,"Was one of the best Volvo dealers on the west coast for decades. Loved working here when I started and planed to retire out of it.  Due to poor/no management and the inability to fire bad or incompetent personnel, It quickly ended up as one of the worst dealerships to work for in the area. It was very sad to watch happen and really didn't want to leave until the environment became as toxic as it did. Reputation became so bad, only applicants that could not get or maintain a job anywhere else ended up being hired at this dealership."
bad,Worked very hard got paid very poorly. Worked with good group of people. Manager at the time made lots of false promises. The grass was greener when I left. Never regretted leaving.
bad,Just do yourself a favor and keep looking elsewhere. They over employ and under deliver. What ever puts money in they're pocket they are willing to do even if it means cutting your paycheck in half.
bad,By far the worst job I've ever had. Very stressful. They take money from you because of CSI even if it's not your fault. The managers are a joke and do not care about the employees. All they care about is their check not yours.
bad,"District Mangers run the company like dictatorships and make decisions to their benefit with no regard for customers, employees or the company.  Much ignorance at the upper management level.  I pointed out a simple mistake in their parts physical inventory reconciliation process and they went ballistic after I proved they had been firing parts managers based on the company's mistakes.  It went downhill from there for me.  LUCKY for me I did not relocate my family after that 4 month ORDEAL in Corpus Christi where good help is very hard to find."
good,"Very helpful employess, fast paced job, lots of benefits, flexable hours. Management is great and very helpful. hardest part of the job, was possibly working the 2nd shift which was until midnight"
bad,"I started working at AutoNation with a promise of a great opportunity with sales leads and 25% commission. Shortly after I started my pay plan was changed to $9.50/HR + some very small unit bonuses. Then, my schedule was changed to 30 hours per week. I never did get any sales leads. All of the sales leads go to a handful of their buddies. After 3 months of being lied to, and drinking the ""Kool-Aid"", I quit. From an employee standpoint, AutoNation is by far the worst Automotive Group I have ever worked for. I would not recommend any motivated sales professional waste their time on AutoNation. They are interested only in hiring flunkies to work for peanuts in order to make the Corporate ""Big Shots"" rich."
bad,"Autonation Honda was a horrible place to work. The management are the typical car f*ck type people. The daily culture became very routine. All management cared about was sell, sell, sell...it was need enough. These people would sell out their own family if they thought that it would make them money. If you don't kiss azs, promotions are out of the questions. They benefits are the worst. Extremely expensive. This place would turn a nun into the devil in a matter off months if they didn't fire you first."
bad,"Let me see where to get started. I'll go back to the interview. The first sales manager I spoke with told me that I'd have plenty of time off (I've been 3 weeks now without an off day), also that base salary is $3,500 a month when there actually isn't a base pay. The base pay is minimum wage that you owe back. But that is what happens when you are working a job for 2 and a half weeks expecting 3k+ a month before they even have you sign the pay plan paperwork. Micromanaging is an every day once an hour task. Rain sleet snow or hail if you don't have an up (even tho you've only been there 2 weeks) you better have an appointment or you get no off day that week. To top it all off, if you don't make a ton of phone calls every day you get brought into an office and yelled at and talked to like a child. EVEN THOUGH YOU'VE ONLY BEEN SELLING CARS FOR 2 WEEKS. I was never taught the sales process. My first day ever selling cars I was put on the lot and told to go at it. I'm 19 years old and never sold cars. But it's a good thing auto nation knows how to treat people. Because my third day when I sold a vehicle I got yelled at because I didn't have all the paperwork. Talk about irony. Icing on top of the cake: I caught a fresh up and put him in a vehicle he loved. Had him sold. But seeing how we can hire new associates every week but not get a finance manager to punch in deals, he had to walk. That was on my first week. I just now figured out how to find my no sales in compass. When I look back he's not even under my name anymore. He's already had an appointment scheduled through a 20+"
bad,"Nothing positive to say, well one...benifits are good. otherwise general negative enviroment and what appears to be weak HR department to correct/ train managemnt on people skills and people managemnt/ team building."
bad,Had room for advancement on occasion. had fun employees and some good times.New management has issues and they do not care about their employees or customer service.
bad,Worked here for years with a lot of good people. If you can get past the horrible work life balance and lack of care from management there is good money to be made with this company. Don't expect to be appreciated however.
bad,"The original concept of the USA brand was great until they decided to go back to the more traditional style of dealership. The sales floor is flooded with too many salespeople. Management seems lost and has no sense of direction. A lot of favoritism and biased towards certain salespeople. One person would get written up for something while others get away with the same things without any repercussions. Ever since the pay plan change, sales is getting paid far less than what most dealerships pay. They either need to revamp this whole store or shut it all down  it‚Äôs a lost cause."
bad,Was ok but not paid for what you do one manager was chill other was rude. You will be promised raises or bonuses that will never happen. They a wish washy with all rules
bad,"don't do it pay plan terrible high stress long hours"
bad,"Management was more or less fine in the beginning, but over the course of 2 years, it has driven customers away and with it the work required for technicians to make money. From my understanding, a lot of fault falls at the dealer level. However, corporate has been lowering labor times to the point that they are below what it actually takes to complete the job, and lowering labor times in the few repairs technicians can recuperate the money lost from other repairs. Overall, when corporate lower labor times, the dealer raise labor rates, and management can't hire quality service advisors customers are going elsewhere and technicians and advisors can't earn a paycheck. "
bad,Being that you will probably be the only one working on anything in your department whenever you ask your manger for help theyll look at you like they have no idea what your talking about.
bad,"Poorly managed company with constantly changing upper management. Lacked consistency and structure. Made daily duties difficult. No set schedule, which affects family life."
bad,0 work life balance. Pay plan is currently the worst I've seen.  This combination makes for a hard place to enjoy working for. Even if you like doing what you do.
good,"Very helpful employess, fast paced job, lots of benefits, flexable hours. Management is great and very helpful. hardest part of the job, was possibly working the 2nd shift which was until midnight"
bad,"Was unlawfully fired by this store. I was a loyal employee that was never late, worked on my days off, met and exceeded goals, worked multiple bell to bell days often,and never had a write up. Never had a survey from customers that was below 90%. Even with all the efforts I put in this company the GM told me he didn't want to work with me and would not allow me on his team. The GM even went as far as to threaten me saying if I was allowed to stay he would put a target on my back and discussed how he was doing the same thing to another employee. Even though I had 2 appointments set up for the day he told me to go home. Upon leaving I immediately contacted HR in person and was told there is nothing I could do and that management could do and treat me however they want. They even told me I resigned. How can someone resign if they were threatened and told to leave. I fought for me job but was defeated in an unethical way. If you dont mind being abused by management this is the right company for you."
bad,"Autonation just plane stinks the managers have no concept of time expecting you to know the job within ! week and making up excuses not to answere your questions . Also when you do get hired be prepared to wait up to 60 day;s before they get all of the passwords and training material you need to learn and do your job if they dont fire you first. And be prepared for the lies you will be told all the time because once they know any info about your personal life outside of work or see any type of struggle they will try to make you fail and then have a idiotic caring smile and demenor like they care they dont, like most corporations today its all about the money. Just dont work for them its a waist of time and emotionally exausting becuase in the end your nothing to them. If you do get fired leave them off your resume. Even though its against company policy for them to say detailed info about you to another employer they will anyway's, they did it to me and lied so i wouldnt get hired by another company"
bad,Out side of the location advertised no matter how qualified. Nor will will regional HR work or communicate with applicants. A waste of time and offers no future to those wanting to advance career.
bad,"I could write a book on how horrible it is to work for autonation. Management is by far the worst part of being with autonation. Managers only last a few yrs before they are let go and a new set brought it. They only care about numbers. Dealer problems go unresolved and when you complain, the problem is brushed off. When customers complain, autonation's answer is to just give them everything for free. When customers bring their car in for service, they are charged premium prices yet are given aftermarket parts but aren't told about it. That is just autonations's way of putting more money in their pocket. The stress level is by far more then a lot of people can handle. Everything has to be done NOW, doing your job at a normal pace is not what autonation expects. But when dealers need something from autonation, they have to wait months. Technicians are treated as the lowest people in the dealer. Most cars are rarely fixed right the first time because you are rushed to get it in and out. Instead of hiring qualified workers to do jobs, autonation just shuffles people within the dealer to different positions. One day your a cashier, the next day a service adviser. This is a way for them to avoid paying for good workers. The list goes on, the only good thing about autonation is the benefits. They provide longevity pay, good set of vacation days that go up based on how long you have been with them. Word of advice, go work for a family owned dealer."
bad,"Managers never listen to employee side when a customer complained, managers have their favorite employees and that employee can do no wrong. Very stressful to work there."
bad,"Advisors hardly want to upsell services for techs, leaving you out to dry for hours at a time, and forcing you to waste your time. Management is horrible. Few cars per day. No cars equals no money, need I say more."
bad,"AutoNation is highly focused on process and as such, as a manager, you find a large portion of your day is committed to cleaning up the CM.  Which, to thier defense, thier follow up process is proven successful.  "
bad,"When I worked there, it was nice at first. There was good and bad times. The most hardest part of the job was rush hour. Only because when you needed the other porters they were no where to be found, so there was only like two porters around or just even one porter. Yes the customer representatives would help or the cashiers would help as well; but not always. Most days at that workplace were good. The management there was very horrible. Management there I would have to say, that there two-faced, don't help you with a question you might ask, or if you're trying to look for them there no where to be found at all. The workplace culture is good for the most part. The most enjoyable part of the job was driving the customers to and from there homes and to the dealership. When I got to drive customers to there homes or to the dealership, It was the only time you get to think to yourself and calm down from all of the stress or even just getting out of the workplace for a little bit. You get to listen to the customers stories and get to actually talk to them and see how there day is going or see what's going on with there car or truck. It was fun for the most part. I just wouldn't say it would be a good job if your just not ready to have a job yet. Or to refer to a friend to work there."
bad,Owner is rediculous and makes his managers act rediculous in return. they do not offer fair practices and have been under investigation for illeagal practices which makes all people in this field look bad.
bad,I had tools stolen and toolbox was vandalized and harassed. So if you like to work in that kind of envorment and not to mention you will never advance in this company so i would not recomend working for this company
bad,this is a good place to work if you have the experience. if you are new to the field then it could be a struggle. things change way too often and things get twisted all over the place and end up making things way more complicated than need be.
bad,"People promoted unfairly.  Not through hard work, job dedication and experience but through who you know.  I detest companies that do that.  Despite that I do love my coworkers.  Just wish GM and higher ups would give raises to the hard working hourly workers who deserve it and have worked hard for it.  No one cares for the service department workers.  Its all about sales.  Even though service brings in more money."
bad,"Constantly busy, always short staffed. Communication is non-existent, and you're treated less than garbage. Don't even get me started on the disorganization! They hired a third-party valet service, which cost me my job. They gave me no warning, and I only found out because my now ex-boss was kind enough to let me know about the situation only minutes before my shift started."
bad,Management doesn‚Äôt seem Understand employees limitations. Was hired as a express technician. Shortly after being successful in the program they expressed to me that they would like be to try a new trade in the Autonation umbrella. They offered me a position on a used car reconditioning team but as a window tinted. I saw they really needed my help and said that I‚Äôve never tried to tint windows before. Training was provided and I wasn‚Äôt 100 on the completion of tinting windows. Told them I felt the quality wasn‚Äôt good. They said it was fine. Well guess what if the customer comes back complaining about the tints your forced to remove and clean up the tints for Free. Not to mention that they pay three hours to install and would take me six hours to complete on job. It all adds up to losing money on a flat rate pay. Basically your working for no compensation. When you brought up you concerns to them they would bully you into doing it anyway. Finally after what seemed like years they removed me from used cars and placed me on the express team again. Was excited to make money again I began to work towards my goal. When one of the top administrators came up to me and said ‚Äú just so you know your still our tint guy‚Äù. I told him I couldn‚Äôt Survive doing that service and that I‚Äôll need to make more hours. ‚ÄúYour the only on in the building that can do them so we need you to do them‚Äù. After walking away I tried to discuss my issue with my lead and store manager. When the administrator came up to us he asked what was going on that‚Äôs when I told him that I felt like he wants me to leave cause
bad,"Straight commission. You don't sell, you don't get paid. The pay is not work the hassle or the stress. You could waste 60 mins on 1 customer to sell a $30 part. Had to work long hours just to make it, barely. Most of the people that worked there were alright."
bad,The local management was not interested in coaching the sales reps to success. They were more interested in keeping sales tips and experiences to themselves. It was an old car sales environment of where the sales rep had to either sink or swim. I also believe that the compensation program helps foster this attitude because if the sales rep cannot close a sale by themselves the Sales Manager gets the commission. So there is no incentive to Sales Management to help the Sales Rep succeed
good,"Very helpful employess, fast paced job, lots of benefits, flexable hours. Management is great and very helpful. hardest part of the job, was possibly working the 2nd shift which was until midnight"
bad,The company is great overall however like any place it has it's ups and downs . I loved the place however the hours are extremely long it cut into a lot of my school time.
bad,I am a registered Cannabis patient in Florida and dispite this I was suspended without pay and later the next day terminated due to what they describe
bad,I worked for them in three different states.   Each state was Different. Just like any business there is good and dad in this Job but over all it was a good experience
bad,A lot goes under the table if you are not one of them you won‚Äôt get fed. All sales are base commissions and you might be there all day and not one customer walks in that day you didn‚Äôt make a penny   It‚Äôs just waist of time at the end of day  you have to know the big guys to get spoon in order to make money
bad,"Low pay and toxic environment! Car dealerships are notorious for dysfunctional people, excluding a handful of very desirable people I befriended. The others are some kind of nuts! "
bad,"Managers are only out for themselves, they work to move out the people that work hard, and have a ""clique"" of who they like. "
bad,"if you want to not get paid fully and excuses after excuses on benefits plus unobtainable percentages goals instead of actuals then go for it.  The company was in need of a complete change from the top down. Poor management and poor pay for sales people. There is an old adage that says "" There are to many dictators and not enough workers"" this is where they put untrained and no common sense people in positions that created a very stressful and hostile work environment."
bad,Loved working with most of the sales people. Management had little to no personnel training. Sales Managers attitudes killed deals.Only carried expensive pre-owned vehicles. No TV advertising. Managers gave eComm deals to Floor salespeople.
bad,"Autonation has decline in there way they do business. Knowledge of area of improvement, do very little in making adjustments. Needs to revisit the basic ways of managing."
bad,"You're incredibly limited in what you can do or say, if it's not 100% all the time you get chewed out. There's not enough money in the world to ever consider working here again."
bad,"After 20 years in automotive I decided to try working at a dealer, too bad I picked a bad one. The company is driven by bottom line only, they don't give two craps about employees or customers just the almighty dollar.  Poor Management I can't believe the General Manager keeps his job in my short 8 months there he chased off the two Ford master techs that the dealer had, then my service Manager quit, I ran the service dept while they looked for a replacement I lost pay while doing that was made promises then when new service manager transferred in was lied to that they we never made. I resigned and new boss begged me to stay.  From what I have read sounds like this is a problem nation wide. Work 70 80 hrs a week and get abused. I wonder if upper management doesn't know or just doesn't care!"
bad,"Stress, intimidation, and chaos. Dealing with people who have no clue about what needs to be done, just about the P/L statement. There is no joy in mudville! 4 years and no raise while the stocks double in value. Make you all warm inside!"
bad,"Typical day would be making cold calls trying to sell them vehicles, then competing with a handful of reps that are waiting for walk in. You could work 10 hours a day and not make any money (worked for free basically). The hourly pay is a joke but commission can be good but is not consistent. Once in the process of actually selling you have to negotiate with the customers AND with management. You'll be going back and forth, some of the managers make you question how they got to their position. You'll also have to deal with angry customers because reps are being told to lie to callers and tell them we have a vehicle available when it's not. People will drive from Houston, Dallas, San Antonio because they were lied to and we have to deal with it. No integrity."
bad,If you are looking for work with no life/work balance then this is the job for you. Management needs to be realistic about expectations and ensure that new hires have proper training.
bad,"During 4 years of growth, I‚Äôve realized that bending backwards for a publicly traded company is that you are just a number. They do not care about your personal life, holidays and work life balance. And it doesn‚Äôt help having a micromanaging GM who AutoNation is blinded to see is the problem and root cause of a 156% turn over rate in the store in the last 20 months. Pay plan is terrible and not morale boosting. Pay plan puts managers against sales associates as they are paid gross vs units. Health care is also very expensive and not worth is it you have many kids. Only seems to be worth it if you have cancer."
good,"Very helpful employess, fast paced job, lots of benefits, flexable hours. Management is great and very helpful. hardest part of the job, was possibly working the 2nd shift which was until midnight"
bad,Typical work day starts at 7 am work 5-6 days a week very stressful but learned to deal with it and multi task. Management not helpful for most part and do not have your back. Workplace culture is good among work mates and we all get along well. Hardest part is  constant judgement of everything you do and being blamed for things that have nothing to do with you or your job. The most enjoyable is the friends you meet and work with that are my co workers.
bad,"I had a bad experience, from the management on down.  Didn't give bonuses, cold calling, micro-management and lost deals. Most of the day is spent standing around outside or calling customers that put you on the blocklist."
bad,Don‚Äôt go work for the Subaru parts department. The manager doesn‚Äôt treat employees equally. He will drown you with work while his close friends sit around.
bad,"Over worked, Not happy , Poor leadership , Long Hours under staffed, People are out for them only, no training in place, no leadership, they hire people in charge that have no right being there"
bad,"Most sales managers ""lead"" by verbal abuse.  Corporate doesn't care about employees, only their own wallets.  Sales is a JOKE.  Pay plans are horrible, management is horrible, just stay away."
bad,Their motto is do more with less. they overwork their employees. They promise culture changes and do not deliver. They have a high turnover rate. Leadership is lacking.
bad,"No opportunity to advance unless you know people in the company. "
bad,I have worked for only a few Dealerships and can honestly say they don't care about their employees in the least.  On multiple occasions I have seen coworkers belittled for performance in front of all peers.  No training or encouragement given.
bad,"Unfortunately the Car sales world is outdated by centuries in terms of proper ethics."
bad,"After you start work, should any questions come up there was always someone to give you an answer.  I loved a heavy work load."
bad,"Autonation is a very well established , I have learned many different things while working with this company . "
bad,"AutoNation is a very hard company to work for, there is a lack of management, dedicated workers, and loyalty."
bad,"Auto nation took over our great, family run dealership into a miserable work Enviroment for employees and customers! Pay is terrible, bottom line is all money. Your just a number at auto nation, both employees and customers!"
bad,"low pay, long hours. I was able to drive any car i could ever imagine."
bad,"DONT go to work here."
bad,"Rather not, do not feel it will not make a difference. Spoke with GM and management throughout my employment, deception was an acceptable behavior towards peers and customers."
bad,"You will only succeed if you know the right people and are in with them.  If you are not friends with the right people, they will blatantly limit your ability to get in front of customers which in sales is a death sentence."
bad,"This one in particular proved to me and others that if you want to stay employed, you must always be honest... even when it‚Äôs the worst thing to tell the customer: ‚ÄúSorry we didn‚Äôt get to your car as promised, the tech was busy working on a car that made him more money. He also had too many tickets for the day... sooooo Yea.‚Äù ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è And they expect you to answer for any and all negative feedback that comes from the customer no matter if it was something you were aware of, or not. It‚Äôs *always* yours fault. And it could easily mean your job.. Work/Life balance? Lol .... You‚Äôre usually there from 5:30am to 7pm. At least on Saturday you get a shorter day. If you can get past those issues, then the last one is the hardest, IMO:  Pleasing the techs. They only like you if you oversell everything that pays them well, and takes very little time. They‚Äôll also overcharge for their hours worked. Change a battery? 1.5 book hours. Actual time it takes? 3 minutes. Cost to customer $199.50/labor + parts. Need to do major mechanical work? Max hours per book, max use of small parts, max use, etc. No way do they care about anything but their paychecks."
bad,Very belittling how they spoke to us. No corrective mentoring for things you didn‚Äôt know  expected u to know them although u were never in the business prior.
good,"Very helpful employess, fast paced job, lots of benefits, flexable hours. Management is great and very helpful. hardest part of the job, was possibly working the 2nd shift which was until midnight"
bad,"Poor and very small inventory, poor quality cars since used car manager cuts corners in repairs to make profits. "
bad,"Long hours and 12 hour saturday .No life kind of job."
bad,"How to students to work for them that are happy and make $2,000 a month real salesmen should be making 8 to $12,000 a month. Managers not as hungry as I worked at other dealerships"
bad,"As an experienced sales professional it was difficult. Upon hiring was told Sundays off would be fine. One full week of training and script memorization, only to be told after training that the schedule was only maybe and would most likely have to work Sundays after first week or two. When approached about pay, it was nothing but ""old"" pay vs ""new"" pay but no numbers. Basically told you will work for base and split commissions first 3 months. When your ""mentor"" decides you are ready... it was ridiculous. You don't hire professional sales people and treat them like fresh out of school college kids. Heavy turnover and disgruntled employees who are more than willing to tell you all about the constant ""new"" management. VERY disappointing."
bad,Plenty of work. If you are willing to find it.  Worked a lot of late nights.  The service team was good.  But management was not so good. The techs there are nice and so are the service advisors and parts people.   Always willing to help.
bad,AutoNation is enriched in a culture of racial bias. It seems each race group promotes their own kind. AutoNation is not supportive of African American growth within their organization.
bad,"I don‚Äôt have any thing bad to say about the management but you better get it in writing before you leave your current job. The service advisor position is a fast pace position with that being said one would only think that if you are writing 25 to 30 customers a day that you would be making $$ wrong!!"
bad,"It's not what training says it is. Management says one thing but does another. Turnover rate is what you would expect it to be. Long hours not for everyone. Usually only one day off a week, and one Sunday off a month. Traffic is very slow."
bad,"Car sales are at a weird place and autonation is trying to figure out a system that works. As of right now, I would stay away. You can make decent money in sales but it comes at a cost. you don't get payed overtime for those 10-15 extra hours you had to work. You are payed minimum wage with a per unit compensation package. "
bad,"I was stuck in a room with two ladies who were very negative, childish and downright bitter which made for a very difficult and extremely unpleasant work environment and there was nothing any of the managers were willing to do about how these two women treated their co-workers."
bad,If you are error proof this is the company for you.  Management is not on your side. they enjoy making you feel inadequate. they don't want to teach you anything they execpt you to walk in the door already knowing   This company is pretty much data entry at any level. if you enjoy punching numbers and being told your not moving fast enough than please work here.
bad,"antiquated CRM ... inaccurate data scale for judging production ... Lack of Team participation is encouraged by managers actions ... Uses ancient ""carrot and stick"" approach to failed motivation techniques.  Managers lack ability to take responsibility and are extremely unprofessional.  Managers fail to control questionable conduct of employees."
bad,the company needs a lot of improvement after fire in 2015. the company lost employees left and right do to management and not enough hours. the company was a good company before fire.
bad,"At this company all of your work is done through the computer. Employees typically work about 9 hours each day, but most of your coworkers are super helpful and knowledgeable about the payroll industry."
bad,"Poor Management and no communication from General Managers."
bad,"Good place to get training but managers are incompetent and very unprofessional! They pick favorites. Very high turnover rate. It is very difficult to make more than a ""mini"" on a car deal. Over all I wouldn't recommend anyone to work at AutoNation."
bad,I worked for autonation Nissan in Memphis TN. The job seemed cool seeing that I was in school for automotive technology and they were hiring for a trainee position. I must say that I did not receive proper training on certain things and I had to figure out on my own. Co-workers where helpful some were not. I got let go for something I was not trained on doing and when asked for help no one showed me or assisted me even though I was suppose to be in TRAINING. As a manager you should make sure your that your trainee should know the ins and out on certain problems and make sure with what ever task he or she is faced with they have the knowledge and understanding to complete that task successfully.
good,"Very helpful employess, fast paced job, lots of benefits, flexable hours. Management is great and very helpful. hardest part of the job, was possibly working the 2nd shift which was until midnight"
bad,This is a good place to be with decent pay and benefits. They are a corporate owned dealership that values its customers above all.
bad,"Problems in the shop go unnoticed or ignored. Always an impending mutiny atmosphere in the shop. No equality when jobs are ""dispatched"". ""Raises"" are restructured pay plans to make it harder to make the same $$ as previous year. That's IF they decide to give you a raise.."
bad,"I liked my job, but we were not allowed to do it correctly. There is no appreciation for doing your job well, but if you make a mistake, they write you up. I was told 3 different times that my mistakes were intentional. Our manager did not support us, she berated us. "
bad,"This place is more a slave operation than a world class business, the work hours are unreal, and the expectations are even more ridiculous. If you have an issue with management the HR department will go to the GM and let them know what are you complaining about and the treatment you receive after that will force you to quit or you will be fired without reason or merit. Do not ask questions that is also not welcomed here"
bad,"When I initially started there the culture was good.  Started off with some issues with one of the managers there that seems to nit pick at everything but once he was under control the culture was great.  Everyone got along, the job functionality was functional, the work load became light was we had a system going and things were moving along."
bad,"i would drive cars to and from accounts"
bad,"this company must have a revolving door policy. in the short time I was there, so many other employees came and went."
bad,Business is very slow. They have way too many sales people and no business. They refuse to advertise. Poor management.
bad,A typical day would be to come into work and clock in. Then I would make popcorn and check to see if coffee needs to be made. I then check phone messages and emails. I get papers from the service and accounting departments to file. I print out salesman letters to send to customers. Throughout the day I answer and transfer phone calls
bad,Taking care if customers??? Ha. Management is more concerned about looking good for upper management. Chop shop environment. Bring employees in and then push them out. Way to go guys
bad,This job is a on the go job where you are getting in and out of your work truck and popping in and out of your accounts. Its a stressful and fast paced environment where your having to meet many task and management is not considerate at all. You are responsible to complete many task with very low pay and most of the time your working through your lunch. Only good from the job were some of the people i met and the experience i gained
bad,Low moral ! Work way two many hours for the pay ! Management overbearing! And for god sake don't make any mistakes! I like most of the people I work with !I been in the car business for thirty years !
bad,Quick to forget the effort you put into your job. They do not promote from within. They do not have there employees best interest in mind. Not worth the effort of putting your best foot forward.
bad,This company would be great to work for if it was not for Poor Management with poor communications along with no integrity. They cleaned house and it seems to have gotten worse not better.
bad,Working as a parts delivery driver traveling 300+ miles everyday for $12 an hour was extremely unsatisfying.  Lack of concern for driver safety and no prevailing wages for those traveling long distances was ultimately what killed it for me. The manager was great but was provided very little in the way of support from his higher ups often putting him in difficult positions with his staff. I would not recommend working here unless you are desperate or without much work experience.
bad,"It's enough that I already don't have an interest in cars in my personal life, but selling them made it worse. Of course I have learned more about vehicles than I already did but this place is just not good at all; but if you like cars and like sells, then come on aboard. Otherwise...stay away from this dealership."
bad,"In the beginning they used to have an incentive for new hire's, you made $1500/ bi weekly for training pay, which would usually last about 2-3 months. After that you are commission based. It would have been great and I could have done a lot better if I would have gotten my training as soon as I started. However I didn't go to training until about 3-4 months in. In between then I was shadowing other salesmen. I learn a little bit more than what I already knew about selling so that was cool. Management wasn't really the best, they did keep me there for as long as they could. They eventually let me go because I didn't sell enough cars that month and they definitely gave me a fair warning before hand. It honestly wasn't for me, I hated selling cars. It just wasn't in me, but if you can push through and learn all the ropes and enjoy it, it can be a very rewarding career. The money was great though. They do kind of con you a bit out of your money. For instance, if you sell like 8 cars and make like $1500 for those two weeks, but one of the cars you sell has a bonus on it for like $1k. You'd get the $1500 plus the $1k, but your next pay check you'd be taxed out the waaazzooo for it. I hated getting bonus's, because I'd know I wouldn't have a pay check the next two weeks. I mean I say try the job out if you want to, it doesn't hurt to try, you may be really good at it. It just wasn't for me!"
bad,"The store I worked at we're racist fired me for a mistake that the parts person made and accused me of a missed diagnosis which was untrue, just racist"
good,"Very helpful employess, fast paced job, lots of benefits, flexable hours. Management is great and very helpful. hardest part of the job, was possibly working the 2nd shift which was until midnight"
bad,Working here was horrible. I was in there from sun up to sun down for very little pay. Working in a car dealership as a women is something I would not suggest to another woman.
bad,"Service advisors and management do a good job of running off business. I used to love coming to work for Autonation everyday. Now, I can't wait to get away from this corrupt organization."
bad,"I worked there for a little over 2 years. I only got one raise during my time, but I was the hardest working employee in my department. I worked long hours and got a lot done. If I was ever out of work to do, I never hesitated to find other tasks to complete around the shop to stay busy. Overall, I was taken for granted and used for my productivity without fair compensation or even so much as an ""attaboy."" AutoNation is a terrible greed-driven, corporate-run slave factory."
bad,A lot has changed since my departure. During my time there was a lot of mandatory over time that did not allow a life outside of work. I learned a lot while I was there with a lot of friendly co-workers and manager team.
bad,"Your busy all day doing all sorts of task..Assisting customers with car needs. Performing vehicle inspections, writing repair orders, handling phone calls, talking with technicians, selling repairs and services. Keep track of WAITING customers.."
bad,"The pay plan is rediculously low."
bad,Corny compensation plan complete waste of time. No creativity flexibility understanding. or thriving work plan for career advancement. felt very stuck in the same place.
bad,"If you want to work in the Payroll Department then you would need to know that the Management team is still trying to figure out the best way to organize the payroll department, the schedules, whether to go paperless or not and which system works best.  Since most people think they are downsizing; they will not be willing to help anyone new that comes in. It is very unorganized and they do not appreciate employees.  If there is any emergency within the company ie.. bad weather, gas leaks, or any other emergency then they expect you to use your Vacation day even if you are evacuated from the building due to their own issues.  "
bad,"The Seattle base of AutoNation is run like a dairy farm. Most employees are used like cattle paid like poppers and treated like children."
bad,To much micro management in a job setting where it is not needed. Wouldn't recommend anyone who has sold cars to work here unless its your last resort. If your new to the business then this will be a ok start for you.
bad,"It was car sales, exactly what you think of for car sales. some days were good, but most were not so good. the management and especially the owner were completely out of touch with their employees. Oh also didn't help that i caught them taking money from our sales for things that should have been covered by the company, ex. window was cracked and put on lot before it was fixed by shop. I sold it after 1 day on lot and was told it would be covered by company, ended up coming out of my pay. went from a high commission to a minie ."
bad,"Too much favoritism, Internet department scheduled appointments with unrealistic expectations by the customers. Good leads were distributed to a certain clique. Unrealistic internet leads were distributed to the rest of the sales people."
bad,"no training for f&i for months "
bad,"Interviewed for a totally different position, but was somehow roped in to training for sales associate at AN USA Houston. Training was half decent, I learned a lot, and aside from Panera every day for a month, I'd say it was enjoyable. However once I was put in the store full time, things changed. I was essentially told to forget everything I had learned and quickly realized the morals there were pretty stereotypical of car sales despite learning otherwise in training. Only one of the managers was actually decent enough to get along with, but everyone else was rude and unhelpful whilst I was still trying to learn. Hardly any inventory to sell to begin with, with promises for more that never happen. I left after only a few weeks of being in the store and 1 measly car sale and I doubt anyone even noticed. But hey, I suppose the facility is nice (especially service), despite being in a pretty bad part of town. I'm sure AutoNation as a whole is great to work for but AN USA, at least for now, is a joke."
bad,overall I love working for AutoNation. The expectations are clear from day one. Training is improving but you have a small window to deliver results or they will find your replacement well before your time runs out. This can cause some anxiety in the mid management ranks. Pay plans were recently changed to promote volume based selling.
bad,"I loved it at first but after many management changes, it became stressful. I never got the help I asked for or a raise after teaching myself everything. It feels like a family for the most part but the job itself is too much for not enough pay. It started becoming cliquey and frustrating to work in."
bad,Work there for 6 months and wasn't worth it. Treated poorly there and when I started working there everyone was leaving for rival companies. Says alot right there about the company.
good,"Very helpful employess, fast paced job, lots of benefits, flexable hours. Management is great and very helpful. hardest part of the job, was possibly working the 2nd shift which was until midnight"
bad,"everyone the boss,brand new plant they build; than closed the doors only in three years.Auto Nation gave us  great luncheon than told us that the doors will be closed on Monday,that we all have no job."
bad,"Miserable culture and management.  Tired to trump up charges to get me to quit and finally said ""we are eliminating your position."" So glad to be out of a poorly run dealership and unfriendly environment for employees and customers."
bad,"Your daily week will consist of 55-65 hour work week six to seven days a week. Unrealistic expectations from upper corporate management who make too much money in my opinion for what they do. Pay plan is unstable and so are rules and policies. HR does not care about you, they are just there to protect company profit."
bad,Never satisfied Office Manager or upper managers. More stress than it was worth. Enjoyed my time helping with phones but couldn't work on anything from my desk at the phones. Most enjoyable was talking to other stores but that was 15min of my day.
bad,A typical day at work is do calls on warm leads to get the customer in the store to convert to a sale. You typically work a minimum of 60 hours per week with one day off.
bad,terrible hours long shifts no life and work balance horrible management
bad,I worked for a Subaru store and enjoyed the environment and the product. We were paid on a volume pay plan. Recently AN changed to a compensation pay plan. This did not work for this location because cars were regulary advertised and priced under cost. In that case we would only be paid between $100 to $150 per car. No hourly pay or salary. I quit after my check 6 months in a row being about 40% of what is once was.
bad,"Management decides how cars are repaired, even when factory trained technicians tell them the repair is against manufacturer specs. If you speak up, they will fire you indirectly for insubordination."
bad,There is no way to advance fairly at this company.  The only one's who receive promotions are the people who sit around and don't do extra to show what they are worth.
bad,"Bad management that would yell when he did not meet his quota. New employees all the time, they will just replace you. Only do this job temporarily till you find something better."
bad,"It was pretty easy; I enjoyed the job. Pace was durable. Kept busy. It was quite at time and it could turn noisy; like I said I enjoyed it very much."
bad,"Upper management and district staff treat you like trash. GM gets all the credit and non of the liability when the store is failing."
bad,The way they take care the customers is the same way they take care their employees. You field like you they want to rip you off with you hours and favoritism is at max at this place.
bad,"Stressful work environment, lack of management for lower areas of the dealership. Schedule was never consistent and never got paid for my overtime when I worked there even though i worked for 10+ hours each day for 6 days a week."
bad,"checks are not consistent, you will work 2 weeks and wait another week for your check. "
bad,"This company is great to work for, if in the right environment. They give you the tools you need to succeed but not if the management and the employees are degrading"
bad,No. This job is a no for careers. Lots of paperwork on everything. People are what makes everything possible for a decent atmosphere and enjoyable job.
bad,"The management at the store is poor. The advancement is also very tiny with no organization or fair pay. A typical day at work is coming to the shop, clocking in and trying to get through the day without having a curveball hit you. I've learned not much but everything has been from my own teaching and not from any management. the people who work with you are good, the employees are nice and fun to work with but the management is not. The hardest part of the job is to not get aggravated through the day. The most enjoyable is having a breather away from the constant workload."
good,"Very helpful employess, fast paced job, lots of benefits, flexable hours. Management is great and very helpful. hardest part of the job, was possibly working the 2nd shift which was until midnight"
bad,Auto Nation allowed me to be promoted into management although it had it's flaws at the location I worked at. It was definitely a great challenge and learning experience for the career i plan to be in.
bad,"General Manager is a horrible person and she should not be in charge of people, or in the same vicinity as anyone else for that matter. She yells and screams inappropriate words to management and employees in front of customers rather than pull the employee aside and speak to them professionally."
bad,"When the dealership fired the General Manager who hired me and hired another General Manager, the whole atmosphere of the store changed for the worse. She proceeded to fire several managers and brought in her own people. This is typical of most traditional dealerships."
bad,"The hours are there and the employees are great. The managers are not good at all, they mistreat the employees, almost no days off, 12 hour shifts, and the general managers are the worst here. They treat the employees like trash. I am not making this up. It was great when I first started and I would of never considered leaving but when they hired the new G.M. And service managers everything went upside down. You have to almost beg for a day off for an emergency. The good thing is the hours are there if you want to work but it's very stressful."
bad,one day you  have accrued vacation next it gone .one year you have matching 401 k next it's gone . sell sell  sell  that's all they want whether  customer needs or not .. management lies to you and wants to retain you lies. not only to customers and  mechanics .they think buying luch makes up for all the hours . they treat everyone the same .take a day off and when you return you wonder if you still have a job
bad,"Due to poor business practices, they will lay off without warning but expect the very same employees to perform at peak levels. There is no generosity or goodwill behind such practices."
bad,cut-throat.  not much else to add.  worked for over 3 years and slowly became unhappy working in that environment the bar was always moving and the pay plan always changed.
bad,All though the schedule is steady.  The pay is low and  there are no advancement opportunities.  The is also no annual raises for employees only management.
bad,"Good money, however that is about it. You will not like the work hours or the changing conditions of work, which seems to change weekly. Unreasonable expectations. Management that is either good and they get transferred, or in the case of some, not fit for management"
bad,"Employees are taken advantage of and are either overworked or given no work at all. Management needs improvement. Very unorganized, and an overall unpleasant work environment."
bad,"small company great learning environment,  must be open to constant change, updates, responsibility changes in the position and dedicated to being a help to your peers as a team."
bad,"At Toyota, the managers do not move peopled positions up because he has his favorites. There are more people that are getting hired, but their experience level is pretty bad because someone of them and I worked before at the same company."
bad,"not a good long term place to work for."
bad,The organization need more improvement management not good the manager suck to be honest. They takes forever to fix an issues.... they usually makes a lot mistake on your paycheck and hours..... its alot
good,"Very helpful employess, fast paced job, lots of benefits, flexable hours. Management is great and very helpful. hardest part of the job, was possibly working the 2nd shift which was until midnight"
bad,"very busy, stressfull management is very rude  no body cares basically its one man for his own, not too happy on how things are done here horrible mondays"
bad,Car business can be fun at times but the long hours and huge fluctuations with income has brought me to the point of wanting a career thats mnore stable.
bad,"As a service cashier I interact with customers, service advisors, porters (valets), and technicians. I checkout the customers who have to pay for services from oil changes, new tires, and recalls. I schedule appointments through phone or in person. I help customers find where they need to go. There is filing and data entry. "
bad,"Job flexibility is nonexistent and the pay could be a lot better. The pros are that Autonation is all over the country and has a high turnover rate so there is room for advancement for the right ""type"" of person. If you are not one of these type of people, then stay if you are being compensated fairly but if not there are much higher paying companies out there with a lot more room for advancement!!!!!!!!"
bad,The Service department is waking nightmare!!! The technicians have no respect for authority and are not held accountable for anything they do wrong.  There was obvious favoritism.  The advisors were held more responsible for work done on vehicles than the technicians.  The management is aware of the problems but continues to make no advances for improvement. They will continue to lose good employees while covering up mistakes from the bad employees!!
bad,under staffed at all stores. would like it if they had more caring staff and people who want to work. its hard to work at a place that no one cares about.
bad,"You'll learn a lot from this job, but if you want something with a decent work life balance and pay, you will need to take your skills to a competitor. Long days for mediocre pay. Decent bonuses are hard to come by since it's based off 1% gross."
bad,Pay is not worth the stress. The culture and overall mood is terrible. Trying to get customers taken care of was not easy. Woking here is like being the lone wolf.
bad,Working here has affected my mental health because of all the stress. I am grateful I got to learn how it is in the car business because now I know where I TRULY want to work. I feel betrayed by management because of personal issues. Don‚Äôt work here unless you need money urgently.
bad,Well I get pay on working with the cars so I don't enough Tickets to keep me busy enough to make the money I want to make two many oh I only give work to this person that why I would ratter work for a different company also they are charging the customer way to much that why we can never get any customer pay repair.
bad,"Do not work for autonation.  Sell you a service for a Mercedes Benz, charge you whatever amount feels fit per customer, use ‚Äúautonation‚Äù branded parts that are had pennies on the dollar and not manufacture parts (example oil filter...their own Korean made aftermarket filter instead of Mercedes Benz) and still charge you OEM price so they reap the benefits on their profit margins."
bad,"I worked as a sales representative with people who had mediocre skills in the job market. They were all unhappy with the job and had a nihilistic view. They felt this way because of the INSANE hours the location demanded of them. When I worked there they paid me $2000 monthly as a salary and an extra $100 for every car sold, I assumed I was going to be working 40 hours a week, but they scheduled me for 55 hours weekly. I was unhappy with these times but willing to give it a try, they sold me on the lie that most representative there makes over $10,000 monthly, and that there is no business like the car business. But 55 hours is a starting point, most if not all representative work 80+ hours a week due to the demand, a normal sale takes about 5 hours to complete on average, guess whos staying overtime if a customer walks in on the last hour of your shift? And don't think for a minute you can pass that customer on to another employee, that is YOUR customer, if you get into the habit of giving away the customers you will be looked down upon by management and will likely not meet your monthly quota."
bad,Management will suck you dry. They expect more than they are willing to give....truly want you to lie to customers...I like helping people not cheating them.
good,"Very helpful employess, fast paced job, lots of benefits, flexable hours. Management is great and very helpful. hardest part of the job, was possibly working the 2nd shift which was until midnight"
bad,"they give you lowest possible pay they can and don't offer pto nor raises, and hardly allow overtime. poor management, like allowing 20 oil change appointments to all take place within 1 hour with only 8 techs available."
bad,"If you enjoy working in an environment where your co-workers will back-stab you at every opportunity and the management are apathetic to any and all situations that do not effect their salary, with little no no chance at managerial advancement then AutoNation is for you. The hardest part of the job is dealing with the unrealistic expectations of the service advisors due to the lies they have told the customer. The most enjoyable part of the job, at least for me, was dealing with the customers as most of them are understanding and have realistic expectations, most of them."
bad,There is a great need for leadership and in house promotions. There is no regard to the employees personal life's or their families. When the weather is bad enough for the city to shut down you are expected to be at work regardless of the dangers.
bad,Easy and relaxing work not to hard of a job to do and you weren't working in the direct heat. Was fair about everything that happened around the job....
bad,"No comment. I  have been with AutoNation for 11 years. Never a pay raise, only pay cuts. Management is trying but they can't seem to figure out how to manage a successful dealership. Too much micro management."
bad,"It was not a good experience, too much politics and not the process you would expect from one of the largest automotive companies in the industry ,  they do not appreciate talent as much as they should ."
bad,Very competitive yet poor management. every man to for himself and trusting others was a challenge. There were times when I was asked to go against my beliefs when dealing with one customer but  I couldn't knowing it would hang heavy on m conscience.
bad,"If you are dedicated to committing your entire life to your job, then this is the role for you. While this is similar throughout the industry, there was rarely an excitement to go in knowing days were going to be slow."
bad,"Told to work way to many hours, CSI,CSI,CSI,CSI. If you know the culture as a Service Advisor the hors are typically long ""BUT"" when you are done for the day you should be able to leave. Not here, they want 1 more person to answer the phone, it might just be that golden ticket of the day. Too much MICRO-MANAGING. No matter what you do, it's not enough."
bad,"Very unprofessional. Overworked and underpaid. Very little room for growth. Customer service is terrible, coworkers don't want to deal with clients and do the bare minimum"
bad,"Everybody's mother tells you, ""If you have nothing good to say about someone (or something) you keep it to yourself.""  So, if this is the last job place on earth, go elsewhere."
bad,"It's a rotating door when it comes to management, they can't find a guy who will stay cause they realized how bad of a place it is. When I was there, 1 manager was from Chevy and the other guy was from a parts store, who didn't even know how to write an RO"
bad,"Management problems made for it to be a real difficult place of employment.  With the right change it could be a gold mine.  The inventory is always incorrect, and the employees are underpaid and unappreciated to where they come to work without a care."
bad,"So the upper management is in constant disconnect with each other. I was under my my boss, the market president following his orders. He stepped down and the regional VP took over. They let me go saying stores rarely saw me. This was due to my President putting me in a location for months on end. They are pretty unreasonable here. They run on a theory of making you fear for your job."
bad,Management was Poor very poor... typical day started with a meeting at 9 am then trade walk and then its in your office to start your days work. Management is very sneaky in used cars a manager will tell you take a day off but won't confirm it with the director for approval then will try to snake you.
bad,The Service Department is very unorganized. The Service employees try their best but the responsibility falls on the Service Managment. Very very high turn over rate.
good,"Very helpful employess, fast paced job, lots of benefits, flexable hours. Management is great and very helpful. hardest part of the job, was possibly working the 2nd shift which was until midnight"
bad,warehouse is a fright. Everything is a mess and its like 110 degrees all the time. cant say  much about other departments but they go through alot of people.
bad,"Be aware of the team in place.  Not a lot of advertising to drive traffic, as a result this is a low traffic dealership."
bad,"Loved the people I worked with, the brand (Mercedes-Benz) and that is it. "
bad,"The program was rushed and some of the tools we needed to do our job better, were not available. The program seemed to be rushed together and dissolved just as quickly."
bad,"Autonation Ford Frisco is a fun place to work if you are friends with your co-workers, you will spend a lot of time sitting around socializing, and less time actually working, but you are there at least 70hrs per week. When you first start there is no professional training, you just follow people around until you learn.. a lot of people never found someone to follow and ended up quitting because they couldn't learn. It is salary+bonus which is not bad at all but the salary and bonus are low and you have to sell a lot of cars to make a decent living, which is hard because it is very slow most of the time. It only really picks up in summer, so you have to save up your money for the rest of the year. overall the staff is great and management does their best, but the turnover rate for employees is really high(you have new managers every couple months)... there are a lot of pay issues, almost every employee gets paid incorrectly and they take their time reimbursing you.. they don't care if you have bills you need to pay...."
bad,Has 7 dealerships feeding constant work along with having several DRPs. Company is run by numbers and doesnt care about customers or employees. Over priced health-care and next to impossible to get a raise. Does not respond to suggestions on how to make quality and cycle times improve.
bad,"If you are wanting to do sales, do not start off in the car business. You can make a lot of money, but its not for the newbies."
bad,"I was a service advisor for 2 years. The people I worked with were... Alright. More about themselves then helping as a whole (i.e. Taking customer away or changing RO's, etc) but over all good people. The GM is awesome! Service manger wasn't so great. But the company is just a wreck! More interested in making a penny then the employees or customers. I never once got any of my ""use or lose"" PTO because we were always ""short staffed"" and needed people badly because people were in and out (in my time there, 21 people had come and gone, nearly one a month)."
bad,"Hard company to work for, did not care for management and how they treated my co-workers. No work/life balance, poor pay, most employees skip lunch because they are so busy and understaffed. Service Director treated employees badly."
bad,"Worked here a short time, bottom line corporate mis-management caused this store to hemorrhage money. Very hard to improve stores bottom line when upper management is more focused on things that do not contribute to customer retention and revenue."
bad,"Drive  cars all day  with coworkers "
bad,"The car business is unlike any other industry I‚Äôve worked in and AutoNation dealerships are no different from any of the others. The focus is totally on making money to the detriment of everything else. Communication and any forethought/care of employees‚Äô personal lives is nonexistent. Work schedules are simply thrown together at the last moment and changes to schedules for special events (tent sales), meetings, and/or holidays come with little or no advance warning. Training is limited to 60 days of online classes that are crammed down your throat in a week‚Äôs time and/or random in-person training sessions that are too brief, vague, and sporadic to be of any use. Managers exist in title only and are chosen based solely on their ability to manipulate (sell) others. They possess no real management skills, take no accountability, and cannot be trusted. They exist to maximize the profit of those that report to them and nothing more. As for the work environment, the showroom is literally any HR manager‚Äôs nightmare. Employees talk openly on the showroom floor using vulgar lingo and profanity that would make any high school teen blush, racial and sexist language is used by all including managers, and employees are screamed at and disciplined in front of others. And because money/greed is king, arguments between employees over whose customer belongs to whom are commonplace. As you'd expect, turnover is very high."
bad,"line technicain but no advancment for me,love working on the GTR"
bad,"Service upper management needs help and change or it will eventually fail. The service director is very one sided and only works off of his philosophies, the service drive manager outstanding but over worked."
bad,"There is a reason for the seemingly revolving door of people being hired and those leaving. For being such a large company, AutoNation is poor in both how it treats its customers and employees. For customers, having seen what goes on ""behind the scenes"" to vehicles; I would not recommend purchasing from AutoNation. Cars are treated poorly, with every effort to simply make a sale and no regard for quality. To say covering-up was a common practice is an understatement. Just make it look good until the car is out the door, then it's the customer's problem. "
bad,If your young person  this is a good job to START with. Learn all u can and move on . Money is low and no raises for non management .  Lots of people yelling at one another and extreme mismanagement is prevalent all day.
bad,Was a great place to work until you got micromanaged too many chiefs not enough Indians management had you going different ways at all times whenever you are profitable upper management would change your pay plan
good,"Very helpful employess, fast paced job, lots of benefits, flexable hours. Management is great and very helpful. hardest part of the job, was possibly working the 2nd shift which was until midnight"
bad,I would work long days and was often given many tasks from various departments. For two months I was the only porter and was handling the job of three porters.
bad,"Good people, the company change pay plan every 18 months be prepare. Is difficult to plan your future base up an down income. I never plan to leave but I can‚Äôt handle any more."
bad,"The management will fire you before you retire.  They will promise advancement to get you in the door, just like everyone else they hire.  Overtime is not always compensated for."
bad,"The workplace in the shared service center is a fun environment to be in due to the people that you sit and work close to. Unfortunately, the higher management that was there was very unhelpful which led to a chaotic & unhappy workplace."
bad,Autonation wants you to be loyal to them. But are not loyal to employees. Constant pay changes usually reducing wages. Promotions based on who you know not based on ability.
bad,"Extra long hours.  Selling of new and used cars and trucks.  I had to Demostrate the car. Work with the customer to get them into the car.  "
bad,The office personnel are not the best.  Managers side with the older employees. Salesmen are rude and disrespectful toward women. The atmosphere just isn't the best. Also. working the evening shift was not the move. Managers leave earlier than you and a mess is always left for you to clean up.
bad,"management was not focused . Never serious, and the training was not good. they just sat you in front of a computer and you watched videos all day. the job just was not organized."
bad,"This is terrible place to work. The management in the parts department is verbally abusive, and unprofessional. Be ready to do way more than your job description, and don't even think about questioning management about it."
bad,This location is a diamond in the rough. Management at this location have no clue what it takes to run a dealership. The General manager and the Service Director could care less about the employee. Too much emphasis on what‚Äôs going wrong and who the culprit is. The management at this dealership need to be watched closely. If you don‚Äôt like the way things run here and make a suggestion to fix it you‚Äôre told to find another job. The favoritism is out of control and will kill this service department. Don‚Äôt waste your time calling HR either they won‚Äôt do anything.
bad,typicall dealership grueling hours your just another number the bad employees always rewarded benefits are horrible very stressful lack of discipline no one honestly cares about you its only what you do for them
bad,"was told during interview that i would be working on cars doing maintenance, and during times i didn't have a car i would be assisting and learning from other techs. That lasted about a month and then i was continuously assigned janitorial duties around the shop. an example of a typical day would be 2 cars try to observe and learn from another tech. get interrupted sent to do moping and cleaning moving boxes etc. didn't really get to learn much besides basic jiffy lube stuff."
bad,"Short and sweet, I would not recommend working here. Theres so much nonsense going on and people literallt jsut not doing their jobs and its the most irritating thing in the world. I just want a stable job that I can live off of. They do not pay well for the work you do. Management here sucks most days. Customers are generally sweet, but only as sweet as they can be for being overcharged hundreds of dollars to get work done on their cars."
bad,"They treat the employees like they don't care, just want to plug numbers for the share holders."
good,"Very helpful employess, fast paced job, lots of benefits, flexable hours. Management is great and very helpful. hardest part of the job, was possibly working the 2nd shift which was until midnight"
bad,Management allows those who take advantage of the system to thrive and those who work hard and perform to suffer.  They sweep issues under the rug instead of properly addressing them
bad,This is by far the worst job I have ever worked in. The hours are terrible. You will work 70+ hours which will equate to below minimum wage most of the time.
bad,"It is sad that I could not trust me Manager, or other directors in the company. I was told I was too ""Powerful"" by my director (whatever that means). Management seems insecure at times especially when a solid person with more experience is working under them. Instead of growing from other's experience, they try to squash them from intimidation. All me peers are excellent to work with. Watch out for jealousy, and passive aggression from upper people. "
bad,People were pigeon holed and not provided opportunity for advancement. Payment was low and no benefits were provided. We made the best of it and had fun together.
bad,"Regardless of what they say. You will be a number, usually an unimportant number. They are so active on acquisitions. They will tell you anything before the take over, then you find out not all you are told is true."
bad,You're kind of thrown into something unknown. Information was inconsistent depending on the manager you're talking to. Lots of turnover and no one really knows what's going on. Most people are new and don't know much either. Their promises were not delivered.
bad,Management hardly ever stuck to their word . They were constantly being replaced . Understaffed so anyone that's did stick around was over worked . Never took care of their best workers
bad,"The hardest part about the job was dealing with the managers personalities, the hours of operation and the lack of training. The most enjoyable moments are when you make a sale."
bad,"Audi Hunt Valley is a good place with good people, but in terms of compensation for the hours worked, it doesn't quite measure out. The People who work there are very friendly, and always want to help customers, but that's at the dealership level. Everyone Who is upper management seems to make decisions based on what analytical spread sheet they receive in their email boxes everyday, and they make life changing decisions based on these spread sheets. For you to being working on the front lines for a premium brand like audi, and to have someone telling you, sell more tires, more service chemicals, etc... seems excessive. Mainly you want to make these customers feel like your service department is there to service them, not slam them with out of this world, unnecessary add on services to reel more in to the dealership for gross profit.  Overall the experience I've had has certainly been good, minus the run of the mills sales environment stuff they grind you with."
bad,"Good work environment, lots of ways to be promoted. Enjoyed working for Toyota. Long hours weren't all that great but I loved going to work. I was a lube technician to start then moved to a greeter after being injured in a car accident. My manager was very understanding. Then moved up to a service advisor."
bad,Need to focus more on the customer and employee and less on the company. the most enjoyable part of the job is meeting people.
bad,"When I was there work hours, rules, and the pay would change every single month. Started off really good but for some reason it went down hill quickly. The other stores might be ok but Toyota was and still may be in need of new management. Its fine if you don't have a life and could care less about pay changing without reason or notice."
bad,A typical day at work involves dealing with customers and following my daily agenda. I've learned a great deal of customer service and learned that i do better working with my hands than my words. Managment is completely unorthodox but my fellow employees are great. The Hardest part of my job is having nothing to do and sitting at a desk. I'm used to being physically productive. The most enjoyable part of the job is Making a sale and making people happy
bad,Job security but no advancement and compensation.  Good for  learning new experiences.
bad,"This company is an extremely busy company with many processes changed on a day to day basis. Working in the car industry has given me and opportunity to experience another side of accounting . Working in a dealership accounting setting has prepared me in running massive documents in an electronic setting versus having to manually review invoices .The position I hold has guided me in a leadership role geared to success. The most challeging part of my job is the consistent pattern of changing processes without notice. There is never downtime which makes the day go by fast would be the best part of the job for me, This company has definitely given me exposure to viewing , and understanding how to priortorize my time in a active and constantly changing setting."
bad,The company as a whole is a good company but each dealership is ran differently and some are run poorly. The one I am at you will work 60 hour weeks and only make a few hundred. Your schedule changes last minute and they dont give time off.
bad,"The environment in the shop was good, but it became very evident that workplace politics were alive and well here. If you wanted to succeed, you needed to be on very good terms with the shop foreman/lead technician. Otherwise you would be handed low paying warranty work and asked why your performance is suffering."
bad,"Purchased a vehicle and was ""laid off"" from my non existent position one month later. Hired me from top dealership to build a department that was an experiment. During my time there, every month we were #1. Once they had department established, I was laid off."
good,"Very helpful employess, fast paced job, lots of benefits, flexable hours. Management is great and very helpful. hardest part of the job, was possibly working the 2nd shift which was until midnight"
bad,Currently working at CDJR. Our new general manager has brought a horrible culture. All employees are miserable. We are not allowed to sit down while on point outside and get fussed at for standing in the shade or socializing AT ALL with other employees. They took away benches for seating so we‚Äôre exp to stand in the heat for ten hours a day without socializing. It feels like prison. We are mature adults who know we are there to work yet treated like we have no work ethic. Constant micromanaging. 50+ hours a week. They don‚Äôt let us leave for the day unless we have appointments for the next day. Can‚Äôt wait to get out.
bad,"I enjoyed the people and the work tremendously, but the management in AR was horrible. I heard since I left that the main manager causing most of the issues was let go, I hope they are doing better in that department now. Work was plentiful unless you weren't ""liked"". I took on several special projects and rarely recognized for it, I also begged for more work or to move departments and got blocked at every angle which is the main reason I left, I need growth!"
bad,"When I started here, job was easy flow. I get the work done quick, talking to customers was nice, management was great. When things got changed, we got new manager, things got moved around, employees arguing with each other, everyone pointting fingers, manager have favorites and gave work to them, instead of the people who are willing to work. Moral was good at the beginning, the longer you stay you will start seeing how terribly this place is. Also we have a new manager that's is actually fixing thingf."
bad,Disorganized training and understaffed and the department was taking on many of other department's roles. This department twas the catch all for other departments which created a large amount of information to take in within a short amount of time. Management were very hands off with extremely high expectations If employed it's best to have previous car financial experience.
bad,"I loved what I do and the customers I saw face to face. Management is Okay however could use some more work. The ability to keep positions filled is hard for the company, I now know why. Trying to get a raise for the amount of work that they put on you will never happen. Honestly, you are over worked and very under paid for the amount of work they put on you."
bad,"there is no much to say, ideas go nowhere only thing to do is just follow to make the numbers, managers they just care about do the number there is NO leadership at all!!!! no matter how employee feel about and how many extra hour you have to work no a simple thanks!!"
bad,"Would not go back if they paid me more money. Very low employee"
bad,"Great work place but they don't even pay minimum wage, they pay below minimum wage. And the manager isn't really strict and will let anyone take over an hour for lunch, but we aren't allowed to do overtime even though most of us don't get paid very much."
bad,when your paid flate rate you only make money when people bring theres cars in . So you can be there all day and if nobody comes with their car you don't get paid anything. The used car section should be disbursed as well as the PDI which is brand new cars should be dispersed when there is no work which they do not do everyone feels entitled so it's hard to make money and there's also people that are committing fraud by claiming work and not doing the job.
bad,The people are great but the work culture is made up of different towers who would rather not work together as a group. There is also a real disconnect between higher management and the actual IT staff.
bad,Management was very strict and not understandable. They  didn't care that you had families and lives outside of work. They required you to work through a snow storm.
bad,Lack of support from co workers to upper management. Lack of accountability from mistakes from others. Favoritism from GM to selected few. Work moral is low. Speaking from sales and service side. Turn over is high!!!
bad,Lots of work Bad management poor hr dept. Management plays favorites makes bad turmoil between employees management needs more training they just put anybody in that position to fill the position that doesn't have the proper training to know how to run a business management does not follow their own employee handbook .
good,"Very helpful employess, fast paced job, lots of benefits, flexable hours. Management is great and very helpful. hardest part of the job, was possibly working the 2nd shift which was until midnight"
bad,"No comment, Currently do not share same Philosophy regarding process and improvements standards with Leadership in company and departments working with. not fit for this particular individual."
bad,"I enjoyed everything about that job till they changed GMs, then it was a living heck. Hours were very bad to the point just being at work will make you unhappy. we went from around 80 hours a pay period to around 135. Five of the top sales men were either fired or quit. He did away with many of the black sales men and hired only white ones. Worst of all he cut our pay."
bad,"coworkers are nice, company only cares about making money, have no care for their employees"
bad," Every car deal is a mini..... no mater what you do as a salesperson...some exceptions.  It got very old..... sell a car between 7 and 40k and get $100 per.  I sold between 8-12 cars per month, could not support a family with their pay plan.  Some managers even made fun of the way we got paid.  If you had a pulse and worked your schedule you can work here.  Make your own decision but this is the way most corporate businesses operate.  Once you calculate how much profit is made, you will want to stab your eye with an extremely dull butter knife."
bad,"Try to apply a ""corporate world""   for working class dealerships.  Did not really know what the people ""on the ground"" were doing."
bad,"They make cashier's do most of sales receptionist position with out even letting you leave the desk to help out a customer. You will be in charge on every single calls, and if you miss one it seems like a huge deal to them. Even if you are working in adminstrative work or/cashing out customers. "
bad,"Consistently being understaffed, doing thing outside of job description, fast paced, stressful. Fun people to work with, but difficult to do everything required because of the lack of personnel."
bad,"The day starts off pretty easy unless you get there and the service drive is already backed up with customers. Mainly due to the fact that they have poor service advisor's there, that cant manage their time or customers very well. Management changed while i was there, the woman that hired me on was nice and good at her job. The next service manager that came in,ran a different store in Florida and seemed like he didn't know a whole lot. Talked a big game on how great it was gonna be but fell short of that. He ended up quitting after i left anyways. I was also promised bonuses for reaching certain goals and never got paid for them. Just a bunch of empty promises. So if you like that, then apply here."
bad,The environment is very laid back. The decision making process is very slow. Errors are very likely to happen and career advancement does not seem to be much.
bad,Constant changes in operation then contradicting the instruction that were given when followed. Instead of making proper adjustments to the schedule to accommodate heavy flow work days they prefer to overload workers and complain about speed.
bad,Only 1 temp worker was hired for permanent employment .  About 12 were release after completed assignment.  Management had much to be desired.  Not well organized.
bad,"The company is based on a no risk(to the company) pay plan! They will not stop until everyone is on straight commission. If certain employees reach and threshold, the company adjusts their pay plan. Seven Techs have left because Autonation refuses to give pay raises, except for their new pay plan at a variable rate. They are also attempting to defund the pension. As a college graduate, with an associates degree you will earn $12.00 an hour. Good luck paying off that 50K loan and putting food on the table! There is a post from a tech on this site from 2017, it is not real! Not one of the techs in this shop would ever say it's a great place to work! The bottom line is, if there is no work, they feel they should not pay you! Even though it's their responsibility to keep you busy. The union contract has been stalled for seven years, and the pay increase is conditional, so 95 % of the techs are still not receiving any actual increase! Everyone is miserable, and it makes it really tough to show up to work!"
bad,AutoNation gave me the opportunity I needed to enter into the car sales profession. I learned a whole new world with great mentors that  taught me how to sell.  Very grateful for that. Business can be brisk and hectic. Hurry up and wait. The company offers health insurance plans and salary plans.
bad,I use to work for AutoNationFord in westlake but I left because the management wasn‚Äôt professional and I was treated like I was littler then the boss.
good,"Very helpful employess, fast paced job, lots of benefits, flexable hours. Management is great and very helpful. hardest part of the job, was possibly working the 2nd shift which was until midnight"
bad,It's not all bad but its competitive. This is a position for the assertive baby! more so if youre shy don't feel bad. Also the pay was nice just the vibe wasn't right.
bad,"When I was working there, the management was terrible, Service Director was pulled from a Chevy store and the Service Manager came from a parts store. GM didn't really care. All those guys have either left or been fired. But apparently it's still bad, the new service director stayed for a couple months then left because they don't know how to run that store."
bad,"Before AutoNation bought the dealership I worked at, it was the best job I had ever had. After:  I hated it more than anything."
bad,"Fast day one slow paced the next , coworkers are very good people and the techs all get along . Have enjoyed working on fords for almost 20 yrs"
bad,"Credit review of pending deals"
bad,There is a lack of management structure where you have multiple managers and if they don‚Äôt all agree your are screwed. I had a very bad experience as a female as well.
bad,"General manager was changed 4 times during last year. Whenever new general manager changed, everything is changed. Current sales person and manager need to follow."
bad,"As an employee of top companies and professions and having the ability to relate, I received the lowest caliber of training, and due to  high employee turnover, the heaviest work loads I have ever endured. I was a single agent in a three agent office, doing the work of three in an extremely high paced multitasking position. I accepted the load, worked all weekends scheduled off and never complained. Nothing was verbally appreciated. I am willing to exhaust myself for my employer. I just ask for proper training and a fair workload."
bad,It's a company that can be worth working for only if you suck up to the heads. Always giving promises they don't keep. Getting skipped for promotions and handing them to new entry people. Seniority Flys out the window unless you are favored. Even if you tried to work hard no one will appreciate it and will then just be expected of you without reward.
bad,"Do not work here, they dont provide training, they treat you like dirt. No one keeps to their promises, the salesman are rude and snide, not a fun place to work."
bad,"Good company with benefits, paid holidays, PTO not really room for growth but has a good staff and can have  flexible hours. Would recommend AutoNation"
bad,"I personally felt like I was wasting my time there due to the lack of work coming in. Lots of mouths to feed but no work coming in. I also didn't like the idea of lying to a customer about repairs they didn't need since i'm a honest person, guess thats why I didn't survive there long ?"
bad,"Before the GM was let go, management was overbearing and followed a broken system. They were unwilling to try anything new (that ever other dealership I've worked at does) but still complained about not hitting results."
bad,lots of hours was not able to spend time working on customer vehicles management doesn't always push you to do better instead pushes you to make more.
bad,Zero direction. There is a lot of blaming going on without anyone taking responsibility. The pay is not compareble to other dealerships. The communication is not a priority
bad,"low pay, okay for a temporary part time job. sales people are rude. high turnover"
good,"Very helpful employess, fast paced job, lots of benefits, flexable hours. Management is great and very helpful. hardest part of the job, was possibly working the 2nd shift which was until midnight"
bad,"I was hired as a Lot Attendant . When I first got the job ,, I was a good employee. As soon as I took over the shuttle driving position ,, I was considered lazy and was told I did do my job. This went on for every shuttle driver not just me. I watched 3 employees leave Toyota because of what went on with the shuttle driving position."
bad,"I enjoyed the time with the techs, some of the managers tell you they are all for the employers, but at the same time they are all about themselves. Upper management with this particular location needs improvement."
bad,10 hours days that is not worth your time overall.  The people to work with are very co workers.  Its a learning experience that I'm glad I received..
bad,"Before buyout, from 2010 I processed new vehicles from transports and other dealers.  I managed new vehicle keys and accessories."
bad,"Very poor or no communication. Poor management, they do not stay"
bad,"this was a very busy store, with alot of different opportunities, I would recommend this store for a candidate that wanted to grow."
bad,Retail Sales Specialist. Enjoyed all of my customers and working with the public on a daily basis. I am accustomed to the sales field.
bad,"There is no opportunity to grow in this company, the managers will almost never help you with problems you are having."
bad,"I was the parts manager when the company took over.  I taught the incoming ""Auto Nation"" guy the way the department worked, he taught me Auto Nation.  I had the best virtual/physical inventory in southern California."
bad,"Large corporation with ideal advancement opportunities, and great people within high management with strong morals. Benefits and compensation could surely be greater for the fortune 500 company. Don't generally like the direction the company is going in some areas."
bad,Toyota was very unprofessional with the way they handled things. A very childish management system.
good,I was placed at a dealership that was setup to fail. All of management was under extreme pressure and was in fear of losing their jobs. Our budget was reduced and the one meal they provided in a 12 hour shift every Saturday was limited to cheap tacos every single Saturday. We had managers teaming up with associates to bend the rules and display little to no professionalism whatsoever
good,"I dont have much to say about this place the sales manager at the time where very unprofessional and he did not go by the book so I left and took a break from the car bussiness .I took a long break , I found out this year I no longer want to sale Vehicles."
good,"This company shows favoritism to those they like, there is no balance for your personal life and your work life. The pace is very slow, upper management was rude and egotistical."
good,"No family time, you have to work everyday to make a good paycheck. Management is very rude and demanding. But the good thing is that you can make a lot of money you just have to put a lot of hours into it. Forget family events and having weekends off."
good,"working here you will learn about different individuals backgrounds management isn't the best but they're nice, coworkers are awesome there isn't really anything hard about the job. the most enjoyable part of the job is learning about the new products."
good,"no computer training which handicapped sales, very high pressure to sell items needed or not.  busy store with a high pressure competition between service advisors with little or no team work"
good,"Very helpful employess, fast paced job, lots of benefits, flexable hours. Management is great and very helpful. hardest part of the job, was possibly working the 2nd shift which was until midnight"
good,"ery long the companies attitude is very much so ""what have you done for us lately""  even after performing record numbers the prior month. atmosphere is full of negativity and people who really seem to hate their jobs."
good,This should be considered as a seasonal job for you. Nothing that you plan on doing in the future. Management is not trained for this company or the job.
good,its not a very good job. I had no sales training and on my first day I was told to get out there and sell cars. And if I hadn't sold a car by the end of the day I should stay until I do. And that's what it was like every single day. Oh and if I was talking to a customer and they weren't going to buy I would get yelled at for not turning them over to someone else who would basically trick them into a car they just wanted info on. I don't like messing with peoples minds.
good,"I actually loved working at Autonation and quite miss a lot of wonderful people I worked with, but..... they pay is horrible and a lot of politics the gm there is quite a snake, while I worked there many people that were employed there for many years left thanks to him or they got fired thanks to him, it is a shame because I really enjoyed my time there."
good,"A number, not a name. Stressful days due to compensation. Not concerned with what is best for the customer, only what is best for the shareholder. Corporarate culure of greed. If company the company would take good care of the needs of the customer, the profits would take care of themselves. The best part of any job is winning the customer, and then proving to them they made the right decision without top heavy beauracracy and a contradictory compensation plan."
good,"Not a terrible place to work, just not a lot of work for the number of techs employed. Had to stay long hours to insure work was completed or risk not getting work the following day."
good,I would only recommend this job if you want no life and a rude boss... expected to drive 300+ miles per day over 11 hour shift while pay stayed stagnant and the supervisor screamed at us like children.
good,"unorganized"
good,Not worth looking at if youre looking for a permanent job. Pay is not enough to substain a liveable life. You get 3-5 paid holidays throughout the year
good,Overall it is the standard dealership work experience. Higher and Corporate management tend to shift focus on spreadsheets versus tangible issues such as hiring unequipped persons for skilled positions.
good,I work there as a temp. I schedule appointment and warranty recalls on the cars. Sometimes when it was busy I assisted the customer with their cars for oil changes
good,Typical Dealership. Overworked by management and criticized to the point of verbal abuse. No balance of home or personal life. If you're selling vehicles consistently each month expect to work 60+ hours a week with only 1 day off.
good,"I moved to Jacksonville a little over a year ago and transferred to Autonation Ford Jacksonville as a porter. As a porter, my duties were to move cars that came in for service to their appropriate locations in the shop. After almost a year, I felt that I wanted more responsibility and to move up a notch to a service adviser position. I was told by many people; technicians, other porters, and even other service advisers that it was the hardest, most stressful job in the dealership and that I shouldn't do it. An opportunity arose for me to move up and I did. All would be fine, I believe, if I had proper training. I shadowed another adviser for a week, then was put on my own. I understand that in this position, you can't be trained on every situation, but I feel like I could have been more properly trained on many of the more routine situations. Different types of jobs have different labor rates and different jobs require different labor types and op codes and all sorts of information that was not provided to me. I've never had a job where I went home so stressed out that I felt dizzy and had to go to bed. Nor have I have I ever had a job that caused me to cry at my desk due to the stress. Advisers here get blamed for anything and everything that goes wrong in the shop. Even if it's the tech's fault. If the tech decides it's time to go home and leaves without completing a car repair, the adviser gets in trouble. If a tech is taking too long doing a repair or takes too long getting a car in his bay, the adviser gets scolded. Also, customer surveys are a huge deal to this company."
good,"Manager of collision center in my opinion is a misogynist.  He told me one thing and then refused to let me do it, and completely changed the whole game of employment from when I was hired.  The pay was horrible, and could not make a living.  My teammate decided to quit, and I was laid off the next day, because of a lack of work.  I would definitely avoid working for the collision center in Westlake."
good,"I loved the people that I worked with. The managers are not trained or are poorly trained. Typical sales managers, don't care about their people and provide poor leadership. The pay plan is designed to keep you down and working constantly in order to make a living. There is no way you can actually take 2 days off and still make a living at this place."
good,"I liked what I did for AutoNation, but, the workload was overwhelming.  I felt that there needed to be another title clerk for the volume of sales that the Jeep store sold.  I have goals and they were are to meet due to the volume and the support from management."
good,"up at 6 at work by 7--get the driver out by 8--receive stock truck and complete by 9--get customer order ready to go by 10 because the delivery drivers will be back and must leave with their orders by 10:20.  complete any left over projects and do inventory counts til lunch 12:00.  back to work at 12:30  get orders ready to go at 2--drivers must leave 2:15--2:30 on, work on nightly deliveries and trucking company deliveries---have al deliveries ready to go by 6.  lock up and go home 6:45--5 days a week"
good,Corporate structuring is having a negative effect on the morale in the shop and employees. Managers playing favorites with certain employees and others are feeling the effects of that.
good,"Monday thru Saturday, 7 to 7 most days, busy shop, potential to make good money. don't go i with negative attitude, do go against the grain, don't ruffle feathers and youll be just fine."
good,"Very helpful employess, fast paced job, lots of benefits, flexable hours. Management is great and very helpful. hardest part of the job, was possibly working the 2nd shift which was until midnight"
good,"Slow work "
good,"Great company, old school management, work all hours, company aniciative good just needs management that follows AutoNation guidelines. Incentives are a little weak. Can make good money but at what cost?"
good,No communication between managers or associates. Too many secrets. Not enough people on the teams to cover in case something comes up for someone else. Too much micro-management from GM and other managers.
good,"Worked many long hours, dedicating to improving the company but credit was given to other employees whom had favoritism from management. Was not a good place growth or move up within the company. Favoritism was heavily practiced."
good,i would not recommend service writing for this company. sales or finance. not service. maybe it was the AN Ford i worked at but management was... under trained. SEVERELY
good,There was usually a bit of cattiness from working in a small building or room with a group of people. It's good for a starter job but definitely not for a career in my opinion
good,"The GM who AutoNation is blinded to see is the problem and root cause of very high turnover and toxic culture . Pay plan is terrible and not morale boosting. Pay plan puts managers against sales associates as they are paid gross vs units. Health care is also very expensive. Upper management out of touch and manage from 30,000 ft."
good,"Over all a great place...just be cautious of the particular dealership and your surroundings. I worked at multiple locations, and each locations vibe varied depending on the manager. One particular General Manager would yell and cuss at his employees. This made for a hostile work environment and was not pleasant."
good,"I think they do a lot more hiring from the outside then they say, and then you get outside guys telling you to work your butt off for a company you have put more time in and effort and then they'll advance you."
good,"Like any big corporation Auto Nation has a lot of structure but it limits out of the box thinking.  They are big on running their play, which do work but it feels very cookie cutter.  Give you a lot of resources to work with but very little on options to go outside there world."
good,a typical workday would be coming to work at around 8:30 and pretty much just wait outside for a customer to come. We also hit the phones and try to get some old customers back in the building.
good,"I was told I would get a certain amount for my base pay, which turned out to be a lie. No biggie, then I was told they were moving in a more ..hmm CarMax direction, as far as working for the customer or being transparent . That turned out to be untrue. "
good,"When going into work each day at Autonation you never new if you had a job or not. Each day the Service Manager would tell you that if you didn't do so many calls in a day that you could be let go. I found that myself got 120% for one day of appointments and phone calls that had to be made and that wasn't good enough. The service manager also said I love money bring me customers, which is understandable but one person can only do so much. I feel that AutoNation needs to work on how they treat their employees rather than being money hungry."
good,"Management changes pay plan weekly , no advertisement for dealership. Morale at this dealership is very low. Employees are blacked out by managers everyday."
good,"Bad atmosphere. Sales are treated as nothing. "
good,Company doesn't have your back. Said they would help but didn't. Told me they would help me find a new position when my current job was ended. No help was given.
good,"Very helpful employess, fast paced job, lots of benefits, flexable hours. Management is great and very helpful. hardest part of the job, was possibly working the 2nd shift which was until midnight"
good,"Title says it all if working on cars is for you then you will enjoy working there, until pay day when you can't pay your bills. Even the most experienced techs there struggle to make a good paycheck consistently."
good,"Corporate culture encourages equal gender roles and allows flexible hours, along with remote work option."
good,"Long hours, no direction from  collision manager. Alot of paper work. The collision center does not work as a team, the techs do not care about the customers or the fellow workers."
good,Friendly people and good associates inside the dealership but the carwash crew is lazy deceitful pathetic and rude lacking of management and respect for their responsibilities
good,"It is a high stress area. A lot of pressure from corporate. Low pay, manager does not know how to manage, gets there late and leaves early not helpful at all"
good,The company is a good place to work as long as you produce and don't raise your hand for any promotions.  If you raise your hand for a promotion they take that as an insult that you are no longer happy in your current role.
good,Management style is to pressure and stress employees with negative reinforcement. Hours are long .. sometimes 2-4 12 hour days consecutively. Pay plan for commissions is much lower than competitors. 18-22% compared to 30%+
good,"Manager didnt care much for the employees side of the story, customer's always right. 2 advisors did as they please because ""they bought in good money"""
good,"Good pay"
good,"flate rate collision repair facility, management only cared about thieir bottom line not yours, highly racial enviroment, horrible working conditions, lotas of time dragging air line & Working outside in rainy conditions"
good,"When I got hired the management was component and caring. Then, management changed and so did the job. The current service manager cut positions and added work loads to employees of the positions without in crease of pay. So more work more hours no more pay. Then raised prices for the guests by 25% and when customers started to not come back raised it again to make up for the lost clients. Until auto nation changes the top of the service department it will continue to go down. I still get updates from employees that are still there and everyone is leaving. Sad because when I started there everyone liked working there, and prices were competitive."
good,No coments confidencial to others agencies and this point I preferred talking with the right people about the employee care and other agencies like equal employment
good,"The managers of the Quick lane (where I work) are horrible. First ones to throw you under the bus, first ones to talk trash about you to customers behind your back. We are treated like swine. The shop equipment is poorly maintained making a severe impact on technicians ability to do their job properly. On the other hand. Pay is good. There is money to be made. If the service writers up sell. They were instructed not to because it does not push cars through fast. The technicians that work here are great working people."
good,"No matter how hard we work, they just keep asking for more and more. We ended up getting new pay which was garbage. Management isn't direct and picks favorites constantly. Corporate loves crying about things we can't control. Also, the insurance plans offered are extremely expensive."
good,"Come into work. Turn on computer, sign into the computer, open email and other work programs. View emails and paper work. Make sure no parts are laying around. See if there is part to hand out. Most enjoyable part is the co workers."
good,"very good company to work for, however compensation is much less than other places. work very hard for less but a solid company overall. upper management gets taken care of well."
good,"Very helpful employess, fast paced job, lots of benefits, flexable hours. Management is great and very helpful. hardest part of the job, was possibly working the 2nd shift which was until midnight"
good,"Large dealership. lots of employees. mediocre compensation. mediocre management, only certain management roles apply to that. Fairly easy work with good job security."
good,"Good company they hire a lot of inexperienced managers that will over populate the work place.  At the end of the day we are all just a number, which makes it feel like a non family atmosphere."
good,Management always has to be right which is really annoying. Money can be made but unless you aren't capable to consistently sale 10 cars a month. The money is not worth the time you have to be there.
good,"A typical day would consist of a morning meeting then maybe a trade walk to see if any cars were taken as a trade.  Co workers were cool but sometimes the management could get out of control.  Sometimes they would curse at you and talk to you any type of way, they may even give half of one of your deals away for no reason.  It was the wild wild west in there sometimes. The plus side is there is a lot of down time on the lot so you could leave the temporarily to run an errand as long as you inform a manager but the hardest part is getting a manager sometimes because they take forever to come and when a customer gets impatient,it affects things"
good,The car business is very stressful and hard environment to work in. Constantly putting you against management and your co workers. Pay is good for those in higher positions and horrible for in the sales floor
good,"A lot of constant drama. Even if you're not in it, the whole negative vibe around you makes you feel like you're involved in the drama. "
good,Hyundai New Port Richey is an up and coming company. They have huge volume of new vehicles so if you like doing PDI's this place is for you.
good,"not enjoyable and very little pay"
good,"They keep hiring Sales associates I was in  internet sales no salary only for new hires, Originally there was a salary now just commission we had 13 internet sales people it‚Äôs hard to make a living when you only get 30-40 leads a month 10  floor sales people and your required to meet a 10 car minimum if we only sell 150 cars a month. They don‚Äôt care about there employees."
good,When I start back in 2013 was a really nice place but at the end you start to see some favoritism with some salesman and all business start to go to them. Is around the same in all dealers.
good,"Good place to build a foundation, but not necessarily a good place for career advancement, unless using it a stepping stone to further your career somewhere else."
good,"It is not hard to get in, but people quit all of the time. Simple work, but no raises. Everyone will blame problems on other people. Won‚Äôt get time off approved, even if you requested months in advanced. Super hot during summer months with no a/c in Warehouse."
good,"I was promoted and I learned a lot in my time there - I will always be thankful for that.  I would still be with the company if they hadn't changed upper management and, in turn, changed the entire environment in doing so."
good,"The company is alright to work for. I wouldn't get to happy about working there, especially if you have a family or want to spend about 80% of your time working.  The pay scale is okay, and sometimes is can get very frustrating with trying to iron things about a sale with the managers."
good,"Good company to work for. Not the type of job I enjoy, but overall a good place to work. Everyone is friendly and welcoming. Interview to start date was a quick, easy process. The job position itself is pretty simple, and the computer systems easy to learn."
good,"great for students. great for first time job experience. can be overwhelming at times, perfect job for having school during the day and being able to do school work at desk as well as office work.."
good,Team job with nice coworkers. Service department works with sales and parts an dsubleted companies everyday. Communication is key. Strongly customer satifaction based.
good,"Very helpful employess, fast paced job, lots of benefits, flexable hours. Management is great and very helpful. hardest part of the job, was possibly working the 2nd shift which was until midnight"
good,"If you like the thrill of first dating and ""hunting what you eat"" working completely commission based pay. Then have fun talking to strangers all day everyday. I loved it till it wore me out."
good,"It is a good store, some people were great others no so much, but its  like that anywhere you go. AutoNation design a program and wants everybody to follow. The ones that do just that and support their people do just fine, but the ones that believe they have to step on top of people to show that they are superior ruin for everybody."
good,Company was great 2 years ago.  Now the culture has changed.  More profit for executives but cuts in normal pay for the average Joe.  Vacations are frowned upon.  You take vacation but work on the days you have requested.
good,very lively work environment. starts at 7 am closes at 7 pm. schedule can be worked out with management if needed. tech 2 flag rate is $14.50 per hour
good,A great company to work for with typical day at work includes help desk and speaking with the different dealerships to ensure that they are operational.
good,"If you are the kind of person who does not have any life then work here. Because no holidays long working hours. Managers never appreciate you and they are not helping at all, and you got learn all by yourself. Tuff working hours with lot of leg pulling."
good,"not a very good place to work, no advancement. or traing,  cut out overtime , long hours,  no weekends off at anytime , no communication thru  the chain of managment"
good,"A great lesson, indeed. This is a great company to work for, they give great compensation, and if you wish to move up into another branch, all you have to do is ask."
good,"Odd hours and never 2 days off in a row without taking PTO.  Great managers and  a lot of fun people.  But what do you expect in sales!  Work all holidays, but able to make decent money."
good,The car business is extremely tough. Customers need vehicles fast and sometimes it takes time to fix a vehicle correctly. The business is based on commission. If you don't sell anything you don't make anything no matter how many hours you work. Outside life a something of a dream. However it is a secure job because people are always going to need their car fixed.
good,"Service tech. is at the bottom of the pole,no chance for advancement,also low wages for work being performed."
good,"There is no movement to move up, there compensation is horrible long hours for such little pay. There vacation was good, but management needs more work and anger management classes. They where always mad"
good,"Is a nice place to work for someone without family. You can make good profits but you will not have holidays at all. The General manager is not a good person, sometimes is disrespectful towards his employees."
good,I was recruited at Autonation by a former colleague that I had worked the same job with at the company that Autonation acquired. I started as a service adviser and then moved to sales
good,"A typical day starts at 7 am. (required 53 hours a week) You might want to get there early to open all the programs you will be using throughout the day. Payscale is structured around customer surveys, depending on CSI scores, which will determine your rate of pay.  Surveys are not fair and set up the Service Advisor for failure as they cannot control all the issues of the survey.  I cannot speak for all the Autonation management,  but my direct manager was extremely sub-standard.  If you like working with people and don't mind dealing with angry and difficult customers, you might be a good fit for the job."
good,"Somewhat of a cliche in the automotive industry.  But, a tremendous amount of workload as a Regional Manager.  Disparity between the treatment of men and women when considering the field sales force.  I have no additional interest in writing about this employer."
good,Management not so good. Onboarding and training was not efficient when I was here. It made working stressful and when I asked to have more information about payroll process I was told that I didn't need to understand.
good,"Lot of work, not a lot of pay. Promised advancement but never got it. Was promised training but never received it. People are ok to work with but management could be better."
good,"Autonation was very organized and had a decent work environment, much like any dealership, the more you put it the more you will get out of it. Management did their best to assist you in whatever way they could, but did not always have the time for coaching."
good,"Very helpful employess, fast paced job, lots of benefits, flexable hours. Management is great and very helpful. hardest part of the job, was possibly working the 2nd shift which was until midnight"
good,Little room for advancement for technicians. Good place to work due to the facility is new and machines are in working order. Management is not on top of things most of the time unfortunately.
good,"Don‚Äôt waste your time working here. As a service cashier, you take on the responsibilities of everyone else and are paid the least for it. Management does not appreciate the ‚Äúlittle‚Äù people although our position is one of the most important ones. Your concerns and suggestions are ignored. The office where you are expected to work has outdated, slow computers that freeze every day. Your chair is a bar stool without a back rest. Imagine sitting at a computer screen for 10+ hours hunched over on a bar stool. How is one expected to work in a fast paced environment without proper working tools or a comfortable work space?"
good,Management was a joke they had their favorite technicians who got all the work other technicians didn't get nothing other than that the workplace was fine met some new friends
good,"I was excited at the prospect of working there. The company relied on a lot of contractors and there were a lot of meetings between teams. However, the coordination was less than stellar so one team would have to rollback changes often. It was also very difficult to have a meeting/consultation with my supervisor because he was almost always in a meeting."
good,"It was a good place to work until they built robots and people started loosing jobs. A typical day for me was come in check email, print invoices, scan invoices and then post"
good,The working conditions can be brutal and the hours long. You were ABC (always be closing). If you didn't close the deal you were required to turn the customer over to another salesman or manager.
good,"NEW vehicle sales are almost all mini's unless there are addendums."
good,Autonation was a great company to work for with the exception of the extreme hours and stressful nature of the job. Being held hostage by consumer surveys versus performance made the job extremely stessful.
good,outdoor repair shop with no coolers and salary is capped off very low. learned more in one year working there than three years working at a toyota dealership.
good,"AutoNation only cares about getting the job done. The good employees get more thrown on them while the other employees just squeak by, They scream work life balance, but what kind of life do  you have if you don't get home until midnight?"
good,"It was not a bad job all and all just not for me"
good,"Working for autonation was okay at best. I say okay because while working there, the management went from being relaxed to very cut-throat in a matter of years due to management shifting and people leaving the company for better employment."
good,Good culture but very micromanaged. Every customer had to be dealt with the same way. There was no tailoring the sale to the customer. Not everyone is the same.
good,Good employer and good place to work.Better interaction from upper management would make it a better place to work.Customer service area could be much better.
good,"Worked to many hours for to litle income plus leave kids alone for a whole year. "
good,"Very helpful employess, fast paced job, lots of benefits, flexable hours. Management is great and very helpful. hardest part of the job, was possibly working the 2nd shift which was until midnight"
good,Wouldnt work with autonation again the company mass produces it employees just to expend them until they fall I worked from the ground up for some years and got the short end of the stick no matter how good I was. Would never recommend then as a business would never consider them for a job again.
good,This is a great place to work if you are not in the Tech field. Technology (IT\Telecom) prefers to outsource or contract out work rather than hire in.
good,"it is ok not a bad place to work, management is lacking a lot but very chill job. No Training so you will be very lost if you have no previous knowledge."
good,Not a team oriented business. They outsource when it comes to hiring managers and finance directors. Could care less of how many hours and employee works.
good,Very cut throat and competitive. New manager didn't care about the guys who made the dealership there money. The benefits where OK but not worth the time and hassle
good,We went through so many managers with in a year. last manager wasn't so nice to be around. However the Heads of the company weren't bad. I sold cars so the hours were terrible. However there was a constant flow of customers.
good,"no management training"
good,"Every dealership tries to tell you that they aren't like the stereotypical dealer, but they're all lying for the most part. This place is no exception. If you're ok with a high-pressure environment, and willing to put in many hours at the dealership, then you can be compensated VERY well. If you're just a nice guy/gal wanting to help people, this job will frustrate you and not pay you at all."
good,"Typical work day...stressful"
good,"typical day is when you get into the office you would need to do your daily cold callings, then you would need to go on field to take walk in customers. working environment is quick paced, competitive. Managers and coworkers are all friendly."
good,Since this is a self sufficient job setting you must be extremely outgoing and have energy constantly. This job requires 60-80 hours a week. Includes a saturday shift
good,i have a very negative personal problem with them so all i can say is do not do it. save your self the trouble.
good,This is a great place to work if you need money and cannot find some other line of work. I struggled to get along with the employees and management.
good,You learn about the car industry from the ground level. The days are busy and so are the nights. Needs to understand how to work with multiple personalities and do not take things personal.
good,I like the job you can basically do anything there.  Mangers were really cool. Only have one problem with a co worker cause he gossip but  he left the beginning. other than that It was a fun place to work at.
good,"Okay to work but not my dream job. Overall friendly co-workers, system not hard to learn."
good,"A lack of clear guidance and muddled corporate training mixed with a ""do it our way"" in store attitude leads to a lack of uniformity and constant turnover..."
good,I was hired by a General Manager who was looking to update the sales team by adding a more diversified sales team.  The benefits to work for the company the first three months was generous.
good,"Very helpful employess, fast paced job, lots of benefits, flexable hours. Management is great and very helpful. hardest part of the job, was possibly working the 2nd shift which was until midnight"
good,"My supervisor at the time tried to include me. But there was too much of a ""clique"" vibe that her and the other girls had. But aside from that, the company is an amazing place to work for. Not only do they care about you as a person they actually treat their employees really well. I only wish for two things. 1. That they would offer the option to remote work. 2. That they signed me on full time. *I was only temp*"
good,"AutoNation Ford, Marietta is incredibly unorganized. The finance managers are constantly contracting customers on the wrong vehicle forcing the customer(s) to be inconvenienced by having to return to the store and spend at least another 45 minutes in the finance office resigning their contract and purchase agreement. Sometimes this process drags out and takes longer. "
good,"Ok, made good commission. Not much room to step up. Economy became poor.Did 22 years there, and made good income. New boss had a thing for my wife, so I became terminated."
good,"AutoNation is a relatively decent company to work for overall. Had the misfortune of being at a poorly managed location during my tenure. As far the culture is concerned, it does seem to be any different than most dealerships."
good,"Loved my team, love the job, the cooperation is where it struggles, they take away all the money and expect you to work harder, not really fair, this is making me write more things so I am writing!"
good,"Even though the job is fun, the work ethic of the employer and employees are nearest to none. I do so love to frolic and play while working just as long the job gets done."
good,"Good Money, but company has poor benefits and no work-life balance. Management was concerned with only making money and less on customer satisfaction that only reflected on the survey."
good,This job will grant you the oppurtunity to get and train at a job in sales and learn the industry. commision based and you can make as much money as you want as long as you work long and hard hours.
good,"Very little training, management is payed on volume sold so if you don't start running out of the gate they will ignore you. Workplace environment very stressful."
good,Management is very unprofessional towards workers sometimes trying to slow you down while working they do not treat all workers equally at least at the place I work at
good,"Compensation is lacking unless you work at Autonation for years and have the customer base. There is almost always an issue with the paycheck which takes quite some time to resolve and it is not communicated very well what happened or why and how it is going to be resolved. "
good,"worked with alot of lazy people. bad management and there is alot of favoritism. lack of teamwork. opened 7 days. such a busy enviroment, you will not have a life if work there."
good,"there was a lot of work and a high turn over rate of the work force. often short handed. i was able to get a promotion when i was there, but the work never slowed down"
good,"Autonation was an ok place to work. Sink or swim in cars, as they say, or just in sales generally. Management was poor and inexperienced in handling difficult slow sales periods."
good,"Good people for the most part, it is the management that has comfortably stood at their positions for some time and not innovative or mindful as they may think."
good,Good company to work for but constant change in management leads to unhappy workers and advancement from within hard. Good benefits and work environment.
good,"Great principles and ideals, but not executed at the management level.  Staff was the best, but not a lot of support at the corporate level.  A lot of turnover due to the low pay structure for the auto business.  Great place to learn but then you need to leave to go make some real money."
good,"work every weekend, is was not a bad place just not the right day off. Working every holiday gets old real quick. Car sales are fun you just never get family time."
good,"Very helpful employess, fast paced job, lots of benefits, flexable hours. Management is great and very helpful. hardest part of the job, was possibly working the 2nd shift which was until midnight"
good,"Working as a front-line salesperson in the retail automotive business is a ruthless ordeal, and one should expect no less at any particular dealership operating under normal principles. The pay system is oblique and the numbers they tell us we're ""earning"" often do not match up with reality and the paycheck. Further, any and all benefits that are not structured through the corporate levels are liable to be taken away at the whim of the particular GM of your store. Do not expect much in terms of support, but do your best. It is not the worst place to work."
good,"My experience has been lackluster. No training on policies and procedures. I was recruited based on extensive experience, but am not allowed to use methods and procedures that have generated tremendous results in the past. Cannot hold bad actors accountable in the shop.  Maybe other locations are different, but this one is dysfuntional."
good,"They make it twice as hard and set it up so you make less money and don't have the same opportunities if you are female. For example: always having the new hire and in training technicians on your team but being expected to keep pace with a team that all technicians have 8 or more years of experience. Being blamed for things that are not you or your teams fault, and in fact happened on days when you were not there. Having to tell a customer one thing even though you know it is wrong so the manager can swoop in and save the day by doing the right thing and throwing you under the bus. Going to upper management is useless because the usually just refer you back to your immediate supervisor, even if the problem is with that person."
good,Lack of stable management makes this a difficult environment to work in. The dealership has been through three Service Managers. Two Parts Managers. Three General Managers in my three and a half years of employment there. As well as numerous poorly trained Service Writers and parts department employees.
good,They show favoritism towards certain techs in regards to advancement and delegation of work.  Allow certain people special privileges and not doing anything about cherry picking.
good,"Automotive Sales, Service Parts.  AutoNation's corporate philanthropic policies were commendable, and something I took pride in supporting.  That is all I will say."
good,"Very helpful employess, fast paced job, lots of benefits, flexable hours. Management is great and very helpful. hardest part of the job, was possibly working the 2nd shift which was until midnight"
good,This place is very clean.  Lot very organized.  Able to find what you need in a heartbeat. Support from tech staff is very good.  Great service department.
good,"very fast pace store, very stressful  store sore is very disorganized"
good,Autonation Ford of Sanford is a potential goldmine that sadly no one tries to strike. The management will be the most horrible problem there. And were talking about upper management. The service managers I have seen go through there ranged from terrible to magnificent but sadly its always the upper corporate management that can't fix there issues and blames everyone one below them. I do hear that other Autonations are better but mainly its Ford of Sanford that should be avoided till the higher ups hire good people and let them do what they do best.
good,They don't know how to hand out work. They cant get their parts order. The paint side can not keep up. The buffer is slow. It seeems as if they dont care on how a car turns out
good,"It was a good job to have to have while going through school, pretty flexible with hours. Very poor management, I actually got a promotion without a pay raise."
good,"Due to changes in warehouse management and processes, there rarely seemed to be any person who knew exactly what to do on a day to day basis. I was also told there were no guidelines for salary improvement or opportunities to advance."
good,"If you have a family and do not like seeing them, than this is the place for you. Favoritism is the name of the game in business. The GM should steer away from bringing his religious beliefs into the office."
good,"Not much positive to say! not people oriented!"
good,"I make about 6-7k per month consistently and it comes at a severe cost. I'll work open to close a few days a week, the rest I go as long as I can usually 9/10hrs. The turn over is like nothing I've ever seen, every month we add 4 or 5 people to replace the ones we lost. In the spring and summer there could be as many as 3 new people every week. The managers do the best they can with new people all the time, but with weak earning potential and soull draining hours they will eventaully get forced out. Those that stay and learn to sell efficiently will also decide that they can do better at dealerships with stronger pay plans. If it were not for a few friends and a couple great managers doing their level best to keep the place on track I'd have left long ago too. The unit pay plan is fairy new and poorly conceived, I find it difficult to believe that it's working as intended so I'll give it a few more months to see if it improves otherwise I'll move to a different dealership before the spring rush. It's not a bad place to work for a short time. It will be harder to move away since unit sales is the opposite of being on commission where you take your time and build value. Unit sales teaches you to turn and burn and give a away the car quickly so you can move on to the next. In closing Autonation does strive to be something better and this current pay system that has created a fast food approach to car sales won't last. With a few adjustments it could be a great place to start a career, a normal 50hr week and enough money to live on without racing to 20 cars for the rest of your"
good,"Great place to learn the industry but working 60 hours a week does not leave my with any free time. Many people have quit in the short time I've been here, an indicator that something is wrong."
good,"Most work is outside and in the weather.  Change overs in personnel made things difficult. "
good,"Sold to Grieco Automotive group"
good,"Great opportunity for advancement.  This is a good job for new sales associates, if you are experienced, look elsewhere. Poor pay compared to other automotive sales , shrinking bonus and incentive pay plans.  Incredibly high turn over due to poor management techniques."
good,worked in used cars recon lots of hours. very fast paced. service manager was very hard to work for. all other employeeswere great to work with. enjoyed it as long as I didn't have to talk to the service manager
good,"Managers are nice, and understanding. They help you grow and want you to advance by any means necessary. They are supportive of your goals and make sure it happens."
good,"VP IT will not listen to those below him and expects you to perform miracles even when you have advised him that it is not possible and that some adjustments need to be made to various facets of the business to achieve his goals. People are nice, some are superficial and clueless, but otherwise a great place to work. Attitude and morale is good there. I am only familiar with IT. Not AN in general."
good,"As with most car dealerships, things can be quite challenging. Since this is primarily commission based industry/business, you have to roll with the punches. Overall the process and dedication to customers is great. Some management personnel show favoritism, which is very discouraging to new salespeople."
good,Busy shop daily within the metropolitan area for the most part running short staffed but always managed to get customers in and out
good,Great learning experience. Participated in the early development of an in-house advertising agency to support efforts to cut back advertising agency budget. Company develop software to enable and facilitate the creation of large volume of advertising material such as web banners and social media content.
good,"Very helpful employess, fast paced job, lots of benefits, flexable hours. Management is great and very helpful. hardest part of the job, was possibly working the 2nd shift which was until midnight"
good,"This job consumes your life. No time for family, friends or vacations. Harsh and in your face management and have to watch out for other salesmen taking your customers. Its a hard business to be in but I think AutoNation is at least on the right track."
good,"Assisting customers and dealing with customer requirements pertaining to repair and/or servicing of the vehicle issues. Follow-up to customers on repair status and charges for repairs and to promote service sales, maintenance and repair needs identified during the service appointment process."
good,i arrived at work a 6:45 a.m. Most days i changed tires and oil
good,"Fast paced,  good co workers, customer resolution and satisfaction, goal obtainment."
good,"Working at Autonation Toyota Winter Park was a bad experience for me. I have work ethics, I did not find any there. You have a sales goal to meet and your co-workers would do whatever it takes meet that goal, including being dishonest and stub you int your back. If you are alone, I mean, no kids, no wife, no pets, that place could work, but if you have a family and you love them and want to stay with them, this is not a good place. Long hours including saturdays, sundays, holidays."
good,The sales position was alright honestly the hours are rough and one has learning curve to overcome. It‚Äôs good if you don‚Äôt mind living at the dealership.
good,"Great comm structure but very slow. Manager always feeding their favorites. Great trainings and product knowledge, and free lunch every saturday. Team of sales great to work with."
good,"The management is kind of helter-skelter.  No chance for advancement.  No annual raises or reviews.  Basically, if you want to advance or want a raise, you can go elsewhere."
good,"They had a lot of fun activities for the employees. "
good,AutoNation is a good place to get started.  Not a good place to think about a career.  The compensation is weak compared to industry standards.  The corporate accountants who don't understand sales really mess this place up.  The reason the stock trades so low is because they are so worried about spending money that everyone ends up with less money and sad faces.  It's really a shame to witness.
good,The groups I worked with was a good group but it was hard to get the accounts payables managers at the dealership level to cooperate with us to fix mistakes on the sublet schedule..
good,"This company is very corporate based. The pay plans are not what you would expect. They pay was twice a month didn‚Äôt matter what day it fell on. You had certain dates you would get paid on. Just beware this company is very corporation based and all about big money. The little guys don‚Äôt matter much, the ones that do so much with little recognition."
good,"Steady work with the opportunity to learn many different responsibilities."
good,Great if you are a shark. Long hours and constant cold calling previous customers if you don't already have your own. Started at $2000 1st month. $1500 2nd month/with  %commission $1000 3rd month/with %commission.4th month minimum wage unless you sell and get commission only
good,A typical day at work would consist of organizing and cleaning work station while awaiting for specific instructions. Must maintain a healthy relationship with other individuals.
good,"Not exactly a well managed company for many reasons.  As a Parts Driver, I had a lot of responsibility that created a certain amount of stress.  The pay was not commensurate with the responsibility  (minimum wage).  There was not a ""team spirit"" atmosphere as management seemed to be more concerned with covering their back side.  The fleet vehicles (trucks) were not maintained by professional standards.  Only the minimum was performed, and consequently many of the high mileage vehicles broke down.  Shoddy image, no real pride in the company.  Lack of genuine concern."
good,"Could have been better, was not as organized as one would have hoped. I loved my co-workers and that‚Äôs kind of where it stopped for the most part. Bottom line, it‚Äôs a Corporation."
good,autonation nissan went through 6 managers in the  years i was there no. really not a great place to work but if you need bills paid anything will do lol.
good,"It was an alright place for the moment Didn't love management, felt very cliquey and just need to move on to a different job. seemed to be all over the place and hard to keep steady in the ever changing magnet decisions"
good,"Very helpful employess, fast paced job, lots of benefits, flexable hours. Management is great and very helpful. hardest part of the job, was possibly working the 2nd shift which was until midnight"
good,"I was able to learn new skills that I will carry with me for the rest of my life. I've learned how to deal with people, negotiate, finance, and learn about cars and related things that I was not able to learn before hand. The amount of hours needed to spend there is ridiculous and got in the way of my personal life. 30 calls minimum were expected and selling 10 cars a month was below average. The people working there are fun people to hang around but can easily turn there backs on you. Its not a job for everyone and car salesman get a lot of flack for lying but that's usually not the case depending on who your salesperson is."
good,"have worked here for 2 and a half years and i have done multiple services to vehicle and have done light line work (turbos, clutches, brakes, tires) all the way up to heavy line (engines, transmissions, diesel diagnosis and repair) all around have learned a lot from this company and working there"
good,This Organization has a great cause behind it and has the potential to be great. However it is a very small organization it a world of large put together organizations. I came on as an intern and was luck to be offered a position right out of college. There is a quick turn over rate with in its employees. There is a great group of people that support and help this organization but in my opinion it needs more then one person running and calling all the shots for the organization.
good,"My time spent there was mostly spent working on my individual work planner, however, I often times had to coach other coworkers and help them meet their goals, as well as give them training tips and overall improvements to how they handle certain situations. I learned a lot about customer service as well as sales. Working with customers is always a great thing to have within a job, getting to meet new people and react and assist with their individual needs is something not everybody can do, but something I enjoy very much."
good,"Enjoyed working in the ssc (Irving, TX) . Team leads were great and always willing to help. Department was very active and always had something to work on."
good,"A recent improvement in customer satisfaction through the survey process has reduced stress level somewhat. Corporate seems reluctant to reinvest in equipment and facilities,"
good,"Clean and get funded any outstanding deals to keep CITs in check, work on pending deals with the bank, spend time at sales desk to see if anything is need, as well as checking with the accounting department if they need anything.  Being at the sales desk is a huge thing in my opinion, as you, as the finance manager would have more value and control on how to properly maxamize profits on each and every deal"
good,"I enjoyed the work and was successful.  I was given autonomy because I was a top performer.  Even so, you still had to work at least 65 hours a week if you wanted to earn your bonus.  I missed my family but am so thankful for the experience."
good,OK place to work in certain departments.  Month end processing is a big deal monthly.  Overtime is usually offered and certain departments are offered incentives for OT such as paid lunches.
good,"I learned all the details yoou have to check/show at the moment your buying a car (used or new). "
good,"Compensation/development/operation structure not motivational for a strong sales team."
good,A lot of busy work that can be easily simplified if management trusted its employees and provided more guidance on what prices are to be sent on each model. More streamlined processes and working equipment would help the store move in the right direction.
good,"Trabaje durante 8 meses en Autonation Honda Miami Lake, no existe entre los vendedores ning√∫n tipo de compa√±erismo, y aqu√≠ nunca el cliente tiene la razon."
good,"Very helpful employess, fast paced job, lots of benefits, flexable hours. Management is great and very helpful. hardest part of the job, was possibly working the 2nd shift which was until midnight"
good,"Loved working in a family work environment, I learned so much from the older guys an had wisdom an experience from the master technician .................."
good,"I feel the service advisor position is comparable to other companies.  Working with customers directly, along with technicians and management team."
good,"I love AutoNation. They have done a lot for me. What I don't like is that management doesn't seem to care one way or the other that we are human beings and have families to attend to. Constantly scheduling bells on the weekends, 9 days of straight work, etc...I know it's car business, but come on. There needs to be some kind of a work/life balance in this business. They be surprised how much more productive happy employees can be. Its not about the AMOUNT OF TIME spent at work, it's about the QUALITY OF TIME spent at work. Just imagine was a fresh salesperson can do vs one that is beat up and exhausted every day."
good,"I worked for Autonation and they are a great company to work for.  However the one that I happen to work at in Knoxville, TN happen to have the worst management and I could never get any real experience in the Finance Dept> My finance Director would give me all the cash deals and take the ones that he knew he wouldn't have to fight hard for.  He was a horrible boss, teacher and leader.  I will say it is not auto-nation that was bad but he gave them a bad rep"
good,"Friendly atmosphere to learn giving the consumers good customer service ,but career advancement is difficult with evolving rotation of management.Constant changes in sales so must willing to adapt quickly."
good,Overall it was not a bad work environment although management was a revolving door while I worked there. I enjoyed my coworkers and in general everyone had a pretty great attitude while working.
good,"Can be hectic at times since, depending on your position, you work off commission.  You don‚Äôt always know what your going to make.  The key is consistency.  I‚Äôve been trying to advance for the past 5 years in the business but get passed up by people who know higher ups.  Hard work doesn‚Äôt always get you promoted."
good,"It‚Äôs hard to say, after almost 10 years at one place of employment the good and the bad.  Here goes, the people are not bad, most are pretty relaxed and fun to chat with.  Management like any where you go has it‚Äôs moments."
good,I like the people there. Their was not a enough work at that location. I would only write up about 160 car's a month. Which I normal do over 200 ro's at other places.
good,"AutoNation is not a place to work if you want fulfillment, its just a job. It's a massive company with plenty of mind-numbing work to give you if you'd like it. The pay will never be great, but the job security is pretty good."
good,"This place is stressful as you would expect the car business to be, but it goes deeper. There are always quotas to hit so the employees and their interests are left in the back burner if the numbers are not being met. Just wish my time there would have been spent learning how to do more."
good,employees should be well compensated considering their performance. additional training for each staff shold be considered as well. yearly increase should be implemented
good,"Be prepared to work long hours it is the nature of the business."
good,"lots of lifers"
good,"Its all about sales, If you do not sale you get looked down on. Its a very competitive work place with lots of stress. The hardest part of the job is actually being able to go to work and not sale anything without going crazy."
good,"Management needs improvement., and pay rate needs improvement, the work hours can be long at month end and no overtime . you are basically a data entry person"
good,"hard work, but for young adults its good money, depending on the man power the hours are great but overall its a good job for some one of less responsiblity"
good,Unlimited earning potential. Always speaking to different customer and can be very fast paced. Would be great if work life balance was better. Lots of 12 hour days. Sometimes will ask to stay at the dealership and not leave to take lunches. They will buy lunches most Saturdays but grab it while you can otherwise you wont have any left. Overall management was very good at communicating your duties and helping. Very high pressure and sales driven.
good,State of the art new facility with floundering sales leadership results. Dealership is suffering in sales and service. Poor service CSI and low market share for sales and service.
good,"In the service department I had the chance to work with some great coworkers, great techs and a fantastic parts department. My direct management was great, upper management was bad and crippled the service department further and further each month. The base salary is very low, and the place is small, not near any major highways so business can get slow. The clientele ranged from good educated people to the most ignorant people you could ever meet."
good,"Very helpful employess, fast paced job, lots of benefits, flexable hours. Management is great and very helpful. hardest part of the job, was possibly working the 2nd shift which was until midnight"
good,"There was a lot more customer interaction than I expected but most was very positive and you are supported when customers are not happy. I did enjoy my time with the other employees and getting to know them. "
good,"Worked my way up to the Corporate office, complete opposite of the dealership I worked for, fun place to work on occasion, free monthly lunches, most of the people I worked with were nice"
good,Stressful job. Got hounded by a manager 24/7. Hard to get customers when you're a rookie in the business.
good,"meeting and greeting different people of all different backgrounds and endeavoring to meet their needs and wants and fitting them into the right vehicle that fulfill their required budget and making sure that they drive off with the car of their choice and completely satisfied.everday is a learning experience just by simply listening to customers how they all outlined their wants and needs and how they sometimes respond to how a car drives and feels.management is always an integral part of structuring a transaction for a customer because they are the ones who are equipped with most of the intricate information that may be needed to put a transaction together and believe it or not management's involvement always boost the confidence of the customer which most of the times make them feel special.on the other hand it is always necessary for my coworkers to maintain a friendly demeanor around the customers which is going to reinforce the fact that the store is a friendly place to do business.the hardest part of the job is always to close the customer on an affordable payment if he or she is financing other than that everything oozes if the right procedures are followed,the most enjoyable part of the whole scenario is when the sale is earned and the customer is taking delivery in a very happy and enthusiastic way and I am the person making sure that such a situation comes to fruition."
good,"Good place to work, but too much corporate interference & restriction."
good,It's a fun place to work.
good,"very easy laid back job. Be to work on time grab the keys to your van. check your area for any items, once you the time is up for all of your items to be station you load up and make your delivery, You repeat this two more times for the day, you have three pickups in a day. once you're finished with your last delivery from your last pick up. you return your van with your keys and any money the was received for any items that day."
good,"Wouldn't go back, it was fun at times. No work / life balance. Money is good if you work hard. No time off at all. Expected to work 24/7 and if you request off it is usually denied."
good,Always in a rush to complete tasks given to techs causing mistakes to happen. Being overloaded with work to where you can‚Äôt keep up even if you are going as fast
good,I enjoyed the time I worked there. Just needed to change jobs as I moved to a different city. The atmosphere is good. I learned a lot there but needed to move
good,"Easy job, get to drive their vehicles to the shops, pay is horrible. Hardest part of the job is the beginning, learning how to do everything. Hectic mornings"
good,"A typical day at work consisted of being at a desk following up with leads, completing online training, and working with customers you can catch."
good,"Taught me managerial skills, manned the station for phone calls and pulling internet leads, being diplomatic with customers to increase sale productivity, managing yourself around your co-workers, maintaining the skill of being indistractable"
good,"Too much red tape, takes far too long to get anything done. Too many Chiefs and not enough Indians. Always running off the good employees, and keeping the bad ones... cheaper..."
good,"Newer shop with AC and nice equipment, nice place to work but you must be willing to go hunt for repair orders to make any flat rate money, a very ""feast or famine"" type of work environment, recommend having ASEs and prior brand experience to advance, 7am-5pm all week and every other Saturday 7am-5pm, parts are hard to get even though there is a warehouse just down the street, often times waiting hours for parts can cost valuable time and money, you do get paid for training that you pass."
good,3-4 new car spot deliveries daily. i learned how to give full details to cars from the interior to exterior. occasional 2-3 shuttle rides to customers daily. most of the other employees were always willing to teach you new things or to help you in some way. management there was pretty unorganized and unprofessional sometimes very rude. to employees and customers. the most enjoyable part of the job was working with cars.
good,It was a great start to my car sales career. Would have stayed if they had a more traffic and more stable upper management at the time. The days and moods of everyone fluctuated more than my liking.
good,The hard work you put in will reap great benefits. It requires a lot of hours and you really have to apply yourself to sell cars. The tools to do so are well offered and when used properly can be very productive.
good,"If you're a female you will and willing to play you will be ok."
good,"Very helpful employess, fast paced job, lots of benefits, flexable hours. Management is great and very helpful. hardest part of the job, was possibly working the 2nd shift which was until midnight"
good,"Autonation has an outdated approach at training and buying cars,  especially apprising them. Autonation has come out with a salary based and commission  pay plan that will make most salespeople lazy. and just look forward to earning the least amount needed."
good,"This is a job as a car sales man. If you are motivated and don't mind the long hours, this could be a place for you. You have the opportunity to make a lot of money."
good,AutoNation was a great company.  However I pride myself of Customer Satisfaction and I don't believe we were holding all employees accountable for the their repeated disregard for their (cusotmers) time.
good,Nice company to work for. Can use some improvement however altogether good place to be. Most employees are helpful and professional. The team can use some work on helping others accomplish their sales goals.
good,"I was only there a few months after they bought out the company I had been working for nearly 20 years, so I can not give any qualifying answers regarding rating the company or advancement etc."
good,"The pay was by flag hours by my position title, so although I would work over 40 hours per week I was only being payed for the hours I worked on vehicles. There was simply not enough vehicles coming in and I could not make nearly enough money. The other technicians I worked around were hard working and very willing to show me information on how to even more efficiently handle the job. The manager however was rather lackluster and did not seem to have a desire to take care of more than the absolute minimum."
good,Good national organization with weak local management protocols.  Benefits offered after 90 days.  Competitive work environment where your drive and motivation are the key elements to your success.
good,"Generate payroll audit reports and audit against supporting documents to ensure compliance with document retention policies."
good,"Issue checks to lienholders/customer after completion of deal "
good,"On one hand I liked the work of a service writer but it was extremely stressful. Training was not very through and you were thrown to the wolves pretty quickly. However, if could be exciting and interesting work and if you are an extrovert with a competitive streak it may be the job for you. You will work long hours and have little time to yourself outside of work."
good,"Each day varies, usually its really slow and then business picks up in the afternoon. "
good,"The work was good if you like cars and trucks. One of the managers was a jerk. Not sure if he is still there."
good,"Very helpful employess, fast paced job, lots of benefits, flexable hours. Management is great and very helpful. hardest part of the job, was possibly working the 2nd shift which was until midnight"
good,"AutoNation Lincoln Of Clearwater was a new experience for me.I was in retail sales  for many years. I was selling $100,000 vehicle just found it not for me they were well-established salesman that had been there for 20 to 30 years with repeat business  I was getting  very few Up‚Äôs  as we college in the business just walk in trade and a few phone calls customers I found it very hard to make a living and I was salary plus commission but very few customers found the writing on the wall that this was not going to be for me I stuck it  Out for  eight months put in my notice and move on."
good,Although management is trying to grasp and act on the changing nature of the car-buying industry there are too many projects running in parallel with resources spread thin.
good,"Loved the pay but management was highly unprofessional, I was there for over a year and half, do not recommend this place to anyone. Everyone there is unhappy."
good,"The local IT dept is a very good starting place to gain job skills. Most of the folks are pleasant. Ask questions but retain the information whether by internally or externally, which ever way you prefer."
good,"when i was hired i was told that there was potential growth opportunity, the two stores i was taking care of did not have a used car manager. 1 of Their main focuses is on days to photos on-line with descriptions in which they were 6.9 days. With in 45 day i moved that to 4.5 days ,also there recon was out of control and they were writing back trade weekly which i corrected immediately. After our Market President left (who was the person that hired me) to take another job the new president decided to eliminate the used car position."
good,"A typical day would be spent taking customer sales calls and placing parts orders.    Calling on customers for service issues and mitigating parts order issues, if any."
good,"Employees there are great and good work environment, 4 different General Managers in 5 years so it makes it hard to have a consistently productive store."
good,its a big company  good benefits for the employes    good time with the employes good celebrations they pay for holy days a lot of opportunities for grow on the comapy
good,"Very helpful employess, fast paced job, lots of benefits, flexable hours. Management is great and very helpful. hardest part of the job, was possibly working the 2nd shift which was until midnight"
good,"lots of paperwork and organizing ,friendly co workers, quiet for the most part, making sure everything is in order for the next shift or following day"
good,"after working there for 20 years it had its ups and downs.  Depending on your GM you could grow yourself and your business, or be pushed to the back until they took notice and decided not to strangle your department."
good,This is a great company for self motivated individuals who have great customer service skills. Must have the ability to close the deal. Able to work everyday and be apart of a team environment.
good,Nice company to work for but limitations on advancement within the company. Job roles are spread out over the country and very limited availability of jobs
good,"This place has plenty of great perks, it‚Äôs a wonderful spot to for beginners. They really teach you and give you the time you need. You‚Äôll just never make as much money as you want"
good,At the end of the month was a very long stressful time working 12-16 hours for 3 days in a row.  Very unfriendly environment.  Office manage didn't seem to care if you had a problem or not.
good,"The manager for the service department of the USA store was extremely erratic in behavior and policy.  Treatment of service employees was not good or consistent.  He could be confrontational and verbally unacceptable.  Upper management was unsupportive in finding solutions to the issue. They encourage you to try and advance but don't back it up.  "
good,Everyone worked together to complete goals.  everyone got along with the body shop.  management did not stay the same was always changing along with the writers.
good,The culture at that specific location barely followed the companies ideals. The GM just yelled at people and scratched lottery tickets all day. One of the design managers was a little sexist. The pay was way too low for the hours and effort I put in while working there.
good,An automotive retailer that's been around for a number of years.  I've seen lots of change within the organization.  Pay isn't consistent with the market.
good,I was able to learn more than at my prior job. The managers and director was very friendly. I like that you are able to be flat rate and the possibility to earn a lot of money.
good,"Decent place to work and lots of vehicles to select from when buying..Great Sales staff. Fast paced/High volume, which I like. Work load is quite a bit for the pay."
good,First car dealership I've worked in. From what it was I'm assuming other car dealerships are similar. It's not bad but it depends on how adept you are at selling and somewhat on the management team.
good,Just not enough work managment sucks parts to slow not the right parts painters get the easy jobs cant make money there I need more money to support my family
good,"however even some of their decisions have to be approved by over head, including someone requesting less hours that works 75  hours a week. Managers in store were amazing"
good,"A typical day included arriving 15min before shift. Onced clocked in, technician would ""Locate"" service ready vehicles electronically via computer terminal. After identifying populated assignment, whether by open orders or pre-assignment, technician would locate vehicle and begin assessment. Once assignment is completed, or on hold for authorization or parts, technician would repeat above locating process. If services are quoted, the technician will provide service times and parts costs to adviser for authorization. Parts costs/availability are identified via back parts counter employee. Service times are found via service manual labor time requirements. Technician will estimate service completion times and communicate all advancements and set-backs throughout day to appropriate advisers. Clean up and storage of workplace during last hour of shift."
good,AutoNation Collision Center of Las Vegas is a good place to work.. They have all tools necessary to do your job and offer the training needed. They are a fair place to work and take their employee well being in mind.
good,"Very helpful employess, fast paced job, lots of benefits, flexable hours. Management is great and very helpful. hardest part of the job, was possibly working the 2nd shift which was until midnight"
good,Continuous education was provided to learn your product and the product of your competitor. Those who chose not to take advantage of it would not have the competitive edge or necessary knowledge to perform well. I enjoyed knowing my Product well.
good,Good place to learn and move on. They buy up small local businesses . Very corporate just another cog in the big machine. Start here lean business and move on.
good,It was fun while it lasted but new management came in and wants to redo the deparments. But overall good company. I would suggest working but very fast paced
good,It was a great place to work. lots of team work and working on getting the most accurate productivity. Changing procedures all the time. no over time given.
good,"Working at Auto Nation started great until Corporate started standardizing all the stores. The prices are too expensive for customers compared to other close by locations and pay is based on customers surveys. One customer can ruin your pay for up to three months. If you do not have a life outside work then this is the job / career to go for where the money can be good, but again no life. You are pushed to achieve certain unattainable goals and recognition beyond when you do. Overall a good steeping stone to get into the automotive field and dealing with administrative tasks and people."
good,"Car dealership with a fast pace record, always changing and trying to meet customer needs. The company had many goals to meet in a standard work day and the environment sometimes hard to take."
good,Hardest part of job is working under flat rate pay.  Not consistent in terms of pay or work. Plenty of experience working on a fast paced shop. Must be a good sales person in order to make a good living
good,Great place to work. Great people to work with. Management needs some work. Good place to start. Big jobs right off the bat. Good learning environment.
good,"my day consisted of filling, distributing mail, listing DMV bundles, cutting customer refund checks, assist cashier and receptionist when necessary and making sure my area is clean"
good,Fast paced work environment with minimal training for an entry level position. When its busy you have to wait long periods of time to get assistance and keep in mind your time is money.
good,"Employee satisfaction "
good,Can't really make a valid recommendation.  Have been gone from there for a long time and they have had a couple of management changes in the interim.....
good,Manager mike yale was very aggressive. But it was okay place not put work to do there and it was so hard to deal with the bull and they never had anyone back
good,Had bad experience at the end they have no concern for family being.in need. I was the perfect employee but still no respect from my superiors or mangement
good,Autonation Ford was a very stressful place to work. The machinery was Old and unreliable. Poor managing. I would definitely not recommend someone here.
good,I enjoy working at AutoNation. The people are friendly and there is always work to do. Some things could use improvement like the way management handles certain situations and more growth opportunity for hard working employees.
good,"The company I started for was purchased by AutoNation and I worked with them for a brief period. They are a large automotive company, maybe the largest. Have a lot of training and great benefits."
good,Great people and a fun place to work. As with any public company micro management is a daily occurrence with making it difficult to perform. If you like lots of regulations this place is for you
good,"Training is non-existent. Was not given the tools to be successful. Long hours, commission only. Benefits were were available but very high deductibles."
good,Management wasn't the greatest but had structure. job wasn't bad did not pay to well but had places to advance to. real good entry level job........................
good,"Very helpful employess, fast paced job, lots of benefits, flexable hours. Management is great and very helpful. hardest part of the job, was possibly working the 2nd shift which was until midnight"
good,"A typical day answering lots of phone calls, a lot of customer contact. You have to be loud and let anger customers hurt your feelings or if an estimator is having a bad day you cant take everything they say or there tones hurt your feelings."
good,"Job requires long hours,lofty goals with little to no management. High expectation with no training or opportunity for advancement. Requires high unrealistic sales goals that require customers to pay high prices for unnecessary work"
good,It was a pretty boring job. Just moving cars around all day after all the sales people rudely moved them and would hide keys so I get in trouble. Was not a very nice work environment
good,If you like selling cars and meeting new people then this is the job for you. Also remember that your paid on commission so make sure you work for your money and do what you have to make a sell
good,Low pay and high work load to new employee. Everyone have to work like a machine non stop otherwise can not achieve their expectation goal. Some department have to work 15-16 hours a day during month end.
good,"a typical day is long."
good,"Sales people are just a number company does not care about their employees. long hours low pay, constant turnover and always moving people around. wont recommend"
good,I loved every day of working there I found my self learning some thing new every day I got to meat new people every day...and there is allways some thing new to move up you don't have to stay in one place...
good,"Loved the people there"
good,I learned how to be very patient with so many different personality's. Honda is a very fast and busy paste company so there is no room for mistakes! Overall it taught me a lot of skills I can use in the future.
good,Great company to start in gaining employment experience. Would recommend to recent graduates. Co-workers are awesome and learned a lot on the job.
good,"was a fun place to work.  The coworkers were the best part.  Sales kind of sucks, customers suck, management sucks, autonations processes suck.  I hated how long it took for no reason.  I worked their and I do not even know why it takes so long to buy a car."
good,"AutoNation was great to work for as a company,i liked how they did things,but the dealership i worked at was a bad place for me to work..no unity,no team,all play and no structure,the new car manager there is a joke"
good,"AutoNation Chevrolet Arrowhead is one of about 300 automobile dealerships across the United States. AutoNation is a large, fiscally stable corporation employing thousands of people. I have worked at three different AN dealerships in the last 14 years, and the people I've worked for and worked with have generally been topnotch folks."
good,"You have all these different Jobs which is awesome, but they wont give you the tools you need to accomplish them properly. I do not like how they let customer walk all over you and treat you like your nothing and then reward the customer with free things then the customer gives you a bad survey and you get your pay cut. I am used to a company that stood up for you when you were being your best, and being professional a and the customer was acting inappropriately using inappropriate language."
good,"Many very unhappy customers."
good,"Very helpful employess, fast paced job, lots of benefits, flexable hours. Management is great and very helpful. hardest part of the job, was possibly working the 2nd shift which was until midnight"
good,A busy day of diagnosing cars and getting them taken care of for the customers. The environment is a team player environment. Co-workers are willing to lend a hand and help if a task comes up that you are not so sure about or need a extra hand. The hardest part of the job is knowing you are just a number.
good,What can I say about car sales? Everyday there is something new. This industry is constantly changing for the better and so the company.
good,"I had the opportunity to work with some remarkable managers and co-workers. I learned new computer programs and customer service tips while dealing with customers. I really liked the interaction with clients and insurance companies, but the hours were very long and were difficult on the home life."
good,I've learned everything you could think of working for AutoNation. Overall I did love the job and co-wokers; but there were crucial changes with compensation.I would have to say the hardest part of the job is being away from my family; but when we are together it's well worth it. I enjoyed seeing the smile of the customers leaving the dealership.
good,Great people to work with. I enjoy the opportunity at first but in the long run I felt that the work load was getting too much for the pay I was getting. The raise here isn't that great but its the people that kept me here.
good,"Most of us who left A/N left, because of the pay. The people who worked there was absolutely amazing. The management was pretty cool but did not know the product hey were selling. I learned a lot about volkswagens in fact that is where, i fell in love with them. The hardest part of the job was not having the ability to approach the management. the most enjoyable part was my co-workers and the clients."
good,"The company is doing well financially. It is conveniently located near my home, so that is makes a difference for me. The company has been in business for quite sometime and continues to grow."
good,"Decent place to work.  Managers are nice, but has a ridiculous schedule even for the car industry.  I've worked at other dealerships and the hours here were far worse.  The process is also antiquated but they are working on updating things so hopefully over the next few years they will improve the purchase process.  Currently it makes it hard to sell more than one car a day as it can take hours just to get a person into finance."
good,i somewhat enjoyed working there but due to management change made it very uncomfortable and i find that organization and customer service was not to my satifaction
good,Very structured but very vanilla in infrastructure people that work there are genuine but management don't know what is going on half the time
good,"I am a self motivator so I come into work work off my priority list I made myself for my lead position. Then I help my Supervisor, team and other associates as needed."
good,"Hard work but pays very well.  Long hours and intensive."
good,"There's politics, like most larger companies. So don't be surprised when the rules change from one day to the next.  But, overall, it's a pretty good place to work. Just know what your job is and what you are responsible for."
good,"A good place to work at if you just want to come in, get work done and leave. Not much room for growth. People are friendly and willing to help you."
good,"Very smart service writers, willing to take the time to help customers with their automobile problems, service issues and concerns."
good,"Good dealership good co workers and management lot of customers "
good,"Overall, I enjoy what I do.  I have a good rapport with most of my coworkers and the customers.  I've definitely grown as an employee here.  The service manager that was here when I started in my department set a high bar for everyone.  If we hit the bar, there was a pat on the back.  If not, there was coaching.  Since he retired two months ago, there has been a shift in management.  There's a feeling from management of, ""Why get a pat on the back for doing what we pay you for?""  Also, if something goes wrong, they're quite eager to find the ""guilty party>""  The morale has gone down in two months.  The employees feel it, as do the customers  I feel like I've hit my glass ceiling here."
good,"Management could step up to make things better, overall nice place to work."
good,"Very helpful employess, fast paced job, lots of benefits, flexable hours. Management is great and very helpful. hardest part of the job, was possibly working the 2nd shift which was until midnight"
good,"they were really a blessing to me, they hired me on the spot since I transferred from out of town and really helped me learn more about the business. they hired as a cashier and my first day on the job they asked me about being a warranty clerk, trained me and showed me all the ins and outs and I really learned a lot."
good,Working with many credit challenged clients to get qualifications for automobile credit trying to match needs with inventory.
good,I learned that what a company says is not always how it truly behaves and I prefer to work for an organization I can believe in.
good,"This is a large company and it feels as if you are a number"
good,"Ocassionaly stressful work environment. Mostly incompetent service advisors. Poor management techniques. Favoritism and cronyism rampant. Lacking in certain basic shop equipment. Nice climate controlled facility with new major equipment pieces. ie: Lifts, alignment racks, ventilation system, etc, etc..."
good,"A typical day at work consists of customer interaction in person, via text, e-mail and phone. Job duties include sales, management of employees, scheduling appointments, estimates, collecting payments, obtaining approval for repairs from clients and warranty companies, client negotiations, profit and percentage evaluations and client follow-ups for future retention. "
good,"‚Ä¢	September 2011 sales person of the month"
good,You interview and help prospects purchase a new or pre owned vehicle.
good,"There is loads to learn from a start up company. I learned manpower management, analysis about many issues-technical and management and more importantly the working with a team. The hardest part of job is co-ordination with labor during financial crunch and most enjoyable is to manage things under intense pressure during emergency times. It tests us in our discomfort zone but in the end we manage to cope up and make sure that the customer line has never stopped."
good,Good company to start out with.Great training processes and culture. The pay is less than most in the industry but make up for it with ease of advancement.
good,Not a bad place to work. Very micromanaged and you really can't make many decisions without corporate review. I think this is a great place to hone your skills but once you have been in the business for a while you will most likely move on. If your a seasoned manager it will make you crazy not being able to make some decisions on your own. They do have some great perks if you can hang in there long enough to get them.
good,"A very large corporation, with typical corporate culture. Overall not too bad, but they all the inconvenient factors like any other big employer, such as burocracy and less effectiveness."
good,This was a good place to learn the necessary skills to close deals. I got a better idea of what it takes to communicate with customers an to effectively use sales skills to make sales.l
good,"This is a sink or swim type deal! There is absolutely no training other than the training modules on dealer central. There are a ton of grey areas with this company, everyone does things different and nobody can tell you what the correct way of doing things is."
good,"AutoNation is the typical automotive dealership where you work 60 plus hours a week. They are open seven days a week."
good,"Perform a walk around"
good,"I'm not even sure where to start. I enjoyed working here when I first started, but in the fast year many things, company-wide, has gone downhill. Paid commission, and havent had a full paycheck in over 7 months due to no work and poor management."
good,"Not a terrible place to spend 40+ hours a week,  Pay was OK, bonus structure needs some work, they really only compensate you for upgrades, not the other sales,  even though you work your but off for incremental sales you don't get the next paying tear because of one particular section."
good,"Very helpful employess, fast paced job, lots of benefits, flexable hours. Management is great and very helpful. hardest part of the job, was possibly working the 2nd shift which was until midnight"
good,"It's a good place to work if there is work to do. It's not for everyone , but its still good. I needed a more stable income than what was presented at Autonation."
good,Biggest complaint was healthcare was way overpricedI Also had a pretty bad general manager Promise me A finance position not to leave gave it to a receptionist  but I did learn a lot
good,If you are looking for an HR driven publicly traded company to work for this is for you. If you can manage to make it to the top the money is there. Not everyone‚Äôs cup of tea
good,I feel in any work place I shouldn't be so stressed about getting fired cause I couldn't complete one task on top of the 6 I had to do that took up majority of my time during the day
good,been with company over (7) years. first several years was a good place to work and little stress. as time continued keep seeing a high turnover of staff and management. currently on by sixth manager in seven years. pay plan has been changed (3) times since being here and not for the good. pay plan is too complicated to figure out. money use to be good but has been getting worse and not worth the time away from home. looking for something closer to home and know what I am looking at for pay.
good,Did not like working for the autonathion santa clarita unfair company didn't know what they were doing will not be going back unless its a higher up position
good,Great placed to work if you're curious about the automotive industry. Not a lot of room for advancement. Always working outside and given an hour break. Great co workers. Hard part is staying in the heat and sometimes dealing with service. Fun part was the opportunity to goof off when there is no work
good,Always work to do although it varies on the amount per day. Can be slow or busy. The fellow employees are great to work with. Can be stressful at times.
good,"This company has taught me a lot about patience. The day usually is easy going with the help coworkers. Management is usually faulty "
good,"Corporate values have changed the Automotive industry completely. The automotive industry was full of hungry, creative, and progressive minds. The need to satisfy stock holders has changed the scope and capacity of our jobs."
good,"Very helpful employess, fast paced job, lots of benefits, flexable hours. Management is great and very helpful. hardest part of the job, was possibly working the 2nd shift which was until midnight"
good,There is not much if anything in terms career advancement or great salary and the company culture is not great but there are nice people who work there which made it worth it.
good,"Great opportunity for advancement through the ranks.  Ability to write your own paycheck if you're good at what you do.  Ability to choose custom work schedule as long as certain work day requirements are met.  That said, if you have a weak constitution when it comes to criticism or don't like talking to people constantly, sales is probably not the job for you."
good,"Management is good old boy network, and if you were not linked to the right person, there was no opportunity to advance.  Time intensive, low pay.  Benefits are good."
good,"Very fast paced, high pressure job where your sucess is totally depended upon your own efforts and skill set. High customer service affiliated. Have to possess strong closing ability. Hardest part of the job would be your abil;ity to withstand long hours and high pressure selling in a very fast paced customer related atmosphere. The most enjoyable part of the job is the monetary rewards if you can perform at a high level and I love working with the customers and they love me."
good,"No life balance, too many hours and no weekends off. Steady flow of customers that go in, too many employees. "
good,"I loved working at AutoNation Ford, at times it was slightly stressful as we were short staffed but I loved how team oriented and motivating team was. I would only tweak a few minor things but other than that it was great. I left due to family medical emergency."
good,Easy company to work for and get adjusted to. The only problem is lack of management and low pay scale. Getting managers to get involved more in the deals earlier and often would improve retention.
good,"I learned to be patient, The hard part is giving the customer service I feel customers need. I enjoy working independently. I love greeting customer and making there experience pleasurable."
good,There is a healthy competitive culture with several opportunities for advancement in one's career.  You determine your income and are your own boss to an extent.
good,"Nothing to report... Typical dealership environment. Lots of hours, critical of vacation time. Show up, have a chance to make great money and drive love,y cars"
good,"This place as a work place is overall excellent."
good,This is a great place to get your career started. If you're new to the auto industry you will learn a lot by working here. It's a very friendly environment.
good,"Manager was not understanding at all, questioned if i had to hold my grandmothers hand when i requested off to be with her for her heart surgery, other than that the rest of the staff was great."
good,Great place for a kid who just got out of high school to work. Management was great and willing to work for their employees. Staff is very helpful and strongly engaged in team work and efforts.
good,"Autonation is nice to work for as the working environment is friendly and comfortable. The benefits are not good, especially the 401k, it is like 1% matching, not doing anyone any favors there. Medical benefits are subpar to and a bit costly. It is also hard to advance your career with the company..."
good,A place where you know what to expect everyday. Outstanding coworkers and clients. Working here I actually got to achieve a very good work to life balance.
good,"Most of my internship days were spent doing Customer Service rather than Marketing. The hardest part was calling consumers and conduct a survey regarding their experience with their vehicle(s). It might sound easy but the company insisted a long survey that would probably take more than a 5-minute phone call. This was difficult because consumers are usually busy, at work, driving, or just simply doesn`t want to be surveyed. Customers tend to get angry as well whenever we ask about their difficulties with the product. However, this definitely improved my self-confidence and communication skills. "
good,"The car industry is a time consuming industry. Be prepared to work a lot of hours, which is not a bad thing. They could pay more. They have very good benefits."
good,"The most rewarding aspect of this position is taking a reluctant buyer, having them enjoy the vehicle that I am showing and finally the customer driving away with the vehicle."
good,Been Working for the same company for many year and looking a career in life.
good,"Very helpful employess, fast paced job, lots of benefits, flexable hours. Management is great and very helpful. hardest part of the job, was possibly working the 2nd shift which was until midnight"
good,"A typical day at work would consist with helping customers with their vehicle needs, answering phone calls, setting appointments and making estimates of repairs to sale to work for the technicians. I learned the product and how to provide great customer service, how to successfully present an estimate to a customer and prioritize their needs. I believe management could of been a little more strict with some employees and not let them do whatever they wanted, come in late, leave early. It sometime conflicted with an on time delivery of car to the customer therefore creating a dissatisfied customer. My co-workers are great people to work with, fun, helped each other if needed and had each others back. The hardest part of my job was to face the customer when a job wasn't done on time or the correct way. But other than that I enjoyed meeting new people everyday, providing great customer service to retain that customer and build my clientele."
good,"Crucial to my success in these positions has been my ability to succeed in an environment where decision-making, self-motivation, a commitment to integrity and excellent communication skills are held at a premium. I truly believe that my skills, experience and character will enable me to offer as My exposure to all aspects of mechanical engineering has enabled me to successfully oversee business development and sales efforts for each organization while generating new revenue for my employers and delivering high customer satisfaction. All of these experiences ‚Äì among many others ‚Äì afforded me invaluable opportunities to develop and enhance my leadership and collaboration."
good,This is a great job if you are looking to make money but do not see yourself being anything else. Came as a seasonal sales associate with the agreement at the beginning of the year I would be focusing on MY career.
good,Would have stayed had my son not been really sick and Hospitalized . All of my managers were very positive and upbeat and willing to help when needed .
good,"I enjoyed the job experience overall. If management will do more to control the out of control ""locker-room"" culture of passive and overt disrespect among co-workers and ties up all the sales process documentation and technological loose ends, this could be the ideal car sales job to have."
good,The position of a finance administrator at AutoNation was a busy job so the days went by quick. Some of the responsibilities of this position were to maintain a relationship with both the customer and the financial lenders and review contracts to ensure they're in company compliance.
good,"A typical work day at AutoNation was fun, we all worked hard to hit our target sales goal of 15 cars a month. The process of the car deal was the most enjoyable part to me."
good,"Too much stress and long hours put in. Never felt job security. Management made employees feel like they are just a corp number and easily replaced. The survey they used to send to customers, to measure if you are doing job is laugh able. Needs to be revised and fixed."
good,"Coworkers are great.  Had a lot of fun.  Work-life-balance?  Not much.  The sales process is time consuming.  Pay could be affected by bad surveys.  4 questions directly counted for/against you but one of the four was based on experience in the finance department (final paperwork).  IF the Fin Dept printed paperwork why is the final paperwork question affect my rating.  And then my pay gets docked if there's an issue?  This made asking for a good survey a must which was annoying.  However, there were some that did very well there.  My suggestion...Internet shopping is killing industry profits so see how pay is determine and what the job specifically requires at any dealership."
good,I enjoyed working as a service advisor for Auto Nation. The customers were mostly friendly and the co-workers are helpful. The environment was clean and the work materials were readily available.
good,"Place is not horrible to work for but it does have its problems. Some of the managment is good, but others are just bad at there job. I did learn how to expand my skills as an automotive technician and learn the ins and outs of CDK. But some things just never change. Sometimes management takes forever to help solve an issue and doesnt care about the internal issues in the department. They just put on a  face for the customers."
good,"Fun company and culture, management experience varies by department."
good,"Great Parts Department"
good,"was a good place to work, but the pay system is very bad and a lot of working hours are required. Was a good experience, but for the amount of time you spend in a dealership you expect your paycheck to be much higher"
good,theres is not alot of work only oil changes and rotation most of real work people didnt want to paid because is too much to fix the vehicle alot of people prefer to fix them selfs.
good,Great dealership.         Good team to work with.        It just was not the job and culture to fit with my personality.  It is a good company to work for.
good,I‚Äôve been here at AutoNation for while I see people come and go it isn‚Äôt for everyone. If you don‚Äôt enjoy working on cars and hustling to get cars down this isn‚Äôt for you
good,"Very helpful employess, fast paced job, lots of benefits, flexable hours. Management is great and very helpful. hardest part of the job, was possibly working the 2nd shift which was until midnight"
good,Too much work and such little pay. Very disorganized and not enough communication going on with workers and the bosses.
good,"I started to work with AutoNation from the beginning of opening.  I was trained/exposed to different aspects of the business from Greeter to showing customer all features of the automobile, outside and under the hood.  Being a new establishment there was a need for further growth and development.  Management had  me in a Business Development position, supervising reception staff and other non selling positions.   They were unable to advance my duties as they we undecided where they needed my skills."
good,Great place to work but very long and non flexible hours. Great Management and moderate organization. Decent Commission.
good,"I start my day answering incoming phone calls, greet and assist walk in customers scheduling appointments, cashiering, providing them with rental cars, filing and assisting my Service and General Manager with any projects that need to be completed."
good,"a typical day at work, I would say is really slow. I learned how to use different programs that we needed to know while working there. my management team was not all that great. my co-workers were really friendly and very out going people. the most enjoyable part of my job was being able to leave at 5 and head home to my kids."
good,Mind opening for someone new to the industry and willing to put for the effort of working in a high stress job but also was fun and always went Into work exited
good,"Lots of changes, processing payroll for the biggest Dealership in the United States.  Processing payroll for 15 dealerships 1,300 employees by myself."
good,At this time I do not wish to disclose any personal written opinions for or against AutoNation Chevrolet West Austin. This is a corporate based dealer.
good,"AutoNation is very corporate and unless you are selling 20+ cars a month, there's not much room to move up. AutoNation Chrysler Jeep West is a little more competitive than most which also comes with a higher earning potential. It's hard to make a good living if you aren't willing to sacrifice the majority of your social life."
good,"Very fast paced  work environment with on the fly changes to manage along the way in warehouse, and on route."
good,"It was an office job and just not something I liked doing. Just my personal opinion. It is a fairly easy job, good pay, good co workers. I enjoyed working dayshift."
good,"A typical day at work consists of 9-11 hours a day. Requires lots of follow up with customers and lots of homework on your product you are selling. I learned phone and people skills everyday. The hardest part of this job is to balance a good job work and life balance. It is a family like culture at AutoNation, this is definitely the best part."
good,"The facility was badly undersized. Inventory was kept at a remote storage lot, making the sales process overly long. The only holidays they closed for were Thanksgiving and Christmas."
good,"Its a good place if the managers, tech and service writer are all on the same page. When equipment in the shop gets broken it takes awhile to get it fix."
good,"I was hired here through a hiring event which Autonation holds pretty frequently due to high turnover.  Let me start with this career is not for everyone.  Its fast paced, extremely stressful, with lack of any kind of formal training.  You have to learn on your feet, learn quickly, and stay extremely organized.  The management changed a few times during my short tenure, but management here has actually gotten better.  I love the atmosphere here mainly due to the camaraderie with my techs, new management, and fellow advisors.  My coworkers make this a pleasent place to work at.  You have to deal with customers and most of the time its challenging.  I believe that my dealership is a great place to be at this time with alot of potential and possibilities.  I feel that my managers are trying to actually make this a better place to work.  A few months in and I was already looking to find employment elsewhere, but now I'm intrigued to see where this goes."
good,"Good job work. Variety of culture workers, staff need to follow company code of ethics in reference to respect others in general but other than that is a good company to work with."
good,"From the time you came in the morning you were non-stop busy. Eighty percent of the time I was unable to take time off for lunch. When you were not dealing with customers, you were coordinating with technicians to ensure vehicle was being properly serviced. You had sales quotas that had to be reached each month on various products. You were constantly needing to have to up sell products to customers."
good,"I liked working there, but I didn't like supervisors. The office manager was a really nice guy to work with, but he had his moments of strictness. what I didn't like about working there, the girls like they talk so much bad stuff about each other but that's everywhere."
good,"AutoNation is a great company in general, but this location has some good management and some management that likes to end up interrupting work. AutoNation has great benefits and can have great pay, but don't work here if you have any home obligations, such as family, school, or any other responsibilities that require time."
good,"Very helpful employess, fast paced job, lots of benefits, flexable hours. Management is great and very helpful. hardest part of the job, was possibly working the 2nd shift which was until midnight"
good,"management is okay, sometimes micro-managing "
good,"You get what you put into it. You work hard and do what you are supposed you will keep your job. typical shop atmosphere, some snakes, more good than bad."
good,"The work schedule is very consistent, and while at AutoNation you can learn a lot. The Management Styles are very different depending upon the department. The Co-Workers are typically friendly but there does seem to be some competition. The hardest part for me was the repetitiveness of the tasks given. It was most enjoyable when the days were busy and tasks varied."
good,"my usual day consist of mainly oil changes and tire rotation. Occasionally, there will be wiper blade changes, light bulb replacements or minor recalls. I learned that the auto industry is a first come, first served with the commisioned sales and commisioned work. The management at Autonation are easy to get along with. my coworkers are easy to get along with which increases the fun of working in this environment, there are few coworkers that are hard to work with, but those are the ones that are hungry for that commision pay. The hardest part of my job is learning new things. the most enjoyable part of my job would also be learning new things."
good,Do your research. Every dealership is different. Expect to work long hours and some days you'll be working for free. Other days you can make lot of money.
good,very relaxed place for young people cool place to work idk what else to ay this thing is asking for 150 words and I just want to find a new job idc about my old job
good,"A typical day at work was answering phone calls, logging in keys, logging in licence plates. Management was okay they built bonds with sales men and then just treated everyone else as if they were trash."
good,"The culture at this dealer is great!  The managers are very easy to work for because they have your back.  However, the hours are long.   The benefits were great as well."
good,Started as a contractor and was internally hired. Very good experience. Worked with the latest security tools and was free to explore and gain useful knowledge.
good,"Just as the title says, I washed cleaned and washed cars. Did not learn much but more information about washing cars. The management was good, helped when we needed help and was tentative/hardworking. Hardest part about the job was washing cars in 100+ degree weather. Workplace culture was not very exciting, just washed cars with several other people as music played in the background. Most enjoyable part was seeing all the cars and the different types of cars people had and driving it to a parking space."
good,Selling cars isn't for most people. It was a starting point for my career after baseball. Was fun and competitive but was not guaranteed salary. Would not recommend any of my friends.
good,"Good place to work, great co workers and ok management."
good,"Great management / great company / good benefits/ good days off  "
good,"Too many hours, not enough pay. Poor Management. Too many meetings. Not a good work environment, lots of negativity.  Training was intense and very long."
good,"AutoNation was a good place to work good environment, really felt like family. But management changed so often never felt like I had a chance. They screwed me after I had a family emergency and I left and never looked back."
good,"Very helpful employess, fast paced job, lots of benefits, flexable hours. Management is great and very helpful. hardest part of the job, was possibly working the 2nd shift which was until midnight"
good,The car business has always been very time consuming. The fact that there is no such thing as an hourly employee so there's no overtime or laws to follow. 7 days a week is where I draw the line. Also the pay wasn't nearly what was expected. The people are good and I believe they'll get it straight over time
good,Very busy work environment My co-workers are an amazing bunch of people.
good,i cant say terrible things but i can certainly not say any great. this job was slow and laid back but not effective or productive. at least not for my position
good,"The location I'm at has a management problem. They lack leadership ability and have poor time management."
good,Focus on shareholder value is the top priority for this company. Longevity of employees is impressive and many tenured employees make up the workforce. Good culture of giving back to community.
good,Working here is very stressful. working 6 days a week mandatory and 12 hour days mandatory. Pay always changes and employees have to sign new pay plans if not they can no longer work for the company.
good,Being an intern I worked with many managers- My last manager was a struggle to work for/with but my hiring manager was amazing!!! It was always a busy day and for a college student they were pretty flexible in scheduling
good,"The location is not representative of the Company. Autonation is a Great company to work for, however the management at Autonation Chevrolet Coral Gables fail to uphold and maintain the company's vision."
good,A great company but your success can really be determined by what store you go to and who the management is at that location. It requires an immense amount of hours to be prepared for that.
good,"they have some good GMs at local stores, but their data driven metrics have in many ways dehumanized some of their job functions which already work ridiculous hours."
good,Do not like the way they manage things around here and how the manipulate people into staying and working for them.
good,"The company isn't a bad company, but choose your locations wisely. I worked for Nissan and it was alright when i first started. But then The company changed their pay and everything went downhill."
good,"Work life balance is horrible, but the pay is sometimes worth it. The program for sales is strict its usually a take it or leave it ultimatum making it risky."
good,"This company is the largest in the us. I have invested a large number of years helping them grow. Pay used to accomodate the hours up until 2005, then pay started dropping drastically."
good,"Management was unreliable. Within a year we had 4 managers in and out."
good,"For an auto Company, it has it's opportunities. With the right management team it can become one of the greatest Auto retailers in the Country."
good,"Responsibilities are to promote automotive sales, train new hires in sales techniques, manage customer database, and assist customers in purchase of cars and trucks. "
good,"Very helpful employess, fast paced job, lots of benefits, flexable hours. Management is great and very helpful. hardest part of the job, was possibly working the 2nd shift which was until midnight"
good,They train and give opportunity for advancement. I have been in the automobile industry for many years. This company does promote from within and that their most redeeming quality.  Autonation takes their process seriously and it shows through their employees.
good,usually was alone in the parts delivery truck and only saw others before and after deliveries. learned how to read invoices and move quickly and intelligently to get things done before they were due. management was very relaxed and there was no room for advancement. The hardest part of work was being alone for up to 10 hours at times. the most enjoyable part was the availability of overtime
good,I was a temp but it would have been nice to be hired permanently. I was hoping that would happen in the future but my position was eliminated when my boss was promoted.
good,Customer Service was a good position while I was a full time student in college and looking for an afternoon/evening job not in food service. They were able to work around y schedule and were accommodating when necessary. Were happy to give me extra hours if I asked.
good,"I have been employed with Autonation for almost two years, and it's been a wonderful working environment. People here work hard, don't take themselves too seriously, and are just a good bunch to be around. Management does their best to be there and personal with their employees, but it's obvious that they are a Corporation first."
good,needs better management and better pay. If your not on the original pay plan which is straight commission your not making much. the building is also old and should be redone because there is a rotten problem.
good,"Although the company gives great benefits, working at my particular dealer has always been a dilemma. I have worked in he same position for 4 years and done an exceptional job. I have had 4 different managers and they have all enjoyed working with me and he results I have given them. I have been unable to advance within the company due to upper management."
good,"In any car dealership, working hours can be long.   Unfortunately at the Hyundai store there was a lot of turn over, so often in the finance department we had to work open to close because we were short staffed."
good,"They are always Micromanaging, so you would have to make sure you are working all the time while on the clock. You would also make sure you don't go over 40 hours."
good,"great people to work with both as co-workers and employees, Chevrolet is a great company with outstanding products and top notch manufacture support both in field and corporate."
good,"A company that draws from the fringes, never the cream of the crop, but usually not the bottom of the barrel. "
good,"A typical day was making sure customers were happy.  "
good,"There is a severe lack of communication between different departments that require teamwork. The biggest frustration lies in the schedule. The work/life balance, is nonexistent. In their defense however, I guess most people realize that before applying for the job."
good,"I enjoy working with my management staff, our sales staff in deep need of help. One thing also need is to have better lenders for some of the sub prime market or inventory to work with the current lenders."
good,"Good sales and opportunity "
good,The company is good with minor problems. The stress the company puts on management has them treat the employees like numbers. The environment is ok and people are mostly good people. Just under stresses that are out of their control. Service advisors have surveys about things that dont work at the store and many other small things.
good,"Very fast paced, stressful work atmosphere. You're on the computer all day making invoices for orders. Prep packages to be sent to customers. Moving orders to delivery zones."
good,"Very helpful employess, fast paced job, lots of benefits, flexable hours. Management is great and very helpful. hardest part of the job, was possibly working the 2nd shift which was until midnight"
good,"There‚Äôs are some great opportunities to keep moving up. "
good,"I think if I had better managers and if they had been willing to explain things a little more then I could‚Äôve really been great at my job. The problem was they wouldn‚Äôt go and explain to a customer why they didn‚Äôt qualify for the vehicle they were trying to purchase. Once they saw there was no deal to be made they didn‚Äôt care anymore and they would just drop the customer like they didn‚Äôt matter. I understand if there‚Äôs no deal then don‚Äôt waste time, move to the next. But, when the customer is specifically asking to speak to a manager so they can better explain the situation and the manager won‚Äôt get off the sales tower for 10minutes.. that‚Äôs a major issue. Bad for business."
good,"Overall, you can make a great living working for any Autonation store, let along, Toyota. The hours can get crazy, you tend to average at least 55 hours a week easily. Some days can be slow, weekends are typically busy."
good,I enjoy working at AutoNation. The people are friendly and there is always work to do. Some things could use improvement like the way management handles certain situations and more growth opportunity for hard working employees.
good,Great income with hard work and long hours. Must stay organized and be self motivated. A great fun career if you enjoy talking to people in general. Good luck.
good,Considered the largest automotive dealership in the world.  AutoNation has 350 + locations across the United States and is always looking try new ventures.
good,management very controlling and difficult Made stay late for staff meetings some times making your day 16 hrs long I had requested time off prior to starting and had to chase manager down day prior to get signed off yo have surgery
good,"Answering high volume calls, assisting customers to different departments. I've learned how to become more receptive and accommodating different situations. Management is good.... The hardest part of the job is the aggravated customers, they tend to be unfriendly. The most enjoyable part of the job is the feeling of knowing you've helped a customer with a dilemma, successfully!"
good,"I am a temporary employee. Just a comfortable place to work at, and friendly people."
good,"Each day I as able to come in and do my work without anyone bothering me.  There were interruptions, but I was still able to get my work done.  Pleasant atmosphere."
good,The managment is horrible the managers are never on the same page or a manager will tell employes how to do their job when its in a different department.They need to fix this so that they can be more productive
good,"Start at 6:30am go non stop until 7:00pm,  Had a great team that all worked towards the same goal.  We had a win win attitude."
good,"fair company. people helpful,   fund raising a lot of the time.  new store just finished in February kept well organized and clean, customer oriented."
good,"It was a great place to work at.  You couldn't ask foe a better office manager. All my co-workers were very helpful and pleasant to work with. It was a very busy office, but I enjoy being busy because it makes the day go faster."
good,Fast paced environment and competitive. You learn so much about the automotive industry. The hardest thing about working for a dealership is balancing work and life/family.
good,Auto Nation is very demanding when it comes to sales for the new and used cars. If you don't sell anything they are nice enough to pay you $8.00 dollars an hour. But you need to sell at least 10 cars a month to make a decent pay check.
good,"Not a bad place just not enough work to go around for painters, everyone is friendly and they work with you on anything u need, work is getting slow and not enough work to make money"
good,Car sales is a great way to make money but be prepared for long hours and fluctuations in pay month to month. Great camaraderie can be achieved and friendly competition is recommended.
good,"Very helpful employess, fast paced job, lots of benefits, flexable hours. Management is great and very helpful. hardest part of the job, was possibly working the 2nd shift which was until midnight"
good,"When I was employed at AutoNation Nissan, AutoNation Buick GMC Henderson as well as at USA Henderson, my impression of AN was that it concers was Only about the metrics/numbers, Not concerned about the human and its family. If AN could have worked you 24/7, they would have. However, AN do have a sales process in place and I did appreciate it and utilized it. Being a United States Army Veteran "
good,"Overall, I‚Äôd have to recommend AutoNation as a place to work. We had a few problems with the management put in place by the company when they bought the dealership, but they were corrected within a couple of months. The pay and bonuses were great. It‚Äôs a fast paced job and you will work overtime."
good,"Management could use help, but overall good place to work for. "
good,"A good place where you can advance within but some obstacles are that the management has favorable advancement for certain people. When someone who has proven themselves to be a good fit to advance, they do not want certain people to get more out of employment."
good,good place to work is fast paced it was a pain most of the time the service manager is constantly changing and they all have different styles in which they manage
good,"If you work hard, you'll get paid great! However, very long hours away from family and management can be supportive only if you're a hard worker and working deals. Just like any dealership, micro-management is high and you're constantly expected to be working. Forget spending time with family during holidays, with the exception of Thanksgiving Day and Christmas Day. Environment is primarily not professional, many times immature/childish, but that's normal in the dealership life. There are opportunities for advancement, but you really have to prove yourself in order to be considered."
good,"It's car sales - Long hours.  Good product and company though. Some of the sales managers were good, others were high pressure and did not follow the company philosophy at times."
good,Over all it's a good place to work.  Management is easily to change minds.  They do try to work with you and help you.  The parts managers are nice.  I do reccomend this place.
good,"Great people, great team. I very much enjoyed working at AutoNation. They have decent benefits.  The company is ever changing and evolving, and very fast paced."
good,"Really enjoyed working at AutoNation great leadership "
good,"As a contractor, I did not have all the opportunities the real employees had.  However, I fit well with my immediate team and was able to grow in that position."
good,"Excelente escuela de ventas, los procesos son muy profesionales"
good,"Good place to work but has management issues to be addressed. Positive work environment but with high turnover. "
good,"Sales & Leasing Consultant (Former Employee), Bellevue, WA ‚Äì November 9, 2018"
good,Great starter company on getting ones foot in the big doors. Positive environment for new workers. Most employees are very helpful. An managements always willing to help when asked.
good,Fast paced and competitive environment that rewards those who work hard and are diligent. Can be somewhat stressful and heavily influenced by economic factors.
good,"Very helpful employess, fast paced job, lots of benefits, flexable hours. Management is great and very helpful. hardest part of the job, was possibly working the 2nd shift which was until midnight"
good,This job was my first real exposure to general sales. It gave me some tools that I can use with almost any other job I come across. People skills will be your number one asset.
good,"This job gives me flexibility with my schedule, but the pay is low I have to put in over 100 hours a pay period to survive. I like the people of the job and its a relaxed placed to work I just need more compensation like PTO, sick leave and at least 15 dollars an hour."
good,"the people were great to work with. everyone got along with each other, always willing to help when needed. the management within the company was not the best but could be dealt with as time progressed."
good,"Work long hours and worked on a lot of warranty stuff. Worked every other Saturday. Cannot comment on current management, since not worked there in three years."
good,"Upper management has not sense of education , look their employees like there slaves , seems they forget where they came from , they not like to hear what is the need of their employee under any circumstances."
good,management was easy to get along with have fun working with other lot porters/technicians hardest part was dealing with traffic everyday going from dealership to dealership alot to learn especially from other orkers
good,"Autonation, in my experience was a good place to work considering the type of job I had. Being a service advisor is a difficult and demanding position and they did their best to take care of us. The pay was consistent with that of the industry as a whole. I would recommend this company to anyone looking to build experience in the automotive industry."
good,"great job, hard to balance with children as the hours are long and you get out what you put in.  there are no spiffs anymore which was a huge bummer so its only commission and now hourly. i loved the people and would definitely recommend"
good,"AutoNation is a big corporation, probably the biggest in the business in United States. They offer some benefits and the pay plan is not as aggressive as others in the industry"
good,"Great Company to learn"
good,The manager at the time was good to work for. The hours weren't that great. Working nine hours on Saturday with no lunch break didn't fair well with me.
good,"great place to work but long hours. Good benefits plan and room for growth opportunity, however, in the car business. The hours are always long. Not ideal for someone with family."
good,"Business car washing locations, very steady and tedious work, always around great people but no opportunity for advancement. Upper management, does not listen to its employers."
good,"Cool place to work, learned a lot about selling cars and met some really nice people. Helped me understand the car business and talking to people. Getting to know people."
good,Ford of Dublin was a very busy car dealership.  Service department was great and had many employees.  The customers were always treated great as well as employees
good,How to take each customers wants and needs with their current financial status and direct them to the vehicle that will meet all concerns for the duration of ownership.
good,Though I enjoyed the work I did at AutoNation the pay was low and the GM was not understanding. Dealerships are a dog eat dog world and unless you are a big dog you will get eaten.
good,My most enjoyable part of these jobs was helping customers. Sold through a needs analysis approach. Great interaction with all departments of every dealership.
good,"Arrived for work at 7am, most other technicians were in by 8am. Working on multiple types of Toyota's per day. Learned a lot about Toyotas and dealership environment but workplace was very stressful; pressure to complete jobs at a very fast pace for lower than average pay (12$/hr). Stayed late most days (~5pm)."
good,"Very helpful employess, fast paced job, lots of benefits, flexable hours. Management is great and very helpful. hardest part of the job, was possibly working the 2nd shift which was until midnight"
good,I thoroughly enjoyed my time at this company. Very friendly and helpful staff and management. The pay is competitive for retail work. The pay is rated off the experience that you have.
good,"New pay plan isn't great for big money earners but may be good for those who want stability. Work life balance isn't great, I wouldn't recommend for a college student or someone who has young kids."
good,Good benefits. great training. great people. mre corporate so if you like the family owned dealership scene it's probably not for you. Advertising means alot of customers
good,"Loved working for AutoNation , a typical day would begin with a positive quote for the day, everyone employed there was great to work with, I resigned due to the company consolidating payroll to one location,"
good,"Provide quality prospects and send vehicle specs and quotation through email and/or personal. Offer testdrive and request for an appointment to possible clients and close the sales. Submit daily sales plans and report status of pending accounts. Train and assist sales consultant on basic salesmanship and preparations of quotations for submission."
good,Very relaxed workplace just very long hours and unpredicted time off if a customer/sales associate needs a vehicle from a different location. Very fast paced because time is literally someone else's paycheck and they rely on you to help as soon as possible. However lots of overtime was given up to 70hr a week
good,Tough hours and very competitive. If you can sell you will love this place. If you can't good luck. Hours are truly a burden on your family life. I would recommend people with limited sales experience to start with Autonation.
good,Working in the Ford Accounting office that I am currently in is very nice and comfortable. Everybody works as a team and I must admit I work with a very nice group of people. This also includes the Salesman and the F & I team.
good,Work environment was open and stable with a professional environment and great customer care focus. Work primarily consisted of acquiring contact with customers looking to purchase via online inquiries.
good,After working for six months in sales I applied for the business development position. I had prior experience in marketing and systems which added value to the decision. Auto-nation BDM training was two days total then I was trained by the used car manager.
good,Auto-Nation had excellent training. Chrysler as well. They did not value marketing education or management potential. It was all about sales of the day and the reps with more days on the job get all the best customers.
good,Good place for the hardworking individual.  A bit cutthroat at times but if you stay sharp and stay motivated the hard work and pace pays you back heavily.
good,Overall a decent dealership. the amount of traffic is decent. Only real negatives is long hours but that is all part of the job. Overall good company to work for.
good,Growing business model with lots of exciting changes in its future. Nice parking and office space. Limited lunch options. Most people pack something from home for lunch.
good,Enjoyed working with customers and coworkers. I had so many responsibilities that the day went by very fast. It was a nice environment to work in.
good,Great place but not much advanemnt opertunities. Service manager is awesome but do have some issues. I am hoping that things get better.
good,"nice place to work would recc. to anyone friendly people good working environment,plenty of room for advancement within flexible schedule good hours"
good,"Staff and people are amazing, management plays favorites too much and will not allow someone to advance if they are not who they like."
good,great place to work with great benefits. they have hands on training with fork lifts. You are taught the proper way to load and unload trucks.
good,"Great hours, national company, work atmosphere is good, awesome benefits package, knowledgeable staff, co-workers have great team skills, clean and safe facility"
good,"Very helpful employess, fast paced job, lots of benefits, flexable hours. Management is great and very helpful. hardest part of the job, was possibly working the 2nd shift which was until midnight"
good,"Very busy every day.  Every activity is driven to produce a great Customer Satisfaction level. Required extensive communication between customer, advisor and technician."
good,"Check my Planner, Meet with staff in the morning discuss priorities, check progress and always be prepared. Priorities the day to day work and always being a team player There no hard part of the job. Totally enjoy help customers and clients"
good,"i enjoyed this place of work , some cultural problems, employees come and go so offen..but over all company offers good benefits."
good,"My typical day involved contacting clients to set appointments, as well as, assist walk-in floor traffic. The environment was great and I enjoyed working with everyone."
good,"This was a good company to work for. I was a contractor doing buybacks for manufacturers."
good,in call center schedule appointments and file i have also  check out customers
good,Nice place to work!! Management is nice and helpful. Excellent location and great product for 2015.
good,they were awesome as well. my co workers and managers were great and taught me a lot. I am so thankful that they went above and beyond to help me transfer to another dealer out of town so I could move.
good,I love the place over all but some departments refused to word with school schedules.
good,Good compensation but very long hours. The management was very rude and sometimes use abusive language.
good,"This is a great place to work, however very hard to move up. Almost everyone is a team player and there are a lot of people from different backgrounds that can give you great advise in their area of expertise."
good,"A typical work day involves calling, greeting and listening to potential customers and their needs and wants for purchasing or leasing new or pre-owned vehicles. Using a daily planner to follow-up with store visits, inbound calls and service customers. I stayed busy even on slow days managing and assisting other not as proficient with CRM, Outlook, Word, and follow-up skills. Very long hours, 6 days per week including every Saturday, and every other Sunday. Scheduled hours were either 9-9, 9-6, or 12-9... Good co-workers, management was probably the least qualified, and voted in to lead based on popularity, but not skills, and production. Above average training for the industry, but according to most, pay was below the average for the industry... The hardest part was the advancement process, and the hours for the pay. The best part was the customer base."
good,"A lot of work to do, Contractors cubes are too  small, everything else is fine. as far as I know the permanent positions do not pay that much but year end bonus could be really good"
good,This is a fast paced high pressure job.  If you want a 9 to 5 not for you but if you want an opportunity to work with great people and make a good living it's great I like it a lot
good,"AutoNation is a great training ground for getting into the car business without the a lot of the typical old school auto industry BS.  Keep in mind the corporate message doesn't always translate into the store level depending on the management team, but over all, my experience was a positive one.  Take the training serious and use it in your career where ever you end up in sales."
good,"I worked with a good crew here, I didn't have any issues with anyone except General Manager who wasn't realistic in some situations. The job is what it is ""Car Sales"" To make a living you have to be there 7 days a week."
good,Enjoyed my time there and hope the best for all those I was blessed to meet.  The company payed for Certifications or school as long as you get a good passing grade and is related to your position.
good,We were kept on to finish the jobs already in progress when the purchased the company. The most enjoyable part of the job was when the customer picked up their repaired vehicle and was satisfied with the work.
good,"Focus on selling and making money . Negotiating is a must , communication skills as well , and knowing how to build a relationship between you and customer ."
good,Upper management killed it for a lot of people they were to hard on the new people instead of helping them. So they did not really last that long there. Other than that everything else was great.
good,"Very helpful employess, fast paced job, lots of benefits, flexable hours. Management is great and very helpful. hardest part of the job, was possibly working the 2nd shift which was until midnight"
good,"The job is stable and decent as long as you put in the work. No real opportunity for advancement, I‚Äôd say you‚Äôre just a pawn in a chess game. All ‚Äútraining‚Äù is computer based and has no benefits to it. No opportunities for raise or promotions."
good,"I have been with AutoNation for 1 year. AutoNation holds their auctions every Thursday at 2:00 pm. This is great place to work, very close to home and the people are very easy going. I would refer a friend if there were some openings."
good,It was like a family there if you can get past the heat and the cold in the colder months.  But overall people had your back there as long as you did your job and came to work every day.
good,"Unfortunately, the car business is slowing down. Even the high executives have foreseen a 10% drop in the market. With traffic slowing down and the large amount of employees needing to provide for their families. Money and business traffic is hard to come by. My needs now have grown. Single parent operating on commission alone for the last 7years needs of stability have increased."
good,"good place to work, company seems to care about its employees. departments don't seem to work cohesively. company needs to listen to its employees to solve simple problems"
good,"Currently I'm a collision tech at the Clearwater Fl store. The director that hired me was awesome.. His work dynamic kept me rocking, parts dept functions with minimal hassles, I- Car Training is available. I'm there quite a bit.. and turn average hours due to the work coming in.. I would like to see more volume overall. The issues that annoy me is the equipment. Yes we have state of the art measuring with one Car O Liner Vision. One older Chief Velocity. We have four spot welders and only one of them works! Additionally all of the frame machines 5 Car O Liners and One Huge Brewco three tower, every stinking one em leaks Hydraulic oil every where.. Is it so much to replace rams and pumps every five years? We do have a Pro Spot smart MIG that works rather nicely. It would be nice if the equipment upkeep was a priority, current technology equipment like a dent pulling system for steel and aluminum would be nice.. and get rid of the junk that no longer works! That annoys me but it's manageable. The only real pain is the pay days.. It's twice a month the tenth and twenty fifth.. When I started I began on the beginning of a pay cycle 1st through the15th then paid on the 25th. Then 15th through the end of month and ya get paid for this on the 10th of the following month.. So I worked Twenty five days before seeing my first direct deposit..Ah man that sucked.. and you Will be here five months before you see benefits.. If I had been made aware of this two things I would have thought twice before accepting the job."
good,"typical big company, too many procedures get in the way of conducting business. Many managers telling everyone to do something different. Change from within is necessary."
good,"Management was biased towards ""favorite"" employees."
good,The company was a great company to work for at first. But then management gets in the way of your opportunities and you don‚Äôt get as many leads because you‚Äôre stuck outside waiting for walk-ins that never happen.
good,You can click on for 10 hours and leave with only 2 hours due to not being hourly.  Service adviser has to sell something for you to get kr fractions of an hour to add up and mak an hour
good,"Analytically challenging"
good,"Very helpful employess, fast paced job, lots of benefits, flexable hours. Management is great and very helpful. hardest part of the job, was possibly working the 2nd shift which was until midnight"
good,Keep up with expectations and get paid. Great people and a good philosophy  once you buy in to it. Advancement from within is excellent especially in management.
good,"typical day at work was arriving an hr before the store opened, attend a meeting and begin the work day on the computers following up on leads and bring in potential customers. i learned how to manage time, i learned the back ends of working at a dealership. management was awesome, really understanding when it came down to family time (working at a dealership can take away alot of that) overall a great experience and my co-workers made the day go by quicker."
good,Although the hours were long. Autonation gave me the opportunity to become a better salesman. The pay was definitely great. Talking to the managers were never difficult even the GM himself
good,"I spent 15 wonderful years with AutoNation. I was surprised when i didn't get an exit interview, It's as if didn't didn't care about me. My only advise be careful after a management change"
good,"My personal experience is being good, never had issues, is a nice place to work, nice people. "
good,"I liked the work however, I never felt the consistent support from my management. I was a hostile work environment that entailed my boss causing problems between other co-workers and myself, her throwing thing, slamming her door and cussing. I worked very hard for this company and I was never made to feel important or like I mattered."
good,"I dont know, if its just my location but managers werent as helpful. They would force us to sell cars without helping their own employees. GM was great! Also, they pay isnt good..."
good,The co workers are great to work with but management doesn‚Äôt really inspire to do more just beats you everyday with do better and never get a good job
good,"Went in on the word of a friend, and during the first couple of weeks with the company the money was there, then it feel off fast and it was hard to stay a float."
good,"As dealers go AutoNation is a good employer."
good,"prepare invoices for morning run,  check  parts, return for second run and  turn in all paperwork and returns, clock out."
good,Subaru is a reliable product and this dealership allows customers to meet their objectives. Good team of managers and sales people. Difficult to achieve work / life balance.
good,"Working at AutoNation was definitely pivotal in my professional growth.    "
good,If your are looking for a great Dealership to work as a technician then Ford auto nation is where it's at. The morning schedule isn't too bad and time fly when you're busy working in these cars...
good,"A typical day would include checking customers in/out. Processing"
good,The service area is not a job for me. it was fine I just didn't like the hours. 11 hours for 5 days a week. not the best if you have any kids to take care of at home
good,if it wasn't for this place i wouldn't be where i am today. This place and the people that work there are some of the best people i have ever met and i am glad to have worked there.
good,"Here I would come in everyday to sort out the daily stock order for my store plus three other stores, our campaign parts and daily orders. Would then verify all parts shipped or missing from daily shipment information, print, pull and sort out daily ordered parts then put all stock pieces away. Everyday there would be over 800 delivery invoices to pull for local repair and body shops. Would weekly go through and inspect all core parts to be shipped back, returns from deliveries, and damaged parts to send back. Every afternoon would receive ten to twenty UPS and/or FedEx items then post them in and take care of handling also would pack and prepare items to be sent out via each services. Had to go through and verify item counts per bin for inventory control, would adjust and shortages/overages, change items locations as needed or add additional spacing. As needed I would also sell auto parts needed via the front retail counter, parts technician counter or phone orders."
good,good place for the hard working individual.  Cutthroat at times but if you stay sharp and motivated you create your own paycheck.
good,"Very helpful employess, fast paced job, lots of benefits, flexable hours. Management is great and very helpful. hardest part of the job, was possibly working the 2nd shift which was until midnight"
good,"Competitive sales position. Very cut throat like any sales job at a dealership. Positive workplace, management actually wants you to succeed."
good,Working for AutoNation was an great experience. Just in the last 3 months a lot has changed due to new inexperience managers coming to run the store. Now I know its time for me to take my talents and experience to a new direction of sales.
good,"I loved working for Ewing.  If you wanted to help someone, it was OK. The Christmas bonuses were a great perk.  Raises were fair."
good,"a typical work day is busy from start to finish, definitely challenging but also rewarding. pay is decent but really no room to advance anywhere unless you sell cars"
good,"I felt very good selling the automobiles brand. I loved to sit down with my customers and truly understanding what they needed as their next vehicle. At the end of the day I felt as I helped the customer make a good decision."
good,I nice place to work for. They really care about training the employees. Its hard to have a family while working since the hours are so long
good,Really nice to work super cool co workers there and really fun and light environment. Really enjoy  working with kids and being there with them. Also had a great time driving and just interacting with different kinds of people. Such a wonderful time there
good,"Get a car and detail interior and exterior. Find a shade when detailing black cars, they are attracted to heat. All the co-workers are friendly."
good,"Originally I am an automotive technician by trade. That will always be my passion. Autonation was an alright place to to work. The only bad part about this line of work is that you don't get paid unless you are working on cars. I worked in the lube department I changed oil,tires , front end alignments, tuneups. The only reason I left this job is the fact that it was never a steady paycheck if business was slow my paycheck was smaller. I have a family to support. And there wasn't much room for advancement due to all the veteran technicians that were already there."
good,overall good company poor benefits to much corporate managment no advancment
good,Although everyone is very nice there doesn't seem to be the atmosphere of unity and teamwork that I thrive in the most.  This makes the job more difficult than it has to be.
good,I think this was by far the greatest job I ever had it was a different outcome every day.I was able to meet some great people at work as well as vendors
good,Beautiful environment with mostly outstanding individuals who are genuinely happy to see you every day.
good,this company has a flexible schedule my co workers are good people and fun to work with.
good,Low stress job but not a very good environment where co-workers are not willing to help each other out very much.
good,I have been at AutoNation for 8 years at the same time getting my Masters. I was unable to move up in this company due to the lack of opportunities. Althought AutoNation is growing and has been evolving as the economy changes.
good,"A n just took over this company 3 months ago....75% Of the staff that was there when the buyout occured quit withinin 60 days... Incomes have dropped greatly....Moral is way down,,,and being a positive person,, I feel that this negative invironment is not for me......"
good,"The most important function of a auto sales consultant, outside of selling to the customer is, building a large customer base in an effort to provide continual products and services after the sale is made. What I learned is that price negotiation is a skilled trade that one should practice at all times. Developing a ""Win-Win"" strategy for oneself (as the sales consultant) and the buyer is the wisdom of getting a ""Good"" sell and a happy buyer. Management in this field of work at times is more concerned about the sell than the worker. However, when managing sales staff, it is important to remember the old adage, ""Oil the engine and it will go far"". Keeping up with competition on the job between other sales personnel is one thing, but looking out for your counterparts is another. Building good work relations is sometimes better than competing with co-workers. For, the time will come when working as a team will bring in greater sales. The hardest part is losing a sale. However, you learn more in what you lose than what you win. Losing is 20/20 for the next WIN! Of course, the most enjoyable part of the job was winning together as a sales force."
good,"Busy workplace and can be a good start in your career. It will be able to test your analytical skills, patience and flexibility. The workplace is indeed stressful but the people are very team-oriented."
good,"Whether you have a good or bad experience is entirely up to you. you could sit around all day, be. bored and make no money or you could hustle. Management was nice and the environment was friendly"
good,"Very helpful employess, fast paced job, lots of benefits, flexable hours. Management is great and very helpful. hardest part of the job, was possibly working the 2nd shift which was until midnight"
good,Very fast placed with very demanding customers but coworkers makes go day faster. There are a lot of challenges between dealing with different departments and at the same time get customers expectations.
good,Regularly it was difficult to get management to answer customer complaints. Additional duties that receptionists do not do were added do to other employees complaining about the different level of work. A bit catty.However management wants to see you grow. Helps you build communication skills and team development.
good,Great Team from the bottom to the staff. However once you reach management level employees its a roller coaster ride. Work 24/7 live at the dealer always on FT calls at home while your sleeping. Money and Pay were always off and never justified.
good,"I really enjoy working there. I had an opportunity to grow within the company. Although, I was shocked to have been laid off, I do understand the business aspect of things."
good,"Excellent culture at my dealership, training and tools provided to maximize sales.  Management respects salespeople and customers appreciate purchase transparency.  Good place to begin your Auto Sales Career."
good,Poor payplan for finance managers with too many desicion makers. Company not completely focus in the number one reason it one for. Automotive sales and profit.
good,"In the short time I was there, I worked at two different dealerships. I was initially assigned to AutoNation Volvo in Irvine, which was a small dealership (selling 50 cars per month). It had nine sales reps and two sales managers. Since I was brand new to the business, it was a good starting place. I received a good deal of mentoring from the reps with experience."
good,"I learned structure and that customer service comes first. I learn how to negotiate. the culture is great, and family . Treat your customers really good and they will send you referrals."
good,This company is good to work with and nice environment. Some days were better than others but all and all it was a nice play to be employed at. They are a great place I‚Äôm sure to move up in as well.
good,"It seems the answer to every problem is replace the manager. The good managers don't stay because they aren't empowered to make ANY decisions without first consulting multiple people at corporate. They don't have the ability to even do the simple day to day stuff, like change a light bulb or have equipment repaired."
good,There were some moments where you feel the stress and pressure with management but the job itself wasn't that bad. Despite that I enjoyed working there.
good,Meet and greet customers before taking into office and getting all descriptions of choice for vehicle; After doing so I would present numbers and organize deal for GSM before reviewing everything is in order and presenting customers to finance. After completing purchase I would present their new vehicle in timely manner and make sure everything about the vehicle (service/interior/exterior/etc) was in tact. Final gesture was sending the customer(s) with a smile on their face home.
good,"I loved helping people and clients it's just the management is not good at all. keep changing managers and a bit of racism, we as Latinas did not get paid fairly but after I left an American/white lady got paid extremely more than we did."
good,"There‚Äôs been a management change and with it comes growing pains. The pay for this position isn‚Äôt good for the amount of work that needs to be done, but‚Äôs it‚Äôs a great position for those in school or those wanting extra income."
good,I liked auto nation I learned a lot and had a great time working there. I liked the general manager I had very motivational. I just didn't feel car sales was for me in the end.
good,My worst experience was business was slow and on flat rate I didn't make as many hours as I made at other dealerships. AutoNation was a good company to work for but the particular dealership I worked at was slow.
good,is a good place to work great schedule great culture. great for an entry lever tech. management is ok for the most part but sometimes you really need to stand up for yourself.
good,I liked working with the team. My co-workers were fun and nice. The job taught me how to audit and I learned customer service skills. I was would to get one-hour lunch breaks.
good,"I worked with the Sales and sometimes Service departments. For my role, I had little to do, which was one of the reasons I quit. This is a job where there are a lot of hours sitting or standing around, waiting for people to walk in or for appointments to show up. Lots of talking with colleagues, a fair amount of time spent sitting at a desk and calling potential customers, and relatively minimal time spent working on selling the actual car. Management had a very high turnover rate while I was there (and after, from what I heard from others). The car business in general tends to have a very high turnover rate because the job can be incredibly frustrating at times. Workplace culture is very male-centric, so those who work well in that type of environment would do well in this setting. The hardest part of the job, for me, was the sitting around doing nothing. This drove me crazy and I would look for anything to do (cleaning whiteboards, taking on additional roles for other departments, walking the parking lot). The most enjoyable parts of the job were probably knowing that people needed my assistance with tasks and getting to drive brand new cars around. Overall, despite the many negatives this job had, I have fond memories of working at Autonation."
good,"Very helpful employess, fast paced job, lots of benefits, flexable hours. Management is great and very helpful. hardest part of the job, was possibly working the 2nd shift which was until midnight"
good,"I started here as a Technician and they gave me a great opportunity I learned a lot from the technicians at this shop. The management varied sometime too harsh on technician when they made mistakes, and not understanding, but other techs tend to look out for you."
good,"The company is run by people situated in another state, it is challenging to make changes on company policy in order to react to the changing market conditions locally"
good,"Autonation is what you make it. If you put in the time and effort, you are guaranteed to make some good money. Management staff is amazing and the employees make for a comfortable work environment. Benefits and 401k are great. Hardest part of job is the actual sales itself. Best part is great employees."
good,The facility was nice and laid out well for productivity. Has lunch break room with heat and A/C. Liked the management and office personnel. Everyone there worked well together.
good,"Long hours beyond normal. High responsibility"
good,"Great communication between managers and sellers, respectful, kindness. "
good,"I always liked the environment of the quick lanes for automation, very relaxed, but everyone still did what they needed to do. I would recommend AutoNation to people starting out in automotive."
good,"Good people, good training provided.  This location has zero traffic so unless  you are in Ecomm don't expect to sell more than 10 cars a  month.  But overall a good company to work for."
good,"Lots of work, fast paced, working back counter with 42 techs and 22 service advisors. doing inventory, checking in parts, heavy phones "
good,"a really nice expierence working with different people, very productive enviroment,very exciting atmosphere with great training,the excitment of going to work."
good,"New facility with state of the art equipment, very nice environment."
good,"Very helpful employess, fast paced job, lots of benefits, flexable hours. Management is great and very helpful. hardest part of the job, was possibly working the 2nd shift which was until midnight"
good,A typical day at work is registering contracts at a fast pace. I learned to increase my speed and accuracy to be finish on time. The workplace culture is okay.
good,The opportunity based on the process and ability to produce helps give the chance to have success.  That is typical in the auto industry when working on a commission bases.
good,I loved working with the customer and problem solving.  I enjoyed how I had freedom about the dealership and my relationships with all of the managers.
good,"AN - Toyota Mall of Georgia."
good,Itd what you make it to be as far as work place goes. You can have a really good time working there or you could have the worst time of your life it just depends on you
good,Working at autonation i realized I‚Äôm more of a number then anything else. I work longer days then i expected when IÔ∏è first got hired. Most days IÔ∏è won‚Äôt get out of work on time IÔ∏è leave some times two hours after I‚Äôm supposed to. I haven‚Äôt been here a year and I‚Äôve seen four different managers.
good,"Arrive 1st and greet all employees, each day when dealing with the public you learn something new. Management style, lead by example. Great culture with my team. Having to dismiss some one."
good,"Although the days starts early and ends late, there is no shortage of laughter throughout the day at my present employer. Due to constantly interfacing with customers both face to face as well as over the phone, the characters and personalities run wide and deep. The management knows the employees by name and recognizes that quite often, we deal with difficult situations, and will try to offset that by throwing contest and challenges to keep the energy levels high and the moods lifted. This is a great place to work but can put a strain on family life as we are often at work from 6am to 7:30pm and have little family work life balance."
good,Long days and Saturday. But you do get free lunch on Saturday. Management was good and bad. Workplace culture is good and fast pace for work. Job security was good but low pay hard to get raise from them.
good,"Great people, fun atmosphere, but little advancement or pay increase. Very corporate, little flexibility for salespeople. Accounting fun but repetitive and reception easy to the point of boredom."
good,"If you like a sales job, it's a good place to work for. I am not into sales anymore so it is not for me..............................................."
good,It is a decent starter job. They have favorites so in order to move up you have to be one. If not you will be there for a year making the same as beginners. As long as you show up and dont call out you easily stick out. Hours are short but its busy so makes them go by fast.
good,"The call center had a fun work environment, but the rules would change all the time so it was very unstable when it came to that. Sometimes seemed like the newer manager tried to be your friend more than your boss."
good,The company has taught me many new skills. I have been introduced to a new industry. Auto Nation has many brands & great prices on vehicles for sale. The no haggle & fair pricing is a great deal for prospective customer's.
good,Toyota was a challenge because of not nowing the product as well as Chrysler and dodge jeep. the company sole to family Toyota in the short time I was with them and then transferred to ennis tx autonation
good,"Very good place to work just not enough time to spend with family management team wants you to make as much money as possible which is a plus, co workers is fun to be around hardest part of job is working 70 hours a week & doing it all over again also you must meet requirement of 10 sales a month or get written up. most enjoyable part is making the money off your sale."
good,Like any work environment there are ups and downs to your work day.  There isn't a lot of advancement potential within the dealership.  But if you work hard and stick it out you just might be moved up into a management position.
good,"Schedule in rotating, hours and days, learned to be patient and never give up, the managers are great and helpful, co-workers are nice, the hard part of the job was the distance 40miles away, meeting new people."
good,"Very helpful employess, fast paced job, lots of benefits, flexable hours. Management is great and very helpful. hardest part of the job, was possibly working the 2nd shift which was until midnight"
good,"Autonation is a great place to work and learn a new career in the Automotive field."
good,"no life, you spend all day everyday in the dealership you have to sell at least 20 cars a month to make some decent money the end of the month you work from 9 to 9 the last 2 day"
good,This is a fun and exciting fast paced job with so much room for growth and so many new things to learn. In such a short time with the company I have worked at four different dealers and multiple brands. I love learning about all the new technologies in the vehicles. Its easy to be enthusiastic about the cars with customers and positive about all the new and exciting features. I have learned everything from cleaning and maintaining the cars on the lot to some finance process to sales and product services. The best thing about the job is meeting all the new customers and striving to provide the best possible experience.
good,"Working at Autonation is very simple and productive. Things can be very repetitive but you arent tied down, you have room for excitment. My co workers are very much relaxed with a few who are always on edge. There is nothing hard at the job, its what you make of it."
good,"It was a over great place to work, I had to make a lot of adjustments when the new GM came in and he wasn't a good fit and a lot of people left because of him."
good,"First time working in an auto dealership.  Very fast paced.  Daily duties remain the same, although each day is not routine.  Meeting new people and networking daily.  Great co-workers.  Management is very helpful and supportive.  "
good,"This is a great company to work for . However the hours are long but that should be expected for a retail business any way. The location and client base are marginal for car and truck sales, but with proper advertisement it can grow to be one of the largest dealerships in the area."
good,great place to work great enviroment. no advancement however to promote as a manager
good,There was always something to do. Greeting clients and providing excellent customer service was my main priority.
good,Prepared vehicles for retail sales.  The hardest part of the job is preparing the large trucks.
good,Fast growing company. Lots of potential. new concept. Great benefits.
good,"Hard to find a balance between your job and life"
good,"Depending on the store you get in, they will teach you the car business."
good,Good place to work.  This os dumb bo one want to fill this out it just waste our time we could be looking for a job instead of filling out this servey
good,"I love my team there/ the managers has their moments/ great GM. "
good,"After working for Autonation I discovered that it required more time of me than I was willing to give. You're scheduled an average of 45 hours a week with no Saturdays off. If I requested a day off it was usually granted."
good,"Managment when I was there was great. Fun, relaxed but quick paced when it got busy. Was in charge of checking in cars off of transports and putting cars back into place when moved."
good,They did a good job with on the job training initially. Areas that they could use to improve would be ongoing training rather than just the initial training. I enjoyed working there and sometimes wish I would not have left.
good,"Very helpful employess, fast paced job, lots of benefits, flexable hours. Management is great and very helpful. hardest part of the job, was possibly working the 2nd shift which was until midnight"
good,"Really kind staff in a family like atmosphere. Store is a bit slow, but profit is there to be made. Managers are pretty cool, although after I left, a few others (including managers) did as well. Not sure of current staff."
good,"This place really was a fun work environment and the compensation potential was definitely there, however work/life balance was not very good. Saturdays you were guaranteed to work from 8:45am-9pm and that was if you actually got off on time. Management was awesome."
good,"Great place to work, good pay , decent benefits, good environment, clean work areas, lots of work to keep everyone busy for the most part, it is not seasonal."
good,"Acted as a role model in techniques for driving sales, consistently meeting and exceeding goals."
good,"This is a job that if you want a 9-5 job and make money, nah it definitely won‚Äôt work , if you are hungry for money you just follow the process they teach you and you will be successful and make really good money (100k+/year) but you would never have time to enjoy it, so that‚Äôs up to you."
good,"The more calls you make, the more chances of closing a sale. Lots of phone calls, both incoming and outgoing. Lots of E-mails both incoming and outgoing. Uncapped commission is a big plus."
good,"corporate is out of tune with what occurs in the dealership, some who have never worked in the business tell what to do at the store level, is always a recipe for disaster, store level was perfect though"
good,"I had an awesome time working at AutoNation Ford Jacksonville.  I was new to the auto industry and I started with AutoNation.  I loved my coworkers and managers.  However, the sales goals set by corporate were unrealistic given the amount of traffic we had vs. the amount of salesmen."
good,"since I have been here the turnover for managers and directors is crazy ,  with unrealistic goal employees turnover also is affected.  "
good,"Super fun and face paced place to work for! I‚Äôm enjoyed my coworkers, we all had to work together to make it a good working environment.  The management was equally good to work with."
good,"Very helpful employess, fast paced job, lots of benefits, flexable hours. Management is great and very helpful. hardest part of the job, was possibly working the 2nd shift which was until midnight"
good,Working at AutoNation is fun. Very competitive and stressful at times but overall a good place to work at because there is a lot to learn. The environment is very fast pace and pushes you to work hard.
good,"Working at an Autonation was good fun. I was new to working in the car industry and it was eye opening. Being a cashier allowed me to be able to interact with many of the customers as well as get to know the service writers, sales reps, the parts guys, and the technicians as well. There was not a day that went by that there wasn't something that needed to be done, and that was good. Overall, it was a fun job to work at."
good,"This was a great place to work at the beginning and actually almost all the way till the end. I wish I would have been able to bite my tongue and stay but, everything happens for a reason!"
good,"Excellent company, Very professional staff at headquarters, Wonderful and amazing training. Very good salary and benefits. The people who gave the training are highly trained and are extraordinarily good at what they do."
good,"I was there many years ago, not sure how relevant my insights to the comany are at this point.  The pay scale was low (at that time).  The HR department ruled the day (at that time). I had good regional fixed ops manager."
good,"No one is ever happy about their cars breaking down. We received about 3-5 tow-ins a day, followed by demanding owners. I completely understand the frustration behind each situation which did help level out my stress."
good,Sales experience on one on one interactions. Daily meeting and client follow ups. Daily contact and participation in company's goals and mission. I learned to recognize different cultures and realize the differences and cultural expectations. Management is engaged on a daily basis and result oriented. Workplace culture in based on sales and service goals. The hardest part or the job is working long hours to achieve the results required and self expectations. The most enjoyable part is working in a diverse workplace and learning to work together and respect different cultures and beliefs.
good,"Your typical day at the job is very tiring, dealing with customers everyday, heat cases."
good,"My first corporate position, and highly recommended. CEO makes sure employees are involved, energetic and having a good time. Fellow employees are always helpful at all cost."
good,"I thought the Management and Training was very good. Learned about several phases of the business. For the number of new salespeople that dealership had, sales managers were eager to assist. Some of the sales approach was a little Rigid but this may be due to the number of salespeople without car sales knowledge."
good,"Like any automotive position, detail is the key. Requirements include customer interview,prepare and review all necessary documents. Sell F and I products. Submission to maximize profits. Package deal with all necessary stipulations for fast funding. Maintaining exceptional CSI."
good,My experience at AutoNation was very positive.  I was able to promote through various levels of management which positioned me to be successful both professionally and personally.
good,"its a fun work place.It was very helpful to me because it increase my knowledge in sales,was able to know lots of people who i build rapport with. and honed my skills."
good,"Very helpful employess, fast paced job, lots of benefits, flexable hours. Management is great and very helpful. hardest part of the job, was possibly working the 2nd shift which was until midnight"
good,"Even when the position consists do make 200+ calls everyday, still no have a designated desk and sometimes is necessary get jumping between chairs from the absent vendors around the showroom. There are not a clear policy about the phone calling shifts, like how many time could be necessary to wait between first, second and the last calling intent with the clients, being this changed two or three times in a month! But if you can deal with the time handicap, there is more incentives when the polls results shows the clients are happy with the services and the software system can help you to keep all the calls done in a reasonable lapse."
good,"Auto-nation Chevy Mesa, now Auto-nation Chevy Gilbert, is your typical car sales dealership. You attempt to sell cars, there isn't much more too it. The managers were great and I got along with my coworkers."
good,"Big company that‚Äôs main concern is the shareholders, not each dealership or employees. Worked with some great managers over the years who moved on, seemed to be revolving door with upper management. Great benefits, discounts, people, but had to work too many hours, sometimes no days off for weeks. Sold lots of cars."
good,"Low Compensation"
good,"its not a bad place to work lots of different opportunities, large shop with many different type of work provided, parts onsite, good bunch of people to work with."
good,"You get out what you put in.Treat this as your own business and you will succeed. Time management and diligence, a must. They provide excellent training and have all the tools to be successful."
good,"Great place to work if you are looking to move up the ladder.  It is hard to manage your family life with the hours you will work. If you want to relocate, they have many dealers across the country."
good,Meeting and greeting customers and helping them the right car for them.  Gaining knowledge of automobiles. management was great was always there to help.
good,They are good people to work for. They just give a little more help to the new hire to get them started in the business. The management team are awesome from the CEO down to the Salesman
good,"From the very beginning you are expected to be on a relentless pursuit of selling. If you aren't proficient in selling, you are let go. As a whole, not recommended if you can't work under pressure."
good,Some of the managers were not the best. Employees were the goto people in most scenarios. I did like a couple of the management team. While I was there I enjoyed it.
good,"I would structure my work day based on priority items, taking care of customers as a priority. The work would be completed as necessary and in a timely manner. Oversight of assistants and training as needed was also important to allow employees to complete tasks. Interacting with Finance Department to make sure all essential paperwork and training was provided to enhance the target of smoothly providing customer case."
good,Great people to work with! Also a great way to gain knowledge in sales! The management team is always willing to help as well as assist you in moving up the ladder. The corporation does a lot for their employees by offering great benefits as well as fun activities occasionally .
good,not much freedom to decide anything corporate controls all aspects of the dealership. System works in theory only but does not allow for adaptability in other markets than the pilot market.
good,The most enjoyable part of the job was learning a trade that I never really had any experience in. I also really enjoyed making new connections with the company who can help me further down if needed.
good,Great experience and great place to learn.  Showed customer options as far cars they might be interested in and pricing and monthly figures.  High emphasis on customer service.
good,Energetic fast paced environment.  Great Service Manager. I learned to work with warranty companies and inspectors.  The automotive industry is a whole other world full of constant work and action.
good,"Extremely high in customer service satisfaction. Professional in leadership."
good,Time spent at AutoNation was a great learning experience. A typical work day included taking clients for test drives and explaining features of vehicles they were interested in purchasing. I fully enjoyed the interaction with staff and management as well as meeting with clients.
good,"Very helpful employess, fast paced job, lots of benefits, flexable hours. Management is great and very helpful. hardest part of the job, was possibly working the 2nd shift which was until midnight"
good,Great company to work for but there is a lot of up's and downs in the auto industry. Outstanding people work for this company and are willing to help other employees.
good,"A lot of really good people here. I loved my coworkers. Great group of  people. Not at all typical car dealership people. Really not cut throat like you'd expect. Good positive atmosphere for the most part. Pay plan is pretty good. They don't nickel and dime their sales people as bad as some places but they also don't pay as much so it's goes both ways. Most of the sales managers are great and genuinely want you to succeed. However, the GM sucks and since he can't his job right the sales managers get bogged down that they don't have as much time for you as you'd hope. Also most of the finance guys are intolerable. But overall it's a good place and a very clean dealership that has a great atmosphere and for the most part really tries to treat both customers and employees pretty well."
good,"Meetings in the morning, then a lot walk around the inventory of cars. Make 30-40 phone calls a day to list of previous customers. Get out and meet with potential car buyers to see what there interests are in a vehicle. I've learned the 7 steps to the sale by studying on the AutoNation website. We would demo cars, negotiate, then close the sale. Would handle all paperwork necessary and detail cars to showroom quality. The management were motivational and helped me fix my mistakes to be a better salesmen. My co-workers were all friendly and willingness to help others, while some were competitive. The hardest part of the job was dealing with the managers in the negotiation process. The managers seemed to do things their way and would put the sale in jeopardy. While i enjoyed working with some managers who would follow the AutoNation policy, unfortunately they would be busy with other tasks. The most enjoyable part of my job was learning the process of selling cars and talking with customers going from step to step."
good,My job consists of registering Service Contracts for Ford Dealership In North and South Texas. I will post journal entries for clients. The management was very helpful for giving information about the task. The co-workers had good work ethics to work as a team. I enjoy learning new things about the job to grow to the next level.

good,"This place was a non stop work environment. From the time you walk in until 10 or 11 at night it was always grind , but it was a great grind. Very enjoyable to teach and train, but most importantly to help clients and employees on a day to day basis. Great staff to work with and for. Being in finance , the hardest was trying to find financing for everyone in a timely manner and also making sure I could get employees paid ."

I want to go into the finance department no one really cared. I saw three others promoted before me. I was with the company for a well lengthy time. No change so I decided to take a Store manager position without the headache of selling customers in the heat, rain, cold, etc."
good,Auto Nation was a great company to work for. It was fast past yet effect in quick learning. All employee's where placed on a very high standard as to what the company expected. They showed their employee's that they mattered by providing agents with lunch/dinner when long hours where expected. Great company to work for.
good,Great place to work good training policies and processes are one of the best ive had. Management salary could be reviewed compensation is a little low.
good,fine dealership and workers. autonation is heavy on CSI scoring and short on forgiveness. autonation also took away a lot of the perks that made them worth working for

good,"Starting off when you come in to work you walk the car lot to see what vehicles you have in stock in case a customer wants a specific model and color, then youd call all of your customers to follow up with them to see if they are still in the market for a vehicle or if you got the car they wanted in stock now."

The management is great because they are always focused and have lots of care for their employees. My co-workers are awesome. We work very hard to get everything done and set goals and strategies. I think the hardest part about my job is satisfying the customer, when a vehicle is not done right while we are very busy, it can be stressful. The most enjoyable about my job, in my opinion, is the traveling. I get to deliver cars to different cities like Austin or Dallas and get to meet different people at those dealerships."

Typically a day at work is busy with phone calls and appointments; however there are days where it is not busy at all and the manager gives recall lists for me and one other employee to research. The hardest part is having impatient customers, which is understanding at times. For me the best part of my job is helping the customers and the people I work with."

The thing i enjoy most about my job is the people and the position i am in. I really enjoy waking p and coming to work."
good,"Very helpful employess, fast paced job, lots of benefits, flexable hours. Management is great and very helpful. hardest part of the job, was possibly working the 2nd shift which was until midnight"

Teams build rapport and camaraderie through performance contests, bonuses, holiday parties, and charity events such as 5K runs, toy-building projects for Christmas, and financial giving. Benefits include full-coverage health insurance and 401K plan."
good,"I had to work all the time, all day long to get an average of 1 sale for every day of the month.  This is the highest producing Toyota dealership in the country and third highest in the world.  It was a great experience and I'm hoping to find another dealership in the Harrisburg PA, area that has the flow of business that this Autonation dealership had."
good,Autonation is a great company to be a part of. They take very good care of their employees and the compensation plan is awesome. Depending on your job there you can potentially work long hours but otherwise it is a great environment to work in
good,"Autonation it's the biggest nationwide automotive sales retail. If your are exited the latest information on new vehicle to your customer, this it's the place you must work."
good,"fun, relaxed, easy job, work with customers, work with great co-workers, can be taught to do different roles, great service manager, loud at times, work outside in the cold or the warmth, no air conditioning in the summer, so working in 90 degree weather for 8 hours sucks, but heating in the winter."
good,"AutoNation is a great company to work for if you can handle the hours of the car business. AutoNation believes in the ""running the play"" and mentoring their people. If you have the want and determination to succeed they will give you every avenue available."
good,"Very helpful employess, fast paced job, lots of benefits, flexable hours. Management is great and very helpful. hardest part of the job, was possibly working the 2nd shift which was until midnight"
good,"Autonation is overall a good place to work for in regards to benefits, job security, pay plan. Because of it's corporate nature, employees and future candidates should expect frequent policy and rule changes throughout employment. "
good,Really cool place to work great team Environment. Very diverse group of individuals. Flexible hours. Very interesting group of customers that you get to work with and get to know their families are strange their weaknesses I am mostly learn new products.
good,i loved working for auto nation they are very organized and the fact you can sell out of other stored inventory gives you more opportunities to sell a care
good,"The culture there was great, if the place was making money, everyone was happy but if not (even if your job has nothing to do with sales) everyone would be mad and take it out on you. I was a Porter at Autonation (Its a Valet for those unaware of what it means) All we did was dress up cars with plastic seat covers and paper mats, take them to the techs, bring them back when theyre done and park them in a ‚Äúready‚Äù lot, when the customer comes in we go get their cars in the ready lot. We also washed cars, check in/out loaner vehicles, pick up/drop off customers at their homes, and do frequent coffee runs for the service advisors. As far as management, my service manager and i never saw eye to eye on anything which made work frustrating at times. But the tech manager and the service director (big boss in the service department) got along great. They were great, understanding people. The benefits include a bunch of insurances, 401k, etc. but the most important one for me personally was the fact we got holidays off and paid. There was also pto and vacation after a year of working there that they said would be a week but the most i was able to get was a weekend. There is also free lunches on saturdays so thats a bonus. Overall it was a decent job, nothing special and nothing bad for $10/hr. Theres also no raises too, i almost forgot to add that part. No raises no matter what. Sucks i left on bad terms though, i was young and stupid and took everything to heart. Got into a deep argument with a manager, said things that shouldn‚Äôt of been said and never showed up again. Oh well, you live"
good,great place to work if youre willing to put up with long hot hours and a ticket dispatch system that is flawed. technicians here can absolutely make a living. as long as you are willing to wait for tenor to start getting tickets that bring your hour count up.
good,"Job was a decent job.  For a disabled person hard.  Had to be on your feet about twelve hours a day."
good,"It was a good job, nice people and good pay, but there was just not enough production to go around. I don't know how much work is available now but if there is a position open I would recommend it."
good,"A typical day at work for me was making sure all Deals were approved, billing them, and then working on CIT. Provided nothing but a great experience for every customer . We were never sitting around doing anything because we are a faced paced store and did not have a biller so we had to do it all our selves. The finance team, we were more so of a family but also highly competitive. Everyone was close, Everyone brought something different to the table so we were always moving forward and completed what needed to be done."
good,"started with early morning meeting and prepare for daily customer service on sales finanance prep the hardest part of the job was the time i had to spend in it  being i lived too far from the job, the enjoyable part of the job was the interaction with the customers and the coworkers i worked with were very comforting to work with.i would do the same job if i had opportunity but closer to home"
good,I staterde working at Allen Samules when I was working for Allen Samuels I love it we would get bonuses more holiday s off then when we switch over to AutoNation  benefit where good as well but ones we switch over everything change remove some off the holiday  off day and the benefits to me was more expensive

good,"AutoNation Parts Center is one of about 300 automobile dealerships across the United States. AutoNation is a large, fiscally stable corporation employing thousands of people. I have worked at three different AN dealerships in the last 14 years, and the people I've worked for and worked with have generally been topnotch folks."
good,There is always something new everyday to learn. You communicate and interact with a lot of people everyday as well. I learned how to reach goals in a better faster way. The people that work there are all like family of course there are ups and downs like any place but its all about reaching goals. The hardest part of this job is working during snowy days. The best part of working here is you get to drive new cars.
good,"Auto Nation is amazing company to work for and each day was challenging and rewarding all at the same time."
good,Great working environment which allowed me to sharpen many different skills in the collections/receptionist industry as well as understanding the American Automotive industry better.

good,good people to work for not a good work life balance i have 3 kids that i didn't see often because of my schedule . Made great money  everyone was really helpful
good,"The management performs beyond expectation; highly supportive, supplies the right tools, open door policy, asks for input before making changes....  super cool!!"
good,"During a regular shift at work, we were all responsible for making sure all customers on the lot were being taken care of. If they were looking for a vehicle to purchase, we had to understand the different options available and explain all features in detail. If they wished to purchase, we put their personal information into our database, printed out documents with pricing, and when necessary we negotiated pricing to earn their business while still maintaining a profit margin for the company. Once the customers finished their purchase and paperwork, we thoroughly went through all features in the vehicle, including Onstar safety services and provided contact information if they had any questions or concerns."

good,"I was very fortunate to have the support of an extremely talented GSM and GM, which allowed me to grow within the organization and automotive industry"
good,"Should implement a better salary for their employees. Other than that AutoNation is a very good company to work for and for advancement, they work with you."
good,"I startednther as I knew the GM-I was his banker before and brought his other store to doing over $2Million in sales with the  bank where I was  senior Credit Analyst, I mentored the new salesman as my long automotive career gave me a good perspective. I was able to provide the dealership with customer satisfaction and many referrals."
good,The best part of my job was the customers and the worse part of the job were the few customers that you just can't please.  During my career Dobbs Ford was the best.
good,They gave me a chance. I really don't want to talk about this but this website is making me write about it. I'd rather just get on with my life so i can apply for jobs.
good,"The manager is strict but at the same time friendly. Great business men. Works with you, if you have school. Takes care of problems if any are presented. Customer service is their best policy and they heavily show that."
good,"I enjoyed honda but they wanted me to stay as a helper, i like to work alone i am fully capable of working alone. I am glad i had the opportunity to work for autonation but its time for me to expand."
good,"It is job that everyday is different. As We say in the Car Business, today you are Hero and tomorrow you're 0."

good,"Keep restaurant functioning properly"
good,"A normal day is usually a little more stressful than what you would think it may be, but the customer are usually great and most of the employees you work with are outstanding people. I am a very driven hardworking type of person so seeing people not want to work when they have chance is the only thing that bothers me.

good,"Not a bad place to fix cars.  Typical corporate management though."
good,"This is a sink or swim business. If you have what it takes you will love it. Yes it is tough, it takes 60 to 70 hr work weeks. If you are willing to put in the worm you will find Co workers and managers that truly have your back."
good,Working overnight i would pull my pallets to the aisle that they needed to be broken down in. Broke the pallets down then started stalking aisles. Ended the night with unloading all the empty boxes and fronting everything. I learned time management and doing what ever i could to help someone out. Management would talk to you everyday. The group of guys working there were different but i liked them. The hardest part was getting used to sleeping during the day. The most enjoyable part was seeing how much stuff i had stalked in the amount of time i was given.
good,"Great company. Screen and direct inbound calls to correct person, set appointments for sales department, Customer Service, Serve as backup for receptionist"

good,"Working with a dealership in a metro city area is one of the most stressful jobs I have undertaken, however the teamwork of my co-workers helps a lot. The hours were long and I would sometimes have 130 to 140 hours per pay period. In the end I was helping the customers take care of their car as well as educating them on what certain things did or how the car would perform without the repair."
good,working at autonation spring jeep was a great place to work and easy going. every one worked as a team and was always busy. therefore it made the time go by very quickly.

good,"Autonation is a publicly traded company on the NYSE. Training is immense, precise and excellent. But lack of synchronisity amosndt the managers. You're on your own! Good support and follow up by managers were overlooked."
good,they are a big company. corporately own. meaning low on pay. ask for raised but not happening. pay is not match on job description. secure on job. but low pay
good,I have worked for Auto Nation for a year now and enjoy my job. Not only do I enjoy my job but I work with great people who are always willing to help you succeed. My transition into sales has benn challenging at times but my boss is always there to show his support. Great place to work!

They assembled a team of talented professionals and leaders, provided funding necessary, and transformed other aspects of their IT organization to truly become an ecommerce pioneer and leader in the automotive retail industry. My tenure at AutoNation was some of the most professionally rewarding of my career."
good,I enjoy everyone I work with hence the reason why I've worked here for 5 years. Unfortunately as a manager I wish I was compensated a little more for the amount that I do and hours I work. There are no negatives aside from pay.

good,Great place to work if you love meeting and interacting with new people everyday. It great to have common knowledge with windows office for you will be asked to use it quite often. Hardest part of the job is to look busy when it is dead the beginning of the week (mon-tue) but watching people walk away smiling with their new car and no hassle is quite fulfilling.
good,always willing to educate and train with the latest techniques and software tools.
good,"work is not busy but steady, there;s always something to do thats what i like abot the work place there."

good,"Must come ready to work. Email, texts and phone calls are a must. Though productive, the work environment is very fun with a family atmosphere.  Would recommend if you're wanting a career in automotive sales."
good,It‚Äôs a laid back environment. We occasionally have cook outs and holiday events. The work load has slowed down but it can get busy as times. Having great customer service is a plus because we‚Äôre in business because of our customers.

good,Great place to work with open door management. Teaching new skills with a smile. Allowed the employee to feel involved and engaged in the job being performed.
good,Let me start by saying that AutoNation collision center in westmont Illinois used to be westmont body works. The owner sold the company to autonation a couple months ago and things have declined since. We once were a company that was over staffed and fun place to work at. Since autonation took over we have lost about 15 employees most of whom which have been here for 10+ years but autonations policy made them quit or the insurance benefits were to expensive. I drive the tow truck at the collision center. Its winter season here in Chicago and we have had some bad snow in the past month. While most tow drivers with other companies are swamped busy I sit around dill dallying most of the time or have benign jobs to do. We have doubled our work load with cars to fix but not enough people to get the jobs done fast enough and autonation isn't doing anything to help out.
good,"Fun, exciting. Yet after approximately 20 years in the industry, my experience in fixed-ops and other skills I've aquired would be better put to use in helping others."
good,"In this business it has to be work based upon team effort and being consistant.I have learned the being patient, fair and upfront works."
good,"a lot of opportunity to advance,  yo need to stick around if you want to advance,  must to be willing to work Sat for sure, excellent training and constant support."
good,If you want to learn the ins & outs of the industry AutoNation has great structure. They will continue your education through advancements and training.  Great place to work until you become a GM.  Once you become  a GM you have graduated and need to go to another company.  Take your talents and training and get paid.
good,"In a months time of working the floor, the phones, PCs, and even the outdoor area of vehicles, the job is very interesting. Autonation provided regular free meals, uniforms and several resources."
good,"AutoNation Honda taught me a great deal of lifelong, useful office responsibilities. There were a plethora of mentors I not only learned from but who also inspired me to work my hardest in a fast paced environment."
good,It was a good experience working for AutoNation.  The staff I worked with was professional and very easy to work with.  The company is very well structured with good internal controls to make sure there is consistency with process.
good,"Very helpful employess, fast paced job, lots of benefits, flexable hours. Management is great and very helpful. hardest part of the job, was possibly working the 2nd shift which was until midnight"
good,"If you can handle the stress of selling cars, this company will take care of you. Long hours. The management has a great course for beginning and experienced sales people"
good,work was worktastic and i worked alot and worked more and more and more and more and more and more  untill i was all worked out... but i got to go back to work the next day
good,"Be able to multi-task all day long. Long Hours with the same people everyday. Learned people skills. Dealing with all types of people, and have to be courteous and kind."
good,They are about the bottom line period. Good People below average  management not very user friendly when applying for a  job ask a lot of questions and look around.
good,"As a receptionist there were many fun days and learning experiences. As a receptionist you learn the basics of sales, parts, service and customer service."
good,"A typical day consisted of answering phone calls, filling lisence plates,faxing paperwork, scanning documents."
good,"Loved my time at this Dealership. Would still be there if not for the commute. I honestly can not say anything negative about my time spent with AutoNation Ford Lincoln. Great working relationship with the other 2 Service Writers, Dealer GM....etc"
good,Going into Autonation I was unsure of many of the activities and how to process the work as I was a lube person and move to Auto Mechanic spot after 9 months and sent to school for a  few things. If you have certifactions then this is a great place to work.
good,"most Dealerships feed you to the wolves, AutoNation does NOT. they give you in-depth training and a good work environment, great benefits. Management has a hands-on approach without micromanaging."
good,"THIS specific store is a phenomenal place to work in the (sales) dept. The drive and passion of the GM fuels everybody, everyday. He has won awards for his leadership in management and is a perfectionist to the core. STATS and performance are what he looks at daily, and expects the team to put in the time and effort and to be brilliant at the basics. "
good,Always have something to do they keep it fun and take good care of employees. Saturdays get really busy but always fun. Able to move forward fast in the company!
good,The atmosphere of the workplace was always inviting and warming. Management was open to ideas and involved with everything from greeting to final sale.
good,"If you are willing to give up a personal life and never have a weekend off, it is the place for you. Money and benefits are good but they come with a price."
good,"Start as floor sales person, it was very quick pace environment, must cold call every day to perspective buyers, made excellent cliental. I was then promoted to internet sales department."
good,Typical day included working with a great group of people and good management.  Long term employer but minimal compensation for the job.  Advancement difficult depending on department.
good,"AutoNation is a very successful company.  It was difficult for me as the owner/operator that sold to AutoNation to adopt to a completely new business model.  If I had not been the owner before and all the employees were new to me, I probably could have adapted better to their centralized management structure."
good,"Great Culture --- Enjoy leading the Salesforce and managers. Growing dealership with so much potential for growth."
good,"Very helpful employess, fast paced job, lots of benefits, flexable hours. Management is great and very helpful. hardest part of the job, was possibly working the 2nd shift which was until midnight"
good,"AutoNation has excellent benefits.  The salesmen work reasonable hours, and Honda is an excellent car to sell.  The company has full time local trainers to help your selling skills.  The compensation plan was fair, however now they pay salary plus commission.  My coworkers were fun to work with."
good,AutoNation is a great company to work for but management needs to change. Fun place to work at. Lots of events. Benefits are very expesive. Employee discounts are very good.
good,"The work day consisted of various meetings proposing how to move the company forward, and what new strategies implemented. AutoNation is a great company to be apart of and I am glad I was privileged to work for such a corporation"
good,"Great working hours. They expect you to work hard but you are rewarded for your work with your paycheck. The pay is fair for the work and there is tons of room for growth. The HQ is extremely nice and centrally located in Downtown Fort Lauderdale. Traffic can be annoying at times depending on where you are coming from. This company is a fortune 500 company and sitting at number 145 on the list. They brought over 21 billion dollars in 2019, and they have over 300 AutoNation dealerships throughout the United States. They are spread around 16 states and they are still growing. At the HQ there is over 600 employees and there is a parking garage so you do not have to park on the street. There is over 26,000 employees nation wide as well. I love my role and hope to grow with the company in the future. The only issues is getting use to all the systems in place, but one you are use to it, it will be second nature. Do not hesitate to apply. "
good,"Busy, stress, always about the bottom line, on the other hand freedom to do what you needed as long as the work was done efficiently. Hardest part of the job was the long hours, increase in responsibility and work load with no increase in compensation."
good,"Great opportunities, lots of good people work here. If you are inexperienced they will give you an opportunity in sales, from there you have a realistic chance to move to finance, if you work hard."

good,"Good Company to work for always looking to satisfy the Customers and Employees.Working together as Team Player we got a lot of things done and everyone is satisfied: Management, Employees, and Customers."
good,"Since the beginning I have been with them.  The essence of the company is to give a fair deal to all while trying to provide a peerless experience for the customer.  As with all companies, we are made up of great people and some not so great ones, but the majority fall in the first category --- people who are really trying their best to do what's right and who truly care about the customers.  Good place for solid, steady employment, and you don't have to 'run the other way' when you see a customer walking down the street as with some other dealerships."

good,"Awesome team :) "
good,"I honestly loved working there, I was just laid off under a loop hole. And instead of challenging it and losing the opportunity to ever return I left on seemingly good terms."

Within 3 months I was promoted to Sales Manager and my income skyrocketed! Great place to work where you determine what you earn!"
good,"They work with your schedule. Very good atmosphere, co workers are there to help and the work is generally pretty simple, depending on your experience. Perfect place to learn if you are trying to enter the industry, great place to work if you are experienced. Constant work flow, always something to do especially in the main shop."
good,It was a good place to work. The manager at the time was very nice. The parts department was slow though. Other then that good place and great hrs and pay

good,"You will spend a lot of long days but that goes with out saying at any competitive car dealership. As long as you put in the hours and don't work the clock but the flow of traffic you can make a very generous profit. Usually two days off out of the week, a weekday and then Sunday (unless your branch is open Sundays). But the last week of the month you only get your Sunday off. Everyone works the last week to grind out those last units sell and take home that long worked paycheck. The people who work there are what makes your days go by a little faster, work is always work but that doesn't mean you cant have fun with it. I hope this helps anyone who reads this."
good,I was very pleased with the overall structure of the company. I enjoyed that i had full benefits and that I had stock options with the company. Every month we enjoyed a birthday party for all the employees in the company.

Management was understanding with working around emergencies that came up. Employees maintain a good work ethic. The hardest part of this job is maintaining control of a situation presented by an excessively heated angry customer, and getting everything situated. The most enjoyable part was working with interesting personalities that I would never have encountered otherwise."
good,AutoNation offered a diverse workforce and great opportunities to grow and develop professionally. Training and mentoring was available at all levels of the organization and bottom up communication and feedback was encouraged by senior leadership.

Sales Managers got terms agreed to while Finance Managers submitted and worked with the banks.

Promotability was unlimited.  There are Autonation dealers throughout the country that you could transfer to as an employee should the choose to.  You have alot of choices.
