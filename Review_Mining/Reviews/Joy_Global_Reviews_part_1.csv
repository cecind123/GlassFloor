bad,Favoritism is at an all time high at this place. Management is an absolute joke. They treat their best workers like garbage. It’s not what you know but who you know
bad,"Foi minha pior experiência profissional dentro de uma empresa, os trabalhadores eram forçados fazer horas extras de domingo à domingo, levando o corpo e a mente ao limite, passando por ameaças se não fizesse. Lideranças sem capacidades, péssimo planejamento de produção e constante flertava com risco de morte. Não recomendo a empresa pra ninguém."
bad,"Very poor leadership. Internal political battles, an unprofessional HR department that is dangerous to employees. This is not a company to be trusted. Not until a full shake out is done is the bad actors."
bad,"Coworkers are terrible, the only way you can get a good review is if you ho drinking with the manager not performance. Don't work there. Nothing further to say"
bad,"Management is the issue here, one of the worst micromanagement types yet. Ended up ""let go"" for ""poor work"" and yet told they never looked at any of it to begin with. Classic case of ""found someone cheaper than you""."
bad,"I wanted to start a career there and from the beginning of my interview I was never asked about the job I applied for and was promised everything under the sun, and now I’m used every day and never getting a raise"
bad,"Poor !!!!"
bad,"empresa multi nacional  muito boa em organizaçao  "
bad,"The only way to survive the Komatsu culture is to become the boss's favorite or friend. There is a lot of favoritism from lower management to upper management. It does not matter how good you are at your job or how many hours you donate (everyone is on salary) you will not be able to advance if you are not a ""favorite"" of the boss."
bad,"My opinion of Komatsu is that they treat hard working people like garbage. Management and HR do not back up their employees, they no longer give non management employees a yearly bonus, yet expect employees to give 110% with no incentives.  Their benefits aren't very well, especially their insurance deductions."
bad,"Joy Global was a great place to work and offered a lot of opportunity. Due to the decline in the mining sector the future was a bit shaky, As well as the sale of the Steel Mill and the entire Company."
bad,It was an OK place to work. Management was not that great to work with at times. But all in all they were very good to their employees. Made a lot of good friends there.
bad,"No regard for safety, favoritism, bullying, horrible communication, lies,backstabbing, i doubt these problems exist at other branches, great product however."
bad,"management sucks, all the supervisors are buddy's go hunting, fishing, drinking and that's all they talk about during the day, instead of helping with the workload. no chance of advancement and the raises suck, no future in this place."
bad,"Horrible management, constant mandatory overtime, no respect for hourly employees, no room for advancement, encouraged laziness and discouraged hard work in order to force mandatory overtime"
bad,Joy Homer City is not worth the effort. H R department is worthless. New plant manager knows nothing about what is going on.
bad,was ok it has a two tier system of permanents and temps with temp getting used and abused then cast aside once theyre injured on the job
bad,"Backbiting supervision. Management will drop you, at the drop of a hat for the slightest indiscretion. I have seen this happen on multiple occasions to good people. Work is super busy or dead slow. Industry is booming right now, yet tradesmen are sweeping floors here. There is no challenge or rewarding work every to be done. Management will use you as a scapegoat if there are any imperfections found, that being said, both mechanical and electrical work is shotty and I wouldn’t recommend buying one of these machines. Bad news."
bad,Lower management (department managers)awesome pretty good people upper management terrible upper management doesn't care   just make money winners find a way you know  if upper management doesn't like you you're gone.
bad,Worked  at fort mcmurray  shop  no matter how you worked or how much experience you have  if you didnt stroke the managements big ego  you were going nowhere
bad,"getting organized was playing a catch up game....vendors were unhappy, stress came out, "
bad,Layoffs every 2 years!!.If you have a job with good security it’s best you stay put!!They go on a hiring spree then lay off everyone they just hired!.
bad,"People were nice, but very clicky and always talking about uncertainty. They overwork staff and no OT was allowed, strict with long lunch even when staff is staying 1 or 2 hours after work daily.  They don't recognition hard work, its unheard of, favoratism! Management doesn't have the right credentials to lead, no room to grow, broken promises. Health and safety is taken very serious and well maintained."
bad,"Working at komatsu/joy global was the easiest job I've had physically, but mentally it was difficult to work through the week.  60hr day shift on call Saturday and then a 60hr night shift on call Saturday.  When you start working Sunday night and then finish Friday morning and they call you in Saturday you don't get a single day off and they don't care.  Do not believe they care about you or your family management only cares about themselves."
bad,"Department and company has potential, all problems are stemmed from poor management."
bad,"place is garbage, they only help out people from wash high, franklin, and ncaa div 1 football schools"
bad,"Until the change in management 3 years ago, great place to work and would of recommended my own kids to start there, but sadly not now with the current management regime in place."
bad,"Overworked with poor management. you get forced in all the time on every weekend if there is no volunteers, which a lot of people have families dont volunteer on Sundays. But at that point you get forced in.."
bad,Gerência e diretoria carentes de atualização no que diz respeito à gestão de pessoas.
bad,"They are resistant to change, and to be promoted it's all about who you know, not what you know.  The company is also very top heavy with managers and executives.  Be prepared to be thrown under the bus on a regular basis."
bad,"Starting work at 7am, brings all new challenges as each day is different. We go for an early morning production meeting for the day's job. Issues of shortages, production levels, health and safety are discussed. Any matters of concern or interest from management are communicated to the shop floor through emails to the workshop foreman."
bad,No puedes mostrar lo que sabes mucha gente envidiosa párese q no le gusta q la gente nueva sepa mucho sino te hacen la cama me lo advirtieron pero no lo creía pero es verdad
bad,Without the possibility of getting hired on. They play favorites. This place is full of work drama. They thrive on miserable people. They choose attendance over skill and knowledge. Also prefer people from certain geographical locations.
bad,"I worked hard everyday, rarely called in sick... once my 1 year contract was up they let me go. It was very upsetting I loved my job there and could have seen myself staying there until retirement."
bad,not even management knows whats going on I got to the point that I just do my own work and not even notice that theres a whole shop of people
bad,Poor management and lack of direction.  Very poor work ethic from full time permanent staff and managers looked other way.  Agency staff treat unfavourably
bad,"Although Komatsu is a very good company and I learned many procedures and I ha autonomy on my day to day workday, is not a great place to work."
bad,good co workers bad management in office worst thing lack of communication.
bad,Poor management  no time off 6 12hr days per week supervisor was not in touch with welders policy’s are to  stringent  you are set up to fail really easy there management wouldn’t work with you very well if you’re late can you get written up three write ups you’re out the door poor management   don’t care to give any time I’ll just work you to death.
bad,hard to advance anywhere in the company. promise raises when hired on after time period but wont follow through. and gives dead end jobs with no chance of hire on.
bad,"they make a lot of empty promises to their temporary employees to get them in the door. Employees gossip like they're in high school. management is nice, but very unorganized."
bad,"Very old equipment, feast or famine environment"
bad,"Empresa com ótimos benefícios e ambiente de trabalho bastante agradável, porém no que se refere á politicas de promoções e politica empresarial como um todo, ainda tem muito a desenvolver"
bad,"The company is poorly managed, paid working staff below par. Management does not know what they are doing."
bad,"The workers are a good bunch of people. But the management needs to be reviewed. You are not recognised for your abilities or experience. You can only advance in the company if you are a friend or relative of the management team. There are no incentives for the workers, and any productive thoughts form the shop floor are not listened to or recognised"
bad,Work hard to please all the different managers.  Not always sure who to report to. Great challenges.  Always something new to learn.  Easy to talk to senior management.
bad,"Appreciate working here. There a lot going on at this time. "
bad,"Good, friendly and happy people with a great work life balance. If you want to do the same role and not step outside of your comfort zone this is your company, strong job security for salaried staff!"
bad,"If you are looking to work at Joy Global, please make sure you have exhausted all other possibilities.  Bagging groceries, mowing lawns, McDonald's are all better paths to take.  You will be treated better working most anywhere else.  HR and management are a complete waste of space.  Joy hires mostly incompetent managers."
bad,"Empresa con buen clima, pero las amistades pesan a la hora de ascensos. No existe la meritocracia."
bad,"If you're interested in working for a company that doesn't appreciate any of the sacrifices, extra effort and 100% commitment to your job. This is the Company you're looking for. If you are looking for a job that has zero job security and has no problems cutting your job, go and apply. I do not recommend them at all. They have cut countless jobs for no reason and will continue to ruin lives with their poor business practices."
bad,Achava que a empresa era mais organizada - a briga entre setores é levado ao limite ...
bad,"good experience, light duties and easy to work with others. Pay should had been a little more and hours were a little hard on the body.but all in all it was a good work experience."
bad,"This company hires foremen who don't listen to the employees and have very little involvement in what is going on.  Fast to throw out punishment and rarely if ever thank or praise employees who go the extra mile.  They used to give safety incentives and that is neglected now.  Favoritism is so bad, and if you don't hunt,fish or raise farm animals you are looked down on.  They hire friends who don't have a clue what to do, and won't give the job's to qualified individuals.   In a short summary, they should fire every Foreman and management and start over."
bad,"My position was a demanding Document Controller working on the Queensland GLNG project.  I would have contact with various contractor regarding procedure, drawings, updates which I was responsible for ensuring all document out on the construction field were correct.  My responsibility covered over and upto 25 locations across the site."
bad,"Empresa nueva, no habia mucho trabajo, falta de organizacion, superiores con falta de seriedad."
bad,"If you are hard working, competent and care about the work you perform, DO NOT APPLY HERE. Cameras watch your every move(which no one explained to me, my co workers pointed them out 3 weeks in) people are fired constantly for petty reasons and morel amongst co-workers is so low that it makes for a terrible work environment."
bad,"Creat material gate pass to the system"
bad,"My day at the office starts at 7h00. Handling of diary to trh service foremean to give instructions on work to be doen. Then over to my dailt capturing of the previous days timesheets. Attending to orders, creating of quotes requested by clients. Invoice any work completed and authorized by clients. before ending my day I do a bit of filing. Ive learned a lot in trems of the mining equipment and the type of spare parts they require for different types of services. My departmental colleagues and I are a team, we assist one another when needed, especially when theres deadlines to meet.What i enjoy the most about my job is having to interact with different clients and handling them as they arent all the same in terms of charector. I also enjoy taking controlling and ensuring that clients receive the best service they require."
bad,"Very conservative company. President Trump photos in offices and banners in the shop. If you aren't family, it's harder to advance. People are really nice to work with."
bad,"Work is demanded be done despite capabilities"
bad,"Prefer not to go further than the above. I am bound by agreement not to disparage the company. An honest review might be viewed as such. "
bad,Understaffed to accommodate customer base with little effort seen to correct this problem. Support from parent company mediocre and most replies provided small amounts of information to reach the engineering goals for any customer.
bad,Years of service should not be the only indicator of performance.  Too many people retired on the clock doing their best to prohibit anyone from being recognized for their achievements.
bad,"Raises and promotions are based on who you're friends with; there are ZERO minorities in the managerial office. "
bad,"The top level management is the biggest problem with this branch.  Does not trust anyone to do their job and is always interfering.  There is absolutely no team effort, each department fighting with others, each crew slamming and discrediting the other, and to call the people in charge performance leaders would be a gross misuse of the word. The stress levels that are put on good people eventually cause them to leave.  From my experience it's an me, me, me attitude in this branch from the top down. The biggest benefit to this place is good pension and benefits that are offered. Take what knowledge you can get and move on if you choose to apply."
bad,It was a good job but wanted more chances to move up in the work place! The co-workers where great but some of the management was not. But it was a good place for the most part.
bad,strategies are not carefully planned out and a long term plan needs to be put in place   investing in systems routinely is required
bad,"Main assembly is a horrible place to work. Lads are very clicky, don't like new lads and are unwilling to share knowledge of the jobs. Management are inconsistent, lots of sloppy mistakes with regards to production and planning and quick to blame assemblers that they rush for thier mistakes. Overall, half decent money, no job security, no overtime (4hours in 6months), bprepared to be treated like"
bad,"Was laid off after 6 months. This is common there. When business slows people are laid off according to seniority, then new people are hired again when business begins to pick up. Zero job security unless you can make it through the layoffs long enough to work up the totem pole a little. Also, only a select few guys are given the opportunity to become valuable, everyone else is treated as disposable and given the same monotonous routine jobs every day. Things may be different now since the company was purchased by Komatsu."
bad,"This is a company that will take as much as they can from you and give back as little as they can.  No regard for family, work life balance and their employees well being."
bad,seem like a good place to work. was only there three months then they laid off 30 people and I never got called back. Received letter stated that my call back rights expired. I didn't even apply for this job they called me and offered me a good wage and I left a job i was at for six years just to be dumped by this place after three months.
bad,"Typical day involves being stuck behind a computer screen for 8 hours.  I did not learn much that I didn't already knew once I got there; although I was able to perfect my Pro/Engineer skills."
bad,Once you clock in you must attend meeting and do the required exercises. Next you go and clean your assigned area which is 30 minutes then you go to office get your orders and begin working. I learned alot about using pips to located parts in the warehouse. I got along with my co-workers and they were great people. The management was poor because they were worried about being friends over being in charge. This was also the hardest part of the job. The best part of the job is doing my job and making sure everything is done to the best of my ability.
bad,acknowledgement of good work through extensive testing. All equipment needed to perform work was readily available. Welded 10-12 hour shifts.
bad,"Cameras throughout the shop. Big brother is watching. Job application states that you can be fired at anytime for no reason, so you may work there for years and be fired because the new worker doesn't like you or somebody backstabbed you. You will be shown the door with no warning. Also, U.S. management type tactics."
bad,"it was a great place in the 80s when the company was family supportive , then new management took over it became very cold and wip driven not a happy place for the for the worker on the manual machines"
bad,"corporate managers out of touch with needs of the organization"
bad,"on a personal note I like my hours and days to work."
bad,"el trabajo en relacion a la sucursales y en relacion a los campañeros de trabajo muy grato , la estabilidad fue nada segura el tema era si nos equivocabamos nos ibamos ,la administracion en la sucursales muy buena pero el manejo de la gerencia del area muy distante y complicada."
bad,A typical day was hard and stead work. I had great co-workers that I learned a lot from on a daily basis. I mostly enjoyed learning from my senior employees.
bad,"I liked it here because of some of the people I worked with, but other then that I wouldn't recommend someone to work there because for one they hire temps and don't expect to get hurt in a place where there is danger every where.  They have people Supervising you that don't know where things are in the Warehouse, someone who doesn't give you all the things you need to be successful at your job."
bad,Buena empresa tanto como para trabajar y hacer carrera.
bad,Some members of the management team turned a blind eye to things going on in the factory. There was harassment of employees by other employees and nothing was ever done about it. Team leaders would curse employees and office management never did anything about that. The pay was great and that was the only reason I stayed there.
bad,Il faut aimer travailler avec des hommes plutot machos
good,I’m just a temporary looking for a full time position to better myself for my self and family. I need a good job I can advance in and get raises to help provide for my family
good,"Management seems to only to be focused on numbers and if the time they rake off which can be from 3 weeks to 8 weeks spread out, yet they tend to become upset if you miss one day as a sick day. Clothing and boot allowance is great and benefits to but the demand for workload versus the other coworkers who hide becomes extremely overwhelming."
good,"Assigned to Training Department in the Underground division.  worked from home, with company phone, vehicle and computer.  required to develop advanced training curriculum with little to no engagement by management to provide guidance regarding desired end results.  their is a great divide between the Service, Engineering and training Sectors of the Company that make production of such curriculum difficult."
good,"Excited for the contributions of the Merger; until that happens, it would seem many have checked out waiting for payday"
good,"Management hovers between neglect and micromanaging. Overall, current 8makes the environment toxic and the drive to do the job problematic. Upper management should wake up and change the situation here."
good,Komatsu is good company I can recommend a friend to work but for me I don't get paid enough .Komatsu had give me the experience that I have today I still love it
good,"moneys okay could be better, but not as bad as some places. its all about what you are trying to do broker a deal in your initial offer that will carry you over for years due to lack of adequate raises"
good,"La empresa se cataloga con un nombre internacional pero en faena tiene varias falencias las cuales deben ser atacadas por las jefaturas, en cuanto a lo laboral por parte de los empleados o técnicos es diversa y amena ya que se aprende bastante dia a dia. el trabajo de mantenedor es sacrificado sobretodo cuando es en un equipo de alto tonelaje."
good,"Empresa boa com ativo muito bom, aplicadora no mercado na epoca nada a declarar."
good,Empresa na qual proporcionou um crescimento profissional para meu cv
good,Penske Logistics provides Warehouse and Logistics Services amongst others to some of the very big names in manufacturing sector.
good,"*  A continuous balance between supply chain and manufacturing"
good,"Benefits and pay above average but no way to really ""shine"". The production calculations are arbitrary at best. Ratings are entered by a supervisor who may or may not have had any direct knowledge of the days activities."
good,"i am currently working in komatsu india pvt"
good,"As a new welder to the trade, with the right motivation you can really gain and sharpen your skills as a tradesmen."
good,"Solving technical visual problems was fun."
good,In my opinion this was a great place to work good environment great co worker's not much room for self improvement.in my opinion it seems like they would rather outsource for new employment then get there own employees.
good,Decent pay and benefits but the 12 hour continental shift switching from day to night in the same week is too taxing on the body. It is basically making all employees sick. Quality of life on days off is terrible because body is run down.
good,The people I worked for and with were friendly and courteous.  Joy is a union shop so the pay scale was good for our area and the company provided a benefit package.  I enjoyed doing the welding jobs but would have preferred working a day shift.
good,"Trabaje por un periodo de seis años en la compañía y nunca tuve un día típico por que tenia muchos matices ,todos los días se aprendía algo nuevo ya sea tipos de repuestos,en que se usaban,códigos, etc."
good,I was hired for my experience and was told so but was still paid as and entry level warehouse technician. I took the job because it was income.
good,Very conservative company with little room. The working area is very high risk do to large machines parts
good,"I’ve been employed by joy mining/komatsu for 14 years. When I started, I  was a mechanic, I was trained by other mechanics that had been there several month before me. Basically I’ve been there from the start of joy mining, lebanon. I was getting paid 12.00, give or take, in 2005. It’s now 2019 and I’ve completed an electrical apprenticeship. I’m now getting paid 22.95. Basically I’ve received .78 cents a year. Not bad, but not great if you include the ever increasing health insurance and cost of living. Compared to other factory’s in my area, electricians are making 30.00 plus dollars an hour. Overall, management doesn’t know what they are doing. Thus, falls upon peon employees to make up for their short comes. Meaning meaningless overtime for the employees."
good,"The job is secure and has great people to work with. Management isn't the best, have been made to work overtime constantly with disregard for family or life outside of the plant."
good,"Although the pay is good, you hit a dead end fast. when you reach the top of the union negotiated pay scale, you're done. Additionally, there are absolutely no tracks for an hourly worker to advance into management, regardless of his/her education or work ethic."
good,"great organization with an uncertain future as a manufacturer. The people are great to work with, however in my experience it is hard to build a life with these types of manufacturing jobs that at any moment can lay you off. Also the shift work is not ideal. and 0.80$ rate for working night shift is not worth the time away from the family."
good,Worked 11pm - 7am 3rd shift.  I ran the vertical lathe machine and enjoyed running that machine.  There was always production to meet and there was a very close tolerance on the parts was sometimes difficult to meet.
good,The job environment is good but we don't have growth expectations.
good,"job started great really enjoyed the company and felt appreciated, management changed and everything else did as well.  after management changed you were just a number in the company and didn't get treated the same unless you were a suck."
good,"not much to say about joy, field service is ok but need more stability. people feel insecure and you never have managers backup when needed"
good,Fast paced work place. Safety oriented. Poor management and not so family friendly. Enjoyed the union brothers that i worked with.
good,"I work in the cutting dept. uesing a saw,shear and moving parts on a forklift"
good,"At the time I was working it was MTI then transitioned to Joy Global. I had a great experience as MTI, very productive and face paced work environment. Unfortunately my manager completely miss represented my work and took credit for most of what I did. Once I addressed this problem, I was let go in short order. A great experience ruined by a few individuals who only cared about their own positions and not integrity."
good,"Good people, good work environment, your standard suburban, corporate office.  They have strict 8am-5pm hours, but good experience and steady paycheck."
good,"Komatsu provides an average work environment, but no opportunities for growth. There is no cross training and if you ask for more advanced tasks, you are told stick to what your current position entails, or that there are other people doing that. If you're looking for a place to go where you are stable in the position you're in and don't want to go any higher, then Komatsu is a good fit."
good,hambiente de trabajo grato y buen compañerismo y de alta competencia al trabajar en equipo.
good,Komatsu is a good company. You must be willing to travel 75% of the time. The pay is good and benefits are decent. Scheduling and travel can tend to be hard on the home life.
good,"Overall good place to work. Very strong Union hard to make changes within the company."
good,"Needed better management."
good,Good co-workers. No room for advancement. Upper mgt doesn't have  clue about the industry.  Facility was nice and  appropriate for the type of business. Good bonuses when we got them
good,"Union shop with great pay. Managers are good to work with. When busy, forces ot every weekend, Sat and Sun"
good,A very good workplace. Demanding management with no organizational skills. Do not treat employees good and you might have to learn how to sleep at work cause of all the travel and all the hours. good hours one minute and not enough the next. Very messy workplace.
good,"Joy Global has engineering, IT and business support needs as well as manufacturing processes. The underground mining division (Joy as opposed to above ground P&H) tends to hire people quickly to get projects completed and then lays off same during the first down turn. "
good,"es empesar con los trabajos designados que deja la jefatura "
good,"Testing world's largest four wheeled loader, cranes, crane houses, crane cabs, etc..."
good,"não tenho oque reclamar da oportunidade que tive de trabalhar na komatsu, profissionais excelentes e uma cultura empresarial em rica !"
good,"1st shift starts at 6 am and finishes at 4:30 pm, Monday thru Friday with 8 hrs on Saturday. I feel that there is too much waste. Some departments do not answer to local management, they answer to the home office which makes it hard to enact changes."
good,Komatsu is a descent place to work if you don’t have family. This is a single persons dream job. Lots and lots of overtime and weekends. Pay is descent for the area.
good,"è stata una bellissima esperienza perchè ho potuto vedere dal vivo tutto quello che ho sempre letto e studiato sui libri in merito al Toyota Production System, alla Lean Manufactoring e al Kaizen"
good,"Komatsu Mining Corp. is a fairly good place to work.  The management has the slightest clue of what they are doing, but, you couldn’t find a better group of guys to work with.  The company is stuck with primitive equipment with a bland outlook to advance or innovate.  If you try to suggest upgrades or better processes, they are swept under the rug and never heard or seen.  Besides that, there is little to no recognition system to boost morale and make people want to do more and to take initiative to help the company."
good,"Good work atmosphere  but low quality of management , tooling and direction. Work schedule was hard on body due to shift work being a 2 day then 24hr switch over to do 3 nights  .I had a good learning experience on operating boring mill and what needed to be machined on a fully assembled frame. Also had a learning curve on how to flip underground machine frames. Some things that were ill managed was mainly production and what was to be done for the next operation for assembly. All in all I had a good experience learning but did not like the way they managed."
good,Working at komatsu for about a year and it is okay. It is a pit stop for a better career down the road. Internal proceidres are clunky and overwhelming. Not good with their finances or employee structure. Needs improvement
good,"Good pay, good co-workers, bad communications between branches."
good,"I don't feel as though I can write a credible review of this company as when I worked there it was Joy Global Mining.  I don't know if or how Komatsu changed the structure of their facilities.  However,  when I was there the pay was awful, benefits were miniscule,  management had no idea or understanding of the product which they were manufacturing and their communication structure was comparable to Morse code.  Constant fear of unpaid lay off.  I will say this though.  The group of people I worked with were outstanding people.  Extremely knowledgeable in their craft and came to work with great attitudes."
good,Good people on the floor keeping the company going but office staff or management not very good at getting back to you with answers to your questions and discriminating against floor employees for petty things . Always worried if you have a job especially if you live in Fort mac where everything is expensive. Keep to yourself don't voice your opinion cause you might not be working for long . Good starting point but it doesn't last
good,Empresa com grande variedades de atividades onde se pode tirar grande aproveito para carreira profissional.
good,"trabalho forçado,aprendi muito com varios tipos de experiencia,a direção muito falha sem compromisso com o funcionario,amigos tds unidos, não ter um trabalho fixo, ter realizado os trabalhos com sucesso."
good,The hardest part of the job was the constantly changing priorities. The management is trying to right size the company after it expanded a few years ago.
good,"Regular hours with hardly enough over time, had many learning experiences from transferring job skills, management wasn't strict enough and tended to overlook people they knew that wasn't doing their job and often unorganized, co-workers were helpful when you asked for help. The hardest part of the day was the heat and the most enjoyable part of the day was staying busy and getting some overtime."
good,"I love the work that I do every day and that working with people "
good,"a typical day of work consist of providing assembly floor with the parts to build mining equipment ...dealing with purchasing to ensure parts will meet with production date and deliveries "
good,I have worked my way through several groups and management levels. Someone with drive to succeed can move up in this company.
good,Things are changing and with change there can be discomfort.  Management has been asked to do more with less and that has translated into a need to work longer more stressful hours to get the job done.  We have already had one workplace reduction.  The future as we are told it is good but getting there will be difficult.
good,"Komatsu assigns you certain tasks that you will specialize in as you work there. There is little exposure to different areas of the company, which inhibits career advancement."
good,desarrollo de planificación de trabajos de equipos en faenas mineras
good,work steady be safe think smart we learn how to build machines everyone is nice to work around and the hardest part is being behind on production catching up is the best part
good,"Komatsu is very busy.  They are very unorganized and that creates more work, looking for parts or other material.  The work load is very high.  Long hours."
good,"Management is strict but fair, willing to talk over any issues that come up. Work environment is good, excellent for safety and your job descriptions are very clear."
good,Komatsu is full of tight-knit management that tends to stay around for a while. Good indication that the company has something to offer. Diverse group of people that offer opportunity to all.
good,"OK working environment but needed stronger backing from HR dept due to lack of fight against union. Formally known as Joy Global,lack of strong leadership caused company to collapse."
good,the company has a slow pace that comes from the corporate world. people were fun to work with. lots of things going on but hard to communicate with different departments sometime.
good,They are modifying order processes. Still early in modification. The company is in process of revamping to a pick and deliver system and working earnestly on this matter
good,"Joy Global takes care of their employees, and you won't be over worked. The opportunities for grown and advancement are a bit limited. The company's global presence and decentralized management structure makes changes difficult to implement."
good,"Mucha presión, desgaste físico y poco tiempo para realizar tareas."
good,"I was employed Continental\Joy Global 20 years but because of bad management I was relieved of my duties as a supervisor. Salary reductions are to blame for not only me but several of my co workers."
good,"Economy has the company trying to stay afloat.  Too many layoffs, not a safe bet you will have a job in 3 months."

good,"Empresa multinacional, que debido a su gran expansion en el corto plazo, no ha podido generar los cambios necesarios para lograr mantener los indicadores que tenia antes de su expansion."
good,I was a leader of a union workforce. On a daily basis I worked with my employees to make rates at the best cost effective way utilizing lean manufacturing and standard work initiatives.  The hardest part of my job was knowing what had to be done but not having the upper management support to follow thru.  I am a team player so my co workers and I got along very well and most tended to lean on me for support and knowledge.  The most enjoyable part of my job was seeing the results of my kaizen events and standard work initiatives that I implemented.

good,It’s A Good Job With Very Good Pay . It’s Just Hot In There But If You Can Deal With It You Will Be Fine ..You Will Get A lot Of OT There Also But You Will Be Tired
good,Horrible staff inside the shop. You are treated as less than human and they will go out of their way just to make your daily work task harder. The managerial staff is the only reason I have stayed.
good,"This job can be stressful a lot of the time, but overall it is one of the better jobs I've had. The people I work with are good and helpful for the most part."

good,"Currently Komatsu is initiating a new system to replace Pips, Pwins, Preps, and Supplier.com.  With all focus on this new system, they have laid to the side the procedures and urgency of the customer driven business.  Very short handed in areas of material planners and expediters.  Process  are not being adhered to or overlooked."
good,"My time at Komatsu was spent with talented people, but unfortunately the lack of true teamwork caused more issues and impeded on productivity. A lot of this stemmed from distrust among st coworkers."
good,"-Journée de 11 heures"
good,Busy environment as I work alone. Daily meetings as I report to middle management. Reports and parts ordering are a priority. Strong support role no such thing as 'quiet'.
good,"A company with predefined systems and procedures."
good,"Joy Global was a great place to work, but being a supplier of mining equipment and service we had to rely on the mines to grow. With the down market in mining survival mode we had to turn to. Very hard to live day to day not knowing if you will have a job tomorrow. Had a vert strong team for safety."

good,"  very good P P E, tidy working ,"
good,"Komatsu is an excellent company that still seems to be going through the pains of adopting change whenever there is a change in upper management. From the role of Director on up, each new corporate officer is anxious to affect their own mark upon the ever changing process. Employees are flexible and work very hard to accommodate and adopt these changes into their current processes."
good,Todos lo días comienzan con una reunión en donde los jefes y los trabajadores tocan puntos como lo que sucedió el día anterior o lo que esta por suceder y en donde se asignan las tareas diarias.

good,"Good Place to Learn the culture and ethics. Employee Friendly company. with good culture, Less in technical learning."
good,"Ambiente agradável de se trabalhar, pessoas que buscam te ajudar em dúvidas e processos da empresa. Salário ótimo. "
good,"This company holds quite a bit of opportunity to develop yourself and is a sandbox for business development.  If you are motivated and willing to take the lead on progressing, there is vast opportunity to excel.  However, the political landscape consists of individuals who are risk adverse or who are always looking to tell you why something can't be done.  Also, due to the size, it can be difficult to track who is the person assigned to a specific task which delays getting things done quickly.  Overall, a good place to call home."
good,buena empresa algunos problemas con el sueldo pero vale la pena
good,It was a great leaning experience. The job was great and great place to work. It was just a bad time to work for the company. The company laid off several people and was in the process of being taken over by a new company.

good,"A typical day at work would be to organize parts and sub-assemblies and then assist to replace said parts with a fair amount of coaching."
good,Uma rotina de trabalho normal.
good,Very unstable workplace due to the failing coal market. The management is unfair as in one shift or department having more perks than the other.

I learnt, you have to flexible and be a team member or be able to stand alone depending on what management demand was. Working with my co-workers was enjoyable as there was a vast age difference between them and sharing my experience with them and guiding them was the most enjoyable part of the job. The hardest part of the job was working with electrical information as the were mistakes and a lot of changes made daily and weekly."
good,"This company provided me the opportunity to travel globally, learn different cultures and gave me the transfer to another country. If you are ambitious and willing to move, the opportunities are endless."

good,I learned how to operate many different machines while working there. Experience and knowledge that I'm able to take with me and use today. I have many great memories and made lasting friendships.

good,"A typical day at Joy Global was a long productive day. My co-workers were extremely dedicated to drive towards a zero harm community. Safety first was truly their motto. This positive attitude provided a great working & social environment to be around every day. For my first Internship, Joy Global gave me an excellent experience. They provided me with an efficient on-boarding training program that prepared me for full-time work. After a couple weeks of working at Joy Global I was providing new employees with our Safety Policy & Hazard training every Monday. As well as assisting the EHS staff with various of projects, in which most projects were helpful information for not just the EHS department but for the entire company. The hardest part of this job was adapting to a general industry workplace environment. I was not familiar with mining equipment and the mechanics around each machine and how each employee used the machine. Though, by the end of the summer I felt very confident with myself. I improved my skills in multiple areas, especially public speaking."
good,The company takes the time to train employees. It ensures people are safe by removing safety hazards. It believes in safety first and safety takes priority.

good,"Busy role with expediting of parts, back orders, daily meetings with management and reporting. Reports for EOM, liaising with overseas employees and  dealing with delivery and freight companies can be challenging at times but always manage to find a solution. Always working on my own."
good,"Komatsu could be a fantastic place to work.  It has all of the key items in place to be great...  The problem is that Komatsu doesn't make an investment in its people.  No professional development, no career enrichment, nothing offered to make us better faster stronger and more efficient.  Maybe it's a Japanese owned company thing...  Not exactly sure.  "

This location was formerly Letourneau Technologies and purchased by Joy Global in 2012.  Joy Global has managed to assimilate Letourneau while maintaining much of the family focus and Christian values that Letourneau was built on.  This is one of the only places I’ve seen that still have chaplains visiting the workforce on a weekly basis."
good,"Se tem tempo para analisar e desenvolver corretamente, sempre planejando e procurando manter cronogramas."
good,"My day was always exciting. First thing was to log in in the system and input data, then start making phone calls to vendors that were on my expediting sheet. I learned how to handle different attitudes and personalities while over the phone. My co workers were very friendly and helpful if I needed a hand.The hardest part of the job was not being able to meet the ship date requirements that the shippers expected especially if there were no parts in stock. But overall I loved the people I worked with and I met some really cool vendors and when holidays come up they would send you a card and a gift for all your hard work."

The work is challenging and at times very physically taxing, but they pay well and have good benefits. Haven't done any time studies in over a decade and don't have a real grasp on what rates should be. They're just fine with guestimating.

good,"I absolutely love my job at Komatsu.  I enjoy working in the industry, enjoy my job, and like the people with whom I work.  The compensation is noticeably below the median for this job in this area, though, and a comparison of the health benefits to similar plans in the area indicate that these benefits may be coming up short.  Also, Komatsu America is a very flat organization in that there are not many tiers to the top.  This means that, unless the turnover rate is very high (and it's not), there are not many opportunities for advancement.  There are opportunities for lateral moves, but that would mean a move to HQ in Chicago.  Aside from that, I do like this job very much and feel that my job is secure."

good,"It was an awesome place to work, but seemed to be that everybody had these cliches and myself, I was there to do a job and support my family not to make friends but socialize with my co-workers and offered my support to anyone of them that needed help to make there 95.7 % percent of fill. You were never invited to go to the afternoon dinners in our department unless you ""fit in"", they seemed to be taking out the older ladies and replacing with some that had no clue to what materials was about nor how to check the procurement on how long it would take to arrive at our facility.  I had 8 to 10 reports that I had to review daily for parts, work my 4 main filters in servigistics and order stocking parts, transfer form other locations, maintain inventory levels. My co-workers were much older than I and they did not like the new methods of planning, they did not like change and it was for the best of our division. The hardest part of the job was that when we had a customer that placed an order lets say for 150 pieces of an oring, and my minimum to stock is only 200, customer service should contact me and let me know that they have just dropped a packing list for 150 pc of my 200 and I could have ordered to replenishment that stock immediately. Communication was very poor through out the purchasing, customer service, and materials. The system we planned was not an automatic system.  What we saw on a certain part never was the actual count, we would have the system update over night. The most enjoyable part of the job was the challenges of reducing inventory of 30 million in three months"
