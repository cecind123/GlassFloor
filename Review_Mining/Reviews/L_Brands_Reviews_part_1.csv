bad,"They could care less about their employees and the ppl there are just terrible. Way too many rude foreigners and good luck ever advancing if you aren’t a serious a* kisser. Very stressful job and you will never be appreciated for your hard work or going the extra mile. They also force mandatory overtime working 6 straight days in a row and don’t expect you to have a life, they simply don’t care about employees , just money gain."
bad,"The conditions are deplorable. The Mgmt there is terrible. There is absolutely no chance for advancement UNLESS you are in the Mgmt Friend Click Zone. They do not work with you if you ha e court dates, illness or emergencies of any kind. You are issued points REGARDLESS even with a Dr""s excuse or court documentation. 3pts and out is their standard system. Any and all ""Open Positions"" are filled by either outside candidates or their friends."
bad,"People care more about hooking up on the job then doing their job. Having relations in the training rooms, cafe etc. Diety work environment, always have bed bugs. People come to work smelling of alcohol/weed. Terrible management!"
bad,"3 years invested to lbrands. On time. Exceeding sales expectations, picked up shifts when coworkers called in, never missed a work day.  My manager found not doing her job. To try and save herself, she had to find a way to keep it. Even if it meant to force out top employees in her store. Worst company ever. Saw it time and time again. Don't ever think it won't happen to you too."
bad,There was never any room for advancement unless you kissed up to the management. Staff never conducted themselves with integrity. No paid time off and no vacation.
bad,"Payroll people referred to DC workers as animals. And generally treated their contractors as sub humans. You actually got yelled at by your boss when asking for more work, they believe you should already know what to do next. Who wants their manager to coordinate effort/time usage?"
bad,"** warehouse/factory** I worked in DC7 and I ended up quitting after 2 years. If I could give 0 stars I would. The work was easy, They just try to work you to death for little pay. Only time I received pay increases is during holidays season or whenever amazon was hiring lol but they take it away after the season is over. It depends on how bad they need the man power, they just might let you keep the pay raise (until things slow down) or just fire you without warning. Management takes the workers for granted. It's really about the numbers, so you'll see plenty come and go. They really dnt respect their employees and when you ask about any opportunities to move up they tell you there isn't none. They'll just move you around the warehouse to perform different task. I hear there is opportunities but mostly depends on how much you suck up to them and hopefully they'll like you enough; nothing really to do with work ethic. Supervisors/team leads gossip and get caught up in drama like the production workers and they just dnt seem to care enough; whether it's showing up on time or actually knowing who's who when it comes to sharing personal/private info. The whole time I worked there,On more than one occasion I was approached by the same supervisor G, telling me someone's business after I told her i'm not who she thinks I was; That was one of the many annoying, sad and frustrating parts about working there. However, I did meet some great and INTELLGENT ppl there. Unfortunaly I cant say the same about management or the leads, They all could benefit from being retrained, especially for"
bad,"Was hired as a manager after one shift and was given virtually no training for the job and was scheduled for management shifts. Begged all management up to district manager for proper training and was never done. stores were a mess, not organized, and store management was never on the same page. Nobody worked together and made job assignments difficult for everyone. Was scheduled for 4 shifts in a 30-day period and requests to work or talk with scheduling management went unheeded.  One of the absolute WORST work environments I have ever worked in. Being unemployed was a step up."
bad,Poor treatment of employees.  Everything was about the bottom line.  Customers are only worth about three min of time.  Employees were pushed to meet goals or be terminated with out reason.
bad,"If you enjoy being screwed over by managers and a cutthroat environment, then this is for you.  Pay is on average well be low nationwide/state wide averages despite the company posting record profits year after year."
bad,This company has a horrible culture.  It is a sweat shop.  They treat employees like a number.  They do not hold their employees accountable.  It all starts with leadership.
bad,Inability from management to learn from pass mistakes. They had kept on making the worst decisions I have ever seen during my long stretch working for them (over 4 years long). I am so Happy I do not work there anymore. garbage
bad,"Worst place to work. Great if you don't care about your own personal growth and goals, bad if you do care about those things. I hated it I hated it I hated it."
bad,Was hired on as a seasonal customer service. Had a 4 week training but after that they throw you to the wolves and if you don't get a sup who cares then you are SOL! Did really well with sales and service all through the season but still ended up not getting the job as a permanent team member.  Was told in training that we would know long before the season was over if we were going to get hired on permanently.  Then at the last minute my sup said I didn't get the job and only had 2 days notice to find other employment.  Very disappointed.  Would think a company like this would treat their staff better.  They don't.
bad,Lies to people in interviews about how much work you will have. Then sit around bored all day lomg with nothing to do. The company is laying alot of people off stay away.
bad,They don't give their employees raises .. you could be there for 5 years still making the same wage.. not to mention the managers and supervisors gossip like high school students .. I would not recommend working here
bad,Depending on the location you are at it can be a good place to work part time.
bad,Company doesn't care about employees only cares about product & how fast it can be shipped out warehouse.  Not a good place to work if you have small children.  No room for advancement & supervisors suck; no supervisory skills what do ever.  Bad communication & sometimes no communication at all.  .5 out of 5
bad,"I set up rooms with hundreds of chairs and tables every day. once in a while some AV would be needed. I walked through the facility and took note of any problems. Then I called the right contractors or I took care of the issue. I also did a lot of painting and patching throughout the facility. Decent team, and no management. I learned nothing. I just sharpened my facility skills. The job wasn't hard in any way. There were a lot of enjoyable employee events during work days."
bad,"I worked at the DC 1 on Morse Rd campus and got fired for the most petty thing ever. I got into an argument with a co-worker and we didn't physically fight, words were just said. But I get walked out and she doesn't which wasn't fair considering she started the argument. Favoritism definitely plays a role in this place. I feel like the matter could have been handled without firing me. Unfair and cruel."
bad,management is the worst at L Brands. Don't have any ideas that may differ from management you will be gone. Don't stay in one place to long you will be gone even if you are doing your job.
bad,"It was okay to start but they favored people horribly and then didn't look at facts of situations. People advanced that shouldn't and then people that were hard workers and treated customers with respect got outcasted. Easy job for the money for an intern job. If you know anything at all, get out as soon as something better is offered, because if you're knowledgeable at all, they don't really like/appreciate that!"
bad,"This is a metric driven environment. Your worth as an employee is determined by a set of arbitrary numbers."
bad,"What a joke!!!! Long time employees getting screwed all the time. Watch your back all clicks and gossip. No one knows what is going on. Crazy disorganized . Cult-like language.  Brainwashing ""Limited Way"" etc"
bad,What a joke!!!! Long time employees getting screwed all the time. Watch your back all clicks and gossip. No one knows what is going on. Crazy disorganized
bad,This job is ok if you're fresh out of highschool and do not have a life outside of work established. The work culture is there really isn't anything outside of work.
bad,"It’s all about management! They don’t care about employees. They talk about us and to us, condescending. I cried sometimes but needed the job. There was so much misappropriation of pay, most of us who asked about our salaries being short changed were asked to leave. Victoria had a lot of secrets here. Would not recommend to anyone"
bad,"I worked for Lbrands for several year and saw it going downhill.  Management was focused on budgets only and not taking care of their associates.  They force you to work much OT and aren't paid enough for the work you do.  You aren't going t0 get promoted here unless you are a white male.  HR is a nightmare, with a plethora of inconsistencies, and a revolving door.  They have an open door policy that they preach but don't allow you to use.  If you don't fall in line and play the political game, you don't belong, despite their motto of inclusion makes us stronger."
bad,LBrands is afraid to be fair. They consistently rely on veteran associates while letting new associates do whatever they want.  Veteran associates are not appreciated. Leadership lacks knowledge and cannot hold people accountable because they don’t have backbone.
bad,You will become a little more bitter with every week you spend here. Don't go to DC5. Foreign employees allowed to be as racist and rude as they want.
bad,"Managers are not accustomed to working with professionals. They promote from within and many managers don't have an education or education in the department they are attempting to manage. "
bad,It’s an ok job. Takes a long time to advance in the career. Job nit picks on things and doesn’t show a lot of respect to employees. Just and ok job. Ok
bad,They are losing money with the malls and such so it is being taken out on the full time associates and getting treated unfairly. New temporary hires were getting treated better than then the ones who have been there longer. Each department work place policies were never followed.
bad,Way too much favoritism and nepotism even though they say there is none. they make you feel like you shouldn't ask questions and you should know everything after a 2week training class.
bad,"This company does not promote from within, the management is always changing. There is a lot of theft internally and externally, which puts a lot of stress on management. The compensation is not competitive and the work load is more than most retail locations."
bad,"bad processing system and vary demanding"
bad,"So true when you say people work for people. DM overly aggressive and need training on how to be a leader.company killed it on marketing and waste so much money on it too. They trained the customers on sales and free stuff. When they tired to step away from that business was hard and the that’s when DM and company start to repeat behaviors that over work there people in "
bad,The department you are in will vary what you do daily. I liked my job but it got to the point that I wasnt getting hours consistently. I wanted to become core and done everything needed consistently to become core. There was no room for advancement or to be hired as a core employee.
bad,The culture here is just awful.  There is no team everyone is constantly pointing fingers versus working together.  You get very little support and zero development
bad,"Worked third shift so I missed out on all of the perks such as the cafe, Starbucks etc. The culture they try for is a far cry from the one that they actually have and if you are open and honest, watch out."
bad,Victoria’s Secret’s stresses empowering women and I have found that to be untrue. They have an authoritarian work culture. The managers are expected to work beyond their regular job requirements without praise or compensation. There is a lack of understanding  between Corporate and the stores on what Sales are beneficial to increase business. This can leave you questioning their strategies.
bad,A typical day at Bath and Body works was a day filled with standing and helping customers. I learned helpful people skills and how to use a cash register.
bad,"When I first was offered the job I was excited and put 100% into my seasonal employment , yet I will say I felt pressured to sale to which was to no one most the time after Christmas , the managers I had were very rude & not hands on with inexperienced cashiers , or was all about “sales” . I will say I like what the company has to offer benefit and wage wise ."
bad,"Don't even think about it , they are going to consume u for their intrest, they do have a good paid time off and good health insurance,  that's all what they have positive , every thing else is................."
bad,"Limited Brands is a very good paying company with great benefits."
bad,"Productive and not a very positive work enviornment"
bad,"Can't get paid, left short every pay day and girl in Dublin office so rude and unapproachable. Can't get hours in advance. Hard work and then not to get paid is so disheartening. And it's absolutely loads of people. Worst place I've ever worked in. Loads and loads of people have left over the same reason and there's no body to help us. Day before Xmas eve we were all left loads of hours short and told that nothing can be done about it."
bad,Look up and your life will be over and you will not have enough to pay tuition for your children. Play political games the correct way and earn a salary that allows you to almost afford tuition for your children.
bad,"Had its good points and bad points just like every place can. Had issues with my supervisor getting me demoted and tried to get me fired, she liked being the center of attention and i wasn't into her like that."
bad,Working at L Brands is okay. The store is fast paced and management gets caught up in making the sale over customer service.
bad,"you almost felt like cattle... it was all about making your numbers, which were unrealistic. most associates could make their numbers."
bad,District Manager does not communicate well. There is a lack of respect from upper management to Store Manager.
bad,picker and packer nice company i got a lot of experience  from them  cherry picking then i moved to kentucky .
bad,They do not treat you right by any means and make you do things that you were never told in the first place. They don't pay enough for what they were asking you to do.
bad,"Scanned trolleys placed items in boxes once the boxes where full I would place them on a shipping belt. I learned how to sort and scan."
bad,"Favoritism is common and toxic, hostile environments are not addressed as readily as one would like or expect. Though, overall, the benefits are ok and they offer maternity and paternity time."
bad,No chance to grow or advance. Horrible compensation per workload and company revenue. Thousands of bosses who are determined to keep the few workers stuck in lower level positions.
bad,Poor management of people will cause productive workers to look for employment other places . This place is a prime example of poor management. Managers are uninformed and not willing to be available when you need them to be. If you have a sup call none of the managers want to take the calls. They make you deal with the customers on your own. It feels like no one has your back within the whole company. If you have a personal issue come up the company doesn't care about your personal life. If you have children and need a day off during the retail season you can kiss your job goodbye. There are zero excuses as to why it isn't all about the company and then making money. It's supposed to be about the customer experience but LBrands does not support their work force. Look elsewhere unless you want stress and anxiety on the daily.
bad,I worked for Lbrands while in college doing the floor sets nothing ever went right and it was more like working for a sweat shop. wont work for them again
bad,"The location (Arrowhead Mall Towne Center Peoria,AZ) I worked at was horrible. The managers and associates didn’t help new hires. They treated them very low. Very judgmental on any hairstyle or how they’d dress. They abused the earpieces to judgesnd bad talk a lot of customers. Overall I hated it."
bad,Lots of hours during peak season. Company did lunches for employees.  Hard job to stay permant. Pay ok. To much cherry picking.
bad,"As a contractor, I was assigned to work in the international department as well as in store displays. I was only there for a few weeks, so I really have little to go off of on this review."
bad,I submitted my resume with a degree and they placed me in a department where my job is to fold dirty laundry to be sold back to the customer
bad,"I would never work for a place like this again, the company took advantage of us and worked us very hard 60 plus hours a week!"
bad,"When I began working with the company, I was proud to call myself an employee. Proud to represent this growing brand. Five years later, I must say I’ve learned allot about my self, politics, and how much people are valued and although this experience has made me stronger and a better leader. Lbrands, does not take the time to invest in their people. They do not allocate enough hours to support the heavy workload. We are expected to recruit a lot of employees; however they may not receive any hours or even work an entire shift. They pressure their leaders, to push for quotas: and ultimately over work their people because there is not enough hours to provide the support needed. They do not value their employees, they do not respect their employees. Leaders, associates, Representatives in HR are spoken down to and belittled. They do not solve HR issues in a friendly manner. HR representatives do not uphold themselves with integrity and create friendships with managers that cause a conflict of issue, specifically within the store, when representing employees. Associates are afraid to speak out because they are afraid to loose their job. They don’t represent their people and it’s sad. The reason they are loosing money is because they don’t value their people"
bad,"You are replaceable to them, they only want you to sell, and if you don’t sell enough, you’re gone. I did not feel like I mattered there and I did not feel like I was paid enough"
bad,"The current employees were very rude, crude, and just plain nasty to new employees or other employees outperforming them.  They literally ran into us, with shopping carts we used.  They would stand around in circles to block walkways or boxes that need packed."
bad,"Horrible place to work, pay does not compensate how hard you work, filthy conditions. Bad management and managers. short breaks, lunches. You have to walk far to break or eat lunch and by the time you sit down you barely have enough time to eat. Management ignores you like your beneath them. Pointless meetings, and sudden layoffs. Watch your paystubs. The few free lunches and gifts you get, you already paid for."
bad,Stressful demanding expectations does not meet salary requirements. Your work is not valued or appreciated.  Anything going beyond what you are expected to do because expectations.
bad,"The pay and benifits is awful, contractors are not treated as equal in respect of rules to be followed.  There is a power struggle between analysts (lower management) and the Tier II specialist.  And upper level management know nothing, as they commonly tell everyone when there are questions they are the only ones that can answer and most of them have been here a while.  The tier I support agents all have clicks and are not very helpful for the most part.  If your not in their group then they dont really talk to you."
bad,"A typical day could be 4-8 hours of working on your feet with selling product, restocking (ALOT) and interacting with customers. Depending on the day and time of year (with retail, holidays are the busiest times) you could have a lot of work or a little, it just depended. One thing I did not like was that the hours are so fluid; one week you could work 40 hours and the next week 8 hours, so it was hard to balance your bills depending on what you thought you might make for that paycheck."
bad,They would over hire ppl so there will be no full time positions unless you were management so no benefits.
bad,"The company attempts to help employees to promote and progress, however if someone feels threatened that one person will surpass another, coworkers tend to step on each other in nasty ways that remind you of high school drama. This was my personal experience with the company. A coworker complained to my manager with some creative lies that couldn't really be proved or disproved and unfortunately for me, this person had more history with my boss than I did so my boss naturally sided with her. Obviously, this made it so that I couldn't progress anymore, the work environment soured, it became difficult to work there, and all-in-all it's just better that I leave the company, so I'm currently looking for work elsewhere. I had another three coworkers to whom this happened. Fortunately, one was able to promote to a different location, so hopefully she's doing better. One other was demoted and is currently trying to make up for it. The last just up and quit because she didn't even want to bother."
bad,The management was not friendly. I worked long hard hours and sometimes without being given all of my breaks. Asked to do more than physically possible without being given assistance. Would not recommend others to work there.
bad,Good part time job. Not enough pay for a career. Learned in fast paced marketing centric company. Enjoyed working with the customers and the products.
bad,i would fold clothes that was returned. Also worked at the shipping deparment. There I would put things in boxes and put lables on them for shipping. I worked a lot of hours.
bad,management needs to have more interaction with employees instead of having all decisions made by the employees in dc who look to them for guidance not wait until it goes wrong then place blame.
bad,"In the Asset Protection Department be prepared to not be welcomed with open arms if you are a young woman, person of color, or independent thinker. Otherwise L Brands overall and their various other departments seemed to be welcoming and open to diversity."
bad,"Managers played favorites which led to high attrition rates; co-workers were great though. Customers were difficult to please and a lot of them, even after recommendations, wouldn't buy anything which reflects negatively on you as an associate(Even if they aren't based on commissions). One manager specifically said I was going to be working register and then decided I would be better at 'loss prevention' and decided to cancel a shift because I didnt have enough cashier experience for it.(I wonder why)"
bad,"I didn't feel I can grow or learn at this job after working there for a year."
bad,"Overall, nice company. Leadership requires further development, however. Siloed thinking and lack of true collaboration. The most talented leave. Organizational structure is to be desired"
bad,"While new and full of hope, Lbrands was a promising place with a fast-paced environment; however it doesn't take long to see you are brought in on great benefits with a terrible work environment. Be cautious when considering Lbrands."
bad,company seems to be grasping at straws to stay a float. constant promos just to survive. no more full price. leaders are to busy to communicate to mid level.
bad,"very stress filled environment that fills 75% of employees via staffing company. so they can get labor without offering basic benefits. or long term. peak only then ""core"" employees beg for hours throughout year."
bad,"Staying focused on task leads to accuracy. Enjoyable environment, communication with group lead satisfactory. Management meets needs with open door policy. Maintaining accuracy while keeping up with required production goal for team progress. Character of each individual should be taken into consideration for success of goal. Reaching an accurate projected goal to maintain production for advancement. Quarterly reports given to keep associates aware."
bad,I came in to Lbrands ready to create a morally sound environment but all of my ideas were disregarded. I was learning the department processes fairly quick but was slighted because the current Manager felt I was working to take their role.
bad,"Although everyone is really nice, there’s not a lot of miscommunication and there’s a lot of made up drama that goes on frequently. There’s a lack in organization and that is what leads to the miscommunications and frustrations that are seen frequently and basically on a daily basis.  If it was a more organized environment where people communicated freely and frequently, it would be a 100% way better place."
bad,"I have learned how to cater to everyone's personal needs as a sales associate; making sure that all the needs of the client are met with exceptional customer service experience. "
bad,"Generally nice place to work. If you work for a brand (Victoria's Secret, Bath & Body Works or Henri Bendel) there are great product perks and employee recognition. If you work for ""the call center"" a.k.a. in a role that supports the entire enterprise, little to no recognition at all."
bad,"Great place to start to gain knowledge in the worlk of logistics. The benefits are great, tution reimburment, and great discounts! If you do not want to work in a DC, then this is not the place for you. Several locations in columbus ohio. Nice cafe, do not have to leav everyday for lunch. Not the place for fast upward movement."
bad,Supervisor depended on other peers for input. They are interested in the Customer and their satisfaction at all costs even if the customer is being dishonest.
bad,"Great pay and benefits, terrible place to work. Enterprise Food and Beverage is an awful environment for good workers. You will be expected to do twice the amount of work, pull overtime whenever its needed, and you will still get treated as a slacker. Don't expect any training or communication from your management (except negative). I don't recommend this job."
bad,"picking all day, learned how to use a voice picking system, I didn't have much interaction with the management or supervisors, After training didn't have much interaction with co-workers"
bad,"Didn't have as much of a role as I intended. I felt I didn't get as much of a learning experience as I wanted. However, the team was great and I enjoyed the work I was doing."
bad,I have never seen a company put so many people on performance review all of whom were terminated; company only cares about speed and does not care how much work it puts on others; very young workers therefore not providing employees a hope for retirement since seasoned employees are few; no bonus' given; hard for others to move up in the department
bad,"When I initially started, I really enjoyed it. I would work 5:30am-2:00pm which is good for me, because I mostly do stuff in the afternoon-late evening hours anyway. Orientation was nice, everyone was pretty friendly as well as it was also paid. Training was nice as well, they made sure you understood it before you were let out of training to work on your own. They also were sure to remember your name and checked on you after you were out of training. Shift leads and management was nice as well, also co workers. Where it fell off was the inconsistent work hours. I’m at a period in time where I haven’t worked in two whole weeks. It’s just been core volunteers only, and there’s no way to become core from a seasonal. I worked two weeks straight, then haven’t worked for two weeks plus some. The first pay was nice but I can’t just sit on this job and wait till November for actual work. What’s the point of me having a job and I don’t get worked nor payed because I’m not working. It’s honestly disappointing because I did like the job, but I need hours."
good,I didn't like working there because you will have to call and check every morning (best to call 3hrs before shift) to see if needed to be there early or at regular time. Who wants that to interrupt their good night sleep for that? I remember one incident when I did call and showed up on time but turned out that it was changed later in the night. That messed me up. Supervisor told me that it was best to call twice...once before midnight and 3hrs before shift. The job was easy and was put in different area daily sometimes not at all depending on the flow of the day.
good,"Job was hard work, management was caddy so I ended up leaving. pay was decent. hours were long. No organization when it came to a lot of things. It helped me grow with my customer service"
good,it a decent place to work if you are looking for a temporary job nothing you would want to stay at people dont really take job seriously and managment would rather yell and complain at you but would never lend a helping hand
good,"While this is a small company inside of a larger one, it didn't have the benefit of leadership with that bigger company focus in all areas of the business"
good,The leaders and management doesn't want to their help employees to grow within the company. Leaders act as every employee is replaceable.
good,"Poor Management and low payment rate"
good,"Management was unorganized, and lied to you in the beginning about the times and how long you have to work in over time. Even though I am good at adapting, it's every difficult if management wasn't consistent."
good,If you are well liked then you get good sections and can make numbers. On the other hand of you do not get good sections numbers are not met and you that affects you bad
good,"this was only a temp job, its was okay. the leads were kind of rude and the point system didn't make sense. long work hours, did provide free lunch during peak season."
good,"When I first started there, it was a good job. But there are a few Management issues. Lately there is a lot of mistreated people including myself there. People who break the rules, don't get any kind of punishment. Always getting sent home, because there's never any work. Not being able to work 40 hours a week is a big problem. Not being able to work 40 hours, means not going to be able to pay rent and bills on time. Money is a major issue with a lot of people there. We all struggle because we don't work enough to make money to pay our bills and rent."
good,The company as a whole doesn’t look to develop the employee. You arrive at work everyday and not once has anyone explained how well you’re doing or not doing. It’s always we’ll talk later.
good,"Decent place to work, however there is only encouragement to recruit outside sources for higher positions instead of looking at current talent. I feel there are many qualified associates for many positions that are being overlooked."
good,"I loved the people, hated management, loved being busy. Pay was ok only because it was supplementing my retirement.  However I would not have made it on that salary alone."
good,No upward mobility unless you are not a person of color period! They do a poor job of making you think minorities are included! During the holidays you are expected to work very long hours it is mandatory!
good,It was an ok place to work but nepotism runs rampant.   They do take care of their employees. It is just some mangers not doing their job. Coachings were to be done monthly but that is not being done. Managers do this when they feel in the mood
good,management is horrible . one per month was leaving the team. very biased and have non existent work life balance.  unrealistic expectations from team. no one knows what they are doing
good,A good Place to work on your people skills. Always work to be done on the floor or in the back. Employees compete to raise there own personal SPA (your sales).
good,leadership makes sure that you know that you are easily replacable
good,Unload shippment. How to organize bras. Management could build better morale for it's employees. Co-workers are actually the ones that builds morale for one and other (NOT MANAGERS). Nine different people (SUPERVISORS) telling you the same thing. The job gets done.
good,L Brands like to make work fun by having activities for the employees. Right now at L Brands they are having a basketball tournament.
good,"Working in sales for Limited Brands, Victoria's Secret has had many pro's and cons, unfortunately it is very difficult to soley rely on this job as a source of income, and with the daily pressures applied and goals that are set for each employee, they do not neccisarly give you the pay / oppurtunities / hours you would expect."
good,"The days went by fast since there was always tasks to be completed before closing from customer service to stock/shipment. Co-workers were usually upbeat and worked as a team. The most enjoyable part of the job was dealing with people, the custmers as well as co-workers. If I had to say a hard part of the job it would be dealing with unsatified customers although there was always a solution."
good,"No hours, call-ins are a hassle. Never know when you're working or if you're actually going to get hours. If you do, you'll most likely be sent home early unless it's Holiday season."
good,"Managers did not know what the policies were and would get different answers depending on the day. Managers would just stand at the front of the store and gossip, totally ignoring customers."
good,"Had very high expectations , but very little room for permanent placement. The culture used a lot of contract work, so as to not have to give benefits and full time employment to workers."
good,"Very fast paced competitive environment the hours are long the pay is good, but the definitely room for improvement when it comes to management skills."
good,"People are nice, but don't truly value their employees. underpaid for the IT industry standard. very casual workplace environment however which was a plus."
good,"They have a habit of hiring minorities and excusing them regardless of their (bad) behavior. The job is needlessly physically demanding, damaging even, because of outdated machinery and procedures. Absolutely no PTO or much of a tolerance/understanding for absences (point system with no recourse)."
good,L Brands is a great place to work and they truly live the values that they set forth for their associates.  They preach a work life balance and really want their associates to enjoy their time off.  They offer a nice compensation/benefits package.
good,The job pays great for very little work. The benefits are great but expensive. My only complaint is the company culture. It is highly political. The best person does not always get advancement. The culture is also politically correct.
good,"In the beginning I was really excited about being part of a new team. I made great friends and reunited with past coworkers. I've learned how to operate new machinery, different aspects of the business. Management helped in ways that I needed, but not enough to understand what I actually needed. The difficult part of the job is when I needed help doing certain parts, I really didn't have it but I managed. I felt like I was misconceived about my position."
good,Great place to work. The most enjoyable part of the job was working alongside my colleagues and learning from them. I also enjoyed the briefings throughout the year.
good,"L Brands has provided me with the ability to grown within the company. I have learned a lot from my peers in the market. We constantly recruit for the best talent in the area, which keeps us busy."
good,"We would go in and have a meeting everyday. Just on how the business is going and where you was going to be for the day. I picked for all of the Victoria Secret stores."
good,"Awesome first mall job however, the training and realistic sales goals really doesn't meet with today's markets. Many of the sales goals go off older models of trajectory and could really use an update in their models especially how they sell their items."
good,"if you like victoria secret youll like this job. The management is ok not too great during season becuase its really busy  but they do their best. Only thing i dont like about this position is their point system sucks. Not a very good balance between life and work at all. Overall the pay is great the people are great, the security team is wonderful."
good,"Be ready to learn quickly and literally run around the kitchen. Its a very clean environment but insanely stressful. Literally you do not have time to do your job properly and have little help. Friendly atmosphere but its a job for caffeine crazed 20-somethings, not middle aged or older. Go go go go."
good,"The pay was great, but the culture is lacking.  Management was under qualified in my view, they waste a lot of resources. It was a great short term experience to gain skills, that's all."
good,Great place to work for persons with no family to attend to. Very stressful. Turnover rate very high for both monsters snd associates. Commission based very competitive.
good,High stress. Upbeat environment. Unrealistic expectations. Fun at times. Great discount. Lack of advancement opportunities. Poor training program. Good culture.
good,Great people for the most part but no advancement available and minimal increase in pay. The amount of work and your continued success in making plan doesn't equate to promotions or increase in wages.
good,At Victoria's Secret the atmosphere was very competitive as well as stessful at times of high volume sales and events. The opportunity for Full Time employee is limited to management and therefore this job is good for those looking for Part Time employment with minimum wage pay and no benefits. Perfect for students or as a second job.
good,5 out of ten because of poor management very confusing at times because there are so many leads that everyone is giving orders and only few are doing work.
good,"L Brands is a great company.  They focus a lot on giving back to the community which is amazing.  Because of the size, you tend to get lost and have little opportunity for advancement."
good,Most of management was reasonable. The holiday pay worked out great but the hours discussed in the orientation didn't match what actually occured...The pick job was fairly easy but during the season was extremely over crowded
good,"Great company to work for, with potential career growth. Great work/life balance.  Wonderful location with opportunity to travel."
good,"Good work life balance.  "
good,The company has experience a lot of change at the executive level so at the time I was currently working there were so many focuses but the customer service was the most positive experience.
good,"Typical day at work is busy, very little time for socialization or anything that isn't related to getting tasks accomplished."
good,"Hard work not worth the pay. Great bosses great benefits. Not worth the pay. You make great money during peak season but off "
good,"During peak the pay and hours are abundant. After peak, pay and hours decrease significantly. So much that I had to leave a job I really enjoyed there, and went to one I really don't like at another company, just to pay bills."
good,"management was a nightmare they were always coming and going and never on the same page."
good,"The company l brands is a good company for people who like to to hard work."
good,"I worked for L Brands in Center City Philadelphia. As this was a high concentrated area, our location was super busy at all times and this was a very fast-paced environment. Being that it is a customer service and retail setting, you must be good with customers for a position like this. My team at L Brands in Liberty Place was fun and cooperative, we worked together and all got along very well. Overall I miss the team but do not miss the low pay and rude customers."
good,"Although it's a great place for seasonal work, and to earn extra cash over the holidays. After your lack of training. Your sent out to do your job to the best of your ability. The department I was put in had pretty easy work tasks but no organization. There's no way of knowing who exactly is supervising during the day if the original supervisor you were introduced to is out for the day. Your told at orientation that you can become permanent but with all the seasonal workers coming in, there's no one checking to see how well your working. They tell you during the hiring process to report your prior engagements to your supervisors, but when you do, you learn that its a block during the holiday season and no one is allowed to take off."
good,Overall it was good and I don't think  I had a bad  experience at all. Managers try to help as much as possible. Employees are the  best makes it easier to work with.
good,The department I worked is was easy and pays well. There are plenty of hours but after peak season hours are much less. Overall it is a good temporary job for the holidays.
good,"A lot of lifting, standing, bending"
good,work is the priority.  they do not care about your happiness. only your ability to do your job. I did learn to fine tune reports and create visit summaries.  I do believe if there we had a better leader to team build we would have gotten farther.
good,Enough said with answering the questions and goin over the answers that was chosen. All in all I would say that they could up the pay cause we they deal with customers and how they come off at times
good,"I enjoyed my job when I could keep working. I worked at the VS PINK store, and management was condescending. Competitive sales is a great way to learn about customer service and skill."
good,My position is a good role to step in as an entry level associate. You will get 19 pto days for the whole year if your start date is at the beginning of the year.
good,career advancement is difficult without strong office politics in environment that is very fast paced and always changing.  Leadership is a mixed bag. some very good managers and some very poor...
good,"Poor management with a blatant disregard for their employees. If issues are brought forward to management it will be swept under the rug. Good job for someone starting out to boost their resume but the career advancement and annual raises are something. To be scoffed at. Don't plan on staying for too long without bein a ""yes man."""
good,"was a contract position - little training, contract was for 4 months, and lasted(for me) 6 weeks."
good,Felt like cameras were there to watch you than to watch for trouble. Unfortunately this was a daily feeling in this environment.
good,"Crash course for everything you need to know to run a successful retail company.  Pushes you constantly to be the best you can be and drive for results.  Very grateful for the learning and challenges I faced daily there. "
good,"As with many large, matrixed organizations associates working in silos is common. It's a difficult challenge to overcome."
good,typical day at work is to load merchandise into semi trailers all day long. hardest part of the job is being on feet all day long with insufficient amount if breaks. Most enjoyable part would be the 40% discount we recieved to various stores.
good,it was a good place to work at most of the staff was nice and helpful. i came in made shakes and stocked supplies needed for the day.
good,"Environment was positive and upbeat, with a sense of understanding and concern for associates' personal lives."
good,Typical day at work was providing logistical support by receiving merchandise and scanned into system for tracking. I learned a lot about the company and how Merchandise processing works. The hardest part of working for The Limited Brands was working third shift. No other shifts were ever available to change schedules.
good,"A typical day at work, will be coming into the store. Listening to the daily message from the managers. Clock in and run out to the assigned floor. Had to clean up after every customer, making sure all the attire are folded, aligned, straightened, etc., pleasing customers. Answering, and assisting customers with their questions on a specific item. At the same time try selling items as well as, the company credit card. Run the cash resister at times when the store will overflow with customers."
good,"Managers are allowed to let personal issues or their own egos limit your potential or block your growth as they see fit  there is  vin little fairness  people you work with can just throw you under the bus to save themselves but I guess that’s anywhere  "
good,"Environment is healthy and the staff were friendly. Management was helpful and the store meetings every couple of months let the associates be updated on new products, promotional item, and sale tactics"
good,"Got 3 hour shifts mostly and it was too much hectic at times but it somedays were fun, management was good and nice, learned how to deal with cash pretty quickly and they trained you well."
good,The metrics change every month so it’s hard to get an idea of how you’re doing. Supervisors aren’t always reliable. It’s not hard though and the pay is fine (lower than other call centers in the area but it’s a slow call center as well).
good,Invoice Audit with Huge required savings goal. The company is slow to hire so our team was never fully staffed with put a lot of work load on all members.
good,its a a okay company to work for. you get discounts on bath and body work products. Lots of overtime when it comes to peak season. You can work alot in peak then after peak they let you go and you could only work 32 hours.
good,"I would not recommend this company to anyone.  They pretend there is equal opportunity for growth but there is not.  They act like they value you, but they don't - managers rule everything.  Upper management does not change their ways and with such an evolving company, you cannot remain stagnant."
good,It is what it is a warehouse job where if you work during the holidays you will get paid fairly decent but your will work a lot. good for when looking for an actual job. Not to mention the possibility to get sent home early.
good,"I was hired for part time back room. It can be very cliquish, but most of the staff were willing to help show me the ropes."
good,I worked at the Henri Bendel of this company and it was a very fast paced environment. It was always very busy and there was always something to do. i learned how to improve my register skills and how to improve my sales.
good,"The company started off good, but then over the years the company separated home office associates from the warehouse associates and that caused some tension with both groups."
good,"great atmosphere, great people, very competitive, not enough pay for the amount of work done, short breaks , management did not care for employees, too much theft occurrence."
good,"I didn't have any career advancement when I stocked over 5 years, but best of all I was able to stay independent and accomplish some other things."
good,typically I stayed in the back was able to work in my own pace. I basically learned how to work with not to much instruction. made me better at decision making. co-workers and management basically let me work with very little interaction.. Not to hard of a job. I enjoyed working on the floor.
good,"I worked first shift, so a typical day began with a meeting that lasted about 5 minutes, then straight to the lines. Two breaks and lunch, then the day was over."
good,"At L Brands, I worked as an Assistant Merchant. The position was different every day, one day might be prepping for a display in the store, the other creating displays for the CEO of L Brands to view. The management was involved, slight micromanagement i.g. showing up unexpectedly to ensure work is being done, checking in every hour, showing progress throughout the day. The most enjoyable was the positive attitude and peers who always celebrated every event.The hardest part of the job was respecting people's title and not questioning their ideas due to their position, and with my creative thinking, I always want to challenge (respectively) outside of the box! Also, I participated in Pelotonia which was a life changing experience!"
good,"Nice experience, but you have to work very hard to advance. High level leadership is amazing, lower level managers can be difficult to work for."
good,Easy to love the brands. Systems were good but with stagnant ways of working.
good,Long work days but worth it in the end. I really didn't enjoy working until 3 in the morning and standing in 1 spot all day. But I loved the people I worked with.
good,Very interconnected office environment with a large amount of cross functional team work.
good,The overall job is a hard place to work if you are not willing to work hard.  Gaining advancement is very hard at first but once you become incorporated into the company advancement and transition is very possible and available.  
good,A lot of computer work. It seems a lot of people don't socialize in their department. Everyone just sits in their cubicles and does their work.
good,It’s a good job to have if you do not have children it’s a job that’s has high demands when it’s busy it’s really busy when it’s slow it’s extremely boring
good,"A typical day is spent supporting (and trying to achieve) the targets and goals that have been set forth by Leadership."
good,It’s an alright job. Pays good. Good people to work around. Nice clean environment. Late nights which I liked. Getting gratis. Which I loved. Not having to be around hundreds of people. It’s welcoming. Friendly. They feed you for your breaks.
good,It was a great experience working there. The pay the people and the work space was all comfortable and welcoming. The next time I could be able to work there I am if I need a job.
good,Good work environment and able to purchase items at yearly sample sale. Along with lots of opportunity to grow with the company. Set schedule and on site cafeteria was a plus.
good,"Working here is good. Also need to come out of lots of politics (which is everywhere common). "
good,During my work experience I ran into a lot of good people and was a good environment. The only thing that was bad was that the hours were too long. Also the reason why I left was because it was a seasonal job.
good,"I absolutely loved the job.  My only issue was constantly being fed false hope.  All season being told that there were plenty of positions to be offered for a permanent spot. Being told as long as your attendance  and productivity is  good and you have a supe recommendation,  then you'll be offered a permanent spot.  Hearing your Supervisor say she's giving you her recommendation to hr. Then 2 weeks later,  comes and says due to business being slower than expected,  there aren't any open positions . I was like, ""wait, what?"" Totally misleading  and very disappointing."
good,This job has a good environment with encouraging co-workers however the hours are not consistent and you never know if you'll work 20 hours one week or 3 the next. other than that the management is encouraging and will try to work with you on your goals in the company and the work expectations are realistic and not over demanding.
good,"I have confidence in job security. Advancement is very positive. "
good,Strong brands in fast paced environment.  Culture is a bit robotic and working in NY distant from Ohio HQ can be a challenge. Good people and a history of advancement.
good,I learned that you need to follow every rule for a reason usually to stay safe. there are times where it is nonstop work but once in a while it slows to a crawl. Don't work here if you are uncomfortable leaving with dust with this hardworking job.
good,"They were very competitive with pay and benefits. Slow most days, had a hard time always using all the hours. They were not great about giving managers the ability to schedule to their needs."
good,"I learned a lot about the retail industry.          "
good,"very professional work environment, I wish the pay was good enough to match that. The hiring process is a little rigorous. I remember going for a group interview and then two more interviews that followed that."
good,"Very sales-focused culture. All managers must meet hourly sales goals and keep staff informed on progress. There seemed to be a large number of people hired that didn't quite fit their job description, which made any real success difficult."
good,"I appreciate the opportunity to work for a such a diverse and established company whose brands rival the world retail place. For the chosen few, LBrands give great opportunities for its up and coming candidates."
good,I took this job as a temporary position until I was able to get another job. The working environment wasn't ideal as it was uncomfortable. I did not work here very long.
good,"It was a good place to be an intern, but just not a fit for me and my career interests. I would recommend to others as a solid company if interested in fashion/retail."
good,This is good job just for start from somewhere. also there is cold and they give you just 15 minutes to ave lunch. the most enjoyable part is when you can but new collection without any traffic and or long lines
good,it was an okay job. the management was always on the floor helping the employees and it was even hard to differentiate them from the regular employees.
good,Okay place to work seasonal. Not to sure if I would go back. 3rd shift kind of suck because we had to pick up the slack from first shift. Other than that ok.
good,I wasn't at this job very long due to the long hours. I like the environment overall. There was always a daily  huddle advising of the days activities and the job offered great benefits.
good,"Lbrands is a good place to work if you can manage to get hired. They have good benefits packages and retirement, and vacation time. The buildings are heated/cooled, and they have fall peak incentives such as extra pay and weekly gifts, advancement is possible given time and experience."
good,The people at this company are very nice.  Working taking the calls has you communicating with some very interesting people and having some nice conversations.
good,Lower management is wonderful however upper management is not. The company does give perks to their employees but it does not make up for the feeling of not being appreciated.
good,"Pulling items from shelves and sorting them to be packaged and shipped out."
good,A great place to start a career with ample room to grow.  The most enjoyable part of the job has been the people I work with and interact with.
good,Busy getting set up. That I am closterfobic. Fourth shift outbound management not friendly. Cool and hard working. Standing in a boxed area. Discount and employee perks
good,"minimum wage for an average sales job at the mall, co-workers were similar in age and working through school. Management was always in disagreement"
good,It was okay I like it go in and around 3:00 pm and worked until 11:00 or if orders was not complete we have to stay longer and they would lets us know at the last mintue
good,Working at Limited Brands. Liked my work schedule Mon-Thurs so I had my weekends but hated the mandatory overtime they put on you out the blue after already making plans or scheduling vacations.
good,"This was a great temporary assignment."
good,"long work days, can be fun, pay is fair, great benefits, poor work/life balance, worse during holidays (but that's retail)"
good,"Brand Leader for Third Party Retailers-Tween Brands, Lane Bryant. "
good,I greeted and assisted customers. Provided exceptional customer service and sales.
good,Just as good as any retail company. Focused on customer service and good track record
good,"Limited Brands is a great company. I love their products and was a loyal customer before I became a part of their management team. "
good,I spent 20 years of my life working for many divisions of this company on many levels and this company ultimately lead me to a dead end position. Corporate politics are to blame as well as the people who fill the district and some management positions
good,"Process merchandise; maintain backroom, under stock to brand standards;Replenish merchandise"
good,The company allows you to take control of your career.  But the hardest part of the job is finding work life balance.
good,"Fast-paced, good place to work. Leading retailer. I would recommend a career here."
good,I placed product in the correct location throughout the warehouse. They had a very nice cafeteria. The management was very nice.
good,"Interesting place to work. Always on your feet. Very fast paced and demanding, as retail sales tends to be."
good,"I most recently have had the opportunity to work with the Victoria’s Secret overnight team. Loading and unloading product from delivery trucks, processing merchandise and maintain the product flow for the store, and preparing the store for bi-annual sales or special events were my duties within the fast-paced environment."
good,Limited Brands was a nice place to work. Famous models would come into the store. We would get great discounts on everything new that came into the store and recieve products for free.
good,"I was the first admin hired for the new international brand, La Senza which put me in position to become a leader in the community (brand). A typical day consists of calendar management, preparing meetings with video conference or dial-in, printing materials, etc. As well as, completing travel & expense reports, booking travel arrangements, manage (departmental) office supplies, and provide support for brand events & meetings."
good,Decent job. Hurts your feet because you are not allowed to sit. Folding panties gets boring.
good,Working for Limited Brands has given be customer service and communication skills that I found essential as I strive to be the best employee I can be. The management focuses on coaching to best customer service practices and rewards employee achievement through recognition.
good,"Retail is retail - typical of all retail headquarters.  Great pay and benefits, but work a lot of hours.  Currently retail environment is unstable, so a bit a risky job."
good,I loved the company. The upper management are great!  You get great pay and a great discount as well. During holiday your friends and family are allowed to work as well.
good,"It could have been more professional. The people were nice while shopping with them, but managers were rude and unprofessional. I would say this company is for someone whom is just getting into retail for part time work."
good,Fun environment to assist customers. Lots of weekends and evenings. Too many last minute changes in promotions. Great customer service and focus on the customer.
good,"Employees don’t leave Companies, they leave Managers (Supervisor's). The environment is fill with diversity, culture and knowledge. Opportunity to move up and make a difference."
good,temp to hire. super slow through the spring months there could not garentee your 40 hours a week and you have to call in to see what your work schedule is
good,Limited Brands has its flaws and perks just like any other employer. I learned a lot working for Limited Brands. The management isn't that good but it all depends on what department you work for. They have wonderful benefits and great discounts. Overall not a bad place to work for.
good,"Been working with L Brands for a few years, some parts of the business are great, others not so much. Layoffs have now happened 2 times in 3 years."
good,There is a large discrepancy in talent across all management positions. The company stays committed to bad hires and just moves them to where they can't hurt the business. This has created a culture where the customer isn't the top priority. Overall culture is strong but HR and facility issues make it a difficult place to want to stay.
good,I loved working in the call center environment but they lack of communication with they management was too much to handle.
good,"A typical day at work involves me walking the floor and admin istering coachings or corrective actions to associates based on policy as well as team building."
good,"Bath and Body Works/ Limited Brands was a great place to work. Friendly co-workers."
good,"Limited Brands is a great company with great benefits. The days can be long, as late as midnight."
good,This is a really good place to work I was scheduled for an interview 2 days before my interview my grandmother past away. Of course I called letting them know I didnt think I would be able to make it through the interview. They then told me that is ok we are scheduling more at a later date Ill give you another call and we will get you in on that interviewing date. At this point I'm thinking ya right I'm not getting a job here 7 days later I received the call and I was in the next week for my interview. Got the job. They really think about people. The only thing is it is really hard to move up in this company because so many people have been there longer then you. Some of the managers are great but there are ALOT that are not so great. Just a little something to think about.
good,"Working for Limited Brands has turned out to be a very rewarding experience. Although it is typically demanding, especially in a Management role, the morale is typically high, and due to my particular store being high volume, the pace is rather aggressive, I've learned how to pace myself and how to fully function in my position. The hardest part of my job is working with multiple, hard and fast opinions, all the while still holding true to the expectations communicated in forwarded correspondence."
good,"Great culture and talented group of people working at Lbrands. Unfortunately, the retail industry is continuing to suffer and some of the brands within Lbrands have had a hard time finding their way back to the top. A lot of leadership change and no clear direction forward."
good,A typical day at work is beneficial and very productive as well. A lot requires movement that includes performing great tasks. The management is quite fair.
good,"Very upbeat environment, will test ability to engage with customers on a daily basis to meet and exceed goals for both sales and credit application. Super fun job for entry level job seekers!"
good,"fun place to work.  Management is encouraging, although a great challenge from upper management.  Selling to customers is the best part and making them happy.  Gratis every couple months is nice as well.  Competitive wages and for the most part treated fairly.   plenty of evening and weekends and last minute promo changes almost every night!  Overall a not a bad place to work!"
good,"L Brands allows for schedule flexibility that accommodates student life. It is easier to have hourly flexibility when you are not in a supervisor or managerial position. Opportunities to advance in position are often offered to those with strong work ethic, However, opportunities for pay promotions are not offered in equivalence to the work required."
good,if you like being yelled at my customers and told to shut up on the regular this is the job for you or if you dont have any children. The pay is great but the amount of time that is required is crazy
good,They associates are pretty decent some are a little rude and miss guiding but overall it was a decent job . They pay a minimum of $12/hr with is pretty good
good,"Benefits are amazing, work-life balance is difficult to manage. Very cut-throat and it seems the longer you are there, the more likely you are to get let-go. Lay-offs occur at least once per year, and sometimes more. Expectations for salaried employees are extremely demanding."
good,"I would go in and replenish and leave"
good,Fast paced work with extremely talented people.  Great pay and benefits. There is a lack of loyalty to employees.  During the 16 years I worked for the company I have seen a high level of turnover.
good,"It's very repetitive, I've been here for 3 years. Just too early for me to get up in the morning. I use to like the hours at first but I had a child and the early morning isn't for me anymore."
good,"Pretty typically and boring on third shift not a lot happening, get here around 11 pm and get off at 7 am we patrol the outer perimeter in vehicle, sign trucks in and out, and sit at lobby desks signing people in alarm monitoring, background checks, id badge prints"
good,"just normal"
good,My job title was called a picker which consists of me putting clothes in a cart and putting them into boxes using an RF gun. I also packed the boxes and put them on an assembly line. I worked individual but as well as with a group.
good,"Limited brands was a good company to work for. They have strong beliefs and great resources. My typical day was to keep people happy, both associates and customers. My peers were fantastic teachers, they just did not teach me everything I needed to be successful. I did have my own problems, but did not feel comfortable asking questions. Many situations were not covered in training, and I made decisions I felt appropriate. sometimes these were not similar to what my supervisors felt. My direct reports felt as they were above my level and treated me as such, with little to no respect for me."
good,There alot of honey point and close. I just pick up boxes and restock everything it that easy. Manager can be up tight but over all nice people.
good,"I enjoyed working for Brands.  The benefits are decent, which includes store discounts and gift cards.  There is work life balance by providing employees the opportunity to work from home twice a month.  They offer six summer Fridays besides your vacation time. Managers and teams were appreciative towards assistants."
good,"It is not a prerequisite to adhere to their design aesthetic, nor is necessary for what you design to be reflective of your own personal stance. All that said, I found the design to schizophrenic, changing all the time, yet familiar in its crazy."
good,"Please recognize that this company is huge, with diverse operations across the globe.  My perspective is by nature limited, so take this with a grain of salt.  It's as unbiased as it can be:"
good,Get work done in a timely correctly and in a timely manner. Lack of communication w/management. Teamwork with workers good.
good,Has great benefits and nice work schedule. You get to work with a nice small group of people and you are allowed to share you opinions and ideas with your team on things you would like to change. You have almost an unlimited amount of overtime.
good,"Have and early morning meeting before work starts. "
good,Always fun but you must be self motivated! Worked my way up from seasonal to key holder very quickly. Sometimes the sales goals can be tough but I find it a great challenge.
good,I was a temporary contractor for a month to cover someone on maternity leave as a entry level human resource coordinator. The position was fun and I enjoyed it while I was seated the opportunity. welcoming and everyone was friendly the building was very clean and nicely designed.
good,Wasn’t really a fun place cuz there wasn’t any games to play or time pass on breaks or lunch time. But we was allowed to go outside during break and lunch times for a smoke or just to chill.
good,Relaxed and fun atmosphere. Good temporary job. Flexible hours and shift. great perks. Discounts not so great. Long days on your feet. If you like to be physically on the move great place.
good,There was a manager at that job that was really hard to deal with. Almost every female worker was having problems with this supervisor. Other than that I really liked the job. I was able to work by myself and at my own pace.
good,This job was a breeze and had really good pay!! I would recommend it to anyone. The only downfall is that you start out as a seasonal employee and have to work very hard to get hired on.
good,"Great experience working in the city, commute was too great to handle everyday."
good,Working as a picker in DC5 was stressful due to numerous factors. You were expected to work as fast and accurate as possible with no regard to personal comfort. Days were long and work areas were hot and not well kept.
good,"Clean inside and allow you to use headphones , wear whatever you want and a lot of activities , has sample sale which is good for shopping and a lot of discounts and offers"
good,All around good job good work environment good people to wrk with. Breaks could have been longer but all around a good job. I would recommend friends to wrk at this job .
good,"I loved working here, great culture, good training opportunities and fantastic benefits."
good,The work was a little bit more than I expected. Very hard work but very nice environment. The employees were very nice but not very willing to help the new people due to the work being timed.
good,I really like working at the lbrands corporation the people are helpful and friendly and kind. I also learned that to always make sure. That the customer come first .
good,they let people go too easy and during the spring and summer hardly keep anyone. They let people go due to the lack of work but they divide it on shifts so if you're on a shift that has a lot of people you will most likely get let go instead of moved to a different shift.
good,"We had the shift meeting, to let us know our job assignment for the day.  How to drive the standup an put the products away.  Clean enviroment.  Stacking boxes."
good,"The back room was usually a mess and the managers were usually ornery and cruel. I was scheduled for on call, and then expected to come in even after I was told I wasn't needed. Other sales associates would just not show up and not lose their jobs."
good,The work environment is very good here. People are nice and helpful when you first stat the job. The pay is very good and I helped me make ends meet. The boss is nice.
good,"It makes you want to pull your hair out, coworkers comfortably curse around you at things and about customers, and if you're not careful you could end up breaking a lot of things and getting in trouble."
good,The company is an ok company to work for if the management team is good your in great hands. It had ok hours but really slow at times.hours get cut but hard work does weep reward.
good,I enjoyed working for the company but some of the management was hard to work for. The hours are long for the holiday season but the pay is very good.
good,"It was nice to work 10-hour days though because most of the time that meant you only worked 4 days. Sometimes in the ""holiday season"" (when I was hired on) we got overtime. I was working through Acloche so I didn't get benefits or anything. The management was okay, but I have a health condition that required me to miss work sometimes; I kept asking how many (absence) points I had and never got a response. One day after I missed work I got a call telling me not to come back."
good,"overall lbrands was a nice paying job , hours were good still peak season was over & got very slow so about a week we will only see about 25 hrs weekly . Everybody working there was nice & respectful . I would only work there around holidays & when I know they actually have work."
good,I loved working here but it was stressful.  The demand and expectations were high.  The new District Manager was on one every time she visited our store.  She was so condescending and all store managers were afraid of her.
good,"Fast-paced environment in support of distributing Limited Brand products for the peak holiday season. Acquired knowledge of use of materials provided, such as RF(radio frequency) gun, to distribute products in the time worked here."
good,The hardest part about this job is how irregular the shifts are and working weekends is mandatory. It is easy if you don't mind basically dedicating a lot of your weekends to the job. It's a fantastic job if you're in school though because of flexible work hours.
good,Good work experience to start. Biggest issue this company has is managers that have moved from either college or other departments and unsure how it runs. Alot of micromanagment and even more miscommunication. If there is any
good,"I enjoyed working with victoria secrets again with lovely employees and had a very welcoming supervisor. "
good,A typical day of work is normally no stressfull but ther are some days that can be . Most people are fun to get a long with. There is a lot of heavy lifting alot of the times. Multiple job positions to be trained for .
good,"Lbrands asset protection can be a great company to work for. It is very competitive metric driven fast paced brand.  Everyone can see your stats weekly, monthly, and yearly... so it can be pressure to perform consistently at a high level."
good,"I liked working here but it is not a job for the weak. People will cuss you out all day long and you have to be able to handle it. I unfortunately was not one of those people. They also had bed bugs pretty bad when I worked there and talking with other employees that had been there for a while, it seems like they never really address the bed bug issue."
good,I've worked here 7 years. And I enjoyed all the people and experiences I've encountered. But it's time for me to broaden my horizon. They are very humanitarian in all the charities and things they donate and give too. The company is very big .
good,"its okay to work i guess just seasonal. some team leaders give preference to certain employees, if ypu dont speaqk english you will have a hard time. if you need asap moneyu this is the place"
good,"Great job, but not for raises and promotions. Stressful and understaffed at many times. Great company and work culture. Managers do not get paid nearly enough."
good,Everyday we had a start up meeting then went to work. I learned how to voicepick .the managers were nice were easy to talk to .workplace culture was very diverse. There was no hard part about the job it was easy. Enjoyable part was during peak season they gave out gifts to us for working so hard that was nice.
good,"I enjoyed being a customer service representative at Lbrands. Being able to connect with different people and being able to help them solve their problems, overall lbrands is a great company to work for I would work there again"
good,Friendly co-workers for one of my first jobs in Ohio. Mix working environment. Great training from management. Various shifts to pick from and paid holidays.
good,I worked seasonal jobs that had early start times.  I was on my feet and moving during the whole shift.  Most of the people were friendly. Most of the people I worked with were seasonal or temporary.
good,"Looking back on my time there, the company did treat me well.  I learned a lot (SAP included) which has helped me further my career."
good,"Managing priorities to insure that company goals are met to ensure that customers expectations are met. LBrands has growth potential as company, but sometimes people panic when there is no need too."
good,Very strict on work production. Fun staff meetings. Lots of incentives to meet daily quotas.
good,"Very good place to work.Tthe Management is very helpful they make sure that everyone are safe environment and inclusion, equality is one of them priority ."
good,I enjoyed working for L Brands. I specifically worked for the Victoria Secret portion of the call center and overall it was a really nice job. My supervisor I had was amazing and she made the job and learning how to do it that much easier and she was always there to answer any and all questions you may have
good,"The Company can do better for the World, they produce too much waste. However, it is a nice place to work in, little perks* such as discounts and free merchandise."
good,"I really like the job. it was fun, easy and coimfortable. Loved the people around me. Dress code was fair for the season and it was great. I did not have a problem at all working there."
good,I loved the people I worked with and the pay was more than fair. Wasnt super thrilled that my shift get left out of the activities alot. Enjoyed assisting customers with the experiences
good,I really enjoyed working for Lbrands because they always had something for you to look forward to or work hard for. The location was very nice and having a cafe on site with healthy food options was a huge plus.
good,I loved working there. Great staff and they look after their employees. Job advancement is not something you look forward to working at Limited Brand.
good,Sometimes it can be very enjoyable interacting with customers;  but can be stressful when angry customers call for any problem they may have. You also can work lots of overtime and you can get company rewards.
good,"I like it it’s very nice and well organized. I didn’t like the fact it was hot all the time, the work was really easy and comprehensive, we were allowed to listen to music so that was a plus for me"
good,L Brands is a good place to work and it supports continuous education and also supports diversity. One of the best HR which actually cares about the team that they hired.
good,"Fast pace,  a lot of hours with weird shifts. Great food but will take all your check. Snd a lot for people of all raises. Pays every 2 weeks, have to get badges before starting or cant get in."
good,"I worked with them in a variety of capacities and positions.  They were always willing to help me find a spot at one of their locations in new town.  I was able to advance whenever possible, and they were great at accommodating the times I needed to step down."
good,"Great people and work place. Nice facilities. Good management. I liked the culture. Low pay. Tedious and sometimes boring work."
good,"You must be exceptionally smart and talented to join the L Brands team. Even seasoned professionals will learn more about retailing, business and brand development from this remarkable company with a 50+ year tradition of influencing and winning in retail."
good,"On an everyday basis, work was steady with customers and inventory stock. It taught me valuable customer service skills and management. Workplace culture was fun and vibrant with a load of different personalities to endure."
good,"Bottom line is speed and accuracy. When working in a retail based business, the customer comes first no matter what end of the business you are in. Every decision you makes needs to have the customer in mind."
good,It was fast pace assembly line work.  Stand while you are working.  Got paid weekly and offered a great discount. Would recommend to work there.  Very nice people to work with.
good,I enjoyed watching people grow to there full potential and promoting within. Customer relations was very important to me as I was the first and last impression on that person.
good,"This position is for those that are fast, and fast on their feet! You see all the products that L Brands offer as a whole company.Overall a great company to work for."
good,Learning different aspects of the company and being able to perform different job duties. I really enjoyed facilitating classes and training new hires. Taking inventory as well as being on the safety team.
good,"There are a lot of opportunities at L brands for an individual to branch out into. As long as you work hard, you will get noticed by leadership and move up quickly."
good,"I love being a part of the LBrands family and am proud to work there.  It's an exciting and creative place to work.  Love how involved they are with giving back to the communities."
good,"I worked 16 years for LBrands and would still be there today if my position had not been eliminated. It's a great company to work for, high energy, fast paced, productive and supportive. Hard work is recognized and rewarded. My co-workers were amazing!!"
good,"It was ok and I like working with LBrands. I would like more experience with LBrands, being that the employees are great."
good,"Nice co-workers and managers, structured organization, regular touch-base meetings, scheduled deadlines, fast-pace, frequent data analysis and excel-pulls"
good,"On your feet most of the day. Friendly environment. Nice people. fast paced environment. Good pay. Good,  supportive management."
good,helped me know children better. put me in a right state of mind when working with people. showed me how to react in a properly way when a child gets out of control and helped with my customer service
good,Friendly co workers and managers.  Faily easy job tasks.  Lack of appreciation from corporate level for store associates.  Should have entire store professionally cleaned once or twice a month
good,LBrands let me learn the very basics of professional life. I got to experience the best of work life balance. Co-workers are very co-operative and share knowledge to make the best of you.
good,"Company spin-off - split IT from SAP in OH to MS-AX in Hong Kong."
good,Very fun. Customer interactions are nearly always the focus. The rapport between associates and management is strong. The team seems unified in their efforts and everyone is supportive. Upper management is involved and supportive while working directly with management in the stores to accomplish goals and maximize business.
good,"Love this job, very good company to work for. "
good,All associates are friendly.  Information is shared when needed.
good,"A typical day at work includes greeting customers. Making sure they have a great customer experience even if they are coming in for a free  pair of underwear to getting one or two bras. While being at this workplace, I have learned to be a better leader. Associates and lead management get along well although everybody has their moments. The hardest part of the job would probably be trying to sell to customers when there is not a lot of people coming into the store. The most enjoyable part of the job is coming into contact with different kinds of people and really making their day."
good,Work was repetitive but slightly enjoyable. The hardest part was being on your feet all day.
good,"a typical 10hr work day worked 6 days a week. didnt learn anything new. management was unorganized."
good,i worked in picking garments on hanger and gift cards. this was a fun and friendly environment we got rewards for high productivity i loved working in gift cards
good,"Responsible for providing great customer service skills, being very personable, memorizing the knowledge of the Victoria's Secret catalogues, taking only inbound calls, placing customer's clothing order, upsetting by suggesting items to complete the outfit.  Responsible for answering any questions that the customer may have had about a previous order that they placed, and transferring calls for the season. Management was very nice and professional. the hardest part of the job was trying to upsell to the customers, but I really enjoyed taking calls "
good,"A typical work day would be log in,get your apron on and name tag, get out on the floor find a manager and ask what your to do that day (for seasonal employees). "
good,True Corporate environment .
good,"Work in a distribution center kitchen, I prepare serve and assit others with the preperation of foods. Using food saftey and sanitation standards keep a clean and safe environemnt for fellow co-workers as well as the customers."
good,The company has improved over the years in providing competitive pay. It seems the employees are more valued over the past couple of years. Pay is fair and paid time of is excellent.
good,This job was an okay job it was a fun job but the hours were very limited and they were not very flexible with wanting to give more hours when I would ask them
good,"L Brands is a good place to work but it’s mostly depending on what department you are placed in because in spite of flow to work standards, staying power may rely on your popularity with your department."
good,"I worked there seasonal for a year and I would and possibly plan on going back for another season. It is an easy job, some days. It fluctuates between being so bored that you want to cry, to being so constant that you want to cry. It seems like there are no inbetween days at this job. Overall the atmosphere is very High School like if you find yourself associating with the wrong coworkers as you will meet hundreds of people. I would recommend this to anyone wanting to start a savings or get ahead who has time to dedicate to working and can shake off customers that speak to you so poorly because they are hiding behind a screen."
good,Had a good time working at the company but at my location room for growth was a bit complicated. That is why I departed. I'd say it's a great stepping stone into bigger and better things.
good,It was a fun and new environment. Good opportunities for advancement within the company as opposed to hiring outside of the company. not like a normal retail.
good,"While I was working there I worked 6 days a week and at least 10 hours a day and pay was $14.50. But overtime pay was pretty good, overall not a bad place to work"
good,"I enjoyed working there, the leads just need to be more humble about position title, and communicate better with merchandise handlers and other employees."
good,"Because this original assignment was intended for temporary employment, my review will be just as brief. I enjoyed the work and the clean environment. Enjoyed the pay as well as the diverse workforce. Only issue i had was the early hours during the peak season. Thinking back, if i was better prepared for the hours, this would have been the perfect fit for me."
good,"Working at L Brands warehouse is very tiresome but if your willing to work those hours it would be a good job to settle down and raise a family with. I learned that having a job there will difficult and a bit stressful due to hours and management. Management is quite quirky and unorganized, things get to one place and another place wont even receive info until the last moment. I can say I did enjoy the pay for my first job in the worforce"
good,fun place to work; i love the company outing and benefits and discount. overtime was good as well. I wish being able to move up in the company was more easier and equal to associates.
good,I really enjoy all of my coworkers but some of the customers are abusive towards us. I enjoy my managers and it was a great experience to be a part of the community.
good,"Good Place to work  no TAX benefits, Finance team is really bad when it comes to this company. no onsite opportunities. "
good,There are many things you can do within this company if selling is not your strong suit. The pay is more than minimum wage and overall it is a good working environment.
good,"Good company to work for, great people, sometimes lack of alignment and communication and low job security as they like to do ""revolving doors"" every 4-5 years."
good,"Great work environment. "
good,Fast paced environment with competitive wages. Exclusive merchandise with long hours. Fun staff on board nice friendly environment. The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting your package quota for the day. I would definitely say the hardest part was the grueling long hours.
good,"They mainly hire seasonal but if you get hired on, the pay and benefits are really good. Very clean facility and management takes care of the issues if found."
good,"nice warehouse job, the hardest thing about the job is standing for 10 hours at a time. The other workers stay to their selves allowing you to work and focus on your assigned task."
good,"The brand cares about their associates on all levels and it is evident in the way they pay their teams."
good,"Good work environment which is Fast-paced, challenging and lot of opportunities to learn and grow. Very hard to move-up the ladder."
good,"The company overall is great and has many benefits such as a solid culture and a true desire to do the right thing. Development of their employees is the biggest opportunity, as they tend to hire externally to fill voids rather than train high performing internal talent."
good,"Learned alot"
good,"Fun place to work, advancement opportunities, good store managers.  Learned a lot about retail sales, scheduling, and managing others."
good,"I have done just about every job in the store in the almost five years working for Victoria's Secret. Starting as a sales associate I sold merchandise and credit, and operated the register. Customer Sales Lead running two hour sales shifts of anywhere from 2-15 sales associates. Backroom Lead and Merchandise Flow Supervisor, which had me in charge of processing shipment and keeping the sales floor fully stocked. Temporary Assignment Position as Beauty Category Supervisor had me designing and running floorsets in the Beauty section and running sales shifts. My co-workers were great and I loved my managers."
good,Always upbeat and always tons of things to do. Great people.
good,Excellent training provided. Opportunity for advancement.
good,Great professional attire at reasonable clothes. Little advancement once in managerial role.
good,Be prepared to work hard and hustle here but the people are good and you will learn a great deal in a short time. Work days are busy but you will be exposed to a great deal. They encourage shadowing as well when time allows.
good,"I love it here I actually work from home! Pay went up recently to make living more affordable. Flexible hours can change preference after 90 days, paid training, benefits, very nice cafeteria."
good,"A typical work day for my specific job of me picking was to walk around the picking area of the warehouse and pick items to put into bins. The way we knew which items and bins to choose was by listening to our computer systems given to us to tell us which item and bins to select. All the co-workers are nice to each other, for the most part, and management is great."
good,"- Very busy place, especially during the holiday season."
good,"Most of the days you walk in, clock in, put on your gear, attended your morning meeting then get to work. It’s a very independent work environment. You don’t really talk to people besides when others ask questions, or during breaks."
good,Lbrands is a good place to work. I enjoyed my time learning developing and the flexible schedules are great. The PTO is awesome. The only con is that sometimes the feedback given is watered down and you are not sure where you stand.
good,A typical day has a huge business plan for sales. Working with the customers is my favorite to find the perfect scent! I love the quick-pace atmosphere. There is always something to do so there is not a lot of down time which I appreciate.
good,"Fast paced, high demand, room to grow and opportunity for advancement. Leaders in the community and volunteer work is highly encouraged. Flexible schedule if needed. Great benefits."
good,"It's a fun, relaxed place to work as long as everyone is doing their part. Team work really does make the dream work at L Brands. It's the only job I've ever left and deeply regretted...if they called me tomorrow to come back I would move back there so fast it's not even funny."
good,"LBrand's is a fantastic company to work for, but the hours are very demanding. I enjoyed this job, but had no time for my friends or family because of my hours. This is a very good job if you do NOT have a family."
good,A work place that is full of people who have passion for the brand and customer. Opportunity to learn the ins and outs of retail with good employee benefits.
good,L Brands written culture is fantastic. They onboard and build their staff to provide the best customer service. The commission structure can be revamped but over all great company to work for.
good,"Company said no phones in work area, this was always overlooked by all including management. Some people not willing to listen to instructions. A few people not doing all assigned jobs."
good,"I loved working here. The people are wonderful and the best benefits. You are required to work long hours during holiday, and peek hours. I missed out on allot of time with my kids and family."
good,"I was in the Finance department. The atmosphere is very nice. People come and go all the time. Unless you know someone there don't expect to last over two years, even though I worked there for 3"
good,"Lots of energy required on a daily basis to keep yourself motivated. Learning on the job in terms of building fast connections based on the sales model of Best @ Bras. Managing tills and also managing store processes in the absence of the Manager. Working towards achieving daily, weekly and monthly sales goals. The hardest part of the job was multi-tasking. The most enjoyable part was when a customer leaves happy or returns just to thank me for the service and assistance."
good,"Good company to work for, user friendly environment. never bored, company was always forward thinking, getting faster focused and more frugal."
good,"Working as a Safety Service Officer was a fairly easy job and was decent pay for a single person with no kids. The benefits were WONDERFUL. Full time core employees start off with 17 days PTO. "
good,"Good team spirit, average happiness for management. The management always, try new technology, which is cool. I was exposed new caching technologies."
good,"The work place is very fast paced, intense, and deadline driven.  If you are not organized, this work environment will eat you alive.   Great management team and I would recommend it to a friend."
good,"Working retail was very fun. This company had many different employees working for them at once so it was a good opportunity to meet new people and learn new things. The downside to this was that we got very short work shifts, about three hours at a time sometimes. It made things very difficult for me since i lived farther away than most. I almost felt like i was paying more in gas to get to work than what i was making sometimes. other than that it was a very fun and fast paced work environment. The management was always very supportive and helpful and always gave constructive criticism rather than pointing out flaws. I would work for them again as long as i could get more hours."
good,"Directly supervise non exempt associates"
good,"Culture was great, but work/life balance can be difficult.  Management can be somewhat unprofessional/political. Potential for personal and career growth is there."
good,Handle design projects. Learned different creative ideas. From many creative people in the fashion industry learned from people who set up and creative things in the Victora's Secret fashion show. Management was good I always meet my deadlines and always worked well with my team. The hardest part of the jobs was sometimes their where extra hours and sometime doing other peoples work but that wasn't really hard. My job was enjoyable from many perspectives I was doing what I like and what I'm talented at so my job was over all good.
good,The opportunity at The Limited Brands is good but not great. Advancement opportunity is possible but it's not clearly laid out. The pay is ok but for the work that is being done its not what it could be. For every positive there is a negative in every aspect of the job but the discount...which is great for a woman or for women in your life.
good,I enjoyed my time with Victoria's Secret. It was not easy and at times I worked more hours than there were in a day. The discount was great and so was the team I worked with. My district manager took time to really get to know me.
good,Limited Brands does its best to be environmentally friendly and customer-focused.
good,very nice place to work the people there were very nice nice break areas the staff was so great i wish i could have worked for the company a little bit longer. i was just a temp but they treated me like i was full time if i ever moved back to that area i would love to do more in the company.
good,Great place to work and learn about the retail industry with very engaging brands. Treat employees very well and help foster growth and development for career advancements.
good,"LBrands offers a good pay for the work. Although first shift starts very early, the good thing is your day is done sooner. The benefits package once you sign on permanently are great."
good,"LBrands is a great place to learn ang grow.  You get the opportunity to meet a lot of people with similar passion and drive.  The majority of the people I worked with have been with the brand for over 10 years, that does say a lot about the company."
good,"Leadership is the most important part of working with a numerous team, did matter if you were late, you get the job done and gain the respect of being a risk taker. Being a leader taught me to be more independent with my current work, schedule, and as a Person."
good,The job was great and easy and great pay but I had no time for school work. I am in school to be an orthodontist and have a lot of homework. The job was great though.
good,"I loved working with Lbrands, I wish they had distribution centers closer than Ohio, however I am able to work in the stores here such as Victoria's Secret or bath and body works"
good,"Disrespectful management for temps, but overall FT employees are treated good. Very fast paced, very little training before being left on your own. Need to have more organization in the work areas"
good,"It is a job that will challenge you.  Not your everyday job at the mall.  A great place to learn how to ""sell"".  There is lots of competition among sales associates, and large goals to achieve to make more money."
good,"I worked here seasonally for the winter months especially during the Thanksgiving and Christmas holiday. I was in the picking department. At times, the work was light but during peak periods, it could get busy. However, I worked there before and was used to what was to be expected out of this job. The shift leads that were assigned to your group for the one week training were really helpful as they made sure you got the skills down. The work culture was of a typical warehouse/distribution center but they made sure you were accommodated to fit your needs."
good,Wanted you to do a lot while working with 3 different problems. Asked you to do more than what we were being paid for. I loved working with the third shifter. Management was very judgmental at times.
good,This job there was a lot that went into it and the management wasn't as great as it could have been there were multiple different people but everyone wasn't on the same page
good,In management it is amazing but if you have a team member who isn’t in it for everyone to benefit and in it for themselves it is hard to have a good experience always looking over your shoulder.
good,They provide paid training a wonderful cafeteria catering they are wonderful people to work for the only bad thing I can say about it as he if you don't have transportation to get to work and back due to the overtime and the way the hours are scheduled then you're going to be pretty much Sol
good,Every day was something new and challenging. The job is fast paced and can be a little overwhelming. Most of the people you work with are very helpful.
good,Its a great place to work.  With major hours to add during season for all departments the people are nice. The atmosphere was great and you learned a lot in training.
good,I would recommend working for LBrands. The Kettering location is 24/7. During the holidays you are extend to at least fifty hour work weeks. They like to give away a lot of prizes and that helps with moral.
good,With my role being seasonal i didn't take it as serious as i should have. They work with you as far as attendance and are understanding of things going on outside of work.
good,I loved the work environment. The workers are driven to succeed every day with their goals and exceeding them. Coworkers are amazing and fun to work with. I think communication could improve within the managing positions because there were times I got told a couple different things which made my job more difficult.
good,"it is hard to get full-time but if you get full-time the benefits and vacation time is good.it is fast pace. a fun place to work."
good,"Great company, great culture , very fast paced. This was a good starting place, I worked as a supervisor in the DC and while I love the company, the second shift 12 hour days has become a lot."
good,"Despite my time at the Limited being rather... limited, outside of the pay the company was a pretty good one to work for. Managers were supportive, customers were mostly kind. It was a shame to see the company go under."
good,I worked for Limited Brands three different times over the years and I'd have to say it has been the most clean warehouse I've ever worked for. Just about every department in any of the DC's is very easy to work in and the pay is doable. If you don't have an issue working for a company that changes rules and policies frequently they this may be the job for you.
good,"the company is a FAST Paced and success driven machine."
good,The associates there made the work place a fun place to be. Most of them knew how to work together wile of course others didn't. Over all it was a great experience.
good,Your day is pretty repetitious. Working on smaller teams helps build loyalty to the company brand and makes your days more exciting. Company offers great pay and excellent benefit packages including 401K with company match.
good,Good solid retail company that is always re-inventing itself.  Talented individuals overall.  Management can be pulled in many directions and blue chips are aggressive.  Division and department direction is not always consistent.
good,"This is a great place to work if you are still in college. The job is easy and the pay as well as the benefits are great. However, unless you plan on moving up in the company which may be tricky this is not a place to stay at after completing a degree."
good,"It was an ok place to work. I didn't have steady hours and requesting off was very difficult sometimes. How many hours you get to work is based off of how much money the store is bringing in. For example, if we have a $3,000 day and are down $500, they will cut two hours of someone (or a couple workers) shifts."
good,"Supervisors are nice, but when work is slow hours get cut tremendously. As a responsible adult it can become hard to maintain bills with less hours on paychecks."
good,I would recommend LBrands to most anyone.  The company values and fundamentals are prevalent.  Leadership development is a focus.
good,"Typical day at work, clock in, go to your spot open boxes put them away, and when your done go help someone else at so we all can get done faster."
good,"Limited Brands is a good company to work for.  Management was good when I worked there.. Not much job security... Heavy emphasis on selling and expanding sales.  Great recruiting, staffing and training practices."
good,"Excellent company to work for.  Made it simple to know what to drive and focus on."
good,This company is wonderful to work for when you are a single mom. It is also a great opportunity to gain experience and advance your future.
good,"Productive, friendly"
good,L Brands is a great place to work. Employee benefits are offered to all associates of the company. Management does an excellent job of employee review and is very helpful with assisting in potential advancement within the company.
good,"My experience at L Brands although stressful definitely gave me the knowledge and training I needed to further my career as a manager. "
good,"typical day very very busy non stop movement"
good,"Working for Limited Brands, Inc. (Victoria's Secret) was a great experience.  I started working as a part-time associate in college and when I graduated  I got promoted to management.  I would then have to maintain daily/weekly/monthly sales goals.  I did the scheduling, floor sets, and merchandise flow.  The hardest part of the job was the floor sets because often the merchandise would not be shipped in yet, and yet the most enjoyable part of the job was the floor set because it was great to change and set up the store differently every few months.  I learned much about setting and meeting sales goals and how to train others to have an effective team."
good,Excellent company to work for. Great place for career advancement and learning from the top company in the retail industry. Company is very strict on corporate policy.
good,"I was always placed at the front of store to attract customers. This company always has a pro-mo. So I expounded on group selling by occasionally yelling from front of store "" buy 3 get 3 free."" this made me aware that most often people are to occupied in there own business to notice the promotions in front of the store. But when they hear it they seem to be attacted to its chaos and enter the store. This created numbers and sales. So I was well liked and so I enjoyed the stores successes as well as my own."
good,This was a fun place to work and I made lasting friendships during my tenure there.
good,"The company has great benefits. But hard to get 40 hours.  There is not much advancement with in the company.  works around home life tho. "
good,i loved the work just didn’t like the hours. the people there were very diverse and nice the hr department was always there to help if needed. the manager was always there to make sure we were in a happy work environment.
good,I loved the environment but it was too much pressure on its employees. Closing hours were very tough as well and employees did not leave til very late.
good,Poner un salario acorde a la dinámica de trabajo que es rápida y fuerte. Dar más horas de trabajo con un mínimo para un part time de 20 hrs. Dar más opciones de promoción y mínimo de beneficios al part time(vacaciones pagas)
good,Not enough time in the day to complete the requirements of the job.  The job is ever changing and evolving.  You will be challenged and learn time management and how to deligate and follow up.
good,I love the atmosphere at Lbrands. There are a lot of great people at this company. Only down side is there is little room to grow on the AP team you will be passed over for promotions.
good,"It is a wonderful place to work!  If you love people, then this job is definitely for you! It is a combination of sales, administrative, and customer service work.  It is very enjoyable!"
good,The messages are always changing alot of time ypur messages will not know there job at all you get a good amount of time off there and the hours are good
good,"For what it's worth, L Brands is a great place to learn in whatever role you're in.  There are tons of learning and development courses that are offered to employees that help you excel in your job and grow as a leader, and that's what keeps me coming to work everyday.  There are also a lot of great people here.  What I don't like is that we spend a lot of time in meetings, there is a lot of busy work, and in that sense we aren't being focused, fast or frugal, which are the three things we are supposed to be at all times."
good,"I enjoyed it, would go back. It's seasonal, can be hard to make permanent. there's no time clock grace period at some of the distribution centers, hours can be cut but the pay rate is good. Overtime available. I was there during peak season"
good,Bath and Body works really is a great place to work. Like most jobs it gets stressful at times but the culture is fun and exciting. We got a lot of free stuff and always smell good.
good,It felt like going into the past when it came to technology but outside of that it wasn't bad. Pay could be better. I would say that if they want to advance in the digital age than they are going to have to adopt DevOps as not just a marketing term but an actual process.
good,"My experience was great, the hours were just unrealistic for me since I have kids. If I could've gotten a different schedule I would have never left! Everything was great but the hours."
good,"Great co-workers. Good to have an outgoing positive attitude. They had this stupid ""conversion"" statistic to monitor customer flow and purchases which made it difficult for the store to profit based on unrealistic goals and repercussions for not meeting those goals. Other than that the job was fun and helped me grow as a people person."
good,"The company hires during the summer before Holiday season begins and everyone is considered a seasonal employee, however, if they need to keep people on due to the high turnover rate, or you did a great job, they will offer you a permanent position around January. I worked there for nearly two years and was given the opportunity for advancement around 1 year, however, everyone is scheduled to work 50 hours a week during their Holiday season which is from right before Thanksgiving to after the new year, so don't expect to have the Holidays off. On the other hand, L Brands compensates very well. They always have some kind of contest going on with bonuses, especially around the Holidays, so you can easily make upwards of $5,000 in a month. For Live chat agents, you are expected to handle 3 customers at once and I would strongly advise being as nice as possible to every customer. For this company, THE CUSTOMER RULES and that is very important."
good,"The work is split mostly into two seasons. The majority of the year is relatively consistent and predictable work, but during the 4 months or so of the peak holiday season, the job can become extremely stressful. The majority of the work that is done is done during the middle months of peak season with a moderately quick ramp up and ramp down time."
good,"it is ok for a student work..or as a start. for a short period of time it was ok, but I do not think it is a job for a long time...you can make money if you are a good seller, if not...than...you should look for other job"
good,The entire work environment is very conducive to work and safety of associates are strictly adhere to.
good,"Great company if you're looking for a life outside of work. Although the company is very competitive, you're offered a generous amount a PTO from you first day working (19)."

good,a workplace with strong culture and very good understanding of the retail business. Pioneers in the fashion retail segment.  The India center to strategic to their IT and Analytics processes.  A technology focused and fun work place to work
good,"Overall working here was a life experience regardless of what you end up doing. I loved working for limited brands either through BBW or VS, both places has their perks. The company is always growing and developing, so they will always want to grow and develop their people. As always not not everyone will see eye to eye which is going to happen anywhere you work. As long as you have great communication skills, are willing to work extra hours when they need you and keep a positive attitude you will enjoy your life here. If you truly take passion in working for this company it will teach you many things about how to provide excellent customer service and amazing products."
good,"the third shift was an easy schedule. This was my first warehouse job and i learned how to pick and pack, work in induction. Management was friendly and willing to help. All of my co workers were friendly and the environment was easy going. The hardest part of the job was  would have to be the slow days when there wasn't much work. The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting our numbers for the night or finishing all of our labels on time, and being able to listen to music while you work."
good,Working there was ok except for it being a seasonal position and also there were no benifits because it's a seasonal position and I'm looking for something permenant.
good,The people here were very helpful in teaching me more about the packaging industry. I was given a lot of hands on experience and a lot of control on certain programs that were being launched. Management was great. Some days there was an overload of work from many people but they were able to understand if I needed some help getting the work done.
good,"Job functions vary from day-to-day, and there is never a dull moment.  Depending on location, managers can be accountable for anywhere from 10-50 employees."

good,"I have learned a lot working in a small Ecommerce team at La Senza. I have experienced great leadership, whom has taught me how to grow within my position. I love working on photo shoot sets for the Ecommerce team and help produce great product for our site."
good,We are more than a company. We are a family. They have good opportunities and Internships. The best in customer service and they maintain you active to exceed the goals
good,A typical day at work begins with a team meeting usually where we'll have a team breakdown in which you'll learn which designated area you will be working for the shift. They allow us to wear headphones during our shift. Pretty chill place to work
good,"My typical day at work was working with clothes either ticking, packing and counting them at the same time. I gaining a lot of retail knowledge and my co-workers were very freindly and supportive. the hardest part of this job was the standing on your feet all day which wasn't even that big of a deal. I enjoyed very part of this job and had no problem working for Limted Brands just that i was't getting my full hours all the time, either i work four hours or was told not to come at all to work"
good,nice management team and good communication. Good company to work for and good potential company. flexible and work/life balance
good,"Great because they put safety before anything, great team work. hardest part was sometimes not being able to help the other co wokers complete their task on time, i would the the easiest was the job itself. Once  you grasp the basics it becomes second nature."
good,"I enjoyed going in everyday and working with everyone, talking to customers.  "
good,"Typical day--design review meetings, fittings, collaborations with cross functional teams such as merchandising team, designing product, researching newest trends."

good,Excellent retail company to work for with great opportunities
good,The average day at Limited was very busy and went fast. Management team were always helpful and fairly easy to work with. Co-Workers there were mostly good people who would help out whenever needed. The hardest part of the job is meeting productivity requirements. The thing I enjoyed the most there was how nice and clean they kept the building I worked in.
good,"i loved working there everybody was like a family , was always friendly.. the most enjoyable part was meeting new people.. i learne how to work the other end of retail."
good,Manage a team of desktop analyst who support virtual and physical Windows computers and Apple computers.
good,"After clocking in through the computer system associates grab the essential ""tools"" i.e tape measure, head set, fit cards. Listen to the coaching message and report to the Customer Sales Lead for a warm up. Which consisted of sales plan goals, focus for the day and what we could impact on customer overall satisfaction report."
good,Id say its one of the best jobs i have ever had. Love the people that work there it makes the day go by fast. management was vary good. only bad thing is that it was a seasonal job.
good,"Auntie Anne's is a great company. The pretzels are fun to make and the employees are (generally) really easy-going and accepting people that make up a great crew. Also, if you're over 18 you automatically earn $9.40 an hour. Another great thing is that after any amount of time you can begin training to become a shift leader."
good,Everyone is nice and they care about you and your everyday life. They have morning workouts and stretches and love getting you awake and ready for the work day.
good,"nice work place learning and good managers"
good,"I was hired as a Seasonal Supervisor. I enjoyed the work and the people, very friendly, and welcoming. Great experience, and L Brands looks good on any resume."
good,I have to say that I enjoyed my time at Lbrands. I would recommend others to apply there. The only thing I didn’t like was that you start off as a seasonal employee with hopes of becoming permanent staff. That leaves it hard to depend on for longevity in the beginning... but overall good company.
good,"L Brands has given me the chance to change my life. Before this job I was in a horrible career that I hated. L Brands gave me stability, a fairly compensated position, great benefits, and the feeling of working for a company that cares. I only wish I had the proper requirements to move up within my department faster as I feel like I'm stuck in my position for awhile."
good,"Great place to work overall, good benefits, multiple levels of management, advancement available and a team environment. Starting pay is low depending on campus and building."
good,It’s a good company to work for. They were very helpful when my son was born and provide me with ways and tools to raise my family. The management team helps the employees and doesn’t just sit there.
good,"Pros: Many opportunities for growth, open-minded culture, high energy workplace, mentorship opportunities provided. "
good,"a lot of fun and opportunities , company continues to grow each day."
good,Lots of projects going on concurrently. The pace of change is quite fast and work life balance suffers as a result. The company is great at giving back to the community.
good,Great place to work. Only issue is when you are a contractor hard to get a full time position. overall solid place to work to get started. Hopefully this helps

good,very nice job fun to work at good hours if i cold go back i would it was very easy and stress free . i use to love going in i worked 3rd shift so it was very cool
good,"It was a nice place too work,everyone was friendly.I like their products and the discounts.The hours were alittle early but it was ok.I liked picking and want too learn other departments."
good,I loved working for Limited Brands. They treated their employees great there and you made good money. The only reason I left is because I moved. 10/10 great place.

good,not an easy job in any role you are in. must be a hard dedicated worker to company. Great benefits for all employees and management is fair with life balance issues
good,Not a horrible company to work for. There are discounts to make up for the huge mark-ups on the products-they also work at Victoria's Secret. There are a lot of products so memorizing everything is difficult but not impossible.
good,The work is tedious but fulfilling once you see the results.I would. continue to work with this company but at this point in time I am looking for change of environment .
good,"The company is generally good to work for, we have a faced paced culture and are always looking at how we can be better. All associates are encouraged to constantly challenge the status quo and find ways to change the company even if it is in their own role."
good,"Picking up merchandise and loading on the dock."

good,There was never a dull moment working at L Brands. I always had something to do so I was not just standing around. My coworkers were very friendly and helpful to me. The easiest part of the job was being able to work at your own pace. The hardest part was meeting the daily quota everyday.
good,"Never worked for a company with such an amazing culture. Teams work very closely together, and support each other 100%."
good,I interned with the Communications department and got great experience. I wish there was room for advancement onto an entry-level position.
good,"working directly with the public, managing payroll, scheduling, organizing and leading visual standard projects, ordering supplies, and tracking inventory. training and managing staff."
good,"Sometimes our team or department meetings happen during lunch time, especially if some issues arise and need an urgent attention to have either temporary or permanent resolution. During such given incident, we gather with our lunch together and start giving ideas and suggestions. We didn't feel like we are working because it feels like friends gather around having conversation. And with this approach the stress was eliminated which helps a lot to bring out more positive results and everyone become productive."
good,"A typical day at working was racing against the clock to process all merchandise within the work shift.  I learned about retail, but not only that more about how women's retail is so very different from men's retail.  From different sizes to the delicacy of fabric, it can be a challenge finding what a woman needs.  "
good,it was great wish i could come back. good people and no problems there at tha limited
good,"I do a lot physical lifting, stocking and working line. Flexible hours and knowledgeable management. Makes the job more pleasant. I have learned from people of different cultures. The drive distance to and from the company is my hardest part of my job. Socializing with my co-workers."

good,Company gives a good training emphasizing in product knowledge and good customer service skills. Very competitive and very stressful sometimes when working with sales goals and performance overall
good,"All in all, a nice starting place. Seasonal hours are poor and management wast not the best. Coworkers were sweet and gratis/commissions were a perk. Breaks were mostly forgotten about in my case and only got a lunch in the 3 months I worked due to the lack of hours."
good,"You can wear casual clothes. Relaxed but fast paced. Very high turnover in employment, promote very fast and it was ok just too demanding for a woman my age. The hardest part is you sometimes get calls that are not really job related, like from creepy guys."
good,LBrands has a highly driven and focused work environment. There can be some ambiguity as it is a retail setting and projects can move quickly and evolve at the drop of a hat. Overall it was a positive group to be part of.

I learned to connect with customers and make their purchases fun and easy. Management encouraged employees to help customers as best possible and make the experience ""all about HER""."
good,The limited Brands as a whole is a company that puts focus on training to ensure you have the knowlege to tservice customers. LB is a great company to get a start and learn the customer service world and get impeccable training.

good,A typical day is a steady work flow. There is always something to do. I learned that you can earn respect from having a willing attitude and asking questions. The management on my side of the building has been good to me. My supervisor supports me a lot towards getting a future in graphic design. The manager keeps to himself somewhat but when I talk to him he is nice. My co-workers are like a family. They are a good team because we run a tight shift. The hard part of the job is exceeding the exceptions of the jobs we take on. I'm no good with numbers so the computer system is difficult to learn for me.  The most enjoyable part is realizing that we are all in it together with different stories. Thank you.
good,The job at L Brands was a good job because I learned how to use a RF unit and how to stack boxes.The management were very professional and always gave advice when needed. The job also insisted of unloading trailers and running automatic conveyors.

good,I like L brands there nothing bad about L brands you come in get the work done and everyone's happy and i just love the vibe everyone getting the work done not joking around
good,"A typical day of work at L Brands consisted of beginning of shift meetings/break-downs of what we would be doing for the present day, loading semi trucks with boxes (ranging from 35lbs.-90lbs), categorize incoming merchandise for outbound loading. Working for this company I learned working well with others there is no task too big to complete and overall just a better understanding of how things work behind the scenes of retail companies. Management was very cool at L Brands I had three supervisors and a shift leader. They all were helpful and engaging with everyone on our seasonal shift. The hardest part about the job (at least starting out) would be loading trucks for outbound runs... but after a couple weeks I quickly adjusted to the physical and timely expectancy of completing all outbound tasks."
good,Hometown bank feel but lack of internal control admittingly is the reason for the recent sale of the business as not first financial bank.
good,terrible management and corporate. the boss is leaving in about a month and only a couple associates know. they're also bringing in someone who has trash talked the store on social media in the past.
good,Great company to work for. Fast paced company with little work/life balance. Fantastic for learning opportunities on and off the job. Lots of free little giveaways. Difficult to be an introvert at this company/
good,"I will invest in the company as far as my feminie wear goes, recieving benifits and hours is a different store. I missed work with Dr excuse which lead me to being terminated. I worked third shift and we had to always complete our wrk plus second shifts. My manager was not helpful, Third shift works harder then the pay just not my cup of tea. Overall I love and will continue to be a customer."
good,It was okay to work here. It pays well. I enjoyed the people I met. Did not receive benefits. A lot of workers are through the temp agency. Location is nice
good,"a typical day is to welcome customers, engaged and breakaway and reengaged later on.   you never stop learning from the  customers we also have different sales and new products that we need to learn on daily basis, I think the hardest part is try to convert every customer as a buyer becuase sometimes we dont have what  they are looking for  but the fun and enjoyable part is when you offered something else and they love it."
good,"Working at Victoria’s Secret is a comfortable environment. I was able to transfer and keep my job when I moved out of state, but the hours are well under what I need."
good,L Brands is a good job but I need steady employment. The job offered good benefits but staying on after the season is difficult. I would like to be hired somewhere immediately and not temp to hire.
good,"L Brands,Inc is a great place to work the 410 k and pto are wonderful the amenities are desired by associates I would recommend this opportunity to anyone."

good,A typical week includes working on new and challenging issues.  Great team support and atmosphere.  Senior management gives ample opportunity to develop and excel.
good,"The hardest part was leaving. The business analysts, application developers, and test leads challenged us (testers) to run the scripts developed and break the codes to deliver an effective copacetic experience for consumers online and in store. We made sure the data provided was accurate and if applied successfully leveled the transition especially for new and returning customers."
good,The most captivating and creative experience I have been exposed to. I am a woman and this was the most aligned personal and professional experience I have had. Work hard/played hard.

good,"its a great place to work, I've had a lot of jobs before that I worked really hard, but didn't feel like I had an impact. I've been able to use my skills to get ahead here. When I've wanted to take on different responsibilities, I've been able to do those with help from my director and leadership. I feel like I've been here for a good amount of time and I've had opportunities to advance myself and learn about my potential."
good,My job was to maintain the work flow from unloading stock in the back room to organizing it and ensuring steady merchandise flow from the back of the store to the front while assisting with any customer service needs along the way.

good,"We can work immensely, work culture is satisfactory, I have learned more by doing project here. I have mainly concentrated on designing mobile apps for VS."
good,i wished they did not do the seasonal people like they do if they could try to keep them they would stay longer. It was also a nice place to meet new friends and different ethnicity's.
good,"Their production was great for two weeks straight, I believe those were the two weeks before Thanksgiving. They did great pay raises during the holiday season which was a great help. They didn't do a good job letting people know they were no longer needed for the season"
good,This was a part time position for me and I enjoyed interacting with people.  Great position for seasonal jobs. Great company to work for.
good,I spent the majority of the days conducting cash register transactions.  Here I learned how to deal with customers of all age and variety.  I also learned how to deal with a multitude of situations.  My corworkers were never the same as the turnover for retail was high.  Management switched at about the same rate.  I enjoyed the job mostly do to the discounts I received.
good,Look forward coming to work. Our department works as a team and everyone in the other departments are freindly.
good,I really liked working at L Brands. I enjoyed working at a fast pace with really friendly people. I love nathan and body works so enjoyed smelling the new smells. Great pay and some really good perks.
good,"I had a blast working here during the holiday season. Great pay, great perks. I was hoping to stay permanently and was told I was staying as well. Until the very last day of the season, I was told I was actually not staying, which was very inconvenient."
good,"It was a good work experience being employed with L Brands, they have an amazing team of people working with you daily making sure you progress in work performance while being safe. They take great safety measures."
good,Good place to work it was just not for me with the things that were happening in my life. They weren't very accommodating with the loss of my uncle at the time.
good,"Great Company!"
good,"Great advancement, great pay  wonderful work environment, bonus incentives, different deptartment job opportunities, great cafeteria for lunch/dinner."
good,"Overall I liked the company self motivated employees. The work was heavy lifting, Loading/unload with team work we were able to get the job done"
good,"great company to work for"
good,this was ultimately my favorite place to work. I stayed moving around. great chances to advance in the company. Loved to listen to my music while I worked independently.  I learned how to pay attention to details.
good,La Senza is a very MS Excel dependent area of Limited Brands. Knowledge and expertise in MS Excel is critical to performing any job duties.
good,"Management is great, and the hours are flexible with your schedule. My coworkers are like a family. The customers are nice. The products we sell are amazing."
good,"Very fast paced environment.  Very high expectations to perform.   The ability to advance and promote is high, in my 15 years I moved up from a contractor to Manager level."
good,"I personally loved working with LBrands. They always gave an incentive during the Christmas season and they even went as far as to give us holiday meals, catering, and bonus gifts to show appreciation of our hard work."
good,"It’s a high demanding job and the schedule is not set, it always changes based on the store need but the pay is great and increases every few months, everyone always watches you and constant feedback. Very fast paced job no time for anything"
good,"I had a great experience working with this company. I worked during the holidays (black friday) it's a fast pace job. It may seem easy just stock merchandise but theres more than that. You need to make sure your trying to meet sales and conversations. The hardest part was that my team mates weren't very friendly it felt the environment very hostel due to the competition to meet sales.  Enjoyable, was helping customers find the perfect item."
good,"A great place to work! As a long time employee, it was a great place to grow as well. A typical day could be non-stop meetings....I learned a lot about ITIL, Disaster Recovery and many more of the skills I consider to be some of my strongest  while at Limitedbrands"
good,"Great company and great benefits (40% discount at all lbrand stores, Holiday pay, lots of free hours, great advancement.) Typical day of inbound calls, placing orders, tracking shipments, filing complaints, etc. Very busy really year around sometimes call que can reach 500+ calls. I worked 11:30-10 (10hrs) 5 days avweek (w-s). Not always family time or social life friendly."
good,"A typical day at Express was always busy. There was always something to do. I learned the different type of styles in the editor work pant and denim jeans. I learned to become the best Customer Lead I could be. I learned how to open my first Express Credit Card. Management was great, they taught me everything I know. They taught to open and close the store, balance registers, coach and develop associates, and how to enjoy my job. Co=workers were different, yet great as well. they all were willing to learn and to teach."
good,"My typical day was very fast paced and productive. My co-workers were amazing and we all worked well as a team. My job was very challenging with change but I enjoy change and I liked that I would learn something new every day whether it was from a customer, co worker, or management. As for management goes, sometimes my direct manager would micro manager and not trust my judgement in leading my team to success. As for the rest of management they were very supportive and a great team to work with. But all around I enjoyed working for Limited Brands/ Victoria's Secret. I am proud to say I was part of the VS team :)"
good,It’s pretty easy and the people you work with are super helpful. If you don’t know something they’re quick to help you out and show you how to do things the right way.
good,"In order to work for L brands you should be friendly, outgoing and helpful. Always had a smile on your face, always on your feet. Professionalism is a must"
good,"L Brands is an excellent place to work with great Leadership, colleagues and a good work life balance. They provide developmental and specialized training's including Leadership development programs and L Brands cultural and values training."
good,"Culture is shaped by ""L Brands Way"". Each leader is fully bought into culture. "
good,All the workers are hardworking and nice. Probably the nicest group of people i have worked with since even are guests remember us and come back to visit time after time.
good,Great place for seasonal but it’s almost impossible to get a permanent position. They offered free dinners during seasonal time. Along with samples from the BBW store.
good,For the most part it was a great place to work. The only problem I had with L Brands was managment. The Supervisor's would pick and  choose their little click of favorites.   I feel that was not very fair to other people. Those favorite people seem to get prompted to other jobs before everyone else. I thought that was very wrong
good,This is a good place to start a career in an eCommerce platform. There is lot of potential for growth. Upper management is well organized. Will recommend this place.
good,It was a good place to work I enjoyed the people and the fast pace environment. Very on top of any issues that required there  attention. This is a good job
good,Lbrands is a great company to work for. They provide a stable work environment. They have a flexibility so that you can balance work and home life. They maintain a good open door policy.

good,"My typical day at work is......."
good,Fast paced environment.  Always searching out ways to improve.  I've learned a tremendous amount about logistics and myself working at LBrands.
good,"We would come and clock in, have our morning meeting telling us about how much we would be estimated to receive and pull for the day. We would do our check-list for our equipment and start our task that were assigned to us after the meeting. "
good,"I believe in everything L Brands stands for they are very good to their employees they believe in work life balance, and good health. They are big givers to charity. I have grown professionally and gained a lot of experience and knowledge in the financial dept."
good,"The people, and the environment at LBrands is great. It is also a fortune 500 company and is always growing, the only downside is there isnt as much room for growth as you're sometimes lead to believe within your specific field, but managers and supervisors are willing to work with you to achieve your goals"
good,"I went through a hard lost during my time at L Brands however, the staff there are wonderful and were wonderful to me and all they're employees."
good,"Customers are passionate, but easy to satisfy. nice place to work and great pay. i originally started as seasonal and then went on to a permanent position. daily task usually consists of computer tasks, things like tracking packages and managing accounts. Overall a very nice place to work and easy position for the amount we were paid."
good,"Open registers, read emails, clean the store, check merchandise, walk the store for any visual details that need to be fixed. I learned a lot from reading and understanding mapping for a high volume store to editing and submitting payroll.  Hardest part of the job was long hours, sometimes we would go home to shower and change and  then head straight back to work. The most enjoyable part was learning something new everyday,"
good,Great place to work coworker are nice. When you do your job your rewarded. Job advancement opportunity and flexible schedule.
good,This was a call center job but still had opportunities for development and special projects.  We answered around 50-100 calls daily per person and supported both home office associates and store associates.
good,"A typical day at work was always very lively (we have music playing in store). "
good,Interning with Limited Brands has taught me more aspects of business than I could have possibly imagined. Having retail experience in the stores allowed me to see one side of business and being on the web team has allowed my growth and knowledge of both aspects of the business to flourish.
good,"A typical day included opening the store and processing shipment. I greeted customers, showed them new products, made recommendations for products they may enjoy. I completed transactions at the cash register and was profiecient in doing so. I got along great with all my coworkers and managers. The hardest part about my job was leaving and the most enjoyable was all the people I worked with and all the customers I was able to meet and assist."
good,"Great company to work for. Competitive salaries and fantastic benefits. Work-life balance is great. You can learn a lot from the associates you work with, most people are really smart and always want to improve. This place will push you to be your best."
good,L Brands is a very good place to work with their bi-weekly pay schedule a staff can make better plans with his/her Paychex each paying period.I really missed them and would like to work with them this time around not as a laborer but as a professional Information Technology or Desktop Support specialist.
good,Lbrands is big on looking after their employees. Management is great with feedback and is willing to work with officers having issues. Over all a great place to work. Officers rotate positions regularly to change things up. Regular on the job training. Over time is always available if you want it.
good,"When I worked there I was fortunate to work the Bombay sorting. The work was relatively easy. They allow you to listen to music while you work. The management was hit and miss, you will always have a few bad apples. No real complaints other then the break time between walking all the way to the back and then front was a bit tedious however I will blame it on building design. "
good,Nice place to work . They provided free lunch everyday during peak season. They also gave away free products at least. Yes and the warehouse management system they used were excellent
good,"At LBrands Victoria's Secret HQ in NY, I assisted the digital bra and panty categories with main responsibilities including monitoring and evaluating collection performance and current/future market trends to prepare for upcoming seasons. I worked with cross-functional teams to enhance success of the product line. It was a great way to learn about how different departments come together to produce a successful collection."
good,"Wonderful retail company with global opportunities...leverages business experiences to create associate and customer centric organizations where value, innovation, process and partnerships are fundamental to achieving results."
good,"A work-hard, play-hard culture. Let's face it, Shower Gel is fun! Bath & Body Works takes care of it's employees and treats people really well in every department."
good,"Lbrands trained me for PJ, Reach forklift and High lift crane operator. A great place to work providing you are in good shape. Lots of lifting which can take a toll on your back. Lots of long term associates, 10 to 30 years, which tells you this is a good company to work for. I unfortunately had to miss to many days due to unforseen circumstances, i.e. health issues. I was a seasonal employee for peak season and still am an active employee until they say otherwise. Great teamwork and enjoyed all the associates I work with."
good,"This is a fun and fast paced environment to work in.  It taught me a lot about talking to customers and building trust with them.  Further, I learned more about how to work as a cohesive team."
good,Y postion was seasonal and this was the second year I had worked at Lbrands. I actually love working at this job. This time around I was pregnant and had morning sickness very bad and ended up having to quit. Hopefully I can come back again!
good,Decent place to work with benefits. Treats employees fairly. Management can be better with strong guidance towards harnessing employee partnerships laterally in the organization.
good,"They are willing to promote within. It is a fun environment most of the time and they are focused on training all associates.  "
good,"Amazing job and environment. I have nothing at all else to say about this job, I do apologize. Apply and find out how lovely it is on your own. well worth it."
good,Everything is great! I have no complaints but I do not get enough hours. I went over two weeks with no work hours.  Then when I finally did I get three hours here or there.  It's so sporadic. Everything thing else is great.  The bosses are amazing. The people I work with  get in there and get it done. We stay busy the whole time.
good,"A great place to work. I really enjoy the culture, but feel that there is a  missing link when it comes to the retention of diverse talent. This seems to ring true for many previous associates."
good,"Good place to work. Great benefits, great cafe's.  Not all departments have good advancement  opprotunities. Overall very good family like atmosphere."
good,"Great place to work, Awesome nice cool Environment. Just that whether is really bad in Portland for almost 6 months. Its rain hard whole year. To work for company like this is a great opportunity"

good,it was fun and very uplifting.I worked with great caring people.
good,"on a typical day I process merchandise"
good,I enjoy Victoria's Secret. I love working with customers and getting them everything they need and helping them get what works for them and makes them feel amazing and beautiful. I also love the benefits of working there. We are all one big happy family and the people you work with are amazing. They care about you there and are willing to work with you and your needs.

good,"Earning the right set of numbers to pack to keep a good units per hour,friendly co workers "
good,I really liked working here. The whole experience was awesome. Great customer service. Great supervisors.They give you ice cream or popcorn every Friday.
good,I love my job it can become a little stressful sometimes de- escalating customers and we get great benefits. I would love to stay but I am relocating.
good,"The store I worked at was awesome, I loved all of the management team. I primarily worked on floor sets and windows once I was hired on full time somewhere else. Occasionally covering a shift when I was called upon, this was the best for me because I really enjoy setting windows and doing visuals. The store manager is an amazing person to work for."
good,"This job taught me just how much I could accomplish in an hour. There is a lot to do, but nothing unreasonable. They had high expectations but always prepared you well enough to accomplish your goals."
good,I loved working here and would still be if it did not conflict with my college class schedule. It is a great environment and everyone is friendly and wants so see you succeed!
good,"I enjoyed working at LBrands and it’s one of the best companies to work for . Safe , fun and lovely environment. They would let you pray when you it’s time to pray , they don’t discriminate and they treat everyone equal ."
good,I enjoyed connecting with customers through their shopping experience and making sure they were happy with their purchase as well as their phone call experience. I enjoyed resolving customer issues and getting to the bottom of things before the Call ended
good,"Managers were amazing, and so was the team that I got to work with. They were very flexible with my school schedule and giving me the hours I needed. I was very hesitant my first week or two because it was out of my comfort zone, but I miss my job there and it will forever be one of the best jobs I ever had. The company gives generous discounts, gratis and options to get better discounts/free items/etc."
good,"I was hired as a seasonal working. All the management and employees were easygoing and fun to be around, while also maintaining professionalism in the workplace. Working there was fast paced, yet also slow on some days and would get the option to leave early."
good,"All jobs can be stressful at times, so there were times where this job was. I was in the chat department, so no calling, which was nice. We used a instant messaging system for support. It can get VERY busy and overwhelming however they compensate for that. Rewards like gifts, visa gift cards, sometimes candy and snacks. Set schedule. 8-10 hour shifts and availability to pickup shifts if you want!"
good,I like how they would give paid breaks & how they would always help you when you needed help. The people were pretty nice also & they cared about your health.
good,I loved this job I wish I was able to go back! I worked as many hours as I could during peak season! It was sad I was let go due to me pointing out because they was not understanding with me being deathly sick and my mom in the hospital.
good,"They have many competitions to when gift cards. Discounted Prices. back to back calls but very easy to manage. Orders are easy to place, customers can be a pain at times."
good,"I worked in their Loss Prevention/Safety Services and I learned so much about the business and really fell in love with the company and bought into their mission.  It is a fantastic company to work for with, for the most part, great supervisors, managers, directors and executives.  Their orientation is fantastic for new associates and their training is great.  Everyone there seems to really enjoy coming into work each day and it has a great atmosphere with beautiful home office buildings."
good,I loved working at Limited Brands. The people were great to work with and the benefits was my favorite part of the job. It was a upbeat hip place to work. My only problem was that the upper management kept constantly changing things. We would finally get situated with the new rules and then they would come back in and change it again. You definitely need to be ok with the fact that you will jump from building to building. One month they will have you in Reynoldsburg and the next your in New Albany. It kinda sucks if your on a budget with gas
good,"L-brands is a company of integrity, intuitive."
good,It was great working for LBrands. LBrands provide a great work environment. Training was well thought out and executed well. The job itself was very simple and easily done.
good,"Typical day at LBrands is auditing and improving processes for due diligence. Our department is Global Compliance so we review reports daily and sanction check vendors that we are going to do business with in the future. "
good,I enjoyed working at Limited. I started as a merchandise processor  seasonally in 2015. I began picking and processing store orders. I advanced with the company to obtain a clerical position. I resigned for health reasons but am now able to resume employment. More details are listed in my resume.
good,"I worked here for a seasonal part-time job and the environment here was amazing. Management was great, work time was flexible, and the working environment was productive."
good,"As a sales lead/assistant manager I helped to coach employees on how to sell products, give attainable hourly/shift goals, made sure customers received the best experience, and assisted in the day-to-day opperations of the store. Very much a family atmosphere and loved the people I worked with. Still work part-time on floorsets!"
good,"l brands has variety of culture that work in and for the company , family oriented and calm work place 18 and up can apply to work . it help you with time management ."
good,"Day starts with motivational sales speech, smile, smile, smile. It is the easiest way to sell. If you aren't excited about the products, you won't do well. Team is always willing to help and is like a second family."
good,"This company is an inclusive company. They do promote from within, but also recruit from outside of the company."
good,"you cannot really rely on your coworkers at Brands, but it is a good work environment, very fast paced, the job security is low, i enjoyed the training i got to drive a forklift"
good,"If you love sales and working with people, Being a sales specialist provides a competitive wage. I am on my feet a lot so wear comfortable shoes and knowing merchandising definitely gives you a competitive advantage"
good,"A typical work day here included scanning my time hard to clock in, sitting at my cubical to set up before answering calls and going on lunch breaks outside with the rest of the employees."
good,I love the atmosphere I learned how to pick using a voice activated assistant named jenenefir. The co-workers were easy to get along with. This is by far the best company i have ever worked for. there is lots of room for advancement.
good,I enjoyed working for the Limited Brands. They have great benefits and have great incentives.
good,"lots of overtime, lots of gift cards, 40% discount, friendly atmosphere"
good,"It was a great company to work for, they dont treat you like the typical intern. I was able to attend design meetings and provide my input during them. I was a part of the team and felt important. Being there for a while also helped the team trust me and provide me with challenging work that they knew i could handle. There are many opportunities within this company and they treat their employees quite well. After leaving i am still in contact with my team and with HR, both of which have offered to help me in any way possible. Limited Brands is a great company to work for, and an unlimited source of experience."
good,I have Worked with a good team and work place is amazing. I would suggest people to choose working here. I dont even know how fast my 1 n half year goes here.
good,I really enjoyed the job. It is very easy work. Everyone there is extremely nice and willing to help. I wish it wasn’t only a seasonal position. I recommend working here.
good,"As, I was working there, I noticed that the management would care about the workers. One fellow worker had a death in the family. The management made sure she had the appropriate time off. So, she can say her final goodbyes."
good,Loved it would love to work there again. It’s very easy & straight forward. My manager was really nice & professional. The shift I work was easy for me.
good,l brand have the best break room bathrooms everything really make you think 'wow i really work here' the employees are some of the most nicest people you'll ever meet it was never a dull day at l brands
good,Great company and culture.  Training and development are highly regarded.  focus is customer and associates.  I would recommend this as a great place to work
good,"Best place to work! Wish I would have never left. Grass looked greener on the other side. If you think about quitting remember that. VS/BBW is awesome to work for and actually easy. Not so easy other places, or as nice and understanding."
good,The safety and security team is a great team to work with. Everyone is great at working as a team and accomplishing common goals.  The benefits are really good as well.
good,"My time with L Brands was amazing. The team I worked with really pushed you to be the best version of yourself you could be. My coworkers were not only great teammates, but great friends. I loved my time with this team and wouldn't trade it for the world"
good,"Surrounding all the negatives of a competitive retail industry, LBrands continues to be, at the levels I worked at, a fantastic place to be. You have the usual questions of management from those in lower levels, but I've found most of my peers and managers to not only be more than competent, but they also genuinely care about your happiness and ability to progress. If you give a little here, you will get back so much more. I went from a contract hourly associate, so a Sr level position in a matter of three years."
good,It’s an ammmmmazing place to work. It’s relaxed and it is just a great company to work for! I highly recommend this company. It’s fair and great managers .
good,"The day begins with a productive outcome throughout the day with morning meetings and working effectively to get a particular job done for the day. It is a family environment where different cultures work together and respect one another while they work. Communicating with the different people that you come in contact with is really a positive outlook for the job. The hardest part of the job is this: ""If you are not responsible for coming to work on time then you are making it hard on yourself . Your apart of a team so the company expects you to be there on time every day."
good,"Great work place and benefits."
good,My first job and good experience and great managers.  My hours were 2nd shift so it help me because I am a full time college student as well. My amangers were great

good,Management and supervisors eager to answer questions.  Many hours available in peak season; flexible with scheduling; eager to train employees in multiple skills for crosstraining
good,"loved my seasonal position here. great pay with benefits. 40% off of merchandise bought from their stores. I would love to work here again, I will be returning"
good,The work culture was relaxed. Rarely enforced overtime on the Mast side of the company. Regular 9am to 5pm shifts for corporate employees not working inside the DC's. Excellent PTO policy and summer Fridays. The 401k match program was great at 100% match of 4% set aside per paycheck.
good,"I enjoyed my contract with LB, the culture was very friendly and within a few weeks, I was completely used to the decor of the place (rather non-conservative)"
good,"A good paying job that has many different roles one may apply for. Sometimes a bit tedious, but you are rewarded for hard work and a willingness to learn."
good,"I had 2 temporary jobs here and they were great to work for. Fun, friendly environment. Beautiful posters all around.  Would work there again."
good,"Great company to work for.  High focus on results, speed, efficiency, and development.  Extremely fast paced environment with much opportunity to impact results on the business and overall market."
good,I have learned by working for Victoria Secret that it is a great company to work for. That management to there to assist me in any way that I may need help.
good,"Working at the Limited was a great opportunity. My typical work day at the L Brands included having to stand for 10 hours. we got two 20 minute breaks and a 30 minute break. I had to be clocked in by 5:00am sharp and usually clocked out at 3:30pm. The management there is amazing the best I have had yet. Everyone is really friendly, and they all helped each other as a team."
good,Limited Brands was the most exciting job I have ever had.  There was a gourmet restaurant on site.  Once a month there would be a fashion show with showing from the upcoming catalogues and professional models would also visit.  The best part about working for Limited Brands was the 40% discount.
good,"During my time as a Procurement Intern at L Brands I gained experience that I will carry with me in my future endeavors. I took on the responsibility of a full time associate and was able to get involved in multiple key projects that supported Victoria Secret, Bath and Body Works, La Senza and the Distribution Centers located at our corporate headquarters."
good,A typical day at work would be me standing on an assembly line with lots of people around a conveyor belt. All we would pick are Victoria secret underwear while listening to music. Free Wifi.
good,I loved my short termed time during Limited Brands. A day there was just as home and their society is well cleaned and proper. I love the abundance of benefits I received during my employed history there!
good,Would highly recommend working for this company! It’s a great start in the retail world. You meet great people & management is always helpful!!!!!!!!!

good,I loved my career at LBrands... Unfortunately I had to move and couldn't travel 2 hours to work... They allow you to move up and advance in their company and they had benefit packages available... They also have an amazing discount.... Thanks LBrands you will forever be apart of me...
good,"The day starts very early. After morning announcements are made, we start our assignments. I try to move at a faster pace, on each assignment. You do get your daily exercise."
good,You feel challenged everyday which helps you grow a lot as a professional.There's never a day where your doing the same thing over and over again. Would recommend this place to anyone who likes to be challenged.
good,"During Christmas time it is a very great company to work for .  . they have special events and for a week they cater food , the work place was always clean and everybody was friendly"
good,"My Typical day include making sure goods coming into the company are well accounted for, gets to the various departments in the building as to enable each one perform their task. Supervision is less at my department because, we are committed and dedicated that, we perform our duties with less to no supervision. This is the power of a great teamwork built."
good,"This company offers you a chance to enhance your skills at sales, interaction with customers.   They will train you every day on how to improve your techniques with selling the product and how to sale to the customer."
good,"I was  a Product manager and a Merchandising Supervisor."
good,Wish I was still There..great company to work for. the job is not very hard and the people are nice.Had to leave because of family illness.I hope to return one day soon!!
good,"A typical day at work consists of answering emails, calling customers, taking calls and placing orders for customers. The team I work with is very loving, understanding, and downright hilarious. I love it here, and have already adopted the people here as family. In order to succeed here, you not only have to be able to place orders, but at times you will need to speak with customers non stop. Whenever you have a question, help is readily available."
good,Fashion industry is great. The culture is pretty lay back. People are excellent. I love Limited Brands. I would love to be part of it again.
good,"This is a company that cares about their workers, and I love it !! Depending on the day of the week work can be slammed or only having 10 -15 customers in an hour.  while clocked in you can do anything from ringing up customers to doing shipment.  during the day you'd sell and make a memorable experience through her journey of shopping in pink. Cleaning throughout the day happens as well. Teamwork plays a huge part in this company which is a plus because every person has a chance to shine in their own way to sell to a customer.  Adding on to a persons sale is the biggest tip I've learned while working with the customer besides making sure no one walks away with purchased merchandise.  Management plays a big part in our role and helps us mold into top sellers as a whole team, which is why its a positive environment."
good,"I learned excellent customer service skills, hardest part of the job was alway being up to date with technology. I loved the fast paced environment. I was a retail sales consultant so I sold a lot of phones."

I learned how to use the gun in scanning products appropriately and to arrange boxes safely on pallets. Supervisors and team leaders over at the work place were very professional and friendly. There is mutual respect and good work ethics at Lbrands. The hardest part of the job is when one is overwhelmed with hundreds of boxes to scan and palletize in the shortest period of time. The most enjoyable time is when employees are given free lunch and during stretches in the morning."
