bad,"Worst job experience I have ever had. When I first started, it was great! But then we got a new manager, who is more interested in rearranging furniture and photos on the walls, then helping out when we were short staffed. Chronically understaffed, 1 or 2 caregivers to take care of 26-30 residence is not safe. Facility doctor will not return calls or answer messages, “because he just doesn’t.”  If you speak out, there will be retaliation. If the staff or the residents are hurt by another resident, nothing is done. The facility constantly smells like urine, and is not safe.  I was there for 6 months and in that time we lost 5 employees. The turnover is extremely high."
bad,None the company need better management traing talk to there workers better be understanding and act right by your employees show the you appreciate their hard work
bad,Poor employer. Took over building that was deficiency free for 2 years and chased away great employees by not allowing enough staff coverage. Staffing ratio of 1 caregiver to 10-12 dementia residents. Some requiring lift.
bad,This company is beyond bad news the management try to act nice until they don't get what they want the staff treat their clients bad they talk within each other about the clients and the clients conditions and they eat the food for the clientz overall this is a bsd company to work for
bad,"Don't apply for a job there. They don't care about their employees at all. Not enough money for work that you do. They ask you to do more than job requires, but when you do what is asked, they give you negative reactions from management."
bad,"The environment is horrible! Follows policy when its convenient the company numbers are only important it is not an assisted living were providing full care going to work everyday is dreadful always short on staff the care for the residents is mediocre as best alot of bullying, false accusations by coworkers if your not liked we do assignments that were not titled to do so"
bad,"The job was stressful, several of the residents were beyond the level of care that we could provide, the building needed repair & several residents left to go to other facilities, the bottom line was the budget over staff & residents."
bad,The job is fairly easy. The residents make your day. Its the management whom are childish. A bunch of he said she said mess. They lie and try and get you to snitch on each other and keep up mess. I'd rather work a job for less pay.
bad,"Caregiving is not an easy job, but when you pair that with an unsupportive management team and uncooperative staff it is almost unbearable. Working here is awful, all the managers care about it money and if that means pushing their caregivers to work through sickness and injuries then so be it. Not only that, they are in such desperate need for staff they will hire and allow anyone to work there no matter now many times a person has called out, or have done things any other jobs would have fired people over. In the meantime they are usually understaffed and most of the managers are never around to help."
bad,Not a good place to work. Has alot of clicks. Not professional . Very Ghetto enviorment. Management suckss. Dont care about employees. Not enough caregivers for residents. Caregivers rude . cleaning crew lazy . Kitchen lacking.
bad,Very tiring. No respect. Everyone quits. No breaks. Old people always angry. Co workers was the only good part about working here cus we all suffered together. was not good.
bad,"Money oriented, residents are considered last. Old, unclean, constant revolving door. Residents actually feared the executive director, and were afraid to complain because the thought their rent would be increased, as one example."
bad,"More about money than caring for their workers , not very considerate . Also you doing everyone’s job , serving, caring , if your a med tech your passing meds as well. For a decent pay it would be worth it"
bad,"They care nothing about employees or residents it was the worst place i ever worked and mgmt are deceptive not truthful. The residents walk around hungry & all the staff does is cover it up & find ways to do write ups bogus reasons unsafe , deceive, all they care about is covering their shift & they also do sneaky ? with the clock"
bad,The worst place ever!!! The head boss has no clue what she’s doing and hates men. They would rather loose you then give a small raise. 38 shifts un spoken for on wait staff and they expect the small staff in the kitchen too fill in when needed for 15 bucks an hour. Then they tell you you are in charge of waitstaff as a cook getting little pay. Stay far away!!!!
bad,Brookdale is by far the worst company I’ve worked for. They don’t value their employees and only care about the dollar amount they make and nickel and dime each of the residents. I wouldn’t put a family member here.
bad,"Truthfully, always understaffed. Food is horrible, pay is even worse. No overtime offered, check never consistent. Can't keep management, and employees that should be fired, often get a pass. Most raise you will see $0.09. No shift differential."
bad,Short staffed. Corporate management terrible.   Bottom line and their bonus was more important than hiring enough staff. No accountability.  Poor training.
bad,Would not recommend working for this company.  It definitely has unfair management policies and supports employee harassment.  Surprised that this culture is supported but there have been lawsuits because of unfair treatment of employees and residents
bad,"This company does not care about their employees or residence , they are very understaffed and have no communication whatsoever, they don’t take concerns into consideration. This is a horrible place to work."
bad,Worst place every to work or live. Infested with bed bugs poor management poor food and underpaid employees. I wouldn't recommend this place for anything
bad,"Do not send your family members to live there! Residents are treated terribly, the RN on site will never care for them and all of the care for each resident is dependent upon some under qualified teenager that had no idea what to do thus leaving each resident usually being neglected medically. I did not work there long. It was a complete disaster to say the least."
bad,"This is the WORST place to put a loved one! Undeniable abuse .. management REFUSES to do her job, YOU have to! And your FORCED to sign documents that are ABSOLUTELY considered healthcare fraud !(services that were never preformed) Abuse that’s NOT DEALT WITH to the residents (from kitchen staff) and FROM THE RESIDENTS to caregivers! I reported and nothing ever was done was FORCED ATO CONTINUE TO BE PUT IN UNCOMFORTABLE SITUATIONS time and time again. The 1 “HR” person is a JOKE don’t  expect to be paid! Your not allowed a break but THEY correct your time to reflect one ! Physically threats from staff, management condones it"
bad,"Management is horrible. Have gone to them multiple times about situations and they don’t care. People show up late all the time, facility is dirty with bugs, staff is extremely rude and will target you if they don’t like you. Would never work for them again!"
bad,I had call out one day for a shift that was my first call out and they told me I had to come in the resident are wonderful but he management was not !!!
bad,Some workers down grade the new workers I only have worked there for 1 month and I'm ready to quit...i can't stand favoritism and there is alot of that going on..
bad,I'm an LVN with 5 years experience. I had been out of work for 2 years so accepted this position for a very low pay of $21/hour after being told in the interview it would be more of a desk job with minimal duties since I would have a med tech. Complete lie. I was doing medications for everyone in the building by myself. The place is a joke. They lie to patients family's also. I would never put my loved one here.
bad,They fire you without warning and claim you do something wrong without proof.  They question your integrety daily.  Built up sales for the community above expectation and they go to the highest level for corrective action vs handling it in house.
bad,I wouldn't recommend anyone to work there as it currently is. There is no way to have a life and work balance here. Their mandate policy is way overwhelming. You'll get called in constantly at all hours of the night. The management doesn't help in the slightest
bad,"I was consistently criticized, often yelled at and lied to on a regular basis by office staff   I could trust no one in the office   It was a toxic work environment at the office   The most unorganized and distrustful management I’ve ever encountered "
bad,To say the least Brookdale in Hagerstown is the reason i would absolutely NEVER work in a nursing home or assistant living facility of any kind ever again. It’s bad enough that these people are dumbed here and most of their families never visit but the treatment i seen and REPORTED in this facility was heartbreaking. Never again.
bad,Don't wait your time here. Look for a better opportunity. Management sucks and so does corporate. They're a joke. They dont know how to keep their employees. There is no teamwork.
bad,This place was FULL OF DRAMA!!!! We even had weekly meeting about drama. Management had its favorites for sure. The pay was not worth it at all. I was a medication technician but often did CNA work. This place didn’t follow any rules as to medication and I was worried about losing my license. The residents was the only reason I came to work.
bad,"The only good part about my job was interacting with the residents. Staff,management, and others were not pleasant at all. They over worked you and used you offering ""bonuses"" that never showed up on the paycheck. They are only good to you as long as you do what they want you to do and after that you are no good. Management here was horrible."
bad,I worked in canton for 11 months & was fired on my birthday. Management in Canton& Woodstock should be laughable but it's not funny at all. Im upset with myself that both places got the time they did out of me. Management has their circle & you cant mess with that. Nor would you want too. 0 stars but that was not option.
bad,"The residents are all great, little do they know the management is shady AF and fire people because of hearsay by their favorite sh*tty workers that do not belong there in the first place. No wonder their turn around rate is so high and nobody wants to stick around. I urge others to not work here."
bad,"Horrible company. I would not suggest anyone to work there.  After a month I sat the keys on the managers desk and said "" I will not work in a place so toxic and pay so little"".. Residents suffer at this company from poor management."
bad,Don’t waist your time. Management was horrible and prejudice !! Took advantage of the good workers that were there for a while.  Executive Director walked around like she was a queen. Never interacted with the residents. She was only there for a paycheck
bad,"I spent five years at this company and loved my residents and family members.  However, Brookdale has a very unstable hierarchy that doesn’t seem to care how hard you work and pay you the bare minimum for the job.   It was nearly impossible to keep frontline staff when the demands of the work load do not match up with the ridiculously low pay offered.  They have lost sight and vision of what they used to stand for which was enriching the lives of those we were serving"
bad,Director was not very strong and could not control her Nurse from bullying other managers.Several managers had to quit due to the nurse making work life hard to deal with.
bad,"Most Residents needing high care than what the caregivers could provide, ignored tasks, ignored residents needs, poor management, not a care in the world for the staff/caregivers and residents. Messed with pay, mistreated residents/caregivers. Poor communication, ALL BAD!"
bad,Working for Brookdale was one of the worst mistakes I could have made. I was divided and felt like I didn't belong. And they didn't allow me to work out my 2 week notice they packed my stuff up and mailed it to me.
bad,I felt as if the staff was not caring for the residents properly and that they were only being maintained. The whole experience was a negative one. But I did like the residents.
bad,Don’t ever apply at this company they only care for themselves. Don’t care for resident or staff. Huge at favouritism for the ones they like. Worst mistake I ever made !!!! Always under staffed
bad,All the managamemt does nothing to help out anybody who needs extra help not good place to work your working crazy hours never get a thank you managment plays favorites
bad,"Management over seeing care staff team didn’t like the way things were running prior the taking the position, management tried changing everything at once  and didn’t have a plan of action to complete tasks accordingly. Management caused chaos and failed to communicate simple plans to staff. "
bad,Less caring for the staff and there needs.The management doesnt care about your family life only there needs . This place needs to be shut down they dont care about there staff nor residents they are more about what money they can get coming in facility. It got worse everytime they changed management.
bad,"STNAs are underpaid, judgemental all the way up the corporate ladder. Not much help on 2nd and 3rd shifts and low staffed. Looks are very deceiving when it comes to this place. Pretty exterior but once inside.... Its a nightmare!"
bad,"Everyone is after you that is a manager, they don't care about the quality of care given to the residents. Everything's inconsistent with the care and management. The kitchen never gets clean and the food is not up to standards. Not a good place to live or work."
bad,Horrible management. Corporate only cares about dollar signs not the caregivers or residents. Management will doing anything to cover their own tracks
bad,"Terrible place to work.  No support very disorganized, totally unmanageable.  They have a manager who has no clue about clinical issues.  We deal with clinical issues daily,"
bad,"MANAGEMENT DOES NOT CARE, RUDE, ALSO... the Charge Nurses(LPNS) are More or Less, Manager like during shift. I loved going at first, but the politicking amongst coworkers and lack of leadership, and organization is really UNBEARABLE.. they gave us 30 day notice of company change. New company FRONTLINE MANAGEMENT, I will not be here much longer it is going too the pits."
bad,Terrible management some supervisors were great but as for the main bosses they where terrible didn't know how to manage don't get paid enough  for all the stress.  VERY VERY RUDE employees
bad,Worst place to work in Wilmington! No where near state regulations and short staff on every shift. If you have a life this is not the job for you. The rcc there blasts everyone's personal business and violates hippa laws.
bad,Brookdale is a for-profit organization. Healthcare staff have a stressful job with high patient to staff ratios. Being short staffed is a daily occurrence.
bad,This place is a mess I wouldn't recommend no one to work for them.The managers talk about the employees.And they pay u very low for all that HARD work your doing.
bad,"Poor Management, Favoritisms, Lazy staff. I would not recommend working for this company the work is stressful and barely pays anything. The managers pick their favorites and allow them to do things out of their scope of practice."
bad,This place needs to be shut down. They never would have enough caregivers to take care of the residents even though they were paying alot of money to stay there. Everything they tell the family of the residents arent true and they try and make the place look like what's it's not. Also alot of shady things go on that doesnt get reported.
bad,They are unorganized unfriendly they don't know what they're doing the scheduling is horrible to pay is even worse there is no flexibility at all in the work schedules and if you're full time they expect you to automatically work 12 to 16 hour shifts. I personally wouldnt take my parents there
bad,"Very bad management, job is not as bad. They never take responsibility for their bad choices, quick to place the blame on other people.Shows an extreme amount of favoritism"
bad,"Brookdale North Mesa is not a good place to work. Management have their people who they favor the most and let them get away with everything. "
bad,"Sad treatment of staff and residents. Work short, and most staff was incompetent. Management only wanted their bonuses and had no reguard to the treatment of staff. Residents were not respected."
bad,It's terrible! The ED lies and can not be trusted. No team work. They not nice people the boss make people do whatever. The managers tell you something and do something else.
bad,"Alot of favoritism...The ED is very unprofessional, she is a liar. Promised people bonuses if they picked up extra shifts even made a memo stating how much it would be per shift. Then when we didn't get our bonus and questioned it she made a memo stating just because we picked up extra shifts doesn't mean we get a bonus!!!! I literally worked 18 hours straight was told I was going to get a $100 bonus...NEVER GOT IT!!! THIS COMPANY IS HORRIBLE!!! THEY DON'T APPRECIATE YOU UNLESS YOU SUVK UP...YOU CAN'T HAVE AN OPINION."
bad,"BROOKDALE DOES NOT CARE ABOUT ITS EMPLOYEES!!! the Nurses and Management act like little school girls, gossiping and giving you less hours just to prove a point. Human resources will not file formal complaints to corporate, but instead go back and inform the person whom you filed a complaint on. It's an overall NIGHTMARE!"
bad,"I worked at brookdale durham for almost 2 years and got fired for something petty. They are very rude to you make you feel less a person will use you to gain. The nurses and residents are awesome but management time is the worse I have ever seen in my life they are children, treat you like you don't matter, talk to you any kind of way and you have to take it because you have a job. The Executive was the worse I have ever had not understanding,  tell you in so many words you can and will be replaced. Write you up for silly things. They blow alot of things out of proportion."
bad,"the company forced the employees to do. stuff"
bad,"The administer in Cumberland made our building worse since she took over. None of the staff likes her or even respects her. They use you as a body for their schedule but they dont care about you as a person nor employee. She let's certain people sleep on 11-7, but writes others up she doesnt like. Rotten facility will burn you out."
bad,"Terrible place to work, uneducated employees, dirty place, mo appreciation, no benefits, management doesn’t listen, residents have no rights, healthy food options are not provided for residents in the cottages"
bad,The management was horrible I can’t believe it took this long to get rid of them or they probably got promoted to cooperate good luck working there it’s not worth the application
bad,"Manager would constantly change schedule without telling me and then get mad when I didn't show up because I didn't know, she tried to write me up without ever telling me, which is illegal. She constantly scheduled me on school days and asked me miss multiple days of class. She consistently lied and talked behind people's backs. You don't get any tips, you get minimum wage, and you have to do way more than a normal server does. Portioning out the food and putting it on the plate, bussing and re-setting up the entire dining room, dealing with rude old people, salad bar set up, making desserts, sometimes even food prep, and more"
bad,"Management here is awful, way too much drama. They will lie and twist the truth, they have their favorite employees who don’t have to follow the rules. If you work hard, they treat you like cattle. If you hang out and disappear for hours you get employee of the year. Doesn’t make sense, does it? The managers here have no clue what they are doing, the food is horrible. The residents are very unhappy "
bad,"No help, rude staff, lots of favoritism, no consequences, no management support. Managment allows staff to form cliques to harrass and bully oncoming workers and will not fire them."
bad,Working at this facility was more like working at a daycare than a senior living facility.  All of the servers seemed to be barely out of high school and acted like spoiled brats and toddlers.  Most being lazy  and unprofessional. Management couldnt handle their crew probably because they couldnt do their own jobs correctly. I reported this to management and his caregiver and no one seemed to care. An ambulance showed up 10 min later. Such disregard for human life its sickening10 min later an ambulace came and he ended up in the hospital. Such distegard for for the seniors there. as they just continued playing on her cell phone. 10 min later the ambulanc
bad,"DO NOT WORK THERE!!!!!"
bad,Horrible management. They don't listen very mean to employees. If a manager says it ..there is no question its written in stone. They overwork anyone they can . If you don't come in they use that against you. They play favorites. They target people . A lot of finger pointing !!! They promise advancement they don't follow through . They go through so many nurses and other Care staff like a revolving door and they could care less door.
bad,If you're white you'll be okay there they don't care about nobody but yourself the company only gives you 3% raise you never can ask for a raise but they like white people
bad,very low pay very low low pay not good at all this place is so sad to work at and the workers are just very slow 90% are under paid and they work there for years no drive at all
bad,"This is the absolute worst company I have ever worked for. Day 1 I thought I could not handle it. I've worked in a trauma center before, so hectic, busy, chaotic, I can handle that. This was overwhelming to the point that careless mistakes were being made on a daily basis that could kill a resident. There is nowhere to wash your hands. Gloves are scarce. There is one QMAP (med tech) for 60 residents. On evenings there are only two caregivers. The nurse told us to pre-pop pills (which is illegal) if we were to get everything done on time. To sum this facility up in one sentence: instead of scheduling two QMAPS, they told us to do something illegal to get the work done so they would not have to pay for adequate staffing. They have the QMAPS do things they legally aren't allowed to do, like insulin injections, blood glucose monitoring. The entire management team was fired and corporate has been of no help. We have gotten no help for weeks since our management team left. I was thrown on QMAP with no training. I am regularly scheduled 50+ hours a week and get called in all the time. The schedule changes daily and then the manager lies about it so basically you can never have any personal plans set in stone outside of work and you constantly fear that your shifts will change. It happens very frequently that the manager will ask why you aren't working your scheduled shifts even though you think you are. Then she'll deny that she changed the schedule even though we all take pictures of the schedule and have proof. On top of only being one QMAP on a shift passing meds for too many people"
bad,"I would recommend anyone here, very very unprofessional. They even stick together when someone else is in the wrong. They also have a high turnover rate especially in dining with negative management and mannerism. It's sad how they really so people. The only good is when you have the seniors loving you and looking forward to me cooking there meals. Along with teaching a cooking that did not know how to cook at all. My time and blessing are over. But avoid this place if you see the sign need help keep riding by. Trust me you will regret it at the end."
bad,There's no teamwork when you have a problem you have people to go to but nothing gets done. Management i have nothing good to say about none of them if yall would interview every person that works there individually i promise they would say the same as im saying. Now im looking for another job.
bad,"They have great sales people that make it look like a wonderful opportunity in orientation, however actually working there is horrible. Management is overbearing, horribly understaffed."
bad,It completely sucked working for this company. Horrible management.  Was only out for herself. Didn't care about her employees. Only cared about getting her bonus check.
bad,The best part of this job are the residents. I use to love working here until I seen how the elderly are treated. I didn’t learn much or received any benefits
bad,Horrible place to work for! Boss's let people get away with anything but complain about the SMALLEST things Also don't like to actually do thier job. LOW PAY for HARD WORK. No advancement. Hours cut constantly. Not worth your time.
bad,"Recently terminated after an emergency 911 call (4 days later). When I was called at home, I was told I used derogatory language at another employee. I was not even told what I had said to the individual, or who the individual was. Personally, it's pathetic that the manager did this over the phone. I don't even know what I said, to state my side of the situation. I only remember saying to the lady in dispatch that I didn't know what the HE/double hockey sticks was wrong with the individual, that's why I called 911. Anyone applying for Night Security Guard be aware that you are actually a night custodian, kitchen aide, maintenance, receptionist and security."
bad,"I would NOT recommend anyone working at this place. "
bad,The worst place to work Management sucks they don't care that you have family and they will throw anyone under the bus if that means they have to save their job
bad,Everyone does whatever they want and management does nothing.. people can do no call no show for work n not be punished n still have a job the next day . They can talk and be disrespectful to the residents and again nothing happens
bad,"Horrible place to work. Horrible pay, horrible hours, horrible management. Employees are over worked and under paid. Management is lousy and extremely unprofessional. I would never recommend working here."
bad,"Management plays the favoritism card at every turn! They'd rather put unneeded new furniture in than give workers a raise! Underpaid, underappreciated"
bad,"Poor management, lack of focus, lack of support for employees.management often contradicts its own policies and procedures in order to lure employees to perform additional tasks without adequate compensation. They are unable to hire experienced wait staff and are forced to hire teenagers with no experience. Rather than train them properly because of managements inability to do so, the service suffers horribly. "
bad,"This place sucks  no structure, management  doesn't know how to manage.  Open door policy is a joke.  Retailiation is very alive and well.   You can't trust no one. Lies lies lies."
bad,They don’t play enough for all of the work they want you to do also the brookdale in lake mary fl is disgusting and dirty. The roaches are horrible and they are everywhere including the residents room. The place is drama filled and the managers are not professional
bad,"Needs to hire Director that cares about residents and knows how to talk to her staff respectfully.  Place is dirty, no activities, food terrible.  Run fast."
bad,"Poor management "
bad,"Not a good company to work for due to low wages and horrible benefits. This company still believes that you can live off of $9-$10 an hour in Houston, TX. I would not recommend anybody to get a job for this company unless you're just in need of a job or want the experience. Run..🏃🏃"
bad,Management sucks high turn over stressful not paid enough always get stuck after your shift because people call in all the time worst job I ever had  ...
bad,"The worst place I have ever worked in my life. Was promised a raise and never got it,  when asked the E.D said she never promised that. Over worked, I worked 13 days straight all 16 hour shifts. When I asked for a day off for a funeral I was told I haven't worked enough to get time off. They do not care about their staffs physical or mental health."
bad,"Do not work here! Management is a joke! The pay is horrible. No wage increase, new people get payed more than people who have been here for a long time. Very unorganized. Schedules are a mess. Run!"
bad,"Unprofessional, rude , not appreciative. They have rude employees that they don't do anything hung about . When you complain about another person being unprofessional they tell you they think it's your feelings being hurt. Even if others have complained about the same person same thing previous. Management only cares about themselves . Residents get minimal care and complain about it constantly to you. When you can't do anything about it."
bad,"This place has no compassion for why they do , they have no understanding even when you have been there for years . They don’t pay what your worth is here at this place"
bad,Worst place I’ve ever worked. Management mistreats employees constantly. Coworker had a stroke at work and they didn’t want to let her leave to go to the hospital. I was treated so poorly that my mental health still hasn’t recovered and it’s been over a year since I worked there.
bad,Was hired to work in assisted living.  Got thrown into memory care with absolutely no training.  Management is there very little but always quick to criticize.  Pay is horrible.  Food is excellent. Left company and was never paid for my vacation that I earned. Do not work there.  Extreme drama constantly.
bad,poor staffing poor infection control no supplies management does not care about its employees  I was homeless and they knew and didn't care liela gllard  actually asked if I could go to the battered womans shelter (im single)
bad,"The ED interviewed me, he knew nothing about the job and gave me wrong information. I took the job and when I started it was nothing like he said. I quit my job for this and I was angry but stayed anyway. I don’t recommend working here management are idiots."
bad,I can't say nothing about this place that is how 👎 it is.... The manager is poorly bad the food could be better and for the pay it could be better for what you do for the job......
bad,"Backwards company who only cares about the pocket books for themselves of upper management, poor training, lots of gossip, and had basically little to no direction or fair chances at advancement."
bad,Doesn't care about anyone just money if I could give less than one star I would. Poor rude staff. The residents are amazing. Felt like I had no support no job incentives. Poor pay
bad,This place was one of the most unprofessional places I've ever had the unpleasant of working for...I'll just leave it there....the pay was horrible and the management sucks....
bad,The company stands for great things and great care. The individual facilities management doesn't know what they are doing. Too many cliques. Too many chiefs not enough Indians. Under staffed.
bad,"You felt like everyone was working against you,  they would treat and speak to the residents in whichever way they wanted. When I brought it up to management, I was told ""I know,  there's nothing I can do though""."
bad,My Supervisor was verbally abusive and HR did nothing to help.  Upper Management is not transparent about what's happening within the organization.  You're treated like a child.
bad,"Not a good place to work.  They tend to run under the good 'ol boys system consisting of the ED,DON,LPN, care staff incl. Med Tech's, the Business Office down to Activities. So your either part of their in-crowd or they will make it miserable and hard for you to stay, no matter what your skills are, how much the residents like you or how well you do your job. Basically the in-crowd can do no wrong, even if you have evidence they did, but you will do everything wrong,whether you did or not. And the DON enforces this to no end. They have SOOOOO many people get hired, work 1 or 2 shifts and just never come back.  Most care staff outside the in- circle is from Agency because they cant keep anyone.  Residents are NOT their #1 priority by any means....its all about the $$$.   Even if a resident has to go without briefs and/or wipes.... even when a resident is out of medication for days at a time, or their dosing(pain meds) is scheduled to accommodate the Med Tech's schedule, not when they need it!  The list goes on and on of all the mistakes and State noncompliance issues. And I wont even go into not getting pay owed for months on end! Don't waste your time and/or your skills here.  Go somewhere that is friendly, welcoming, supportive and puts patients/residents FIRST!!!"
bad,"Do not apply. It is a sinking ship. They lie to get you in the door. The culture does not match what they spew. No life balance. They over work you, throw you away when they are done using & abusing you. They use your compassion & kindness against you. Corporate does not care about employees or residents. They only care about the $$$$. All of my relationships with family, friends, & spouse suffered due to my employment there. No job is worth all that negativity."
bad,Avoid this place this is a terrible company to work for you are just a number here and they could care less who is working as long as someone with a heartbeat is on the floors
bad,Over all the residence are sweet but management didn't care about the residents. Sense of urgency is non existent unless corporate comes down or a tour is going on. Learned alot but it was time to go.
bad,Management is still looking for help. I had about 5 CNA'S  that communicated wonderfully. The LPN was a joke. Upper management played favorites with both staff and residents.
bad,If you are a licensed professional you'll stay away from here. Staffing is always short and they pay is lousy. Things go on here that make you realize that if you stay any longer you'll lose your license.
bad,"If you need a job, please look somewhere else. All people what I know have a bed experience. They have a ED in Scottsdale location who just care about herself."
bad,This company will lie about everything. Always understaff or no staff( which happend multiple times). Not a fair company. Dont waste your time unless this is your only option.
bad,The ED is uneducated & inexperienced! She feels threatened by your knowledge & will bully you. You are over worked & underpaid. It says it's an assisted living but our residents at memory care are nursing home residents
bad,"The worst place to work. Never seen unprofessional management in my life up until now! Bed bugs everywhere, no maintenance, no servers, while management work only 4 hours a day you will do everything!"
bad,Management is very unprofessional and it’s very understaffed. There’s no communication and things get blamed on you even if you’re not working that day.
bad,This is the worst senior living company to ever work for. They give ultimatums and heaven forbid you voice concerns. They will turn around and can you for no reason just because you have concerns. They force you to work on units that you're not comfortable with. The pay is absolutely terrible even when you have years of experience. No one can pay bills on the wages they throw at you. Unrealistic expectations with no vital information given about residents.
bad,Corporate makes it very uncomfortable strong arm employees massive exits due to non communication terrible attitudes pressure placed on employees lack of consideration for employees
bad,I would not recomend working here. managers are not understanding and do not treat employees fairly. ................................... .............
bad,"as an HWC you will work the floor constantly. if you are fortunate to have a good director(i did have a great one in Richland Hills -AL), they may alternate working it with you. otherwise, you will work any and every shift on the floor. good luck!"
bad,"A horrendous place to work, a uncooperative Corporate structure that is more concerned with making money than caring for their residents and employees. Everything with them revolves around the “bottom line!"
bad,"Too many chiefs and not enough Indians!! Too many people taking leadership when it should be defined to one specific manager, communication is bad, no more compassion for the residents it’s all politics!!"
bad,"The management was so bad during my time there. everyone started to quit. starting with the director to the chef to the housekeeper and cna. They started to make the cna's do all the work from missing staff. we were cooking dinner, sering dinner, housekeeping, washing dishes and stiill had to care for 22 residents all in a 8 hr staff."
bad,"A typical day at work consist of you standing on your feet from the moment you walk in the door at 7 am until about 1:30 pm. Both the LPNs and CNAs have a ridiculous amount of residents to care for each. Management is to blame. They would claim that adding an additional staff member per shift was over staffing but how?? When the LPN can have 30-40 residents each and the CNA can have 15-20 residents each. It is unbelievable that management thinks that any of the resident receive the proper care and attention they require because this IS NOT! I repeat IS NOT AN ASSISTED LIVING. It is a nursing home that does not use lifts! The staff pretend as if the complete all the work when it is practically impossible to finish your assignment in its whole in an 8 hour shift. And if you are unlucky enough to have an emergency during your shift expect to be at work for an additional 1-2 hours and payroll will deduct the additional time from your check because they are trying to avoid paying overtime. They also deduct your lunch break even though you are barely able to take a 10. Run! Run as fast as you can! Beyond the stress, the amount of physical pain I felt at the end of the shift was not worth a single dime I made there!"
bad,"No job training, management and corporate have unreasonable expectations. Very much cliqish, if you are a favorite you can do no wrong. If you are not a favorite you can do no right. Manager is a drama queen, two faced and dishonest."
bad,"No housekeeping being done for a month both housekeepers quit. Dirty briefs tossed on the floors in the hallways. Infested with nats probably from the smell, no supplies makes it very hard to give proper care, management locks up towels and bed pads thinks employees are stealing. Cross contamination, ABUSE I've witnessed skin tears from negligence of other caregivers"
bad,"Don't work there,  and don't put your family member in there.  They will act like they care during the tour, and get you to sign on the dotted line DONT DO IT,,  ,RUN AWAY FAST."
bad,Terrible company to work for.   To many managers not enough direction.  Lack of Loyalty.  Lack of respectful manners.   To many secrets amongst “Directors”.
bad,"At Brookdale the CNA position was very hard We had to do 4 peoples jobs "
bad,I loved working with seniors but didn't have the support and a realistic understanding of the challenges from corporate management.  It was like they had no idea what it to to do my job.
bad,If there was a ZERO stars this place would be NEGATIVE. Management got their position out of a cracker jack box. Dining room director doesnt knw how to order food. Chef doesnt knw how to cook. Food served with no compassion. ALL management thru out the place turn their backs when things go wrong and LIE to Corporate. Residents are always neglected in the dining room.
bad,Don't work here if you have any respect for yourself. Run in the other direction as fast as you can. This place is a joke. Not worth the time or energy.
bad,"It was the worst job I had in over 50 years.  You have to work with nothing because they won’t buy anything for you to fix what is broken.  Then yell because you didn’t fix it.  "
bad,"The cons outweigh the pros largely."
bad,"No one ever communicated with one another. It was always come in, no communicating, go do what you needed to do and then leave. If there was ever an issue or you needed to let the management know something, it always would come off as you're bothering them and they didn't care. Multiple times where a resident would have TWO underwear/ pull ups on (and I kept track of who was working when that would happen) and took it to management and all I got was a ""oh really..... Well she has worked here for 8 years. She would never do that. And that goes for any issue that would be brought to my attention and I thought needed to be taken care of. I love helping people. It gives you such a strong feeling knowing you were able to help that it's indescribable. I wanted to make a change, make Bookdale better for the residents but I couldn't ever do that. Management would always say to make a list of things that you would like to have improved but nothing was ever heard. Also the pricing to live there is over priced. One guy lived there for almost 8 Years and paid OVER ONE AND A HALF MILLION DOLLARS. To just live as a normal human being with under quality service and terrible food. For the price they pay there Brookdale should have staff for laundry, dinning room, cleaning, and for day to day help. Not two employees working an 8 hour shift, taking care of 42+ residents, serving food, doing dishes, taking garbage out, giving out medicine, doing laundry, and showers. FOR THE PRICE RESIDENTS PAY THEY SHOULD BE GETTING TREMENDOUS SERVICE, ASTOUNDING FOOD, AND BEAUTIFULLY FOLDED LAUNDRY. END OF STORY."
bad,The ED is very rude and does not care about the residents. The managers only care about money. They will not get on the floor to help the employees out when we were short on staff. They were very rude about working with schedules. DO NOT WORK HERE!!!! They did not pay nearly as much as we should have gotten for the workload.
bad,I worked there 6 months pay was horrible my boss was a horrible person to work for if she didn’t like you boy oh boy she piled the work on you had a new person come in did not follow directions got away with a lot of stuff she should never got away with yelling and screaming and cussing me out and my boss allowed her to stay there took it to the manager and still. Nothing
bad,"first off, the place is falling apart. leaking water in lobby, and a wallway and they dont do nothing about it for 2 years i heard. i was there for 6mths. 2nd, they all new my back was messed up, ( bone on bone) and they gave me the one shift i told them i coulnt do. (wen i was hired for N.O.C) 10pm-6am.. 3rd the staff.. there all are rude to the ppl who live there. waiting cuz they dont want to go back to the room 2 times in 30 mins. got mad at me wen i did go see what they needed and then i would get some of the ppl poppcorn an took it to there rooms. cuz its hard for some to walk. i got yelled at more then once for that..and they all think they are better then you.  4th, the bosses play favorites with the R.A's if they dont like you, they will play with your hrs like they did me. 40 hrs a week to 15 to 25 to 20 to 30. i did like this place wen i started. anyways, i could keep going but i will stop there. i hope this helps. thank u for ur time.."
bad,"This location prides itself on the care and treatment of its patients, alongside with their families needs. Care Providers were entrusted with the safety and management of the patients, which often lead to stressful encounters due to lack of support from coworkers and or supervisors."
bad,"This is a very demanding job. You are the only caregiver of over 30 residents. You provide activities of daily living assistance (bathing, dressing, housekeeping, socialization, nonmedical health services). Staff will tell you the med tec is also a caregiver but that position is very time consuming and does not allow for caregiving assistance. They do not have a Director of Nursing they use an LPN who is often not adequately educated or supported by management to fulfill their duties adequately."
bad,"While the place looks nice, they treat their employees terrible. Micro-management is the biggest issue! I was over being treated like a 3 year old that needed to be told what to do. I knew how to do my job, very well yet I wasn’t treated with respect. You will be told Thank you for the extra they expect you to do, but in the same breathe be told but..... Management will tell you, if you need anything do not heaitate to ask. Management will also make up excuses as to why they cannot help when you really need it."
bad,"The only reason I stayed is because the man I private sat. The management is horrible. You get yearly raises by .25 which is sad. When you work for them they only tell you what they want about the patient but theirs more my patient was diagnosed with more than what they told me and I had got to deal with it but I respected him because he was a vet. I was smarter and knew more than than the lazy med techs getting paid 11hr coming 2 hr late on his meds. This man pays over $2000.00 a month to get taking care of you should be giving him 5 star meals, quality service and everything. But all Brookdale in Kerrville Tx cares about is money I left and god bless that man."
bad,Managers don’t respekt team and have favorites. They don’t care for residents. Issues are not getting fixed. Corporate doesn’t care for short stuff situation.
bad,"Not enough help, ever. Too cheap to staff floor help properly. Putting the patients at risk. And rushing the nursing staff all day. I'd never work for this industry again."
bad,"Don’t fall for thinking this will be any fun, or a rewarding career. Most community leaders are obnoxious, and regional leadership is blind— just as obnoxious. There’s no teamwork or culture, or encouragement from your peers. Culture is non existent. Great corporate training... back in the real world the field leadership could care less."
bad,The most important part of my job was interacting with the residents cleaning the residence apartment having a companionship with the resident I was a very detailed housekeeper
bad,"roaches everywhere so if u enjoy working with roaches and beingtold tokill the roaches by management teamthis is the place for you,all management caresabout is yhere paychecks supervisors are all kids and they only promotes female canidates ay this local"
bad,There is a cook on staff who is abusive and controlling  his belittling behavior is unacceptable towards the dining staff  management tolerates this individual without proper reprimand I also have to say after working there I  would  not give that place a satisfactory sanitary review either
bad,"Frequent Management turn over "
bad,Please if your gonna apply at brookdale save yourself from here management don't know how to run the place and don't care about there associatesno fun
bad,"working an entire agency with mostly contract staff and even they seem to burn out and terminate there contracts early, it is the craziest and most mismanaged place I've ever been."
bad,There's a lot to say about this company but all I'm going to say is its a depressing horrible place to work. This is not a place for a career. Don't work here
bad,"Screw this place ! RUN FAST AWAY FROM THIS PLACE! Only off one weekend a month ! The management forever wrote people up based off HE SAID SHE SAID STUFF NO PROOF ! The co-workers are forever trying to find ways to complain, get out of less work, and basically get you fired ! I never missed a day or had a call in yet I was always being called in the office for petty things. The Co-Workers would train you one way then you’d get in trouble because of the way they trained you. They also had residents that’ were bed ridden which was not allow but the did it for the money ultimately making us work more harder than we had to"
bad,"Worked many hours, staff was mostly agency, and the permanent staff turnover was the most I have ever seen. There is not enough money for me to ever work there again or send anyone else there to work"
bad,"My schedule was always inconsistent, some days I closed then opened back to back. I was brand new just starting out and was alone opening and closing on those days. I would be scheduled for 10 hours and then set to open the next morning. I had no time for family and I never got my lunch breaks until almost time for me to leave. I saw so many health violations and the way some workers talk to the residents is just horrifying. Also when they say “see something, say something”, that’s a trap. They do not listen or fix any issues that you bring to their attention."
bad,"Worst job I’ve ever had. Poorly managed, under appreciated employee base, low quality training, poorly balanced budget, and high turn over rate. Witnessed poor treatment of residents on many occasions."
bad,"I gave my heart and soul to this place for over 2 years. I never received appropriate training and asked for help for months and it all fell on deaf ears. I was on my own! The job was never ending with working 12+ hours a day and not so much as a ""thank you""! AND phone calls and text message all night long until I went in the next morning. There is NO work life balance! They OWN you! 24/7/365! No matter what you do,it's never enough! I never took a lunch, eating at my desk. I even made sales! They do not care about the residents at all! All they care about is filling the building! The ED is heartless and when a resident passed away, her first statement was always ""we can charge them until they get their stuff out of the room, so I'm in no hurry to have them get it out"". When I started working there, the building was a complete nightmare, 2/3 full and horrible care staff! All of the caregivers were related to each other and made their own schedules! Most of them didn't speak English, so the residents, who already have dementia, had a hard time communicating with them. They didn't do their jobs even half way satisfactory. I completely revamped the staff and got good, caring, qualified caregivers in there. I was told by providers, that I completely turned  the building around and I was the reason that the POAs were so happy. We were always understaffed because they pay caregiver a lousy $12.00 per hour to take care of 14 residents. I was expected to fill in on the floor including 3rd shift, even if it meant me being up for 24 hours at a time! When I first started, there were lots"
bad,Poor management and hours are always cut. You are always overworked and underpaid. The house keepers are treated like nobody and has the worst jobs to do. They lie about overtime and and always expect you to be happy about working at a place that treat you like nothing... It's really a good to job to have until you find a better one
bad,"Corporate is crooked. If staff don't want to work, they just cry and play some ""card"" and they don't have to work... well guess who suffers... residents are being neglected, possibly even dying, bc corporate regional staff more worried about selling a bed than they are taking care of residents. worst place ever to work if you have any ethics. the regional staff are under qualified and no backbone. its all about BD profit and not about patient care. facility can't stay out of regulatory trouble bc of it's management. RUN as employee but most of all as a patient, especially at the SNFs."
bad,"They had very little care for staff and residents when I was working there. Cleaning was good, food was prepared properly. How ever those are really the only two things I can think of that you were trained adequately for or that were done properly. There were several incidences with residents that were ignored or brushed off. A lot of the care givers really did not show the proper care for the residents they were supposed to be caring for."
bad,"The place was run by people who were there for themselves only. It was a very dismal environment. The building needed a lot of repair and updates. Everything was done cheaply. It was a dirty place to work in. Furniture in the lobby was old & needed to be updated. Common rooms needed paint, and carpet is smelly and so dirty."
bad,My average day was to come in  start with morning meeting and go about the day with cooking serving meals. also deal with any issues that might have come up during the day.  This place was a horrible place to work
bad,"Pay is horrible for what you have to do! They accept residents that have no business being in Assisted Living, but as long as their family can write a check, they will take them. Limited to no activities for residents. And of Course, you will get nowhere unless you play managements games and become their puppets."
bad,Management Sucks they are unorganized plus they only pay 10.00 which only a teenager can live off 500 or 600 every 2 Weeks! The employees half do their job so others have to pick up slack and the communication it HORRIBLE with HR & MANAGEMENT! It’s really a money hungry organization if you ask me.
bad,I worked as a server as a part time with fulltime hours never got the correct pay. The coworkers were bossy rude and talked behind your back. Hr didnt care how about you felt. I went back to brookdale to apply for caregiver they wouldn't move me up they said they put in my background check when they never did brookdale is full of lies and promises
bad,"Would give a 0 if I could. Horrible facility. Wouldn’t recommend. Not a place to grow. Only friends of the DON are moved up. On call did not answer calls, DON argued with people rather than help."
bad,"I adored my job and the people I worked with for almost 4 years. I got a job with a brookdale after highschool and I worked there until recently. I was heartbroken to quit, the work load kept building to amount where none of us should have been working. I got injured and as they took care of my injuries with workers comp I had gotten so discouraged with the looks and the outsider approach everyone had given me. Its a good job if youre willing to stand your ground and not just go with the flow, its absolutely a job for someone who loves to care for other people."
bad,DO not work here. This is not the place you want to spend your time. The money can be good but the drama is consistent. The latter will always outdo the first.
bad,"All Managers treat some people better than others, when you tell them about what a person has done if they like that person they don't believe it but if they don't like that person they will belive it."
bad,"Place sucks, I got reduced hours and did not recieve specified training as when I first got hired. I would not work here ever again, just minimal benefits from the place at all and not many, if at all any opportunities to advance."
bad,"Favoritism, gossip, lack of organisation, terrible staffing issues, management that doesn't work, bored residents, dull food options, empty promises, and just an overall horrid place to work."
bad,"This place was always understaffed, employees were always asked to pull double shifts after working a hard day of work because your day is consist of not only assisting Residents with ADLs, but serving meals, the kitchen ware and the dishes from the Residents and that had to be worked out between the RAs to alternate each other's assigned Residents that they were responsible for. No appreciation from management, just complaints."
bad,Horrible management.  Spends more time on lunch and frivolous items than on residents. Never promotes anyone   Treats employees with disrespect.  Does not deserve the position they are given.  No corporate support.
bad,"We switched to working four 12 hour shifts a week because we were so short staffed and it was burning people out.  The management was horrible. Didn't care about anything and trated you like gum on the bottom on their shoe and acted like you didn't know anything about the residents even though we were the ones that were with them all the time. Management never left their offices to help on the floor when needed only yelled at us through the walkies unless state was there, then it was all sunshine and rainbows and better be on your best behavior. Terrible pay for what you do there."
bad,"I love being a Caregiver/CNA but I have never worked for a company who treated its employees like cattle. Extreme supervisor employee intimidation, Management ganging up of employees they do not like and the kitchen Management treated you like dirt and talked about you in Spanish to the other Hispanic employees."
bad,Bad benefits and management. It starts off as a team but however you have to worry about yourself and your job. Great elderly people that you get close to but company itself no.
bad,"I feel sorry for anybody who gets to work here. Terrible wages and management makes the work environment terrible. Love the residents hate the workers. Aids are lazy and nobody actually does anything but complain. I hate this job with a burning passion. I am responsable for so much but get so little. I work all the time but my paycheck is actual trash. Therefore, I don't recommend working there at all."
bad,They have very poor management...extremely unprofessional an they don’t listen to their employees..when you tell management something personal everyone finds out..they treat all their staff like they are disposable..they play favoritism..which means they may like someone better than you an they let it be known. Also in my case they didn’t want to let me take a vacation even though I requested 2 months ahead of time
bad,This is the worst company I have ever worked for . There was no nurse manager on duty. The office manager served as a nurse manager. She was a joke! They hired people off the streets with no experience whatsoever and expected them to know how to care for the older folks.
bad,Loved my residents and some of my co workers but they hire to many young people who think they know what there doing but in the end they don’t. And the young ppl they hire treat the residents like bad Management sucks especially the on calls they will never cover shift if  someone calls in. I would never recommend anyone to work there.
bad,DO NOT WORK FOR THIS PLACE IT IS HORRIBLE AND THEY TREAT THERE RESIDENTS HORRIBLE !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Do not even apply they leave residents sitting in their urine for hours and when you tell them you are going to change the residents they tell you to wait till you put the resident to bed to change them
bad,Working at Brookdale at first was okay but then if you stay to yourself don't be messy your being mean or should I say intimidating because you're not talkin to other employees or gossiping about nothing working here was a headache very unprofessional they have no staff so employees were mistreating resident the management does not have no professionalism.
bad,The only reason I gave this company 1 star is because I didn’t have the option of no stars. I worked at Brookdale in Cary. Chapel Hill Road. They are not appreciative whatsoever. Just work and work and work. No motivation from managers. They just nitpick and treat the job like a boot camp and wonder why all their employees quit. They need a complete revamp of management. The place is disgusting. Constant quarantine for nasty viruses and rashes.
bad,"Hated working here. Constantly understaffed. Forced to stay past scheduled time if next shift didn't show up. Horrible management. Do not know how to schedule. Residents can be very nasty towards the aides. Nurses are very rude and never help, but are always sitting around at their station doing nothing or gossiping. You get one 30 minute break for lunch during 8 hour shift. Sometimes this break is missed if you are understaffed and your supervisor does not let you go, but 30 minutes are still taken out of your paycheck."
bad,"•Very toxic environment"
bad,"They will work you and use you, they don’t care about your outside life, Brookdale Senior Living In Rockwall, TX has treated me poorly and worked me every single day. I hope nobody else let them take advantage of them.👎🏾👎🏾👎🏾"
bad,"Bedbugs and louse are rampant. Employees steal money from residents and their snacks bought by family. As an Aide you have to pass meds, total patient care, wait and bust tables, cook when the cooks are late, do laundry and deep clean house keeping because you are hired as a universal employee not hired as a CNA, CMA or ACMA, you also clean the kitchen and wash dishes because they do not hire house keepers, you also shampoo carpets. The pay is real low and they only promote their personal friends within the company."
bad,"terrible place to work. always understaffed and management doesn't care about staff or resident. back breaking work, resident are horrible. the ED is the worst entitled and bratty. drinks on the job too."
bad,"Management is awful!!! Supervisors only love their pets and puppets..raises are only given if they can pull your string not by work performance nor excellent annual reviews"
bad,"Management is always uncertain. It always seems like every one is just looking out for themselves. Plus, everyone talks about ""teamwork"" and how everyone should do their best to help one another, yet they themselves don't follow what they tell us."
bad,"Management is terrible and doesn't provide proper care for residents while over charging significantly and abusing the power of billing to amount of times basic care is needed. If you care about the residents and do your job correctly, you get written up for going above management after warnings and reporting resident abuse."
bad,Lovable resident just not enough caring and loving back. You have some people who's there because they love what they do and you have some that is just there for a check know the difference
bad,"management and team horrible "
bad,This place is absolutely the worst place to work in leesburg. The turn over rate is so high because the management treats you like you are nothing but the trash you are barely paid to pick up. Do yourself a favor and dont apply here!
bad,"Very stressful environment."
bad,Work there too many RA are not good ! Leader control everything.give section out. But don't even resident out in section.Leader take section with only 2people to do and you doing more people. What a leader. Get all the overtime they want. Just Bad jugdement. Boss is young so they don't know how to do discipline action on them. Make you server food.and clean up.Hey I don't remember put a application in dining service. I work at long term. And I swear I'm doing more work over here then I did at long-term!!!!!! We're stay in the department we work for.
bad,"This is by far the worst company I have ever worked for and I am only 6 months in. This company has the worst home life balance-accrued time off only 4 hrs every two weeks, no sick time, only 4  holidays, very poor pay, stressful environment, highly micromanaged "" they pull logs on work you done for the day, calls, etc ""metrics"" the company gives you other departments work if they fall behind, largest turnover rate I have ever seen in a company- Just stay away!  and they make up titles for employees and promote unworthy employees (you did not earn that position)! "
bad,This was a good first work experience for me. I did enjoy working with the residents and helping them with what they need because that’s just the type of person I am. However the management here was inconsistent. My boss was constantly unprofessional and he treated us poorly. I wouldn’t recommend this job to anyone.
bad,The management are dirty people they will do you anyway they dont care about their employees i traveled two hours to work work 16 hours shifts and still wasnt appreciated i loved the residents but head manageent some not at te nurse and ed were horriable when i decided i wasnt gonna quit they stil wsnt me to work overnights as prn
bad,Bad work envirment the managment was terrible and no one would stay as aides or as nurse or as managment. everyonr there was very rude and hateful and they pin pointed aides if they didnt like you and it wasnt fair to hardworking aides who was there to get their job done and be there for their residnets.
bad,"Beautiful building,  horrible company.  Cliquey,  will throw you under the bus and lie on you. Nepotism. Laziness is rewarded. Low wages. They expect you to be 2 or 3 people at work,  but only want to pay you for half a job. Lots of rude administration."
bad,"Unethical, poor upper management, inappropriate residents just to fill units. Lack of training. Assocoates hired out of desperation instead of right fit."
bad,"Brookdale is a lie."
bad,"Management would staff the building properly. They would take what little staff from Clare Bridge (MC) and send them out to the AL side."
bad,Residents  do not get taken care of . They do not get very good care . They are way under staff . But when state rolls through the doors they have so many people in there that they are running over top of each other. I have worked in there with all of south  to my self  2 aids to the whole building  and one in rehab.   Residents  laying in their beds wet and soiled.  It's just not a very good place at all.
bad,I've been working for Brookdale San Jose for almost a year and in that year Licensing has been there MORE than 12 times!!!Run as fast and as far away from this place as possible.
bad,"Not worth your time unless you have a higher certification to make more money... you are not recognized for working harder than anyone else, they’re always understaffed, and miserable management."
bad,"I had worked at Brookdale in Attleboro Mass facility. Looks very nice on outside. "
bad,"I loved this job at first. But as time went on it got worse. Only a few coworkers are willing to help you when its needed. Its super stressful. You have a list of things to do and hardly any time to finish it because you get busy helping a resident. Management doesn't listen. People including management are quitting left and right. No time for breaks, Pay is not enough. Super short staffed. 1 caregiver per floor."
bad,"Easy burnout....required more than what the salary was."
bad,"Brookdale Senior Living is nothing but a money pit for residents. They charge too much and get nothing in return. The chef is only allowed to spend $5.35 cents a day, (not per meal), per resident. She was fired because she kept going over budget to feed her residents. The corporate office is only worried about the bottom line. Every facility has high turnover because they don't respect their management team."
bad,"long no mangers in sight "
bad,"I loved the people I worked side by side with on a day to day. Management talks bad about others personal lives to other staff members. Their priorities are focused in the wrong places. The staff is over worked and under paid. They do not care about the extra work and stress they put on staff, as long as management looks good to corporate. You go to management with complaints or concerns, don’t expect anything to get resolved until corporate finds out and gets down their throat about it. Med techs and RAs are WAY underpaid. You work hard, get no recognition, you make one mistake you’re a bad employee. DO NOT do this to yourself. I’m glad I was taken out of there"
bad,Management did not really care for residents even when they pretended to care. Many residents broke out in rashes and they didn’t care at all. Multiple two people assist and when we would bring that up to them they would catch and attitude. You would get talked down on or like you were stupid. A lot of turnover for caregivers they ran all the good people off and then want to complain.
bad,"Not a good person, my wife left me and i lost it at work and she called me a weirdo. It was a terrible place to work in general, always  dealing with cranky senior citizens who would order something and forget and then get mad at you."
bad,"The whole experience was bad. Management played favorites,  they fire people at the drop of a hat for no reason if there position was wanted by someone else. Neglect is overlooked on a regular basis. If you bring neglect to managements attention you put your job at risk."
bad,"If you like being over worked under paid and not appreciated this is the perfect place for you!  If you have a problem you better just shut up and deal with it, bring it too managements attention and youll put a target on your own back, try to utilize the joke they call the ""Integrity Line"" and you'll be bullied by corporate lawyers. But if you neglect and mistreat your patients you'll probably get a raise and a pat on the back.  What a joke!"
bad,They use employees until they get so tired from being overworked and under paid. Worked there for 5 years and they throw you away like a bag of trash.
bad,Environment is lead by Caucasian women and Caucasian gay men primarily.  There was not a comfortable environment for me within the organization.  I do not recommend this organization.
bad,dont work there at all they will wast your time where you could be at another job making money it use to be a good job but it turn bad real qick its a wast of time
bad,This was the worst facility that I've worked at in all my 9 years of working in healthcare. The management was absolutely terrible never made 1st or 2nd shift work at all everything was put off for 3rd shift. There's a corporate women in the building and she's terrible nothing is being changed nor fixed. From the lack of caring during the day mostly all the resident's end up sick even with the office people there to observe they do nothing vut sit in the office while the Resident's care providers are off doing their own thing. 3rd shift does all the work and gets no type of acknowledgement. They have a LPN nurse not even a Registered nurse working in the building so the resident's are never really checked by her.
bad,Felt like I had to fight to get the job I was doing for months. The pay I received was a lot less than person before me . That person was male. He was making three dollars more than me.
bad,"Brookedale is trash, they accused me of “abusing” residents saying I was doing this and that but I wasn’t even working with the resident I “abused” brookedale is a joke I wouldn’t recommend it to anyone they are poorly staffed, they don’t help you with anything and they treat you like dirt there I hope they get shut down"
bad,"This job is stressful as the number of residents moving into Brookdale are increasing and the number of dining staff is decreasing. The manager of the dining room does not fulfill his responsibilities and doesn't help during busy meal times. The pay is not enough for all the responsibilities that the servers have, especially since there aren't enough servers."
bad,Day drinking supervisors and crew. Neglect if residents and breach of HIPPA rules by staff. Racial discrimination and back lash for reaching higher. Leaking building and unsafe staff. Horrible hours and pay. Not in any a disgruntled employee the residents deserve to be looked after as if they are family not eldelt waiting their demise or burdens it's sad to hear the workers treat the residents also management. Sexual harrassment and loss of job if you call the hotline to bring some justice to those who abuse their power and position it's just sad environment in all.
bad,"Very stressful work environment,lazy management,and alot of drama from house keeping department. Managers not willing to lend a hand and help in their department (maintenance) mostly... Stay away... little pay.for the job."
bad,"Brook dale was a hard place to work, there was never sufficient staff. The management didn’t care and expected a lot when there was never enough people to get things done."
bad,Management was ruthless and lied to residents. The atmosphere was stressful and full of Drama. Pay was terrible. The only enjoyable part of this job is the Residents.
bad,They over work their employees which is why they are under staffed part time makes more then full time and they have full time hours. Brookdale doesn't give you benefits even paid time off they don't give you that either without trying to call you in. Definitely would not recommend living or working there
bad,"I didn't like working there!! Staff was always short no matter what shift,residents are great! Management didn't care about any one but their sleves! Dont recommend"
bad,"Not good , fast paced without time to help residents properly, they always told us they were trying to get more help, they have a very very high turnover rate."
bad,You have to be fast paced and work extra hard with no help what so ever. You have to manage on your own to figure out how to get things done before your shift is over.
bad,"Terrible management. Terrible staff. Borderline abuse to the residents, illegal activity, and seemingly nobody cleans anything. I would not recommend this place for employment OR senior living solution for ANYONE."
bad,"Everything at Brookdale Senior Living in Minnetonka is horrible. There is a high turn over in every department. No one in places of management (kitchening, housekeeping, nursing, etc) has been there over a year. They change the rules all the times and will pull you to work in a different area even when your uncomfortable. The culture is basically the worker verse the front office. Working here your better off calling cooperate then going to HR about a problem."
bad,I don't recommend this place to anyone. Management team seems that they don't have enough experience to manage this place. No communication. Short of staffing all the time. Management belittling nurses all the time. They hire always new nurses .most of the time this new nurses quit before they finish their training.  No teamwork. They put patients from skilled in long term care. I don't recommend this place  to anyone.
bad,"New management that did not provide proper training. Expected the nurses to perform skills which they had not been properly trained to complete"
bad,A lot of favorites if your not a favorite your hours will be cut. Attitudes are bad they don’t know who to speck they would rather give orders and dont change
bad,Once volunteering time to help a team that is completely under staffed they would take full advantage in utilizing your number & calls would be made after business hours.
bad,"The company was always in constant stress. "
bad,The management was very poor.  The equipment need to be updated and trying to get it serviced was horrible.  The Residents were not treated very well by a lot of the staff.
bad,Money driven Corp that’s all smoke and mirrors. Cutthroat. Dishonest. Make leadership had considerably higher salaries. Lots of constant turnover. Inappropriate assessments.
bad,Terrible management. Dirty environment. Unreliable coworkers. Terrible pay. Always understaffed. No help from management. Poor inventory control. no uniforms provided or compensated for. Stressful work environment all around.
bad,"management have favorite and bias ,lack for experience of leadership,have poor approaching employee ,have no consideration ,always short staff ,not having enough experience to management who manage the company"
bad,Run fast! Poor managment. Management lacked and gossip work environment. Lack of staff to effectivity run company. Very stressful work environment left employees with tense personal and work lives.
bad,"Worst place to work.  Management doesnt care one single bit about how hard everyone works. All med techs are overworked because no one wants to work there.  Have to work overtime but you never see the management work on the weekends or stay late.  It is horrible, they dont care about you. They use you."
bad,This place is terrible. Awful managers and treat their residents awful. Do not work here the pay is terrible for and they treat people like they don’t care. Do not do it...
bad,Management is poor. I learned to not let co-workers take advantage of you. The hardest part was letting the residents into your heart. Seeing the residents everyday made me smile.
bad,"I don’t recommend nobody to work there the pay rate is to low and you barely get hours the service is horrible , I feel like it’s a kid in high school job"
bad,"Lacks structure, management might as well not be there. I worked there for 2 years and I was there for the residents I assure you because the pay was not worth it. Management likes to make up rules as they go rather than following the handbook. Corporate was called several times, not by employees but by the residents because they were sick and tired of the employees getting treated like slaves. I would never recommend someone working here unless you are really wanting to be over worked for 9 dollars an hour and have your hours cut if you are forced into overtime so they can get a bonus on their checks (overheard managers talking about why they short us hours on our checks). Management does NOT care about their employees, they care about the number of people that are living there."
bad,"The ideals and values behind Brookdale are excellent however what is said and what is expected are entirely different. Horrible management, residents treated poorly. Lack of compassion and awareness for the resident needs. I learned that companies like this only care about the bottom line minimal effort with maximum financial gain. I thoroughly enjoyed caring fort the residents. The company knows their directors/mangers are all about making money but keep them anyhow in turn, losing hard working and caring employees."
bad,"The local office is run by women who are stuck in ""mean girl high school mode"". Home office lets them do whatever they want to do because they are profitable. Was a really great place to work with great benefits and pay - before the mean girls took over. So sad !!"
bad,"things change to quickly with no time to adjust to the last change, very unprofessional, I was really not a big fan of the callout policy considering I have children"
bad,don't waste your time trying to work for these people they treat you like dung and run you into the ground and than pass you up for advancement even if you are more qualified than all the other people that are there and you have proven yourself time and time again
bad,"Management never works on solutions to problems, has ""favorites"" among staff and residents are not often taken care of properly. Staff lack compassion and aren't paid enough to keep the good ones around"
bad,"I had the worst experience working at Brookdale"
bad,Worked under better conditions overworked under paid unappreciated cut throat .Typical day management walking right pass you and don't speak. Frowning on over worked employees blatantly showing a disregard for employees. Assisted Living facility operated like a nursing home but pay less.
bad,Poor management this is the worst company ever by far!Very unprofessional.  Residents are treated poorly and most of the staff are unprofessional. And the facility is very nasty.
bad,Highly dislike working for this company. Management is very unprofessional. I would never go back to this company. They don't work well with your schedule. They tell you that you can have a day off you requested just to turn around and have you scheduled that day even though you requested off.
bad,"Serving contaminated food to residents, the cook had a swollen red eye, no patch over the eye, no gloves, serving food,  another cook making meatballs without gloves waching football on his little Tv. Go in to the walk in and see the spoiled vegetables. Knats  everywhre and they serve food.  The health department passed them.  Go figure."
bad,"Terrible place to work . They don’t work with your school schedule if you go to school, they want you coming in on off days & then if you don’t they make you feel bad about it. They have their favorite employees favoritism is well seen. You get no help from other CNAs it’s like working with 12 patients all by yourself"
bad,"Poor management"
bad,Brookdale Senior Living was a horrible place to work. They underpay all their staff and expect way too much out of them. On top of that there was mean-spirited people that work there that love to throw you underneath the bus.
bad,There was not enough help for all the residents. I do not feel there needs were being properly met. I felt the staff was very overworked and tired so could not perform there duties well. I loved the residents and my job. But being in charge I'd hundreds of them and only one person.over night was not right for them or me.
bad,Brookdale is the McDonalds of assisted living and memory care. Bottom of the barrel in every sense of the word.
bad,It was ok when I first started because they were short staffed and they need help I was getting hours. No longer needed they so I'm not working unless they need help.
bad,"Most horrible place to work, I wouldnt reccommenend my worst ememy a job there. Management I horrible, they only care about making money and not the people living there."
bad,"Poor work environment, dishonest management, staff are bitter and distrustful... an unfortunate situation as healthcare for dementia patients is so very important."
bad,The residents are the most important priorities there. Yet the workers are getting overworked and not getting paid. They continuously messed up on emplyees hours and pay checks.
bad,"The company is very unorganized and has a ""I don't care about the staff attitude"". They do not give you the tools that you need to be successful. This company is by far the worst company I have ever worked for."
bad,The management is the worse. I was trained one day and  that was it. It took me months to find out was going on. The E.D was sick for 1st month and I had to run the building alone.
bad,What I learned by working at Brookdale was that even if you are still doing your job management will find any reason to get rid of you if they don't think that you are a benefit to their company.
bad,"My job is part-time and they didn't explain the information enough to me before I started. My position is PRN and they change my hours constantly. Management doesn't communicate with me about hour changes reasonably. It's a nice place to work if you have full-time work but in my case, I don't have enough security."
bad,Been an employee for some years now. This community in particular has poor managing. The employees are underpaid and overworked and unappreciated. You will be taken advantage of if you do not know your workers right. Knowledge is key.
bad,"I would not send my worse enemy to work or become a resident here."
bad,Management is horrible they were not in my side after being sexually harassed.very unappreciative tward hard working staff. They do things outside if the book and its not fair to staff and residents
bad,I enjoyed  working  at Brookdale  . If they had better  management  . I would  still be working for  Brookdale.  The Dinning Room Management was so disrespectful to the staff.  An know  one would  anything  about  it .I enjoyed working  with the residence  am they'll  family.
bad,i really like it but i didn't like how the manger that was at brookdeal because they dont  no how to manger. i just dont like thee manger they really dont no what they doing we have to get are own check stub.
bad,"We were always running out of necessary supplies, cups, spoons, gloves, detergent, garbage bags.  Poor planning from management.  Bad attitudes from management, who would come in to work only if they felt like it."
bad,"comapany pays poorly and wants meracles to happen with there employees,do not work for brookdale it is not worth it trust me go look for another job..."
bad,"Worked as a RN Case Manager for home health in Brookdale buildings. Most cases were related to diabetes, CHF, medication management, or Psychiatric issues, with occasional wound care cases. Not much driving, but a very cut throat culture in the company. While working there it was rated as 1 of the 5 worst companies in the country to work for."
bad,Always babysitting staff and putting out fires with the families. Too much work load for a days time . Top management  works anytime and never available for family and residents. Skilled patients in alf with little staff to properly care for them.
bad,I liked it at first and then I didn't cause it became very stressful towards the end and I won't recommend it to anyone and they really don't care if you're sick or not
bad,"Management (ED) only wants head in the bed and will do anything to get it. Even at the expense of the staff. Takes residents who are not appropriate and are actually dangerous. Sales is out for the old mighty dollar,and with no experience in healthcare will go as far as to lie to resident and families to get them sign. If you work over 8 hours you are in trouble and if you go over 40 hours per week, they will actually not pay you."
bad,This place is full of drama and the Executive Director is totally incompetent. I brought several issues to her attention non where resolved the employees where instead where offered to go to school on the companies dime.
bad,"Horrible place to work, the kitchen manager is extremely rude and fires people on the spot with out a reason. Staff is rude and does not care for their residents."
bad,"I was very excited when I was hired, as I felt strongly that my experience and background was a perfect fit. The truth is that accepting this job was one of worst decisions of my life. Honestly. The workload was impossible and unsupported. The ED and BM were always either shut in one of their offices or not in the office. "
bad,ceo stole money and we were forced to be bought out by golden living.  all employees at emeritus  in management lost there jobs.  residents were not taken care of and left to die on countless days and nights.
bad,"this is by far the worst place to work at. the management is horrible, rude, talk down on their staffs and residents and just evil especially the supervisor. staffs are always leaving its so unorganized , overall terrible place to work at"
bad,"They Do Not take care of their residents , certain employees got away with stuff on not doing their jobs. If you said anything to management you were told to do your own job and not say anything about another department that wasn't doing theirs . When I started at this building in 2005, it was privately owned and the staff and management did great on taking care of the residents. Now I wouldn't suggest anyone to work or even a resident to stay there."
bad,"Brookdale is overrated. Horrible company to work for, the care is less than average, the management is deplorable. Although the property was beautiful, the cleanliness was less than acceptable. I wouldn't move my loved ones in there facility."
bad,"Management is very unorganized and unprofessional. This is supposed to be an assisted living community, but they allow people to reside there that require more care."
bad,very unpleasant experience. This workplace was very unprofessional. It was extremely stressful and that was not due to the actual workload. There was no training.
bad,"Your shifts are not even four hours long, paid very low, manager always made me work on days when i had class in springfield when i told her not to because it would make me late, and you deal with the elderly."
bad,"The environment was not clean and dangerously understaffed. I would not recommend this place for employment. There were no gloves, medium briefs, or wet wipes for long periods of time making it difficult to properly and safely care for residents."
bad,Treat you terrible and will threaten you if you try to quit. Will tell you that you will not be able to work at any other Brookdale Facility. If you need a job go for it. If you can do better pass.
bad,"Great residents to work with, a good facility. overall a good company. Good location. A lot of Discrimination without any investigation, talking down to employees."
bad,"The most  enjoyable  part  is the residents, the management  is horrible  and is a place for gossip  you would think the residents were the hardest  part  of  the  job but it's management  and coworkers"
bad,the job was great but the management wasn't as I expected... very rude and never kept there word... always blamed me for something that wasn't my fault and told me that's not a good excuse...bad place but loved what I did and miss my residents
bad,Treat employees poorly and there is no support.  Unrealistic expectations without proper training. Management is not present for support.  Do not take the time to care for residents appropriately.
bad,"i was a server, and a busser and a dishwasher and only got paid 8 dollars an hour even when i would go over time.the place was vry unorganized and unprofessional from the way they talked about other people and the seniors. I believe that work is work, not a gossip central."
bad,Brookdale is a cheap corporation! Associates are not allowed to come within sniffing distance of 40 hours and absolutely NO overtime pay! Benefits suck!! Managers get free lunches while the working poor don't.
bad,"management is prejudice. no bonuses. overworked and underpaid. contant turnovers and no raises. they continue taking residents that belong in a nursing home, not assisted living."
bad,"Would be a great place to work if there were more team work, less sabotage against care team members and better compensation, moreover,better pay for care team members. The company needs to improve on seniority for care team in place before new employees."
bad,Working with Brookdale does not offer one a career advancement. They do not encourage learning about the different jobs within the building you work. They also have poor management techniques and do not care about your family issues.
bad,Working short staffed is a typical day with zero support or help from management. Myself personally have learned what a poor manager exemplifies. Management shows minimum appreciation for their staff. Workplace culture is very hostile and derogatory. The hardest part of the job is the job culture. The most enjoyable part of the job is taking care of the needs of seniors.
bad,"The staff is over worked and under paid, I would constantly be asked to work over time, the residents were not taken care of properly, you're hired as part time but worked 40 plus hours a week, and get no benefits. The facility is gross and the management is rude and could care less about you. Its labeled as assisted living but you have to lift residents that are 5 times your weight."
bad,"The management and co workers are very disorganized and a disaster. The communication through management and staff is very poor, they make the staff look like they don't know what they are doing and the management does not care, the management is a joke and a push over."
bad,excutive director is not good she is very disrespectful very Races theres not respect there mangers are very rude they dont have teamwork excutive director lies alot to workers and residents
bad,"Management is not supportive its evry man/woman for himself they don't support their nursing staff, all they care about is protecting their jobs."
bad,One of the worse place I've ever worked. Extreme drama between all the staff. Staff will lie about you to get you in trouble. This job has  favoritism so you better be kissing someone's butt to go up in the facility.  They are always short so expect to work with 13 people with dementia by yourself.  The worst part is is if you're by yourself on the floor that's harder than another one and they have two people no one it's gonna come and help you.  If you work weekends your life is pretty much going to suck they never schedule anyone for weekends so you'll be by yourself every time.  There's not a nurse on duty at all times so med techs will be the so-called nurse they have no idea what they're doing especially if someone falls or is bleeding.  They are completely unorganized.  Don't expect the med techs to call family I mean that's too hard.
bad,terrible place to work. horrible management. rude coworkers. worked to death with no break per week. enjoyable part: helping residents.
bad,"ambiente de trabajo muy pobre y poco profesionalismo, decidi renunciar porque me dolia en el ambiente y condiciones en los que se encontraban los residentes y debido a mis principios religiosos decidi renunciar y no ser testigo de tantos malos tratos"
bad,It was a fun and wonderful place to work until i started and got fired because one of the residents urinated on me and i asked to go home and they told me that i had to sit in the persons urine till my shift was over and i refused and told them it was unsanitary and they told me if i was to go home than they were going to fire me. They were also unprofessional with the residents and didnt care for them properly.
bad,I accepted a position as ED of large independent living facility but quit after 10 months. The regional mgrs are horrible and the budgets given to the EDs make it impossible to provide proper care for the residents. The safety of the residents was always a concern and the community had many instances of theft as well as drug activity. Requests tor additional security or monitoring were denied. I realized that I gated my job after a month but kept on working until I could find another job. The pay for hourly employees is well below the industry standard and good employees will not stay due to the corp culture of profit. I would never place a loved one in any of their communities and strongly caution everyone. The stock price has tanked over the past year and corp is desperate to make more money.
bad,"I LOVE my residents and my co-workers, but the management is pathetic. Putting me on different shifts in one week is very hard; making it impossible to sleep at night, or at all."
bad,"Staff would eat at their desk all day. Unprofessional environment. Lots of gossip ,!"
bad,"Stay clear of this place!!! Staff are rude,  unprofessional and not helpful.  Was there for a month and couldn't stand it. Neither could the 3 higher up managers or exuctive director. They were always complaining about us MAs and RAs. They have so many open shifts and staff shortages its ridiculous.  Shut this place down and start over!"
bad,Poor upper management with little experience with people.  Poor company which is interested in office politics more than making a difference with people.
bad,"Management is horrible,  never want to help even when asked. They dont care about the residents just about the money. Very disrespectful and belittling. Machines dont work becauae maintenance never fixes them. Employees work doubles because they refuse to hire more people. Just overall worst experience, wouldn't recommend."
bad,"The management is awful. Very underhanded and lies to anybody that comes in for tour. They tell them anything to get them in and most of the time is untrue and then the floor staff has to deal with these families when certain services, etc. aren't true. They use drugs to keep them restrained. Nothing gets reported to the state. Orders just disappear from the charts as does narcotics! The pay is below going rate."
bad,They leave you with a hall by yourself and have to answer so many lights and then giving showers with a two people assistance they never help. Coworkers like worse then elementary school. You don't get nothing for a hard day working by yourself if someone calls off I just quit I will NEVER WORK FOR BROOKDALE IN MY LIFE AGAIN so I don't care if I don't get rehired.
bad,"Very unorganized, nurses are unpaid, never can keep staff, always working short. The most enjoyable part are the residents"
bad,"The manager had no background in medical care. He also hid it when I reported suspected abuse. He attempted to frame me for ""med errors"" that occurred on days I hadn't even worked. I had to medicate 52 residents, while also being a supervisor. The pay is terrible, and I was jipped out of over 40 hours PTO which I had accrued, as well as over $500 in OT pay. They have absolutely no idea what they're doing, and this place is horrifying. They will act nice, but don't be fooled. This is a dangerous place to work for anyone with a license."
bad,They had one lead in charge for years who always made sure she got the days off from work she wanted. She never filled in for called off shifts as was required of her position. She always made sure someone else covered the shift whether they had already worked five days or not. She claimed this under the we have the right to  change the schedule within 24 hours and you have to work it policy. The director did not support the staff at all and there were times when people had to work 10 days in a row without getting any over time. There was no family time as you could never go by the schedule and plan anything.
bad,"If your looking for a job that offers no security, considers 30 hrs full time and that's pretty much what you will get unless someone goes vacation and it won't be you because your pto accrues on hrs worked so you don't get 2 weeks a year but if your an OTR or PT you get paid for 40 hrs and don't  have to actually work a full load and get max benefits such as pto and not be accountable when you come in or leave and eligible for productivity bonuses and the list goes so to sum it up if your an assistant your pretty much treated like (****) . Don't fall for the hype bottom line is how much do you bring in for the company hince evals."
bad,"The culture of this company is to care for the residents using the least staffing possible, and to treat that staff like slaves. Management   offers no support to it's staff but berates and insults and blames them for their failure to maintain residents. Wake up if you pay 3 thousand a month you expect good food and care staff to be available to you when you need them. telling residents you can't help them set up doctor appointments is not what they expect  and feeding them food you would not serve your pets is why they leave. They take in sick residents to fill beds but do not give you the staffing to care for them. "
bad,I worked for horizonbay Clearwater for 10 years thru 3 company's and we were always full but as soon as brookdale took over our census fell almost in half the dinning service director was working with no cooks serving all 3 meals alone the regional people come in and blame the staff for the problems that brookdale has created in 2 months we went thru the director of dining services director of health and wellness marketing manager 2 memory care program directors and 2 executive directors last last executive director lasted 30 days all the staff hates working brookdale the moral in the building is terrible all they care about is the bottom line money they want you to work with no staff but at the same time do mountains of paperwork bottom line don't work for these people trust me they will break your spirit and they never look at themselves as the problem
bad,"The management is very bad a huge clique place the people who work and are about the resident are treat poorly. People who can suck up to management are rewarded.  Management do not care for residents at all.  They schedule single staff the floors for resident care takers putting resident and staff in harms way .  During holidays the management leave letters for nurses to deal with any issues do not contact them.  Management will not give you straight answers will give you the run around.  Executive director hired a friend to do activities in memory care, the guy sits on his computer watching videos never does activities unless corporate there.  The activity man does not help when single staffed just states he is not there to help with that stuff and shuts office door. It is a hard place to work.  The management  expect more then one person can do."
bad,"Mgmt does not have a clue. Understaffed in all areas. Supplies to perform your job are scarce. As a RA (resident associate) you are nothing more than a maid. If you're a CNA run as fast as you can away from all Brookdales. "
bad,its a wonderful  to get history back when residents  can tell you somethings and family is mostly helpful.having a behaviors are really tuff they don't know what they are doing and its sad that you can't make them understand.
bad,"If you are not corporate, you mean nothing. Minimum wage, no compensation for anything you do. I wouldn't recommend this place for employment to someone I hate."
bad,"I had absolutely no support in my position from the Executive Director to enrich the lives of the Residents at this community.  One of the companies cornerstones is ""Put the Residents First and the Bottom line will take care of itself""  The Residents are far from being this companies main priority.  They are only concerned with having reports look good, staying within budget, and getting their BIG bonuses.  They have no concern for the care of the residents or their line staff.  If you are not a SUCK UP to management they will find a way to make your life miserable.  If you are a Puppet......this will be your ideal job!"
bad,When management changed things seemed to go down. What I learned from this experience is that if your previous job was good don't leave it.
bad,"This branch of Brookdale called the Solana opened in 10/12 and they  started with very poor management as well as ownership of the facility, seniors complained about everything, from being cold in their rooms, to the food quality being poor when I was off. I was told it isn't any better although everyone that was there with me, has quit. so that leaves the ownership.I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THE SOLANA IN OLNEY TO ANYONE, JOB OR LIVING."
bad,"I worked for Brookdale Senior Living the entire time I was a manager for them, however Brookdale ""culture"" wasn't fully in place until about three months before I turned in my resignation."
bad,Don't work here your better off collecting unemployment. The people here think they are above you and every one think they are the boss
bad,Too much task to be accomplished in just one shift. The work environment is unhealthy.
bad,Very stressful environment. Wouldn't recommend place. Glad to be gone
bad,Residents were not being properly cared for and the lack of compassion people had towards their residents were horrifying.
bad,"RUN!"
bad,Run this place is horrible and has bed bugs!! Residents and staff are being bit by them.. Those nasty thinking are infested in the building! Rcd doesn't know how to treat people.
bad,"Overworked and underpaid.  Executive director only concerned with census no concern for if workers can actually take care of the residents. Unprofessional,  constantly lying to the family.  Selling an unrealistic dream. Google dateline review on Emeritus the review is applicable to the macon facility. No training was offered for the RCD. 24/7 call with engulfing responsibility,  you are never off. A bunch of snakes in the grass. I recommend shadowing before you take the position"
bad,"This was a horrible place to work at.  The staff was ok."
bad,"A wonderful national company with great values, programs and some exceptional professionals.  However, the company 's only MA property, River Bay Club, lacks the corporate oversight and local leadership to live up to the company's many promises.  The result is an unprofessional environment where ignorance and dishonesty are rewarded."
bad,"brookdale (crystal bay) not a good. place to work .all they say to you are untrue they dont feed night shift staff .resident food cut short.some employee get way with lot. and the ones that want to work see the problem talk about it get fired.Joe needs to leave. i am a pass staff so what i m saying is true he preasure staff and dont want to hired ,resident rooms are so dirty i dont. know how they. use Amy for Nurse all she do is play outside with friend"
bad,"I've never had such a horrible job! The staff are miserable and burned out, the management is awful , and the HWD doesn't care about you or the residents. There's a high staff turnover rate that leaves the staff down to bare bones. The place is supposed to be ""assisted living"" but has nursing home level residents and those with behaviors.  They only see the residents as ATMs.If I had known this was the mess I'd be getting myself into I would have never taken this job!! If you like working for a company that laughs at you when you call the integrity line for serious matters, then be my guest and sign your soul over.."
bad,"This is by far the worst company I have ever worked for.  It's bad enough that the wages are low and the benefits are horrible, but they short-change you at every turn.  There is a waiting period to accrue sick and vacation pay, and then you have to wait some more to be eligible to actually take sick and vacation pay."
bad,Overworked underpaid supposed to be a assisted living but is more like skilled.Management is unappreciative of there workers.This is why they can't keep employees
bad,I worked for this company for 6 years! It is an awful place to work I would not suggest working here to anyone!!! The management team is awful there is absolutely no leadership! They look down on you and treat their employees horrible!! There is no room for advancement with this company! They care NOTHING about their employees!!
bad,"The residents keep a smile on our face. Managenent (not all) need to be replaced. Lack of care for staff and residents. Lack of pay, but work and work with nothing to show for it. The grass is not always greener on the other side. Take it from people that had the experience. Stay where you are."
bad,"This place is the worst place i have ever worked. I stayed  working there for a totally of 3 weeks and I felt unethical working there.This place is all about money, unhygienic, low paying,  EXTREMELY HIGH TURN OVER RATE. Please don't make the mistake I made. Read the reviews.  These places should be shut down.  The care is horrible.  The management is not qualified.  People belong in nursing homes there and require lifters but they keep these people at this ""assisted living"" facility just to keep the census up. BED sores, extreme dehydration, and all the employees where hurt and over worked. ZERO STARS. ..ZERO"
bad,"The managers in the community work their butts off to ""live the Brookdale Culture"" but upper management could care less!! If you want to be treated poorly work for this company!"
bad,"Loved the residents and the family members, I would never consider putting a family member in this dump. People in jail get treated better than the people that pay 1000's to live there,in all honesty they should put chains in the doors and throw away the key"
bad,"In 18 yrs of nursing this by far is the worst job I've ever had. Assisted living community with skilled level patients. Many incontinent wandering with behaviors. Only you and an aide to provide care for nearly. 50 residents. Resulting in poor care, overworked staff and angry family members. As the nurse you were required to pass medications, call MD, chart, take orders, deal with staffing issues, families, labs. Also serve meals, clean up meals, do laundry, clean common areas, which included vacuuming, dusting, and clean bathrooms, shovel snow at times. And care for residents it is the worst place to put a loved one and the families were charged a lot to stay there . And the staff were certainly not compensated or supported."
bad,Not a good facility to work at would not recommend.The managment team doesnt care about the staff . Turn over rate super high. The pay isnt good its suppose to be a assistance living but we give care like its a nursing home.
bad,"This is by far the worst job I have ever had..there is ABSOLUTELY ZERO team work and even less support from management..the wages are just simply EMBARESSING! Minimal training but you're expected to immediately perform at an expert pace..noone is ever at fault....the excusees ""its not my resident"" or "" its not in my job description"" are WIDELY used....even management holding a degree in nursing and havong YEARS of experience refuses to perform any task related to nursing...management harasses staff on a consistent basis...this facility is so incredibly understaffed daily there isnt anyone to cover call offs n more often then not there is less than appropriate staff to provide proper care.....this place is seriously going down hill would warn anyone considering a job here and values their license to stay FARRRRRR away....and thats to even cut my own throat as i would have to work under such conditions for the time being....im looking to get O.U.T.  a.s.a.p. believe"
bad,The management is terrible. They are more focused on being friends rather than being managers. All in all not a good place to work.
bad,"If you have a conscience this company will wear you out. They preach "" care over real estate"" but practice the exact opposite. I have been an exemplary employee that is until I spoke up about the problems that rise again and again. Call lights going unanswered, med errors, understaffing, theft and drug use. After my call for help fell on deaf ears I reported these issues to both state and ethics first. I was swiftly put on an action plan. I continued to see problems that effected our patient care so I made another report and I was swiftly terminated. If you have any self respect this is not the company for you."
bad,"If you care about yourself as a human being, do not apply here.  It is by far the worst employer I have ever experienced.  Treat their staff like animals.  Management is awful and the RCD is mentally incompetent.  Please stay away.  The residents are not taken care of...management talks a good game but the bottom line is its all about making money, not focused on care."
bad,"This is the worst company that I ever worked for.  Orientation for management positions is horrible. The Regional Directors treat you like dirt and expect salaried workers to work 12 plus hours a day. No flexability. This place works you so dam hard that you do not have time to pay your bills, grocery shop or see your family. You are made to travel with out notice. Three to four hour trips and made to work your 8 hour shift. To Emeritus travel time does not count as work time.  Just because you are management they expext you to not make plans on your days off. Basically tell you they can make you work as many hours as they want. Fire people for no reason. Just suspended two workers just on hear say. This company does not give a dam about their employees or residents. The $$$$$$ is all they care about."
bad,"I worked for this company for 3 years. Poured my heart and soul into my job as a LPN. Never got so much as a thank you. Only got 60 cents total raise in this 3 years. I was asked to cover up many medication errors and hide issues of significance from families and state. We were always under staffed and out of supplies, leaving residents to pay the price. Thru only care about putting commissions in their own pockets. I tried hard to get then to pay attention to neglectful nurses but in turn they fired me and counted up the issues. "
bad,"I worked for Brookdale for about four months, it was wasted time. As a CNA, I was housekeeping, doing dishes and doing laundry. I hated working here because the bosses don't care about anything! The residents were not taken care of, and my nurse didn't care. The entire time I was with them, there was one (1!) nurse who was only an LPN. The thing that finally drove me to quit was when I found pressure sores on one of my patients. I called the nurse, because there is never a nurse on duty, and she hung up on me, saying there was nothing she could do about it. I feel sorry for whomever works or lives in a Brookdale community. "
bad,I was a server/ buser i made sure order was right before it was taking to the cosumer
bad,I terminated my employment with Brookdale after 2 years. I observed multiple health code violations every day in the kitchen while working there and found the quality of food to be sub-par. I attempted to leave in good standing by giving appropriate notice and maintaining a professional work ethic. I was informed that there that was no work to be done half way through my final shift and I could leave early. They did that sothey could flag me as leaving early and not pay out my comp time.
bad,"Underpaid, poor management, stressful, never enough hours to get the job done. Would never work for anyother Brookdale Community."
bad,The more you give the more they expect with no appreciation. Works staff like dogs. Expects more of employees than they are willing to give back. Doesn't care about their employees. Unless union happens this co will never get better.
bad,The residents are the only thing that made working at EMERITUS AT RIVER OAKS bearable!
bad,"I am a past employee. While working at the facility in fairborn ohio i saw disgusting care of the residents. The housekeeping staff is uneducated in standard precautions. They mop each bathroom with dirty mop water. Spreading germs to each residents room. We had an outbreak of c diff while i worked there..i do blame housekeeping. They didnt wear gloves and used the same cleaning rags for every room.Completely disgusting. The building smells of urine and most staff has had no training in nursing care. I quit my job because it was too difficult to change a building full of uneducated aids,i felt like i was working alone .My mother in law and sister in law works there now. Neither is trained to care for the elderly. My mother in law is on pain meds for nerve damage and my sister in law has back problems andd can barely walk . I do not understand who hires incompetent people. Bad hires create a bad business."
bad,Terrible place to work. ED was a joke. Very unprofessional.
bad,"Very poor place to work, horrible management. The corporate HR turnover is about 50 percent. Benefits are terrible and salaries are under market value in HRIS."
bad,"Let's see..,,hmmm..one resident hung themself, one resident got taken by management for 100,000..ya thats right one hundred thousand bucks stolen. I got fired for being a good employee for TeN YEARS...I think they needed to make budget so see ya long term guy."
bad,This is a terrible place to work. They do not treat employees with respect and the pay is way below the average for this work. The upper management does not support the management staff. The turn over in staff far exceeds any other work place. People don't even return for a second day of work after orientation.
bad,I worked hard for almost one year including working Saturdays to get the work done.
bad,Management did not provide training and support for staff. Regular reviews never took place.
bad,I enjoyed working there very fun and outgoing place to work. Its the DON and ADON that I couldnt' work for anymore they were changing up everything not just for the workers but residents did seem fair.
bad,"i worked there 9 monthes in roswell nm. they work you like a slave telling you to pretty much do whatever they say, they also call you on your days off or just tell you to come in on your day off. The management is like a gang they think they are soo special but they are not plus management is always changing when i was there i saw 3 directors come and go. dont work there its not a secured job at all. its like when the management is having a bad they they want everyone to have a bad day on a day to day basis."
bad,"I learned alot, However I was too energized for such a negative environment. I never experienced employers not appreciating their"
bad,I have good days at work. I enjoy what I have learned to do. Because I've never worked in a healthcare facility where I was working hands on with patients. I've always had a desk job.
bad,"I only gave one star because I had to give SOMETHING. The values the ""live by"" are only on paper nothing else. I have been in nursing over 10 years and this was the worst experience ever. I will say when I was able to do my job it was very rewarding. I truly believe there are good employees here but they are outnumbered and the bad have free range. Even when u try to enforce them no one supports you on a local level but you are held accountable by regionals. They fake the funk when regionals are in town. From one nurse to another beware nurses your license will be in jeopardy daily, you will not sleep you are on call 24/7, you do your work and the ed work, the mt, and the cna work because no one comes to work and they don't discipline them. You won't have a home life. Oh and best of all they don't want to pay the you will have to work dispite being hourly unless you pull teeth. I love a challeng and have had my fair share but it is like you against them all the time the ed will tell you this all the time. The pay honestly is not ridiculous but it is on the lower end of the scale of he assisted living pay. If the ed, rcc, and other poisonous staff were gone and you might get the tools, staff, and support all around to do your job and I could give it a better star rating. there are many there that do not care for the residents. However I will say there are some dedicated people holding on and it is so sad they ran off residents and some fantastic staff. So sad this could be the best but until they undergo major re staffing starting from the top down it will never make it. Leadership"
bad,I would not recommend working at Milw Corp Office
bad,this place is a disgrace and should be shut down. they treat their employees bad and pay them the same way. all they care about is money. DO NOT PUT YOUR FAMILY HERE. they hire people who dont even care about the job or the residents.
bad,"regional team only sees $$$ not senior citizens true needs. ""Our Family is committed to yours"" That is a crock!! They employee poor management. Your sanity is worth more than anything Emeritus has to offer!"
bad,"I was there for 1 year. 18 people quit or got fired in that time. Management has not employee confidentality, nor the sense to treat the employees or residents with any human compassion. The most common saying is this is a ""for a profit company"". Never complain to try to resolve any issues with management it will result in getting fired or hours cut."
bad,"If you want to work for a chauvinist, that is behind the times in food and does not listen to anyone that doesn’t kiss up to him then apply at brookdale. "
bad,Worked here for a year. Poor management the executive director dislikes men. She is the root to most of the drama this place has. They trait they residents poorly. The place is great infected with bed bugs. The food served there you would get a better meal at the homeless shelter
bad,Run and dont stop! These people are con artist they sweet talk everything and make it ALL sound and look good for the sake of keeping employees. Its SALES they expect you to harass people in order for them to come look at a overpriced FACILITY that stinks! They never take ownership and will blame the advisors for the pettiest stuff then the higher ups come and tell us how good we do?! The system is now being switched to an autodialer omg really run now!
bad,This company does not care about there employees!!!!  Employee are over worked and required to be team players but not paid nearly enough for their job. If your not apart of the club there is no need to grow. Can’t report anything because the so called ethics like can’t be trusted!!!
bad,"The facility has declined because their only focus was to increase occupancy, lower budget and treat staff unfairly; family members are mislead about what facility offers for their loved ones; understaffed most times; multiple employees fired without warning or legitimate reason; multiple daily complaints from families, residents, and staff not having the help or supplies they need to give the residents the care they are paying for; no longer a place of happiness and would not recommend working at this dysfunctional place"
bad,"Poor place to work no help from upper management "
bad,"This employer was one of the worst employers I have ever worked for. The cultural of each unit (each facility) is different, but mostly it is very toxic. The toxic atmosphere extends not only at the local level but within the whole corporation. The only good thing I can say about this employer is that it offers a paycheck until something better comes along. "
bad,I love the residents that’s what most employees are therefor you won’t get any kind of help from your managers ar all.  Your always working short and your always asked to do other shifts
bad,Poorly run and manged. Managers and Regional VP's  are not educated in proper business management acumen. All management is retaliatory in nature.  Not at all employee friendly.
bad,Everyone from the caregivers to the floor staff are overworked and under paid. It’s dog eat dog. If something goes wrong upper management always finds someone to blame and fire. Favoritism is often put above loyalty and hard work. Everything is a popularity contest. 24/7 on call for most management positions and no time off - even when you are on PTO you get phone calls regarding work.
bad,This was the worst experience I ever had. I worked full time and was put under part time so I wasn’t able to receive benefits. Management would listen to the lies old employees would tell them to make others look as if they wasn’t doing their job. They were so unprofessional in every way and management talk to you as if you didn’t matter.
bad,Liked working at Brookeside until new management came in and didn't want to work with staff. They just wanted it to be one sided and didn't like listening to the staff and their needs.
bad,"The current director is awful, she is fake and plays favorites. She treats residents poorly and when I went to corporate about it they did nothing about it. The way she treats staff is disgusting. You couldn’t pay me enough to work for a brookdale facility again."
bad,"Worst management I ever experienced and bullying allowed by the management!"
bad,"Although I loved the residents, my job was made very difficult every day because our managers/ administrators did not do their part, especially with organization and communication with staff. As CNA's, we were not informed of the care needs of our residents, we were not provided with PPE when we needed to be...we were not even told that we needed PPE until we figured it out ourselves. The management here does not care for you as an employee. They were demeaning, discriminatory, and disrespectful."
bad,"Extremely poor management !! As a food server you are treated poorly."
bad,they have good hours and the residents are so sweet and fun to work with the co-workers fun and hard works thrers lost of team work there and good benfits
bad,"Started off great as a cook. Over time noticed the kitchen coordinater had no experience at all as a manager and just used fear as her motivator. She was continusly late keeping up with her paperwork, always blamed someone else for any and all problems in the kitchen, and always had a sob story why she cant help anyone out or work a shift she scheduled herself. I'll never work for brookdale again. Higher management still allows her to do this."
bad,"I was really excited to start my new job. The pay was good, but in the end not worth the headache. ED kept his hands in nursing to much including getting into the med-cart. The RCC and him were cozy so they would always get together and pick someone to be mean to. They would turn their heads when someone they liked were doing wrong. Always sweeping something under the rug. I worked long and hard for my license and was not about to loose them for a corrupt company. Yes I went above the ED to report but nothing was ever done about it. I loved our community and its people. They deserved better."
bad,Brookdale Health Services (Home Health & Hospice Division) continues to keep unqualified and poor senior leadership in place year after year.  It is clear that this why they are unsuccessful.
bad,The culture at Brookdale Senior Living is very unprofessional with many of the senior ranking managers unqualified to hold their position. The atmosphere is one of keeping the employees in fear of losing their job in order to maintain control. Allied health personnel are treated as a number and the organization will not hesitate to replace any individual no matter how good the employee performs their assigned work responsibilities. Steer clear of this company!
bad,"3 salary cuts in one year with increased workload.  Discriminatory management, verbally abusive. Nonadherence to policy on creation of hostile work environment.  Constant restructuring of company and elimination of positions. Nepostism."
bad,"The Director is the boss,  regardless of what nursing needs there are or what the patient needs are.   I believe that 28 to 30 MEMORY Care patients is too much to pass meds to while you are dealing with family members, Dr visits, and patient “behaviors” and lazy resident assistants who don’t want to take care the patients."
bad,"Just look up on the internet 60 Minutes story on senior living and it will explain everything. Bad stock, bad business model; sales managers transfer to other communities to avoid getting fired when the tenant population declines. Incentivizing with money only leads to bad practices when dishonest management gets hired to oversee honest ones."
bad,Management is horrible. Days off was same every week. The environment was bad the staff didnt treat everyone right. You had to pay for your meals if you didnt have lunch but the meals was the same as residents. You were paired up with 2 other people one in laundry and another housekeeper if that person wasnt there then you had to do there job and if you difd anything wrong it falls on you.
bad,"My mom taught me that if you don’t have something nice to say don’t say anything at all. So I will not say anything, I did enjoy the residence and so workers ."
bad,This place is great to work as long as you don’t have a family. The workers are always understaffed and are responsible for too much. The resident to worker ratio is not even close to being equal. The managers HARDLY ever step into help out as well.
bad,"Loved the residents and a few coworkers but the regional team was rude and treated workers like they were so beneath them! Let someone have a management position who had no experience and very unprofessional and immature, should’ve never been given that role"
bad,"This company is literally awful. If you want bad hours, little to no recognition for your hard work, and the stress of dealing with the elderly, go for it."
bad,"Agency director is a PT, who is known to dislike nurses, and is absolutely clueless about clinical needs. This office lacks even the most basic supplies, making it difficult to perform simple tasks, such as labs. Hostile office environment, with very little support for field staff."
bad,"Its not a assisted living it's more like a nursing home. They are always under staffed and cant keep help,not to mention management isn't professional at all!"
bad,Noting to say just stop your staff from sleeping on the job at night then no one will get  R that why that happened.     Make a clean start of new hire
bad,They do not care about the field staff. Acting DOCS is all about her own advancement.Great case managers and schedulers. Teams work really well together.
bad,"A typical work day is around 10 to 12 hours, no proper training, no proper  time to get  the days duties done, low budget, bad quality of food choices."
bad,Became very stressful when the management changed the residents were amazing they become part of you as family. Too much drama and favoritism between shifts
bad,The turnover rate is so high. The pay is the min. For the position. They want you to do so much work its unreal and when you become burnt out the company nor management cares .
bad,"Bad, Bad, Bad and Bad! All about the money. Regional Operations control everything and only cares about the money coming in! Regulations are NOT followed and everyone knows when there is a someone coming in to do a site assessment. The residents are not the first priority and the ED is only a puppet to the higher management. Sad"
bad,"The building that I was in, could’ve  have been run better by a dart thrown at a wall covered in bad ideas. The management is turned over constantly and everyone hurries to undo what the last one did. Good people are left in a lurch while higher management is busy throwing each other and whole buildings under the bus to save their own skins. Working for this company four years and 8 different executive directors there was one decent one the whole time. Who on earth is hiring these bums?"
bad,"No fun, no team work. Management does not understand anything and don't even offer to help if you are alone. Will ask you to work more hours but will not understand if you have a emergency. Mostly if you're pregnant."
bad,"I’m not sure how it is in different cities, but I would not recommend working for Brookdale Las Vegas unless you’re up for doing the work of 2-3 people. It was not terrible because the good outweighed the bad a majority of the time but I was not one to want to be treated the way I was. First of all the training was poor. They throw you on a computer and then expect you to know your entire job afterwards. Apparently no one else knows what’s going on in everyone else’s departments. There is no communication whatsoever. The teamwork is the worst. Being there only for a couple weeks, the amount of times I’ve been told “Well that’s your department” was terrible and extremely unmotivating. Some managers tend to half a** their jobs and get away with it. There was plenty of times I felt belittled and that was just horrible for me to experience that in a workplace. There were also a handful of days where I would not get a lunch break because the workload for one person is ridiculous. I really cannot stress enough that there should be more employees. There were several employees I encountered that would have to work extra time because there is only one of them. The residents deserve a lot better than what is given to them right now. Majority of the staff has bad attitudes, no integrity, no teamwork, and absolutely no communication. I 110% would not recommend coming to work for the Las Vegas location."
bad,Worst company I ever worked for . Managment is scared of employees.  Managment let employees bully (file language) other employees and disrespect them and others (residents) and nothing be said . Employees drink liquor on the job while working and come to work drunk and do med passes drunken and nothing be said. The pay was the only thing that was ok. Brookdale memory care in Hilton Head So was where I worked.
bad,It’s a good place to stay away from. They will use you and degrade you. I would not send my worst enemy to work there. The people were against me from day one. They are a hateful bunch
bad,"Terrible management, terrible company. Saw my coworker get fired for literally no reason other than my manager didn't like them. They exploit their employees and they aren't good about sanitary practices (LIKE GETTING RID OF BEDBUGS, etc.). 10/10 would NOT recommend."
bad,Work life balance is out of wack.  leadership briefs rainbows and unicorns and tries to improve management morale with candy.  turnover at the community level is close to 30%.  cant keep anyone on the job for over a year.
bad,"Too much work for the alloted time and keep putting more work on us.  Had to take a break daily for half hour but didnt really have the time to do so.  management was very poor , threatened us with firing if we didnt have time to clean."
bad,Corporate management is terrible. Not supportive or very none caring for associates. Wages are very low and not consistent with industry standards. The entire senior management team just quit and went to a new organization.
bad,This was my first health care experience and it was horrible. The management was the worst I have ever experienced. They would schedule me to come in and then once I get there the client wouldn't have any clue I was coming. Its was like being forced to be there BC the clients NEVER wanted you there. They would schedule you then the client would cancel services and they wouldn't tell you until you showed up. It was the worst experience ever. I was warned and should have listened to my friends.
bad,"basic rules, policies and standards. Same as other facilities, turn over extremely high in all locations. LPN""s holding management positions with little management or clinical care experience. Resident care is below minimum standard in most facilities."
bad,"Most of the residents are very appreciative of any help they receive,  there are some that complain about everything and make it miserable for everyone else. There is poor management, they lock their doors, unplug their phones, close the blinds and are not available to the residents or family members, its horrible. they don't even keep their appointments. Staff members do not help each other out, its a 1 man show.  ."
bad,"Do not work for Brookdale. The pay is terrible, the mangement is terrible, everything is. And the corporate level workers aren’t any better. Horrible. The residents are rude, the nurses and aids are lazy. You will never get a raise, no matter how hard you work. Servers are severely under appreciated and over worked. Brookdale is a terrible and selfish corporation that shows little care for its workers. You will never get any days off because the home is constantly understaffed in all departments and the turnover is very, very high. After working here for almost a year, I received a raise that wasn’t even a dime. Ridiculous. There is no way anyone could work at brookdale and make a decent living"
bad,I learned a lot working for Brookdale. Believe the reviews. These aren’t simply disgruntled employees. The residents are wonderful. The community is only as good as the leadership.
bad,"I wish I could rate Brookdale a zero. They don't care about their patient care as much as they should. They care more about how the facility looks. They are so understaffed that they refuse to confront issues with employees, which is why issues never get resolved. Patients are constantly left soaked in a brief, covered in a bowel movement, and left In the same clothes for days. The employees fake their vitals because they're lazy and don't know how to take them properly. They over work their associates. Workers who sign up for patient Care should only be doing patient care. If we didn't have to be a waitress, house keeper, pet Care taker, and a dry cleaner, perhaps we could give meaningful patient care so the residents don't have to suffer from the company's lack of responsibility. And the dumbest thing, no one is required to be CPR certified. Not even the nurse. What are we supposed to do if a patient with a full code status codes? Call ems. And what if a hospice resident falls? We have to leave them on the floor until hospice arrives, which takes over an hour. This place neglectful, careless, borderline abusive, and is NOT a place i would ever suggest working or putting my family in."
bad,Don't work here .... Everyone including the manager will stab you in the back.  Constant turnover !!! No wonder the communities and the community dowsnt want to use the ancillary services
bad,"Horrible management at Raymore,MO facility. Housekeeping director is cutthroat! CEO sits in his office all day! HR is no help at all. Choose your job wisely"
bad,The managers at the Stayton facility do not have control of the staff. They also take people that they cannot take the best care of. They are constantly losing employees for doing this and stretching us thin.
bad,Need to clean house and get new management across the board. No respect for providers or staff. Meeting heavy. Out of touch. Totally money driven organization. Patient safety and quality suffers. They don’t want to work in poorer neighborhoods. They only want Medicare patients and claim they can’t accept Medicaid. They don’t want Medicaid.
bad,Horrible work experience . Get paid minimum wage to do a 5 star exoerience . Always cutting hours and expect to do the same work in less hours . Management are selfish
bad,"My location was seriously understaffed, and the director blamed everyone and everything except the company and himself. turnover was almost 50% annually, and we had several incidents of abuse, neglect, medication errors, and theft. All of those would be preventable if Brookdale paid employees enough to live on, offered good benefits, provided quality training and mentoring, and maintained a good caregiver-to-resident ratio. This location was a complete disaster and should be shut down by the state. A typical caregiver was scheduled over 30 hours of duties to be completed in less than 8 hours every day. They were often scheduled at a ratio of one caregiver to every 15 residents with dementia. It was absolutely unacceptable."
bad,"I would not recommend working at Brookdale."
bad,The management team does not pay attention to employees concerns for the residents and their safety. Not the best place to work if you care for the elderly. There is no communication between staff and management.
bad,"Management does not care at all. There was always so much drama for no reason. Communication between management, co-workers , and other shifts was terrible! It's honestly easy work but too much drama for what you are paid. It's true what they say ... I don't get paid enough for this!"
bad,"This job would’ve been nice if I had a reliable dining manager. Food was always running out, schedules and menus never on time or properly written, so many call ins and no shows...favoritism and unfairness/disrespect all around. I worked for the residents but I felt I could never do my job properly because I didn’t have the things I needed to make sure they were taken care of. "
bad,"Management steals money, jewelry, clothes, electronics anything of value from the elderly in the facility who have alztimers  or damintia. You are payed over 4 dollars under what you would make elsewhere and treated like you are the worst employee ever if you agree to always pick up shifts and help other coworkers they will take advantage and force you to stay for two shifts instead of letting you go home at your set shift end time."
bad,Management is VERY unprofessional. Been working here over a year and still no raise. I wish I had enough characters to explain how this is the worse company I ever worked for. Or maybe its this location. Management favors other employees and give them more hours. Management over schedules or under schedule employees. And gossips with other RCA about disciplinary action against another RCA. Personal issues are Personal issues not to be gossiped about
bad,When state comes you see people do things you never thought they could do..LIKE WORK...ONCE STATE LEAVES. BACK TO  DOING NOTHING.CNA N NURSES DON'T REALLY CARE..ADMINISTRATION ON 2ND FLOOR THINK THEY ARE ABOVE EVERYONE...NOSE UP IN THE AIR ATTITUDE...
bad,"Loved being around all the residents. I worked at Brookdale for 2  years and for those 2 years I tried to make a difference. The only place it got me was banned off the property after I gave a 4 weeks notice. Management is horrible and did nothing about the mistakes I pointed out that were being made on a regular basis in elderly care. There is little or no training, so some workers go to the residents not knowing what kind of care they need. Clients have been left off the schedule. Care plans are not always in place. Incorrect medical information on clients that you take to the doctors that is supposed to be updated by the supervisor of Home Health and the LVN if they are in charge of their medicines. They use intimidation and retaliation so people don't come forward. Gossip is over the top at this place. They only care about making money. Don't work here if you are an ethical person, you will not make it."
bad,"It was nice helping patients at this facility but they were always short staffed and bad management who always made it harder for the workers to perform their job, which to me was staff abuse because the workers tried really hard to do their job right but the administrator and the managers where never satisfied and would not help to resolve any issues taken to them."
bad,"Sh++ flows downhill starting with corporate.  Expect your boss to place any blame on you so they can save their #ss.  Laziness seems to be encouraged or at least tolerated. If you are a hard worker they will not even recognize you just expect more.  If you are lazy, this is the place for you"
bad,"Great experienced, talented, and devoted Managers gave notice to leave., with mass exit!!!  Look at all the positions Brookdale is hiring for in that area.  Nobody stays in the Sarasota area because of the Regional team!  "
bad,After Brookdale bought Emeritus we were promised pay raises and better work conditions. Much to my disappointment things began to hectically decreased. The Brookdale Corporate representatives came into the facility and made the work environment hectic. The residents also were told things that by the company that they refused to provide. Management continually shows favoritism towards certain employees. You may create some bonds with the residents but that does not account for how rude and disrespectful they are. Also never expect to be paid the correct amount for how stressful the job is and how much work you will be doing
bad,I worked for this company for three years. Management was like High School. The gossip of employees was more important than the clients. The pay is not good at all. In three years i saw only .36 cent raise. I am honestly glad when i was done working with this company. I felt like management did not have the time to listen to my concerns. The residents were not treated fair either from co-workers.
bad,"My first day of on the floor training was also my last. The nursing staff was unprofessional and vulgar - cursing in resident's rooms, talking horribly about residents in front of other residents, making vulgar comments to a resident, complaining about the facility. If this is how the staff behaves in front of new employees, I had no desire to step foot in there again. The admin was questionable - my first impression was a really short dress and high boots - hardly professional. I truly feel bad for the residents and would not recommend this facility to anyone - as an employee or resident."
bad,Residents overcharged for substandard care.  Most are not able to ambulate without assistance.
bad,"Administrative Assistant"
bad,currently work there.mmmmm mmmm mmmm mmmm mmmm mmmm mmmm .whar are u gonn. to iy will not let idtoo you.
bad,"Management lied continuously to nurses and staff; unsupportive; micromanaged; I had several misconceptions and misunderstandings with them and would try to explain what I interpreted from a meeting or conversation, to only be chastised. Very stressful working environment with tons of office drama. When I first started I was an RN Field case manager for home health, and then went to prn status.  As a prn RN I loved my position, my patients, and coworkers.  The ALF buildings I would visit were staffed with the best LVN's and resident care associates.  I also was trained and worked for the home hospice and it was a beautiful experience.  Unfortunately when I went into a full time office position, I realized very quickly that I had made a very bad mistake in choosing to work in the office setting.  It was horrible.  My team leader was such a mean person and a horrible mentor one on one.  The nurse who trained me was sweet as pie.  Two weeks into it, management changed our position, title and roles.  This is where confusion and chaos really started. Conflicting information, I didn't know which supervisor to report to, no one would give me my evaluation (one supervisor said the other one would do it, and the other supervisor said the other one would do it). All the stress exacerbated health problems and I had to resign. I worked there for 3 and a half years.  I was let go a few days earlier than my resignation date.  None of the staff were ever told I was leaving, no good luck in your future endeavors, or thank you for your years of service. I was walked out of the office with my"
bad,Not willing to work around school schedules. Management not the greatest.
bad,"the hardest part of the job was to watch a few co-workers getting special treatment..ex: smoke breaks..hiding out to prevent from working..using cell phones often...not completing job tasks..and if reported ..the whistle blower getting fired...not the co-worker..."
bad,"Upper management plays too many games.Bottom line is important but not at the expense of the residents. They have no loyalty to the directors, morals or integrity to do the right thing by their people."
bad,"Employees are constantly showing up late, or not showing up at all, and management does nothing about it! My three days of training, we were short two of the days because people did not show up so I did not get properly trained. People were so poorly trained that I would catch people going from one room to another without changing gloves! Ewwww! We were always out of supplies, management locked them up, and we would have to check dozens of rooms if we needed gloves or wipes and the managers had left for the day. Pay was terrible. I was a part time employee, not eligible for benefits, but I would get called in so I end up with full time hours, no benefits. Glad I left!"
bad,I started here as an LPN then became an RN case manager. They worked me extra long hours and had horrible management. They laid me off after working there for four years while I was seven months pregnant.
bad,"This is one of the worst jobs I've ever had. The management is horrible. They don't care about their employees and let them do whatever they want. They have their favorites. if you work night shift you get absolutely nothing. No free meals, no accommodations made for them at all concerning extra activities that are planned for staff. Management does not listen to anything you tell them. They fire certain people for no reason and then keep the ones who call in all the time and don't do their jobs. Don't waste your time."
bad,"A horrible place to work,unless you just don't care about taking care of the residents. They are all about the $$$$ and prove that by cutting staff, cutting hours, cutting budget and putting the extra work on the ones that are left, but don't go over 8 hours. I would not put my dogs in a Emeritus community. I value there well being to much. Tanglewood Trace what a huge mistake."
bad,"-Advertised, interviewed, trained, and hired as a caregiver. Then got handed a toilet brush and a mop and told we weren't allowed to do what we were hired to do -- caregiving."
bad,"Run fast, avoid at all costs"
bad,Wouldn’t recommend. Terrible management. No room for growth. Strongly advise to not work here. Not flexible. Treated like children. No support from HR.
bad,"Not flexible at all be prepared to give up your drs appt, your children birthdays to go to work as u are responsible to find your own cover once a schedule had been assigned to you."
bad,"Coworkers were amazing. The management sucks there, and treat you like garbage. It’s amazing with the residents. They are lovable and enjoy your company. You get close to them everyday."
bad,"I have worked at Brookdale for 6 months now, I work over night, the workers on nights are over worked and underpaid. The management team seems to  only care  about how the facility is looking day and night and if the cleaning isn’t done by a certain time it’s an automatic write up. Some mornings the people who have worked 8 hours sometimes more are forced  to stay over because someone called in at 5:30am when shift change is  at 6am."
bad,Marketing leadership is chaotic and unorganized. Job security is non existent and managers are dishonest   Need to hire senior management with integrity
bad,"I’m not going to sit here and complain about about staff and how everyone was always in a bad mood and we were always short staffed, I worked here for a very long time because I loved what I did  I loved taking care of the elderly people and caring for them and making them feel loved and wanted"
bad,The management cares more about money than anything else  they claim the residents are top priority but the residents will tell you otherwise. If you have any work related issues going to them about it is pointless.
bad,"Very deceiving job. I got hired to be a dishwasher, yet I do all the work. I mean all the work. 5 days a week 10 hour shifts, of none stop work. You are gonna be paid for 1 job but do up to as many 10 different jobs. Oh and dont complain, the managers will ignore you, then have a meeting asking you not to complain. I love the residence and really hate the neglect that they experience. It's very sad, I wouldn't  leave my pet rock  there care"
bad,"Wow!  They lie to their staff and to the families.  Favoritism exists and you will be putting your license at risk just by working there.   Some staff come in everyday a half hour late,the schedules are always an issue and have mistakes. They text you all day everyday even when you are off in group texts that go on all day and night.  The place is all about drama."
bad,"Company is good don’t get me wrong, great benefits if ur full time, Nurses and DON is horrible! No respect at all toward employees and patients. Just consider before applying to this location."
bad,"No help, you can't even call in when you are sick, instead they will give you a $50 dollar bonus???? No DON, ADON, No Admission nurse- if someone is there they are from corporate."
bad,"I worked here for a year and a half, I was completely worked to the ground and not one bit of care from management. They moved residents in that deserved more single one on one care or residents who were severely handicapped. We were constantly short staffed not one manager would help on the floor you couldn’t ask a med tech for a simple transfer or you’d get screamed at. I was put ln the hardest section and almost always did all transfers invluding 2 person on my own not one person offered to ever help you it was you swim or you desperately drown"
bad,"While working at Brookdale as an aide/housekeeper (we were so short staffed I was forced to work 2 positions same pay) employees were forced to work short staffed all the time. Management NEVER stepped up to help with residents if needed. They talk about the residents as if they’re a waste of space. Our executive director encourages using force on some residents who are difficult. Many residents are physically forced into the shower & verbally abused when they aren’t doing what is needed of them. Residents share clothes, hygiene products etc. Management is all females who are all friends outside of work they only like the males in the kitchen. Female staff on the floor work like slaves & get no recognition at all"
bad,"Won't work there ever again.DON is hateful and plays favorites.Pts don't get good care because of ALWAYS being short staffed.Wknd nursing supervisors are lazy and play on the computers instead of helping the CNAs when working short.For the last 3 months I worked there,they scheduled 3 aides for 50 patients. Not worth the pay considering the stress and BS you go through"
bad,I work the night shift so almost all the time I cannot come to the meetings and since we don't have managers during the night shift managers do not communicate well with the night crew. We cannot request holidays because they will not approve them. I been here for 3 year and the new hire get pay more than i do
bad,"Brookdale is a company that makes promises that never happen.  They seriously overwork their employees... They bend rules in order to make sales....benefits them, not the resident.  Their idea of logs and paperwork are literally a nightmare.  In my mind and others, the fat needs be trimmed desperately!!!! Horrible company....."
bad,Discriminated during my pregnancy they tried to fire me just because and they were women at that . I was pushed in to maternity leave.  Very unprofessional
bad,Management does not care about what you have to say they only see you as a number and not a person. They make no positive changes. Some employees are very unprofessional and they have favoritism here. Way to much down time and no room for an advancement. I would not waste your time with this company.
bad,"The poor ratings says it all. Corporate in the building every week. Constantly micromanged remotely for other states. Constant clean up of disasters. Could never keep consistent management. Positions went to those they liked, not those that deserved it. I had 4 DONs in less than 2 years."
bad,"I worked for this company for 3 years. The last year, I was promoted 2 times for my hard work and dedication to the company, residents, and staff. I have been a nurse for 20 years and have worked short staffed and with poor management most of my career. The management at Brookdale Bayshore are the most negative, nasty, vindictive, and absolutely NON team players, that I have ever seen. I am a hard worker, a team player, patient and staff advocate, and for these reasons, I had to resign with a heavy heart. All I stood up for was to get help for my staff to better serve our residents. I was bullied and in a hostile work environment after that. I know I am replaceable, and you can always get staff, but quality always beats quantity in the end."
bad,"This was a very difficult facility to work at. Very poor management, co-workers who only did minimal work, I am very surprised this facility remains open."
bad,They have horrible turn around the management is elementary at best!! Nice facility is about it!!! The pay does not match and they hired the new people making more than the people who had been there before!!!  Then they terminated me and I didn't find out about it til the bank called about my 401k. Also they listed me as a no rehire with NOT 1 write up in MY FILE
bad,"It started out horribly chronically short staffed, nearly daily visits from state, patient falls are if not expected not surprising. It got much better when a corporate DON shook the place up for a couple of months but was then yanked away and it fell to pieces again. 4 DONs in 6 months. No mgmt ever helps when staff is short, they hide. 1 nurse for 45 patients and no one cared. It’s so bad is ridiculous."
bad,"Worst management I have ever worked for, training was not complete. They would blame and then ask questions, they figured it was always the new person."
bad,I worked at Foxwood Springs with Supervisors that should never have that job. Teenagers would do a better job. The Supervisors overwhelmingly tried to micromanage everyone and everything without managing the issues that arose. Non of the Supervisors should have ever been in a position like that.
bad,"Large turnover, extensive daily travel. Small patient population over a large territory. 2 full time RN's covering patients from Woodbridge to Ellington. Nurses expected to travel to both locations in a single day. 1 HHA covering the state."
bad,"This place should be closed down. People need to start telling the  truth, and stop  lying, to  employees and families. I am going to say run far away from this place."
bad,One of the worst places I’ve ever worked.  Enjoyed the residents.  Very hostile work environment.  Not supportive of the activities department and very high turnover because of the way people are treated.  Training at other facility was good but that’s where it ended.
bad,"I was let go by Brookdale with no warning or proper write up letting me know my performance was lacking."
bad,"Terrible DON , wouldn’t suggest working for that company In Dover de you are under paid and it’s not a great place to work the state is there everyday do not suggest your relatives to come there for care . They switch the schedule without telling . The business manager is terrible as well."
bad,"Granted the pay was better than most care giving jobs, the management sucked and no one cared about doing their job well. If someone from the next shift didn't show up you were forced to stay and work another shift. I don't know anyone who loves 16 hour shifts. Most residents are judgemental and mean, there were a handful of nice ones that I cared for. The kitchen is a total disaster and super unsanitary."
bad,"Working here help me to realise a lot about people in power. Altho I am thankful for my experiences here; good & bad, I wouldn't recommend it to anyone who's looking for high pay or advancement in the work place."
bad,"This home health company should be investigated for Medicare fraud.  They admit patients that are not in need of home health services, do not fit the homebound status, do not have a skilled nursing need.  There is no tracking of this, the documented reasons are inflated and made up.  It is amazing that this company has not been shut down yet.  Management is a joke and provides no oversight.  Staff is sent to do skills they have received no training for.  Visits are plotted out for 2 to 3 times per week when NO skilled need is present, staff is discouraged by management from changing visit frequency when these concerns are raised.  This is abuse of home health services and not what this service was intended for."
bad,I love the residence but management is the worst I ever seen they have favoritism.  Management family members and friends  work here so no matter what they do even if they’re wrong and you tell management nothing will be done.  Very unprofessional no values no ethics.
bad,Everybody needs to be team players and management note needs to learn how to trust their team and not assume things  Care givers also need to care about the residence in not just come to work just  for a paycheck  bemoOrganizationorganized station
bad,"Only got a raise once with was 25 cents. Management is horrible as in picking favorites and just stuck up, worked with coworkers who bullied other coworkers. Brookdales the easiest place I've worked compared to other places but some of the people make it hard to work there."
bad,"Never ever work for the Henderson TX location.  "
bad,"Working for this company made me realize a lot. They will manipulate you by saying things you want to hear. Everything you do will never be recognized especially if you’re one to do a lot. They don’t care about you at all, it’s all lies. I don’t know how the DON is still in office, he’s out of his mind, poor management, too many stuff going on. Very unprofessional to work for. Coworkers make the job tolerable but you’re gonna have to leave at one point because it’s the same stuff everyday. Nothing ever gets fixed."
bad,"I do not recommend working for this company. "
bad,"It has been almost a year since I worked at Brookdale Delta located in Lansing. So, things may have improved. However when I was there it was awful. The management let the rude care staff bully residents and other staff. Nobody cared about the residents wellbeing which broke my heart. There was always yelling either staff to staff, staff to resident, or Directors to their employees. Very toxic work environment for all."
bad,"Working at brookdale was the most stressful environment I have ever experienced. This company makes you question your job every single day. Not worth it. "
bad,"During my time there I worked as both the housekeeper and RCA. We constantly had a turnover people due to managements overworking of staff, they’re impossible expectations of their employees,  and you could be written up without them checking  with you about the situation first to make sure that the information was reliable or not. I believed I was fired due to my disability. I was four months shy of being there for a year when over the holidays I went from being full-time working 7-8 hour shifts  to all the sudden working shifts of 4 to 5 hours with being expected to have the same amount of work completed. I am hearing impaired and I also have other disabilities that made working difficult for me but I always came to work and I worked really hard for this company that promised me after the holidays that my hours were go back to normal and they never did two months later they fired me."
bad,"Brookdale is a pretty tough company to work for. In regards to sales, their expectations are out of reach. During my time, only two Sales Managers hit their quota, however, they only hit it twice out of twelve months."
bad,"Despite the multitude of five star ratings, it's safe to say Brookdale is nothing but a soulless corporate entity that has one objective: keep the rooms filled."
bad,Keep all documentation and written reviews from staff when you put in your notice. I’ve heard many accounts of management finding a reason to label employees ineligible for rehire so they don’t receive PTO. Experienced this myself after 2 years working for this company as well as being a team lead and being on call. Good luck.
bad,"I will start by saying that it was an honor to serve the residents in the short time I was there. I got to meet some amazing dedicated employees especially some great RA’s and Med Techs. I’m so disappointed this job didn’t  workout."
bad,"No staff! Promise residents everything but are not capable of coming through, it’s all about money. Unsafe work environment with untrained staff. Management is  racist. Poor work environment."
bad,"Management is horrible. There is no such thing as integrity line for employee complaints. HR will notify the supervisor and give details about the call, after that....watch your back cuz they're coming for you. The stress you endure is above high limits."
bad,"I can't believe that one place can have so many incompetent,  rude, lazy and uneducated management associates. It is obvious that many are uneducated and have very little experience."
bad,DO NOT WORK HERE you will be worked to death. Always short staffed. Insecure manager's so they start drama continuously. Some managers get away with ANYTHING . I'm very disappointed with my experience here and have seen things that make me cringe. Stay away from this place until someone buys again or something.
bad,"I wouldn't recommend this job or this company to anyone. The management clearly only care about making their salary and not the residents that live under their care. "
bad,"Terrible atmosphere. Co-workers are allowed to bully and not do their job, and get away with it. Nepotism abundant. Sneaky staff. Something needs to be done. They hire people whom have been let go because of the same type of behavior at other places."
bad,Management is very clickish. They talk about their staff with other staff. Didn’t want to pay overtime but was always asked to come in on days off. Expected to work as a CNA all the time.
bad,"They cared more about the bottom line, which is money. With some of their facilities it is questionable about some residents as some need higher levels of care than assisted living, however they get away with it bc some are assistive living (makes no sense to me). The HHAs hardly make anything for the amount of work they put in. The upper management allows the residences to treat the employees like complete garbage. Corporate does not listen to employees when they call in a complaint."
bad,It's a great place to work at just need full time and want to try something different and would like to meet different people and just have a different experience
bad,"This place borderline commits felony tampering with medical records the executive director encouraging staff to ""pencil whip"" paperwork. In fact is very open about it tells everyone the only way they pass inspection is by pencil whipping reports."
bad,"Memory care facility so it is a very specialized nursing home.  The staff is trained by the company and it is fairly decent training, however due to lack of certifications earned the pay is terrible and they are able to keep it there.  There is very little room to advance and the benefits are incredibly expense, along with very few nearby doctors that participate with the insurance offered."
bad,The management is awful. They play favorites and certain individuals get to do nothing while others struggle to meet the needs of the residents.  Upper management does nothing to fix it. Low staff levels are a constant and its incredibly stressful.
bad,"I ask that question because I see the same bad reviews over and over. That's because top management is always pointing the finger outward, and never at themselves. listen 90% of your staff is fed up. Wake up!!"
bad,"Management unprofessional.    everything is the ""bottom line."" Patients uncomfortable and feeling forced to participate in treatment they did not need.  Families aware and angry.  People soliciting going to HR about a clinical manager - ""insurrection.""  I don't elect to be part of this movement.  Dressing up in costumes like buffoons to make a point about professionalism.  Pitting therapists against one another with regard to making the bottom line.  "
bad,I use to love coming to work every day and this place ran me so far into the dirt that i disliked my job so much i quite.  The management does not recognize the good work habits and or they dont do the guideline work habots for the st of Oregon.
bad,"This is a very low paid job with a lot of work to do. They are under staff and will not hire enough people to do the work, if they do so they are not serious people and they are not trained enough to do the work or tasks, so the people that are working hard are the ones being hurt. Also they have favoritism specially in Brookdale pecan park Arlington. They just need to change management."
bad,"Run run run! Don’t trust anyone! "
bad,"When I started at Brookdale I was very excited because the company had good benefits and the potential for very good pay was there, however it was based on points per visit, admission , etc... I went from fighting for enough points to completely overworked . I was always working after hours and every weekend that i was supposed to be off to catch up on work from the week. I received no real orientation and was expected to complete work that I was unfamiliar with ( OASIS, admits, recerts, etc..... ) within a 24 hour time period. On call for nurses consists of an entire week every 4 weeks after working full days. Management was very poor and the office was the most unwelcoming environment i have ever experienced in over 16 years of being an RN. There were numerous important emails that were not sent to me regarding pay and mileage which I do not believe was an oversight. Patients are not truly case managed , nurses are just thrown to different people every day and clinicians do not control their own schedule which never works in a clinical and case managing position . This was the most disappointing company I have ever encounterd."
bad,"unprofessional, unorganized, poor management.  "
bad,"Brookdale is a poor conpany they are out to only seek money. They do not give you to proper staff to run a building like this, they rather you work doubles back to back with no off days..not allow to get over time. Rather than fixes a broken equipment they wants to rig it up, and then blame the manager in that department for when state comes in and they get tage on it. They do not know how to talk to people. They do not treat their residents fair they just want there money. Any time you go and tell them about a concern either nothing gets done or they blame you. Just a horrible company to work for!!!"
bad,"poor training"
bad,"I really enjoyed most of the people that I worked with on a day-to-day, but ""corporate"" management had very little idea of what it was like in the field. They would make changes that were not practical and when feedback was given, they seemed to ignore it to the detriment of the business and employees. "
bad,"Productivity was number one goal. If you weren't making productivity levels, you were too sit in front of management and explain yourself for ""being lazy"". Electronic records with zero history saved."
bad,I would say the only thing i missed about this job is the residents manager gave hours to who he wanted to give hours to they were not at all flexible just a bad environment
bad,"A typical day is filled with complaints about other shifts, extra work due to lack of staff, and Med Techs and RA's working in the dining room for all meals. Management would not work with us for earned vacations and needed days off. As well as multiple times there were hours and PTO missing from paychecks. The hardest part would be to have to pretend things are okay for the sake of the residents. The only good thing is the staff that we work closely with, even though the numbers keep shrinking."
bad,"if you don't make friends, or have one there, you'll sink fast. the pay is low and they don't work as a team. it's a title ranking environment. the good thing is you get free meals when you work."
bad,"I was hired on spot for this job, which now I see why some people say that is not always a good thing. I was immediately thrown to the wolves.  No hands on training was given to me besides the videos I had to watch, which really did not pertain to my department very much.  Therefore, everything I learned was by trial and error.  I was often finger pointed at for stuff that was out of my control or done before I started working there.  Let's not forget my supervisor just up and quit without a notice or anything.  So everything was left up to me to do w/o even getting paid for what I was doing."
bad,This is a very rewarding job. You will learn a lot from the residents and will gain a experience that will set you up for other jobs in a similar field.
bad,"terrible place to work, wouldnt recommend it to my worst enemy. always short of staff. nurses are less than admirable and dont want to lend a hand to anybody."
bad,Negative work environment. I loved helping and taking care of the members but the work environment was not healthy. I was not proud to work there. I was a med aide prior to finishing school. Then I jumped in right away with my LPN position in home health. I wanted job that would push me to learn more and gain more experience.
bad,Its OK place to work..hiring everyday..high turn over...our location in Willoughby mandates..which means after u work your scheduled shift you are required to work the next shift.. Over worked...will have double assignments due to no show no calls..if you want a check OK...just beware..high turn over...you serve meals...wash dishes..showers..put people to bed...not Assistant living like working in a  nursing home..heavy
bad,"The people that work here have a terrible attitude they think they are better than every one else, and above everyone else, and unfortunately that attitude passes on to the residents, then the residents treat the aides poorly. Management doesn't give you much of an opportunity to grow you have to meet their standards within a certain time frame. The turn over rate for them is extremely high. I wouldn't recommend this place for anyone to work at. As for the residents if you want your loved one to be pampered and well taken care of this is definitely the place to take them too, however their very costly and make the aides feel like slaves to make that happen. The only benefit of working here is the good pay and benefits if you can tolerate being talked down to, walked all over, and treated like your beneath them for it."
bad,"If you like to work in an organized environment and  like professionalism, want to feel like you are part of the team with good support as a new employee. THIS IS NOT THE PLACE FOR YOU. THERE IS NO ORGANIZATION,  LACK OF PROFESSIONALISM, WORKERS CALL OUT ALL THE TIME, HIGH TURNOVER RATE WITH STAFF.  I wonder why????? Not worth the stress."
bad,Upper level management are money hungry mean people.Go buy another Gucci bag why don't you.  That should really be nicer to their team members.
bad,Brookdale has no advancement opportunities.  Does not hire full-time so employees can earn PTO or benefits. Managers play favortism among employees. Shift responsibility is questionable for third shift. Required to perform as a nurse and 4 hours as an aid. Short staff.
bad,"Ever since Brookdale bought out Emeritus, i feel like every thing has went down hills. Pay stubs are being messed up to to where they say they will owe us that money on the next pay check, but itsnt there."
bad,"This company cares nothing about their residents or employees; they are a joke.They just had a meeting yesterday and in this meeting they had a nerve to say, ""if you see a resident on the side of the road broke down you are not allowed help them"". They claim it for safety reasons, which is bs. How are they safer on the side the road, then in the comfort of their own home. They also said we are not allowed to sit and spend time with a resident doing or after work because it would be considered a conflict of interest. The only reason they don't  want employees to spend time with the residents is because they want to pad their pockets, by having the residents pay for a companion and they don't want the residents and employees to care for one another. It's like they want us at odds with each other. The problem is that administration is receiving a lot of complaints from the residents regarding their inability to do their jobs and the way they treat their employees. They refuse to fix the elevators that keep breaking down and let's not get on the bed bugs and roaches within the facility. This is by far the worst company I have ever worked for. The only good thing about this company is the residents."
bad,"Low pay, long hours, no recognition for all that you do. The residents are the only reason I stayed so long. The ED and HWD cannot be trusted and lack basic management skills. They will throw you under the bus to save themselves. CNN recently aired a segment on Brookdale stating a survey lists Brookdale as top 5th worst company to work for. It's absolutely true. The ED is terrible. She talks negatively about families that give her a paycheck. They do not care about you. You are replaceable is how they make you feel."
bad,"Management thinks theyre gods, servers are more important to them then cooks, attitude is given by all staff, no respect, no class, residents are mocked behind their backs, and it's the biggest rumor mill i've ever worked in. This is with 10yrs of cooking experience."
bad,"Emeritus is about filling rooms while understaffing. On a daily basis the concierge department was handed tasks from other departments that they did not want to do. We were spread thin and new employees were not fully trained. The emeritus location that I was employed was unprofessional. After 2 years of employment I had been overworked and unappreciated. I loved the residents and received compliments from them on a daily basis about my constant smile, kind respectful nature and willingness to help them when needed. I did my best to go over and beyond to keep them happy. My department Director had changed the last year of my employment. They were to busy ignoring the issues at hand and short staffing the desk.  The work environment became very distracting, unprofessional and embarrassing. I am very thankful for my experience. It helped me to respect those around me and work hard. The hardest part about leaving was the residents. I worked everyday for them. They trusted/needed me to be the best I could be and everyday I learned a little more about myself and what I could handle. Overall It was great work experience, but I do not recommend working for any Emeritus retirement homes."
bad,    My co-worker were helpful and knowledgeable. They made it easier to do my job. 
bad,"Woked here several months. I absouletly was not impressed w/ the patient care here, it certainly doesn't exceed my expectations in patient care, as a care giver at all. Upper managment is a down right joke, I have never seen so many two faced people doing favors for one another and the way they ran things is not right. They Never have the proper supplies,  to do your job properly.. This assissted living facility, is a law suit just waiting to happen. .Good place to loose your license as a caregiver!!! . I would never place a loved one in this facility. The patient  ratio per caregiver is a joke at night. 1 cna and 1 med aide to run the whole entire building. Your so busy doing chores and taken care of patients that are up roaming the halls at night, that you can't get everthing done. Should be focused on patient care and doing proper rounds every 2 hrs, There is  No nurse on duty in the evenings...you couldn't find a first aide kit, if u had too. The staff is overwhelmed w/ more duties than they can handle. Including answering the phone, stopping what your doing w patients, to answer the door, doing laundry of the whole facility, cleaning the building at night (kitchen, dinning room, three bathrooms, country kitchen, sun room) the kitchen is a joke, dirty and nasty. There are no cabinets to place the clean dishes in, to keep dusts or insects and rodents away from. The washing machines do not get the clothes clean, they still come out looking and smelling like a nursing home..don't think proper amount of soap is being dispensed in washers, or maybe its just sooo dilluted down,"
bad,The Director is very rude and unprofessional. The Resident Care Director also. They treat their staff bad as well as the residents. Also they don't even have enough food to feed their residents it a terrible place I would not advice anyone to put there love ones in there. Theu are wlways short staff becsuse management doesn't know how to treat their staff.
bad,"My coworkers were awesome but we worked our butts off repetitively being told that as soon as the resident capacity reached 70 we would be given extra help. Well what do ya know , capacity had been at 70 for a month and still wasn't showing any signs of hiring. Residents weren't getting proper care bc there were just too many and too few staff members. Not only that is just so they could get more money they would let anyone come in tthat were above and beyond assisted living these people needed full care! How were we.supposed to care for these poor people when we could barely take care of the previous ones. They actually kept letting go staff members and never re-hiring them. Obvious reason is the big bonus they would get for how much money they were making. The activity director quit and they wouldn't even consider rehiring one at the time. The residents and staff complained nonstop but all we were told was things we wanted to hear but we would never see any action whatsoever. The most pathetic, non-caring, fake management group ever."
bad,"I haven't worked for Emeritus that long (<2 years) but have learned that corporate doesn't care about the residents. They only care about their bottom line, PROFITS. We voted in a union two months ago. The ED and RCD both left. Better management has been brought in. In my opinion union is the only way to make progress with this selfish company. The best raises for community employees are below cost of living, they seem to be short staffed almost all the time, and staff doesn’t have a voice. Things are definitely heading in the right direction since the Union was voted in. Even the families have commented about how the Union seems to have made the difference. I don’t believe Unions are always necessary but in the case with Emeritus I think it is. The only reason I stay is because I am so attached to the residents."
bad,"A nursing nightmare! Inadequate training, lack of support from management. The building has not had a nurse in position in several months and those that come in quickly leave, just as I did when you find out all of the issues in the building that have not been dealt with or addressed in months. As a nursing professional, I felt my nursing license was on the line constantly! Good luck if you try it..."
bad,"At least that is what this company thinks and unless you give 100% corporate will reign down orders to have your higher ups to drop you like they dropped one of my friends who they fired based on the word of someone who heard a rumor. But the most horrible part of this business is admitting residents that are supposed to be in a nursing facility or have 2-3 day trained med techs handing out black box medication and narcotics to residents who generally have no clue what meds they are being handed(Some of the residents are sharp enough to remember what their taking but they are the exception, not the rule). This means one of two things. Yay! Average folk can earn an extra buck possibly bending the law for their employers or Emeritus has found a way to do nursing for only $10 and hour. Making massive profits... Such a smart business."
bad,"Do not work here if you have a good work history. The H&W director and wellness nurse are so unprofessional. They go on smoke breaks every half an hour. They are never available for the residents. Puts the RCC responsible for things that are not in the job discription, so make sure you know your job discription.Didn't mind helping out.I am a team player,but when the h&w director will pile her work onto the RCC. It got to the point they set you upto fail. Just watch your back when working with these people.They will stab you in the back."
bad,Management is not qualified to lead.
bad,"Working for Brookdale felt gross. They are more concentrated in corporate greed than they are with resident health and safety. I was an administrator and had to do all the admin for all 6 departments AND do the reception duties. That’s one person doing HR, AR/AP, payroll etc. for 50+ employees and 100+ residents."
bad,If you dont want to go anywhere in the company apply. If your looking for a company that really has a interest in your improvement in the company this is not the pllace to work. Employees are all hard working and friendly and they dont get the credit they deserve.
bad,"An over centralized company with over staffed central office and under paid under staffed units."
bad,"Training and meetings can be a bit excessive. Tends to get in the way of selling time."
bad,"Salina, Ks management are dishonest and unsupportive. There is no communication from the regional level. Goals are not discussed with employees and expectations are anyone’s guess."
bad,No support from managers. Some LPNs runs this nursing home like union member work place. The LPNs attack the RNs. Dont bother to work in there.  There is a lot of back stabbing.
bad,"Brookdale management chooses its favorites.  There is no room for mistakes for some, but others can do no wrong no matter how much they lie.  They look for reasons to let you go if you are not ”one of them.”  Their expectations are unrealistic.   I was terminated and the administrator asked me if I would finish up some work for that day… And you call that integrity? Cold, cruel place."
bad,"Company does not respect their sales leaders in any capacity in their Home Health divison. No sales cultulre at all. Operations driven. Everything is a sales or voluime issue. Operations will lie and hide customer service issues and non-admits  and blame the low numbers on sales. The financial guys and Brookdale Alumni Operators have been promoted through the years and know nothing about running a home health business and are control freaks that refuse to let the sales leaders try anything to grow business. It's a shame how bad the sales leaders are treated here. Very sad.Brookdale Home Health will never grow until they get rid of all the old Brookdale alumni dead weight, and hire real talent that understands Home Health and that sales drives the bus for business!"
bad,"I worked there for nearly 2 years before someone got me fired while I was on break for a safety concern. Because that patient was on my assignment, I got blamed for it. When I tried explaining that I wasn’t responsible because I was on break at the time, I got told to stop making excuses."
bad,"Crappie pay ,crappie hours....in a pinch it will hold you over until you find a better job. 7.5 daily...work  holidays...no chance of advancement..lots of turn over on the staff..cannot recommend at all"
bad,"Poor regional management for the Dallas, TX area. They are not held accountable for issues within communities. Definitely no work/life balance and they make it clear that you are expendable."
bad,"Unsanitary conditions and lack of training "
bad,They do not care about the workers or patients.  They will work you to death  all they care about is the money that is coming in instead of can we take care of this patient. You are very under paid with this job . I had worked there for 3 and a half years. I loved all of the patients but management was awful.
bad,"Residents were wonderful and they are there for more assistance with ADLs. However, being frequently  short-staffed makes it impossible to provide the assistance the Residents need. As a LPN, you are often doing your Duties, which are many & providing Resident Care too.The Resident Aides are mostly young & very inexperienced. AHCA does not required any Certifications such as CNA or HHA at this Level of Care because,  it is a Social Model of Care, not a Medical Model. For most RAs this is their first Job, they need frequent monitoring & On-the-Job Teaching to ensure the Residents are being cared for. Many are young and not Team Oriented or respectful of one another. This particular location has a History of on-going Short-term Staff /  turn-over in all Departments. The ED is nice but, not effective with Staff Management Skills & ensuring Residents are getting the care that was promised on Admission. ED rarely came out of her Office, always on the Computer. The former Heath & Wellness LPN was very inexperienced in Nursing Knowledge / Skills &  Staff Management; LPN Supervisors were always finding & fixing mistakes in Orders that H&W Nurse may have taken. H&W Nurse played in the same Sand Box with the RAs, always Texting them On & Off Duty and not informing the ED or LPN Shift Supervisor of the Call-offs / Staffing Changes. On a daily basis, this was a very frustrating & stressful environment, with no improvement in sight...only empty promises. For a caring & experienced Nurse to be in so, like myself, many LPNs leave. We all came with high hopes of helping to make a positive difference"
bad,"Management favors employees who have been there longer . Speaks to me like I’m a child , and I feel like she as well as the other employees retaliate on me .I was hurt on the job and instead of getting light duties manager added more duties to my work day. While I do more duties the other employees sit in kitchen or break area and hang out . I have not taken any breaks since I started working there ."
bad,"What was something great tured into a disaster.  I will never work for this company EVER again. Management Horrible.   Very understaffed, moral low. Very bad experience with this company."
bad,"The residents are wonderful but communication is as low as the pay. In the interview, one is promised a certain number of hours but the reality is far less. The job is more of an admin/janitorial position than receptionist."
bad,I believe they hired me so they could pay me low wages; training did not come close to getting me prepared for the job; the director ridiculed employees behind their back and discussed their sexual orientation openly.  Always understaffed. I took my concerns to the associate director and he did nothing. Transfer to another property-- server was also a nightmare - NO TRAINING
bad,"No teamwork "
bad,"When I started things were pretty good but the longer I was there the worse it got. Management blamed cnas for EVERYTHING. We were expected to work overtime all the time and people who had kids were treated poorly if they couldn’t find a babysitter to cover last minute. There were times that so many people would call in on the same day that 2 aides would have to care for 80+ residents. The ED wouldn’t help, nor would the RN. The LPNs would shut off a call light and page the aide saying so and so needs the bathroom.. even when they know the aide is stuck with another resident. The residents DEFINITELY didn’t come first. And the aides didn’t get treated right at all. Management and kitchen staff and the house keeper got free food but the aides were required to pay. Breaks were required but if you were on break you would have to clock back in even after a few minutes if a call light went off because nobody else would answer it. I remember being on break one time and three minutes after I clocked out, a resident called. I listened to that call light go for my whole break just to prove nobody would get it. And we got yelled at for clocking in early even to get that call light."
bad,"As long as you are into butt kissing and never question anything, you are fine. If you have a brain and won't go along with just anything they tell you this is probably not the place for you."
bad,The upper crust management does not care about employees or the Residents all they care about is the appearance of the building and how much they can upgrade the main area's and outside and nothing for residents Only one activity a day and then they get pd for all day and do nothing else for residents This is a sad fact
bad,The office environment is not welcoming. Rude management. High turnover with nursing. Scheduling is poor. No support from management. Poor orientation process.
bad,Poor morals in the clinical area. Treatment of med techs is horrible. Poor training. No communication  between staff. Favortism. Decent schedule. Turning into a nursing home by accepting patients that need help with most ADLs.. not senior living. Clinical rules change very often.
bad,"Be prepared to work 16 hour shifts. This is not a typical assisted living facility. They claim to be assisted living but yet most of the clients need nursing home care (total care). Dont look forward for any help from any coworkers they wont help. You're on your own. They claim to have good benefits, that's how they bait you in."
bad,"The workplace culture is very hostile, nobody has anything positive to say. The hardest part of my job is management constantly putting more on care staff and telling us we do not do things good enough. The most enjoyable part of my job is the people I take care of, getting to know them and their families. A typical day at work is very stressful with no help from management. Brookdale has very poor management, I believe it could be a very wonderful place if management was better."
bad,"Reported the Director Crystal, the Clinical Manager Ashley, and Sue the scheduler in Saint Louis, MO"
bad,"Upper Management, just fired the best thing that happened to our building in a long time, our HWD. She was passionare, caring and fantastic, she supported us unlike the new ED they brought in. She is all about the money. Constant turnover of mgnt since ive been here. Sad. The familues, residents and staff our suffering because of it. We are supposed to be getting memory care training from our activities person, which does not happen."
bad,"I was a Dining Service Coordinator and was the only one doing there job, all other department heads, lazy! Maintenance was awesome to work with, but the E.D. was an ego driven young little boy running things to the ground!"
bad,you were treated very badly by seniors and were never compensated. you must have a lot of patients. besides the job the people there were friendly. also u get to take home any food that wasn't finished.
bad,The job wasn’t stressful but had very poor leadership! The ED had no structure within the team and the only focus was money. I wouldn’t recommend this job unless you have no morals.
bad,"The resident to employee ratio is not what it should be which over works there aides and leaves them feeling burnt out.  High employee turn over.  Can't leave on time because many employees are constantly late, but then management gives you a hard time about ""working the clock"". They won't fire the employees who are not performing their jobs because they're so desperate for staff.  There's residents that should be in a skilled facility instead of assisted, but Brookdale won't transfer them because they care more about the money than they actually do the residents or staff..."
bad,"Not even sure where to begin. The facility is nice, but behind the scenes is a nightmare. They hire people from factories and big box stores and allow them to pass meds and make decisions for your loved ones. The workers are uncertified through the state and it shows, poor hygiene, unsafe work practices with the residents care, and tons of what came off as neglect and or verbal abuse towards some residents. The workers have a bullying mentality, it's as if you're getting bottom of the barrel pay to go back to high school. The residents pay an arm and a leg to live there but they pay you less than a fast food chain would. Definitely do not recommend."
bad,This is an inconsistent company. The benefits are horrible. I will never understand why healthcare companies can't get their hands on better benefits for their employees like the non healthcare companies do. Brookdale has a high turnover rate on its employees.
bad,"Staffing was one of the biggest problems this location had. There were call ins all the time. Unfortunately, the staff that did come in were constantly overworked and stressed out. There was also a lack of support and lack of communication between management and the staff. Overall, it was a very disappointing work experience, but I did truly enjoy working with the senior population."
bad,Brookdale was the worst place to work at. You witness residents being treated wrong. Not Enough hours. Bad pay. Only a few associates really care about they residents
bad,"If you are strong willed go for it otherwise look else where.Bad management,lots of turn overs and low pay .Residents made my day and worth coming in when I did work there."
bad,By far one of the worst companies I’ve worked for. They do not take concerns seriously. The kitchen is a mess and not very clean. The drama and bad mouthing done by employees and directors is awful.
bad,"Yeah I agree with the guy who wrote a recent review which I agreed with. I don't know what management was paid but it's too much for how little they do. I took care of several patients there and the thing that was most upsetting was how management stepped in the way where I was trying as hard as I could to accommodate the patient with Alzheimer's. I remember this Mexican woman that had a real control issue and dismissed my credentials as LVN.  I do comply with the State regulations and always keep up with CPR, etc. My heart really goes out to the patients there and felt like telling their families to have them some where else especially for the amount of money they pay each month, it's outrageous. The only positive thing I can say about that place is the movie theater, the kitchen and the manager who is in charge there is really kind and nurturing to the people that dine there and food is good."
bad,Management has favoritism towards money making employees before anyone else. Staff is unable to express any opinion that is not acceptable or aligns with corporates ideas. Not enough support given by staff to new employees to feel welcome. Too many adults living at buildings that need more help from staff and should not be in assisted living. They charge so much to residents for additional services that should already be included. They are so understaffed that residents don't get the attention they need. Lots of staff should not be working there as they clearly don't like working with the elderly and complain too much.
bad,"If you're looking for a long term job in a great environment and advancement opportunity, this is NOT the place for you. Favoritism is a big problem here and it shows right away.Only a select few employees actually care about their residents and do what is supposed to be done, which leaves them doing the job of 2 people without getting paid like it. It seems they hire and keep anybody around despite their poor work ethic and lack of common sense. New hires are trained by other new hires, meaning nothing gets done and the vital parts of the job are left out. I have witnessed residents being left unattended on the toilet, unable to get up, left soaked in their own urine and feces, and ignored. Even employees that know the job and care get lazy and unmotivated due to poor treatment, being underappreciated and underpaid. When complaints are brought up to management not much is done about it. Most of them walk around with their nose up in the air acting nice one minute and talking about their emplyees the next. The amount of gossiping by workers and managers is outright shamefull. If youre looking for something temporary to gain some experience working with the elderly give it a shot. Longterm I do not recommend this company, specifically this location."
bad,"DO NOT WORK HERE! Once they no longer need you , they’ll do anything to get rid of you. This place is a scam and will eventually get shut down!!!!!’nn"
bad,"This office is very chaotic. The staff does not get along and there is no loyalty in management. Very much about numbers and not staff balance. Lots of favoritism,"
bad,Hated working here management was insanely corrupt I only recieved a 5 cent raise after working there for a year. Made suggestions to improve the system in the kitchen. They didn't listen
bad,"The current ED will lie to you or about you if it benefits her. She only cares about the money and that she will be retiring soon. She does not care about the residents only about money. She should be caring about the residents that are there now they are the ones paying the bills and her salary. "
bad,They asked way to much of servers and punished us when task were not completed. They gave us more and more responsibilities and less and less hours to do them with.
bad,"I enjoy working with the residents and helping them as best I can. I enjoy the gratitude they give when I have helped them solve a problem. The hardest part of the job is the high level of stress. The residents and guests can get very impatient and at times the phones will be ringing off the hook with very little support from other team members. Management is very inconsiderate to their staff and residents. Seems like they are here just to collect a paycheck and don't actually care about anyone here, Director literally locks her door."
bad,I loved working in activities and loved the residents.  Brookdale is a unprofessional place to work for. Upper management is disrespect toward lower managers.  The aides are allowed to run the place which does not work. Corporate sets up their staff for failure. Managers are suppose to do their job but is not provided the finances or staff to make each department successful. The atmosphere is very negative and the residents feed off the negativity which makes the day chaotic. There is a high turn over at Brookdale Memory Care. In one year 7 managers were either terminated or walked out. A very stressful place to work. Upper management makes mistakes but will cover up by blaming on others.
bad,The Detroit Network is tough. They push and push and push and push. It is not team work at all. Everyone has attitudes. Not a pleasure to work with this network (Home Health office) at all. Management delegates all their work to regular employees and scold them for not doing it timely. You are extremely overworked. They embarrass you in front of others. Horrible.
bad,"It's easy but management sucks. They are insufficient. They have attitudes and the rules only apply to certain people. They are good if you want to further your career as a CNA or nurse but other than that not much room for growth. Not really good pay. Never closes. No holidays off. The turnover rate for nurses, servers and daycare staff is ridiculous. They left my grandmother in a dark room with a broken call light as her oxygen declined and then called me to ask what I thought they should do. Duh! Call the blanc and take her back the hospital! She was scared in that room. The food isby that great. So basically it's a bunch if under paid people tryin to make ends meet In a facility  that cares nothing  about its staff... at least this is true for the Indianapolis  location."
bad,They don't care about suggestions or employee needs.                ...............benefits are really low vacation is only two weeks per year etc...
bad,"This is a very horrible company to work for or maybe it's the community. The managers do not care for the workers what so ever. They pile them with work and take hours. The managers all are all about themselves. Corporate office is a disgrace, they do nothing when you call and report stuff to them. Team work is just sad. The managers do not care for the resident just the money."
bad,"Its fine and dandy until the upper management decides that if you are not in the circle.  always talking bad about others.  If they are talking bad about others then they are talking bad about everyone.  Constant turnover.  the longer you are employed seems the more they think you should be let go. Calling people out in front of their peers.  Not knowing who the true leader is and others are able to speak to other employees in a very dis respectable manner.  Being polite and nice in hiring process then belittling you in front of everyone with little stabs at your ability in front of others with in weeks.  Care staff is mostly wonderful, they are frustrated of course because of management however continue to care for the residents because that is why they are there in the first place and it shows when they are interacting with residents.  The residents are the only reason to be here but it is hard to keep that reason in mind everyday you work because you feel worthless to management.  The bigger the company gets it seems to be the management they hire has bigger egos.  I have a bachelors degree but was layed off at a large employer after many years of employment and have never ever been treated this way.   and even worse is the customer service to the associates,  of course they are nice to the residents or new residents and family because they are the ones who pay the bills.  I will never recommend anyone working for this company.  Remember why you became who you were and why you took an oath in your career choice. This company needs to make management take oaths and really"
bad,"Beware, this is a billion dollar company and growing, but they do not invest in their employees. RN hourly rate is ridiculous(25.00) and the CNA(10.00) rates are just over minimum wage. You would be better off working at Aldi, their cashiers make 12.50 an hour for ringing up food."
bad,"I was the AD in a Independent community. We had over 70 residents who ranged from truly Independent to those needing a lot of assist to a few with Dementia. I had no assistant, that tells you plenty, as I'm sure the company saw us as ""Independent"" with folks who don't really need activities as they are so busy on their own. The company motto of filling up with whoever can pay held true with us as we were always under pressure to market. We has a sister building down the street and had to share our administrator with them, as the thought was we didn't need a full timer. A typical day could be very stressful or sometimes very quiet. I loved what I did and our residents were the best. Had the company cared more about what was really going on instead of appearance and money, I'd still be there today."
bad,"I worked for Merrill Gardens for a long time. Emeritus bought several properties including the one I was employed at. unfortunately, I became an employee of the horrible company!!  The workers are seriously overworked and underpaid.  Even the residents know that!  There are lots of people that lived in the community that shouldn't because they actually need around the clock care, But, this company is interested in filling their apartments and keeping their census up! They really will do whatever it takes to get those apartments filled because they want the money!! Its actually really sad.  The co-workers there are serious back biters too! no teamwork whatsoever! I've never ever worked for a place like this before, where your co-workers are out to get each other, gossiping, and starting all sorts of drama! the privacy act is constantly being violated and management doesn't do anything about it. amongst alot of different things they didnt do anything about. And it did'nt really help if you report it to HR either.  God forbid if you called in sick! jeez...I called in a few times only because I hurt my back on the job and had Dr notes and everything.  They were very upset with me about it. when I came back to work, not one person asked how I was feeling. not that I expected it.  The part of this job that kept me going was the residents. That is it."
bad,"A typical day at this job was very fast paced and filled with drama. I learned that your personal feelings have to be put aside at times. Management was terrible; some people had special treatment, not everyone had the same rules, management was lazy, and inconsistent. Some co-workers were a big help when needed. A lot of people would call out so you'd have to stay another shift almost everyday. No one liked working there so co-workers would quit and there wouldn't be enough workers at times. The hardest part of the job was balancing your emotions in the workplace. The most enjoyable part of the job was working with the residents, talking to them, and doing activities with them."
bad,"worst place ever to work at. I do not reccomend this company, afgter a few months you will quite"
bad,"They work you to the bone for $8/hr. I am all about the team and would help whenever it was needed and do more to help everyone. But when you need help, no one knows your name. Was the worse management I have seen. After working there I would never place love ones there to live!"
bad,The regional management team does not live up to the company standards and family values. At a local level the community is good until the Regional managers get involved. They make rash decisions without full knowledge of facts.
bad,"If you ever get a job offer at this company, run. It is the worst most bizzare company I have ever worked for. Corporate is insane. The dollar is the most important thing with this company."
bad,"I left Wynwood after 2 months of waiting for working conditions to change. They brought in new residents who were confused and/or total care instead of assist, but 99% of their RAs are not CNA licensed. When an RA quit, she was not replaced; therefore, there was not enough coverage to care for the residents. Two RAs working in a three-story building with many total care residents, added to the many mundane tasks expected, made it impossible to get to call lights promptly. I worked most all eight-hour shifts with no break whatsoever. I could not continue working there in fear of residents and/or RAs getting hurt."
bad,"Total, never ending, chaos from my 1st day! I don't believe it will EVER run smoothly. As part of the management team, I ran into wall after wall when attempting to correct issues within my department. EVERY wall had huge DOLLAR SIGN ON IT! HUGE employee turnover in every department. Unreliable staff in every department. I worked WEEKS w/o a day off. I'm done!"
bad,Health care professional with extensive experience in home health care services by providing clinical needs to patients. Compassion for understanding and meeting patients needs in an individualized and consultative approach has enabled me to build impact relationships.
bad,"I was told to resign after a week of working there on account of ""not being dedicated enough."" I had been sick with bronchitis for 2 weeks and had one (1) day i came in late and just like that, I was gone. absolutely ridiculous."
bad,"Mismanaged, unsupportive management.  Unprofessional staff that have little to no prior experience.  Some staff are dedicated, but most there to earn a check and punch out."
bad,"Was discriminated against due to the gender of my spouse wrote up and verbally abused by management. Witnessed abuse that was not resolved. I was able to get my med tech class and 80 hour training. The residents are amazing . Just ran very poorly, very rude and hurtful management staff."
bad,"Managers don't care about their employees. Will want you to work several jobs, but will pay you for the least paying one. Mangers gossip about others and themselves. Cut hours to force people to quit or find other employment."
bad,"Brookdale seemed to be a good place to work. It was a good place at first because they have 40 or more hours for you. However management is not good. I cant tell you how many times I talked to management about a concern and it  was promised to be addressed and not addressed. They work you to death and stress you out and expect things to be perfect. Nothing is perfect in the medical "
bad,"If not in their click you are not treated  fairly.  Residents are not  taken  care of properly, ignored  until they have to be  attended,  pay is terrible and  hours are even  worse, I feel  bad for anyone who  works  or lives there!!!"
bad,"This place was just a nightmare. The turnover rate was ridiculous. They were so understaffed that third shift had two people working from 10p-6a. One in Memory Care and the other in AL. That typically included the nurse. Also, if you weren't blonde or worked firat shift, then you weren't ""in"". All in all, I feel like the employees are paid unfairly. Eleven dollars on the hour to do what aides do? Yeah, right."
bad,"My biggest issue is with the management team in the assisted living portion. They are cliquish. The director of nurses shirks her responsibilities. Creates policy and procedure out of thin air. And holds PTO for ransom. Residents are not priority, The clique is priority."
bad,The management does not care about you and are very phony friendly. No orientation to your job. Short of help constantly. They treat you poorly especially if you were injured on the job
bad,Great place to work if your heart's in it other than the residents are the ONLY perks for this job! Management and corporate doesn't care for their worker's you're basically a mule there's so many violations and corruption going on it's unbearable!
bad,"Wages are too low, not enough staff, terrible work environment with no supportive management however I was able to make decisions on my own if needed. Corporate Nurse was excellent but on site managers are terrible and nurses do not have good basic skills like wound or catheter care."
bad,"This place was sad because so my people where neglected in some sense whether emotional or physical."
bad,"I was pushed out the door by territorial co workers. "
bad,Under current Management...RUN don't walk AWAY! Onsite ED and Management staff below poor . Zero compassion for seniors and slide bye....while covering for each other's errors at the cost of residents integrity and care!  Senior Management made aware by complaints from staff residents and family members yet they keep them on staff. NOT worth being thrown under the bus for!
bad,Favoritism from management. The lack of care provided was awful. The RCA's was very neglectful.  Management is horrible. She is not a honest person.  She plays her staff against each other.
bad,"The Executive director and human resources director always gave conflicting assignments, when asked for clarification was told that I was not paying attention in meetings, however the other housekeeper was having the exact same issues."
bad,Brookdale and broke! My boss was kind enough to let me know early on that thus company treats their SM like disposables. When I tried to help families Brookdale did not accept the client.
bad,"The pros Fantastic co workers, eat for free, residents is Wonderful "
bad,If u have a family and bills don't go there and work because it's not worth it. I hate  management the health and wellness nurse because they don't care.
bad,"Pros:"
bad,"It’s a good place to work if it’s your only job. Because you are obligated to stay and work double shift if the other person doesn’t show up.. which happens regularly. Management is horrible. As soon as you tell them something, the entire facility knows. Best to keep to your self. And the med techs run away the little to no help that they can get. And management knows and doesn’t do anything about it."
bad,"Please stay away from this company.   It's cut-throat madness. You will be deceived into believing that you made a great choice but after 2 months, you will see the the truth."
bad,"I ignored previous warnings thinking they were written by disgruntled employees.  I should have heeded others warnings!  Office environment was toxic, unprofessional, unorganized and just a bad company culture throughout.   Power struggles throughout the office w/ layers of management pushing paper and no one to provide patient care.  I have never walked out on a job before but my sanity was worth more to me than a paycheck.   The company treats its clinicians so badly that they are unable to get them to sign on as direct employees and the contractors leave before their contracts are up.   Never, in my two months, was quality of care mentioned.   The company is losing ground and it's showing in their push to increase revenue.   Stock market is a good indicator.   Run!   In the other direction!!!"
bad,"This place is falling apart in the kitchen, a lot of pests roaches bed bugs  takes forever to fix equipment staff lazy  is like high school with the gossip would never work for this company again.."
bad,Materials we need are scarce or non existant at times such as drugs towels tiolet paper and  linens. many times we have to wait til some are washed It is a terrible situation for our patients. We suspect it is because mgt is not using their funds to make it appear they are saving money in their budget They claim these things are being stolen If that is the case make each person accountable for a certain amount of these supplies snd take inventory every month instead of punishing the patients and not allowing them every day to take baths or wait for medicines or use brown hand towel for wiping
bad,Not the best place to work. You will do everything a receptionist doesn't do. You'll clean up and do hard jobs. Ruin nice clothes and not be able to get ahold of anyone.
bad,"I would not recommend to a friend unless it's a first job. Soo many task but soo little pay. Whether you're sitting around doing nothing  or working your butt off, you get paid the same and maybe even less hours then those are just sitting around.  It's nice to get to know the restidents but other then that, That's all."
bad,Worked with Brookdale for 2 years. First year was with Home Health and second year was with Hospice. Working with Home Health was a great experience. Second year working with the Hospice manager was the worst experience ever.  Instead of coaching me as a sales manager should do she was always trying to find out something wrong.  I was informed by my accounts that she would come in when i wasn't around to try and find out if I was doing anything wrong.  Completely unprofessional and I honestly don't know how she still has this position.
bad,"Manager was a big micromanager. There was no trust in other department heads, from the executive director. It’s quite funny how someone always talks about team work, but that person that does, is the number one person to not help out when it come down to it."
bad,"well this places management was poor and irresponsable, she was european and didnt understand english well enough. At one point my boss taught me how to use a rag to dry a plate."
bad,Unsanitary conditions were not corrected.  When brought to the attention of management they would rather have workers come in and do their job instead of making sure these servers were properly trained.  Poor to zero hand washing by serving staff even after a smoke  break or restroom break. It was acceptable for employees to physically touch and push each other.  This horse-play was not corrected by director.
bad,i only worked 3 hours each day and only worked 6 days.Management never listens to employees.Residents and Employees were being treated unfairly.Residents are aggressive.
bad,"2nd shift- come in check on residents. See what needs to be done before supper time at 5pm. See what laundries need picked up prior to your shift ending. Assist with bathing and dressing for bed. Best part of the job is getting to know your resident and find out how they like to do things, that way you can make them feel right at home. I learned from the culture of Brookdale. Enriching the lives of those we serve with compassion, respect, excellence and integrity. At our daily meeting we repeat this following the end."
bad,"Hello everybody I was a CNA at Skilled Nursing Rehab Brookdale la Rosa .I just want to say that Brookdale treated horrible. This was my first job as a CNA, and I was treated unfairly I felt discriminated I don't know why but Brookdale has a lot of bad energy Except the people in assisted living that I love and care for and the kitchen as well. Adding to  my former Boss and few Nurses. Everybody else was not a team player this was a very very stressful job. yes they terminated me but guess what I think they did me a favor,and  God doesn't like ugly and for what the higher-ups did to me was wrong. Anyways God is good and he blessed me with a better job.🤗☺😘😇"
bad,the work place is stressful and fast moving. but the residents you care for are a delight and amazing . i love my job and the Elderlies that i get to care for.
bad,not a good place to work. low employee moral and run down back of house. residents not well taken care of. would not recommend this job to any job seeker.
bad,"Can be a great place to work, but have very poor management.  Every department are always short staffed.  Everything is nothing but rush, rush, rush.."
bad,"Too much turnover. Management is not concerned with the needs of the employees. Management shows favoritism towards certain employees. Constantly working short staffed. Too much drama between staff. Everyone, including the residents, seem miserable to be there."
bad,"I personally was treated very well. However, management caused low moral for staff.There was a negative atmosphere overall. There were four Directors of Maintenance during my 14 months there,"
bad,"Management sucks, if you have a work related injury either: your hours get cut, you get written up, or fired.  Policy says if your sick with diarrhea or vomiting to not come in. Yet they won't let you call off if you're sick. Staff has no team work all they do is gossip and watch other employees that they do not like struggle. Management assigns residents that belong in memory care and skilled in assisted living, the quality of care goes down because assisted living isn't equipped for that level of care. I wouldn't recommend this place to my worst enemy."
bad,"Management micromanages activities from the Regional Director down.  The District Manager outlines specific guidelines to follow, then when they don't work  holds staff accountable.  Negative reinforcement is the flavor of the day.  The residents are wonderful and offset some of the grief."
bad,"I've work here for 1 year and some odd months. Coworkers are shady and lie on people. Management is a total joke, the turn over rate is so high it's unbelievable. Residents are needing more care than an assisted living facility should give. We are a ""no lift"" facility; we lift 90% of the residents. You're told what you want to hear; no help when needed. Charge nurses will be your friend then turn on you. The rate of pay is a joke for all the things we do!"
bad,"Residents are great. I was a caregiver for this company for a few years. Management over caregivers was very poor. I've seen all of residents not being cared for like they should have, broke my heart. Some co-workers were amazing but they were definitely a lot of weird people working there. The nurses were absolutely great and have great hearts but did not get enough credit for their hard work. This company does NOT care about you, they don't even care for their residents they just want the residents money."
bad,I worked @Homewood Village of Genesee County & it was awful.
bad,"This place doesn't understand hospice. To much management, and not enough Indians. Job security is none. If you are male do not work here. Very woman dominated place to work with a few man haters in management."
bad,Worked as hwd was on call 24/7 no breaks. Not good upper mangers. Glad to be out of there.
bad,BEWARE! The RCC position in Greenville NC is nursing suicide!
bad,It was not the right place for me to work. I put values and respect on everything I do and this was just not the place for me. It was just time for me to move on.
bad,Working with the residents was truly joyful.   I worried about many of the residents when I wasn't there.  I don't believe they were not mistreated as much as not given tenderness and respect for their age.   Management was more concerned with the bottom line than the happiness of the residents.   I don't believe most of the residents would choose to live there if they had a choice.  They would go to another facility.  I choose to leave because I could.
bad,Brookdale was the worse job I ever had.  All of the managers were terrible with the exception of one.  I do not recommend this job at all.  They act like they are interested in improving the contact center for the better but you can tell they don't care.
bad,"Management at Brookdale Macon are the Worse. They are very Fake..”Beware!” They will smile and lie straight to your face. If you complain about a resident left in bed when you arrived to work, soaked in urine & feces, not one time but many, resulting in you having to do someone else’s work plus your own and it was on one of their favorites...you can forget it, nothing will be done! However, you will be marked as a target and at that point, they will tell lies and do whatever to fire you and or get you fired. Horrible Experience!!!!!"
bad,The management team plays favorites and treat non-favorites like they dont matter. Do not like to give employees the chance to move up throughout the company. The benefits are very good but the pay for what employees do is not enough. Management will always side with other managers regardless of situation.
bad,"This started out as a great place to work until management came in from corporate. The other supervisors became lazy, Which in-turn made staff workers lazy. So a this made it hard to come to work."
bad,You never know your schedule they change it daily and always call you in on your day off.  Always short staffed. Working with the elderly can be very rewarding but not being able to have a work home life balance was very hard on my child
bad,Unfair treatment  they over work you favoritism with certain employees and not enough pay you cant make a living off $8.50 managements is horrible horrible horrible
bad,This job was not a fit for me. I was constantly frustrated by the short staffed feeling of having to take care of too many residents while not feeling properly trained or looked out for.
bad,"It’s a great job if you want to be involved in drama everyday. Resident Assistants care more about their personal needs than the actual residents. No teamwork whatsoever, so if your resident soiled their depends while you are on lunch, expect to find it still on them when you return."
bad,"I had three years with Brookdale. I gave 110% every day of my employ. I loved my job of encouragement and service as the Sales Counselor for Assisted Living and and Memory Care. I had the highest marks in all my annual performance reviews. I had just come through my annual reviews and was told by my Executive Director I was doing a great job and my position was secure as we were under a new district management team. 10 days after this conversation on the morning of April 1st my position was eliminated. I was given a single paycheck as severance pay. My betrayal by Brookdale Company is complete. They don't care about theit staff and the heart and soul they bring to their positions. Their residents are clueless to the fact that they are nothing more than cash cows to this corporate machine. My trust in this company appreciating my blood, sweat and tears given to my position as Sales Counselor we're misplaced. I would keep moving if you are looking for a good company you can advance and believe in."
bad,"A good place with people who care about their job, but management was abusing their powers. The time I spent there was the best job I had, I was interested in the people who lived there. The had accepted me as one of the hardest working, and youngest cook, there was."
bad,"Very poor management.  Will tell you anything to get you in the door, then things change quickly. High staff turnover of all disciplines. Very little attempt to retain staff. No recognition for meeting census goals."
bad,"would never work here again, residents are very rude and disrespectful staff is always calling out and doing 16hr shifts, management doesn't care about employees."
bad,"I have been working here for over a year now and have been through two ED's, two HWD's, 5 nurses, 8 aides, 2 dining service managers, 3 cooks, 4 housekeepers, countless residents, etc.... Get the picture?"
bad,"Cooking, Cleaning, Washing dishes, and following diet orders. How to have tough skin and work with a very low budget. Overrated nursing facility with high class prices. always critcized"
bad,"The company was bought out, creating a lot of turnover and new leadership being brought in.  I spent 6-7 days a week working for them, which made for long hours.  It was also a tough environment to be in given the direness of the patients and their illnesses."
bad,"Just plain sucks!, it's a paycheck.  But it's always about patient being right every time and always the staffs fault of course the bosses are always right. "
bad,Need I say more? Fine. Constantly understaffed. Day and evening shifts are lucky if they get to take their lunch breaks after six hours straight of being on their feet. If someone calls off.. it's that much worse.
bad,I'M LITERALLY quite as a mouse.They always give me backhanded compliments. Go out there way to be NICE=NASTY...GOSSIPY GOSSIPY GOSSIPY...ALWAYS IN PEOPLE'S BUSINESS.I work privately with my client here. I personally would not work with this staff. I would QUIT the 1st week there CALCULATED AND SHADY....(Covert) narcissistic environment.There very careful not to be too OVERT
bad,"Lack of communication with management.  Schedule problems. Unable to prioritize the client's  needs. Hire without enough work and training."
bad,"Brookdale is a horrible place to work.  There is no management, no communication and understaffed.They promise incentives, but never pay them.  You never know from day to day what you're going to be in trouble for doing.  Absolutely bizarre and ridiculous!"
bad,I was on 4th kitchen manager when i left and 3rd executive director. If thats any clue run while you have sanity. I got blamed for things that i had no control over and werent in my job duties and got tired of bullying from everyone including ED. I called employee hotline but by the time they called me to yalk about the issues i had given up and left. I took medical leave due to bullying and  ended up quitting and
bad,managers are awful they do not listen to floor staff and when problems arise it takes the favorites to get anything done about it. The only good part was the 2 good co workers and the residents of course.
bad,I was extremely disappointed when concern was expressed about the executive director to not only the regional manager but HR director and absolutely nothing was done to investigate for make things better. Both associates and family members expressed concern with the lack of involved the executive director had with its associates and residents. One family member said “it’s really sad she doesn’t even try to get to know her employees or the residents” she was making this comment because she never would leave her office and still doesn’t.
bad,"Too much drama and lies. If management doesn't like you they will find every way to make sure you don't move up. Staff are overworked and underappreciated . I always got mandated all the time . They hire anyone to work just to have somebody so the rcc doesn't have to do their job . Rules constantly change from one manager to the Next"
bad,Always covering or picking up after others. Managers/supervisors would rather not deal with any issues even if you go to them about a specific problem that’s happened multiple times. At times it felt like there was no one to go to for issues happening within a department. Horrible yearly raises and you don’t get the opportunity for growth because your voice isn’t heard or taken seriously. Housekeeping department specifically is a revolving door and no one takes responsibility for anything.
bad,"I worked for this company for 4 yrs. I was just nominated and won Employee of the Month, First week of April I was another bonus for always being on time, never missing work, never missing time punches, no accidents, coming in early or staying over when asked.  My immediate supevisor hired a friend o his to fill the open position in our dept. and 3  weeks later after training this man, I was fired.  I fired on LIES> POOORRR MANAGEMENT AND IDIOTS IN HR."
bad,Horrible management. Everybody left did not care about the residents or the workers. Very rude and disrespectful and only cared about their own personal needs.
bad,"Very stressful work environment. Lack of communication and respect.Resident care is terrible. Few very caring staff members, upper management more concerned about making money."
bad,"Very unorganized poor management, to much work not enough employees to perform work without over exertion. Management is all about the money and sales and not about the care of the residents or their staff"
bad,Growing the Home Health Division- very stressful and disorganized. Training of employees is very limited and expectations are extremely high with a workload that is unmanageable.
bad,"As a nurse I was disgusted at the poor management skills. The building was always short staffed and we were personally told that the reason being was that we were over $800,000 over budget and easiest way to get it back is to cut labor costs. I completely understand that, except this isn't a factory. These are living human beings who require attention and pay large amounts of money to be taken care of. If they want to cut costs I would highly recommend serving something other than lamb almost every day of the week for dinner or having salary employees pick up instead of offering overtime we can't afford. If family member had issues/concerns they were not dealt with within a timely manner and a lot of times were disrespected. It saddens me that this building has been driven into the ground by management. The residents deserve more. They shouldn't have to be worried because they're out of briefs or feel uncomfortable because the EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR interrogated a resident in her own room because she called the hotline on her. Unreal."
bad,"Terrible management who have absolutely no concern for residents and employees,  although they are following instructions from even worse corporate leaders after nothing more than profit."
bad,"I worked third shift and of course, just like every other place I've worked; third shift gets blamed for everything. Managment took down curtains thru out the building so they could spy on us at night. We were terrified. A few times we heard knocks at the windows and seen people peaking in. We didn't know who it was at the time and had to call the police multiple times. The pay was horrible and it was like re-living high school all over again. #theworst RUN!"
bad,"the most stressful place to work in every department. even supervisors hate working there. unless you are a department head making salary. pay sucks especially for all the mess you have to put up with including the ""security"" cameras they put in the smoking area, which is an open space in the parking garage- nothing more than a spying invasion of privacy. every exit has a camera, you cannot take a restroom break without being on at least 2 cameras, and that's only if your boss will let u go. roaches, mice, and fruit flies plague the kitchen and dining rooms."
bad,"On call 24/7, get called into work at 2am and 12am because someone called off. Do not apply for this position if you have kids or family that you want time with."
bad,"Lack of professional, compassionate management .  They had bedbugs and wouldn’t replace the carpets . I was so discouraged with corporate. Some coworkers were fantastic, others should find other place to work where they could be happy. Nurse was cruel"
bad,Other than the people you work with this place is not a good place to be. You're given a lot of expectations for 7.17 an hour after taxes. If you got on management's bad side you were exiled to minimum hours until you quit.
bad,"This job started out great, but descended into a disaster due to their ridiculous micromanaging.  They have no idea what they are doing in regards to the rules, which has created an environment that favors certain people.  If you aren’t one of those favorites, then good luck on every pleasing the top brass."
bad,"ADL's,staff schedule,addressing family concerns. lots of staff and management turnover. I enjoy all my residents. Alzheimer's is stressful. It is hard to work with people who are here only because they need a job and truly don't care about the residents."
bad,"Full time requires about double the visits as other companies. There is little to no consideration whether those visits are SOC's or revisits. The nice thing is they are mostly in 7 facilities in town, so you could easily just be in 1 location on 1 day. They pay well, I would work here if I had no family or other life outside of work."
bad,"As with a lot of corporations, focus on the individual is lost with the size. It's all about profit and bottom line."
bad,My hours were cut without notice and residents were neglected. The staff was always out to get each other and were very unproductive. Tasks would never be completed. Only work done was around meal time and bed time. Housekeeper never cleaned resident rooms or bathrooms
bad,"Management very unprofessional, gossip about everyone. When you complain about how things are run , nothing gets resolved, no matter how much they say to come and tell someone, nothing gets done. Some employees back up each other on mistakes being made, but when it’s comes to you they try to fire you."
bad,The one I work at have favoritisms with some of the workers they always let this one person do whatever he wants some of the management play with your check putting hours on in services when you really was working for overtime hours if they hirer new management there it would be a better place to work and give some of us more pay
bad,"The management here is horrible, they’ll tell you not to gossip but they’ll go and gossip to you. You get 1 raise a year and some people get 10 cent raises, others get 35 cents. 35 cents is the highest raise anyone got in the community. If they tell you you’re getting a promotion and a raise, you’ll get the promotion and the work load but they won’t give you your raise."
bad,"You will be overworked underpaid and stressed out the expectation of you is high but the reward is not."
bad,Cleaning and taking care of the elders is one of the most rewarding experiences ever. The company treats the residents and the employee good. They hold the residents best interest first .
bad,They stick together in clicks and if they don't like you they find a way to fire you. Management very prejudice toward African Americans.  Wouldn't recommend
bad,"Day shift is extremely busy, they put people in beds that aren't rehab just to fill beds. State was there for complaints of understaffing. Management works by LTC guidelines not skilled nursing guidelines."
bad,"The staff was not organize,especially for the front desk receptionist staff, I was never given a name tag,nor username for the front desk computor to complete work orders. Very messy."
bad,when you are working in an enviorment where you have to deal with co-workers you must know how to seperate personal from business so that you maintain a certain level of professionalism in the work place especially if you are in a management position
bad,"Management only care about telling families what they want to hear to get the move in.  Nothing done by protocol. When staff complains to corporate they decide to ""clean house."" Not enough properly trained staff, always short staff. Managers hire families and show their favoritism towards their family members they hire. So upsetting because this once was a fun,caring, company. They also move in people that should be in a memory care unit but will take them for the $, not caring in regards to their safety."
bad,"It started out as an amazing place to work - "
bad,"I worked for Clear Bidge. And loved it, when it came to my residents.. I started on the night shift. Befor I went to days. At night the shift is ran with a CMA,or MAT, and a CNA. And a at home nurse that you hope you could wake up and answer the phone. I would have to work with kids that was in school all day, and only wonted to find a hiding sport and go to sleep for the whole shift, waking up at 5. Doing a half jack hall cheak and clocking out.. Trying to get Management to help you was a joke. Because this Company is a friendship base hired.. And you dear not say anything bad about there warm body on the floor.. Or you would be dumbed on, and out casted by management thire self. When I went to days it was only just as bad with no management in the building, and no one running the building.. All we was told in team care meetings was how Broke we was.No training so what ever.. Being a season Aide was my only hope in this community.. So I transfer too another Brook dale community.. Wow. Also starting on the night shift before going to the day shift.. Same thing employees slept  all night while I have to clean, do the laundry, cheak the whole building trying to make sure everyone was okay,and off the floor. After going to days. The coworkers never stop changing. If anyone showed up at all. And if management had to come in there was hell to pay.  Frist thing you wouId hear was I don't wont to work the floor or the cart.. ..then you have the nursing team... saying things like you don't know how much medication it takes to put me in a upright position to come in and deal with this"
bad,"I loved my residents and my job but the management was so bad. They terminated the only manager that cared and tried to help her residents and employees. She always tried to do the right thing but they still decided to terminate her with no warning. The most enjoyable part of my day was seeing my residents happy and taken care of well. The hardest part was dealing with a coworker that has neglected, threatened, harassed and was very rude and disrespectful and used her ""personality"" as an excuse. Eventually all of the managers for terminated and they fired several employees when corporate came to ""fix things"". I was put on administrative leave for something that was very unfair and the employee that neglected, etc, is still working there. I would never recommend this place to another person seeking a job or a family or senior looking for somewhere to live and receive care."
bad,Management at the Randolph location was very unprofessional. I felt as though they didn’t care about the residents at all. Which led to my resignations
bad,"First of all, when you have worthless lazy staff it shows. The care staff are lazy and blame management. They call off ALL the time and complain about being short. They have nasty attitudes. The work ethic of the RCAs is NON EXISTING!!!!! Then they call that stupid hot line to complain about management who has there back when they are the screw ups. Every single UNEDUCATED caregiver thinks they can do the supervisors job better than she can. Such a joke. Brookdale Troy is Ghetto heaven for those ratchet birds. Everyone needs a job. I would NEVER place my family in a place like that. They might as well take medicaid. They staff that place with Detroits finest garbage. The care staff complain about the building being dirty and its their job to help keep it clean. Bet their houses are disgusting."
bad,Was a rewarding experience for me from the standpoint of my association with residents and their friends and family.  I had many residents who became important to me.
bad,"Management is awful. They say they are assisted living, but 80% of residents are total care, housekeeping and laundry done by rcas, management does nothing to make sure residents receive proper care, faulty equiptment, short staffed, just a awful place to work."
bad,I suffered at  Chatsworth for 1 year. I was sexually harassed by a maintenance worker it was never reported by the AED and i was not paid my comission since 2018 and 2019 and the Ed lied to have me fired
bad,A typical day at work included assisting residents with getting dressed and eating. The hardest part of this job was ever losing a resident. The most enjoyable was being able to help the residents.
bad,"Poor management, doesn't work with you they against you if you are African American no matter what title you carry, all African American that I have seen in management, they either quit or get fire, it's ran better when men where in upper management."
bad,Not a bad company but do your homework before accepting a job here. Some communities are fantastic while others aren’t so great. The community I worked at never had 2 Sales Managers (before I started) but their census was down and they needed help. I quickly realized that their goal of 4 move-ins per sales manager was unrealistic. It was a bad situation from the get-go. They expect you to buy “personal connections” for all visiting prospects but don’t give you a corporate credit card to do so  it was a very strange situation  the people and families at the community were great but the Directors didn’t have a clue when it came to understanding sales and improving their census there  I would recommend Brookdale but not at my particular community  do your homework and proceed with caution
bad,Worked at a brookdale in mesa. Quit with no notice because of a death in the family reapplied in apache junction. Hired me then the corporate said no. I wouldn't recommend brookdale to no one. They don't care about people.
bad,Only thing I loved about working here was the resident and there family’s. But management was nothing but a bunch of bullies and so where the girls working there for 1 year or more. There under staffed and expect the 2 to 3 ppl they have there to handle 38 residents. A lot of the staff bragged about how they hit resident or how they cursed them out and ignored good employees never stayed long nasty place!
bad,I work there about three years ago I don't know how it is now but then it was very unprofessional I don't recommend working there . Not as a server dishwasher because they  don't give you your Fair hours.
bad,"This is one of the most poorly run and unorganized home health companies in this state.  They promise patient care that they cannot provide, insist on starting care for patients that are NOT homebound, they do not have enough nurses because they all quit-positions have been vacant for over one year. They do not have enough nursing assistants because they fire them all !  Patient constantly call to complain about the staff because they either don't show up (since there aren't enough of them!) or are not properly trained on the skill they are sent to perform.  Orientation is non existent.  This company is only interested in accumulating patients (especially within the assisted living buildings owned by Brookdale) and use intimidation to push staff into pressuring these patients to accept"
bad,"Poor Nursing management, does not have the skills to be a D.O.N. Let’s other people pass narcotics who does not even have a CNA license. Never been Certified in the state of Kentucky. The Administration is A Joke !"
bad,the squeaky wheels got the grease while the good employees got walked on. management was terrible. training you was a lie to get you to buy into the company. they hire executive directors who get fired from every other building near them so she drives 3 hours there just to drag the place into the dirt. executive director hired friend for big salaried position who clearly was not qualified.
bad,"Each time we got a new HWD the way things were done was changed ,which confused residents as well as staff. (8) times since I've been here. Management does what they want to do and only follow rules when they want or convenient for them. Things we would get written up for was ok for them to do. Every time  around they were telling us that if we didn't do it we would get written up."
bad,Brookdale home health Greensboro office may have been the worst place I’ve ever worked. Very high turnover rate for that branch. Management is very poor. Money driven which leads to poor decisions in patient care. Please do not waste your time.
bad,DO NOT TAKE A JOB AS A PSY HOME HEALTH NURSE. YOU WILL NOT BE DOING ANY PSYCHIATRIC NURSING.You will be going to extended care facilities working with geriatric patients. Long hours. A salaried job. A lot of computer work for when you get home. Understaffed. As a supervisor required to do a lot of staff field work because they could not keep staff RNs. Bordered on medicaid fraud. Signed up patients for services not needed or of little use to them. Families angry that their family members were being billed for services not needed for their family members. What I was told in the interview about the job I would be doing was nothing like what the job was. Started at 8 AM and did not get home until 7 to 8 PM. Then had get on the computer to complete the paper work.
bad,"Working here was an awful experience. Not only are you severely overworked and underpaid, employees are also treated like slaves. Management is full of petty and immature bullies that like to belittle and mock their workers, while they sit in their office and praise only their favorite employees."
bad,great place for elderly. great food and activities. great jonb for part time but not full. elders are pleasant except for occasional sour apple no respect for workers. jessica was a horrible boss and reason why i quit . im happy i did.
bad,I hated working here ! I showed up for all my shifts but was either locked out or had nobody to train me as i was told i would have. 80+ elderly yet there was only 2 overnight workers.
bad,"This place ruined retirement homes for me. It’s sad the lack of effort and care that goes into this place. There’s holes in the floors that lead directly outside. The food has no flavor and barely any taste, yes I know it’s for the elderly but you still need to put effort into what you do."
bad,"This job was very overwhelming , we were always under staff , and Management were not team players. The only thing I enjoyed about working there is creating a bond with the residents"
bad,"Poor corporate leadership, high turnover because lack of support.  Seems to be an overall lack of strong leadership or business management."
bad,There is this clique and if you're not in it you are the odd one out. not only that but everyone will run to the boss for every little thing. They try to tell you what to do in your own personal life as well. Always short staffed and picking up shifts with not one thank you. the place is a joke. I don't recommend anyone working there.
bad,"The job always smelled horrible. The carpet is old and soiled and need to be thrown away. The staff are rude, harsh and always overworked the employees."
bad,"I worked as a manager for this company,  and stepped down from the position. In a Meeting one of the managers stated  (Let's take the Residents pet cat down to the Chinese restaurant and cook it.) This was said in the presence of two of our Asian employees, and also the director who did nothing to stop this behavior. The employees are over worked, Under paid,  Stressed out, and burned out. The management team with the exception of one is a joke ,The director is a total air head,  and the foodservice manager is a buffoon."
bad,"I work for this company for 9 month, with the worst management staff I have ever seen, also nurses, that always give orders, but never listen to the staff members, to see what they could do , to make it a better place to work, also work us short on midnight shift. Working one CNA with at least 17-18 resident, with four residents to get up in morning, call lights ring all night, with no help from nurses, that make up story on you , to get you wrote up, and management believe what their nurses say.there are no recognition of a job well done, also hire you for full time, and put you on the schedule ,and you drive all the way there , to find out that you are cancelled, at least once a week. But you ask me do lake Harris care about there workers, no consideration what so ever."
bad,I feel Emeritus is a terrible company to work for. No support from management. Staff are not shown that they are appreciated (example not having a Christmas party in 2012 for one). Staff are over worked. There is too high level of care and management wont listen to the staffs cries for help. Its awful just like Frontline said! And thats why my last day is August 30th
bad,The best part of the residents. They are great to talk to.
bad,"This job sucks if I was you I would never work here, they do not know how to talk to people, they judge you soon as you walk in the door. the pay suck, the people who hire you suck, it's a pretty place and the higher up an HR they all suck. if you want to keep your license don't work here...."
bad,"Working in our facility is a typical day at work. l start the day with a smile, greeting our residents, saying Hi.. how are you doing..check their rooms, the residents, the cleanliness and everything. I give showers to scheduled persons, change their beddings and see to it that they look presentable to everybody. In other words its like a routine already and for me this is a typical day. My shift ends with a smile, even l am tired but l have serve mankind and proud to be a servant to my people."
bad,I loved work there because the elder people that lives there they remind me of my grandparsent that I took care of befor they both passes away a month apart
bad,They ware unprofessional was trying to worry about my Personal life letting ppl get to them and letting co-works tell them things  about me that didn’t have anything to do with work
bad,I really enjoyed working with all the staff. My area would get so far behind with filing I never could keep it up during my working hours. I received permission to come in after work and keep that from getting far behind.
bad,"I only worked here for 1 month to keep the money flowing after I left Gate petroleum, so I havnt got too much to say. The work was constant and repetitive"
bad,"When I first started working at Brookdale it was wonderful. After 2 years management was not what it used to be and it wasn't the same work place. While working for brookdale I had five Executive Directors. I started as a resident associate and worked my way up to a promotion to Medication Technician. While working for Brookdale only three people including me were ever terminated and we were terminated within a 5 month time frame, all from the same executive director.  I believe that I would still be working for brookdale if my last executive director had never been my superior."
bad,"The typical day at Brookdale would be fast pace,I learned how to do many things at one time and get great results at the sametime,the management at the time I worked there was great,my  co workers were team workers we provided the best possible care for residents ,The hardest part of my job was getting off time, the most enjoyable part was the residents."
bad,Management didn’t take actions on anything going on in the office. The management also didn’t pay attention to residents needs and/or wants. I felt bad for the residents living there
bad,would not work there if you want a place that will take care of you and pay you what you are worth. they are always cutting hours wanting everyone to pick up the time.
bad,The pay is horrible and you are lifting people who shouldn’t be there management doesn’t care either. I would never recommend someone working there. They are only concerned about filling the beds and their pockets. Nothing more sadly!!
bad,This place promises you so much but doesn’t hold up to it. They put to much on there employees and still expect you to get your job done so in the end the lack of care for residents is sad because they don’t care. They over work you and pay isn’t good
bad,"nurses not held accountable, Corporate is equally poor and do not return calls to concerned family members who also are very unhappy with the horrible nursing staff. The sales manager will promise all you ask for but once mom or dad are moved in thats where promises no longer are kept and all concerns are directed to those 2 rude, lazy LPN's."
bad,"I worked there for five years."
bad,Horrible place to work the nurses don’t care about residents and they just sit there horrible horrible horrible just horrible I work at lake health now pay be way more and the nurses there are awesome
bad,"The work at Brookdale is simple, but the DON condones gossiping and doesn't stop bad behavior among the employees. I learned I couldn't depend on my management team for anything their to busy gossiping about everyone and sucking up to the residents and their families trying to put on a good show. They don't care how many times you fill in on shifts they still have their favorites and they are constantly taking other peoples words on things that happens instead of just asking they would rather send you a text accusing you instead of finding out the truth. Would I recommend this place -No- Management is too judgmental and they hang out with each other out of work instead having professional relationships (you cant have your cake and eat it too)"
bad,"Worked hours I wasnt payed for , management made verbal threats , pay received wasnt what my offer letter said , don't waste your love and energy here"
bad,"Stressful environment,poor communication between management and employees, constant turnover of management,  short staffed. There is little recognition of employee skills and relationships between the residents and staff."
bad,"Poor work enviroment, not enough staff to take care of residents, poor communication, over worked,residents are not properly cared for because of being under staffed and over worked caregivers"
bad,"High turn over, goals are not realistic, staff who have been therefor a while are on a auto pilot mode, not willing to go the extra mile to get more business."
bad,"While the regional team will tell you ""take care of the residents and the bottom line will take care of itself"" that's not true. They don't take that to heart. The regional team talks out both sides of their mouth, there is poor communication at best and little transparency. Brookdale is knows for using and spitting out ED's at a fairly quick pace, so if you take this job you need to know how to protect yourself from being stabbed in the back and how to get dirty with company politics. It's not about caring for the residents, it's about making money for the shareholders."
bad,"I've worked for this company for a few years. The only reason I am still at this company quite frankly is because I can't find anything else, and I need a job. The management is the worst! They don't help out with anything. Most of them sit in the office and talk all day. Then get mad at the staff when everything isn't perfect. Things aren't done the way they should be unless State is about to come in and do an inspection. Other than that they don't train the staff on how things are supposed to be done, then give us a crash course as soon as they find out they're having an inspection. The pay is horrible! They want you to do a lot for a little. Then if you ask for a raise for some reason they can't find it in their budget. However, I will say we get yearly raises. But those raises aren't really worth the effort of trying to get. You'll get anywhere from 0.03-0.25 as a raise. The food is horrible. They say they serve gourmet style food, but you could find better food at the buffet down the street. Not because of the cooks here, but because the quality of the food they have to order is horrendous. They do have staff appreciation, once in every blue moon, all you get outta that is a bag of candy and a thank you note. They really don't appreciate their staff, at least it doesn't feel like it. And as far as scheduling goes, you don't have set days off. The days you get off vary from week to week. Which to me makes no sense. If you even mention looking for another job your hours get cut. That's not right especially when they pay you next to nothing. One good thing I can say about"
bad,"Typical day is having to go in in the afternoon and start on my duties, I learned to keep my mouth shut and do my part, The management team has their own clicks and certain ones they look up to. For the most part some co- workers are alright,but I find it important to stay to myself and do my job. Not getting the help when it was seen to be needed. enjoyable part was finishing up and going home."
bad,"Lets just say I am a current employee. the only reason im still here is because I haven't found anything better yet. The pay sucks, you sare over worked and under paid. U r doing everyones job. You have to serve meals, set tables, bus tables which they have a server for. Overall don't aste your time unless you are in dire need THUMBS DOWN"
bad,The Emeritus at Austin Bluffs is horrible. The management team is garbage and they treat there workers like dirt. i would not recommend anyone working here. Th management team talks behind resident family members back and are just horrible. They also are very blind to there workers when they have family problems and have to handle certain things they expect you to drop your family and be solely worried about what they need and only what they need.
bad,The job was stressful . I learned how to deal with the elderly and how to serve. My co workers were amazing we all looked out for one another ... The hardest part of the Job when a patient came in an we got so close to them and they only stayed for a few days..
bad,"I dedicated 4 years to this company to wind up with no health benefits and no job when i was 6 months pregnant. The company never does what it says it will and management has been an absolute joke. My most recent executive director was fired for embezzlement and stole all of our christmas bonuses leaving us with nothing but a bad taste in your mouth. It used to be a fun place to work and all the care staff had been there a min of 2 years. Now, the turnaround is crazy and new staff isnt being trained properly. The values that brookdale claims to hold so high are a joke and I am so happy to be out of there. I took the cna class and the company refused to pay my tuition reimbursement and I had to fight to get the $1 raise i was promised. Once I became lead med passer, I never recieved my pay raise for that either. And now that I quit with a 2 weeks notice, I have still yet to recieve my pto. Hell i cant even get my checkstub sent to me. Worst job ever!!!"
bad,Metrics and constantly changing QA expectations are the order of the day. It's very difficult to succeed and even more difficult to move up. The position is supposed to be a great stepping stone but it was nearly impossible to get ahead.
bad,"Can’t move up in this company, it’s who you know. Administration is terrible, prejudice and unfair. Administration are alcoholics also. They need to thoroughly pick administration like they do other staff. Dietary  , Marketing  and manager for Alzheimer’s/Dementia being ran by uneducated personnel. Terrible place to work but could be wonderful. Human Resources busy doing other things besides her job."
bad,"At the time of employment, I made new friends and enjoyed working with them and taking care of the residents. However, the only thing that this company, management and administration cared about was the bottom line (McMinnville, OR location). Many of the residence complained about the mistreatment and unfairness and the RN plaid mind games and wanted to be treated as if she was God regardless of the standing orders of the residents physician and family members. Do to her negligence she almost cost the life of a resident and the company refused to give me my job back even though the State and Senior Services found the facility, administration, the RN and LPN guilty of negligence, breach of standing orders and protocol as well as the miss treatment of residence by such individuals. This location has a very high turnover rate do to the administration and management. After State and Senior Service's investigation the RN, LPN and Head administrator was terminated, but the Corporate office work not allow me to return to my position stating I was a liability. This company is NOT a good company to work for."
bad,"No concern for resident safety, poor upper management oversight and support, more concerned with filling rooms than staffing and resident safety. Low wages for staff, but they consistently raise the rates for residents and say it's for raises for the staff. Raises range from $.20-.25 a year."
bad,They tell you in the beginning that they have strong family values and that there is a good work like balance that couldn't be further from the truth. Pay rates are not competitive. Upper management at building is very poor. Do what I say. If you dont like it here dont let the door hit you on the way out.
bad,"The residents are nice, but the staff ratio and residence are amazingly insane. The upper management already acknowledge this but still they want to push it to the limit to extract every dime possible in the expense of their staff's health, happiness and of course Money!!. They will always tell you that are rooms to improve your career....do you think they will always be hiring if the staffs are happy to stay and work there? "
bad,Management doesn't care about the employees. They are very over worked and extremely under paid. Have no respect for the residents and employees. Not a good company to work for.
bad,Supposed to be assisted living and have people in assisted-living this post to be in skilled the staffing  is bad and under pay overworked Very messy people to work there they always begging for someone to stay over but don’t want you to have days off they can’t understand when you say you’re tired pay needs to be way better for the work that you do
bad,Mgmt does not care about anyone but themselves. Pay is not fair for work load. Would not recommend to work there! Literally the worst job I ever had!!
bad,"They claim they don’t choose favorites.. untrue. You can’t get more than 37 hours per week. Split shifts are frequent unless you are favored.  Some get special treatment. No family life balance. Most have 2 jobs. "
bad,"New management staff due to turn over, unorganized and over work the nurses. No work and home life balance constantly called in days off, does not respect employee personal time."
bad,I worked at the Brookdale on cutten road overnight.  I did an orientation on the 6-2 shift. They wanted me to see the residents while they were a wake and moving around. I helped with breakfast and lunch. Then one of the supervisor told us to start cleaning. Wiping widow sills and mopping and sweeping. I wondered about housekeeping. Not the place for me. I quit.
bad,This place is suppose to be assisted living but have residents living there that needs to be in a nursing home where they can provide their every need. Not enough people working on each shift. Had too much responsibility and only getting paid $9. Residents are sweet but the job isn’t worth it. We went without proper equipment as well.
bad,"This location was ALWAYS understaffed in the kitchen. Upon getting hired I would work from 7 in the morning to 7 at night (12hrs+) on most weekends. There was never enough servers to cover each shift, and many would quit within a few weeks of working at this location. The environment is very fast paced and there is never a moment where there's not something that needs to be taken care of. Kitchen staff, for the most part, was very nice, with occasional bad apples who hated the job. Front Office Management (HR) did not care about servers being constantly overworked and complained if we did a bad job as a result. Residents are awesome, some are picky making the job harder when you are given 25 or more residents to serve in under 30 minutes."
bad,"A new ED was brought in and because of her ego we lost most of the management team. We had improved our BEST survey prior to her coming and she totally disrespected department heads. She was rude and only thought about the bottom line not about what was best for the residents. She drove years of experience out the door. There was a solid nursing team and she could've cared less.  When this was brought to the attention of the regional corporate team,  they turned a blind eye."
bad,"Overall okay place to work, just alot of down time, rarely any teamwork and communication between management and employees. Residents arent getting there daily needs made to satisfy them, no vending machines for snakes or drinks for employees, barely no break room, no activities being done for residents."
bad,"Management is terrible! A lot of high school drama, a terrible turn over rate! Managers only care about themselves, because they can do as they please. Horrible pay and they always messing up checks."
bad,"I worked here about six months. They will overscheduled aides and expect you to stay an extra shift if someone doesnt show up for theirs because they dont have enough aides to call if they need extra. They underhire for the amount of clients they serve and dont pay well. They constantly schedule one aide per like15 to 17 patients and then there are too many lifts to be able to adequately feel like you did provide your best service as a CNA to each resident. You can tell all to management but nothing ever changes. They dont care as long as they have the bare minimum. Dont work here. They are sorely understaffed and are poorly managed. If it wasn't for the love of the residents, I wouldn't have stayed so long."
bad,While paying for school its a job. It does what it need to do for my personal life so I'm settling till I get done with school or find something so much better.
bad,"a typical day was stressful. no one wanted to help each other. everyone wanted to be the boss at one time, and i was not getting the proper pay for the job i was doing"
bad,"The clients are wonderful to work with. However, management schedules the bare minimum to care for the clients, so many times you are forced to work positions outside your role to ensure everyone is receiving acceptable care. As such, it is a stressful environment and employees can be very unfriendly. Extremely busy environment."
bad,"Brookdale was honestly the worst place I have worked. It is extremely unprofessional and there is no room for anyone to move up. It is a kind of environment that you are going to wonder ""Am I going to have a job in the morning?"" "
bad,Everyday at work is an adventure. You never know what's going to happen next but somehow we make it work. The residents are great so I have to provide greatness for them. Management needs a little help. The turn over situation is an issue.
bad,There are 40 residents and only 2 caregivers and 1 med tech. A lot of the residents are not assisted living material. They should be in memory care or a nursing home. It is unfair to the residents because it is almost impossible for all of the residents to get the care they need.
bad,"the pay is $9 because its assisted living "
bad,We could not keep managers while I worked there. The temporary managers would not listen to the long term employees about what was happening instead listened to knew hires. Pretty much was forced out because I had no other choice.
bad,"I never like to talk down about previous jobs, but this is one i cannot help myself from. Everyone there is so two faced, and if I could give the management zero stars i would. Very unprofessional and very rude to the employees and residents."
bad,Need to pay employees more could be better food. Rude coworkers an family's an some management.need more light for works that gets off at night
bad,"This was my first job as a CNA.  I was excited when I came on but suspicious at a non structured interview.  I was hired on for Night Shift which turned out to be myself and another CNA (Not Med-Tech...they give you a test and if you pass they put you in charge of the med cart but you have no clue what you are dispensing/what the medications do).  There was no LPN like there should have been for medical emergencies.  There is no MDS for cleaning supplies and in regards to dietary needs I believe no dietitian on staff, simply a picture of the resident and what meal modifications they need.   If a resident wanted to go to the ER during our shift the morning shift looked at us like we sniffed glue for calling paramedics to come and assist.  Complaints from residents were not taken seriously and some needed to be in a Long Term Care facility."
bad,"A typical day at work includes getting several residents up in the morning, dressed, changed, beds made, help get several people down to the dining room for meals, while answering calls, then we are serving the meals to the residents, taking the residents back to their rooms toileting them again and taking room trays to some of the residents This is all done with only 2 people on the floor. After all that we are taking out garbages for the whole building, answering to calls, doing several showers then getting residents down to activities, and in between getting others ready for the next meal. Some of my co-workers I have had to train in the past have ended up quitting because we are asked to do so much and just don't have the time for it. And or the not the right people for the job in the first place. Our management isn't very fair with scheduling their employees as we are asked to work our entire life around our schedule getting constantly changed, and asked to work extra shifts/hours since we are always short staffed. The hardest part of the job is ensuring the residents are happy, which most the time isnt the case because we are always so busy we dont have that extra time to care, we are constantly rushing to get things done. This job is very stressful, and does not pay employees as much as they should for as much work that we do."
bad,I handed out medications and helped residents with day to day  needs. The management didnt really work with you. They owners dont allow enough workers or hours
bad,"Brookdale Senior Living as a company may be appealing, however when you're on the community level the impression and experience is extremely different."
bad,"i enjoyed my job, i interacted with residents in activities., and part-time cooked for them.the hardest part of the job was lifting and washing All dishes after cooking, and still have time to cook the next meal. but i enjoyed the challenge. i have no comment on management"
bad,"Learned many things at Brookdale, had fun with the residents at holiday parties Not much time away from work as you always had to have the phone on. received calls from the staff  even when not on call"
bad,To much stress not worth your life at this place. So glad to be out of there.
bad,I got this job as part time while also having a full time job they wanted me to work 80 hours on top of my 80 hours at my other job. I was working 16 hour days 4 times a week!!!!! The pay isn’t good and you don’t get raises. The building itself looked like a dirty motel
bad,Not a place to work if you have a family and want a life. Management sucks. HR is rude and very disrespectful. They stay short staff. I worry about the care of the resident's.
bad,Good place for residents to live. Enjoyed interacting and entertaining the residents and employees. Love my job as a HR Manager. At times management does fun activities with the residents.
bad,"They don't pay what a person is worth based on their experience and it is a very stressful work environment. "
bad,"i adored working with the residents that’s the only thing that kept me working there for as long as i did. the compensation was no where near what you should get for the work you do. I was overworked , working long and exhausting shifts basically by myself taking care of 10+ residents who need help eating bathing and changed every few hours."
bad,"Helping with clients, medicine reminders, helping with bathing, dressing, eating, transferring, shopping, companionship. Doing exercises with clients, engaging with each and one of them"
bad,Worst place I’ve ever worked!!!!! Management is VERY unprofessional and gossips with coworkers. The DON is very MESSY!!!!!! I wouldn’t pay my enemy to work there. Medtechs are dangerously running the cart!
bad,Your community is only as good as the management which is poor.  They constantly lie to you and make you feel incompetent.  You don't get accredited  when you go the extra mile for them.
bad,"It used to be an excellent company to work for but as time went on the company became about the ""bottom dollar"". A phase they like to use every chance they have. The company started to worry about money instead of the people they were supposed to be taking care of and their employees and started worrying about how they can recover all the money they lost from making a bad business decision like buying the second largest company in elderly health care. Because of this bad choice the entire company suffers including the elderly and the employees. The community I currently work in could be a decent place to work in if they would have hired the right person for the job. Instead they hired someone that took the least amount of money to get them in the door and this person has zero experience on how to run a memory care unit. We have lost countless costumers due to this persons lack of knowledge. Until we get the right management into our community my building will continue to suffer."
bad,"Brookdale staffing is not up to par the management team uses intimidation to get you to do what they don’t want to do. They continuously put the wagon before the horse. "
bad,RCA's work the hardest with the lowest pay.  I loved the residents/  Management not so much.  Lots of yelling at RCA's belittling them.  Not enough time per resident.  Constantly checked on/no trust.  Management has favorites/stool pigeons.  Run away while you have the chance.  You don't want to work here.
bad,The management team is not professional. More into having parties for residents and dressing up instead of patient care and safety and employee satisfaction. That place will never be great as long as Mark P. Is the director.
bad,"It's a job something better than nothing.  No team work, managers are lazy, maintenance put work that's in their job description off on RA's......The RA's are not appreciated was given a bag of chips during appreciation week by a hospice provide nothing from Brookdale employees not even a thank u"
bad,"Big corporation only worried about their own profit, not the welfare of their residents or employees. Staff is overworked, underpaid, and go through a huge turnaround. Also, the company is absolutely NOT green. They use Styrofoam, go through MASS amounts of corrugated boxes, diapers, plastic gloves, medical supplies and newspaper with ZERO recycling opportunities,"
bad,"Management was terrible, unprofessional environment, extremely low retention rate for staff ; only a few people there have been for over 6 years. High demand for completion of tasks without proper training."
bad,Omg the manager was horrible had job advancements and no credentials. Staff horrible about responding to the elderly. They would let them go on themselves and be in the hallway wet calling for help. The director didnt care. Nor the coordinator.
bad,There is no respect from employee to employee. At times it is more of a nursing home instead of a true assisted living. Not enough employees for the work load.
bad,"I worked for this company and I would not recommend working here. Staff would come constantly late, there are no opportunities for advancement and the fellow employees are very catty. Everyone has a different rate of pay even though you’re doing the same job."
bad,"Chaotic, unorganized, manipulation, games, favorites, non-supportive, awful schedules, unprofessional. Residents enjoyable......staff not so much.. Awful management."
bad,when you start working there they were nice but soon as one of the supervisors or a manger has a problem with you your job is threaten. They need to be more honest and treat their employees better then they do. They also need to be more respectable then they are. the community that I am refering to to is the community that is Emerson now. I wish that they could have solved some of the problems their when I was working there because they had some wonderful residents there I wouldn't change them for the world.
bad,"Stressful, not a lot of help with side duties, management wasn't the greatest at all. Low pay, wanted people to work off clock and didn't always hire the pest people."
bad,"I honestly do not want to be biased but if you have over 7 deaths per year, there seems to be a huge problem with the type of care these patients are receiving."
bad,They are not a patient centric company.  They only care about MEDICARE patients.  I left so I can sleep at night.  I do not agree with the amount of pressure they put on reps for Medicare referrals.  They should be a Medicare only company if that's what they want.
bad,This was by far the worst job i have ever worked. I had fulfillment by helping others but management was terrible and i was treated very poorly as an employee. the balance of life and work was a joke. I worked 16 hour shifts and was beat up by my residents on a regular basis. To give any advice to someone who is considering working here please just Dont. They dont view the people living there as people. They see them as dollar signs. I wont recommend someone to work there or sent their loved ones there either.
bad,"The management is sub par, they are mean, they do not care about their employees or their residents.They pay is WAY to low for the job you do, you always have overtime options because they cannot keep employees."
bad,"I worked for Brookdale for many years and was quite happy until I accepted a management position.  I have never worked with so many incompetent corporate leadership team members in my life.  One hand had no clue what the other was doing.  You could never get a straight answer from the home office and you were left to interpret policies and procedures without help from the corporate office.  Staffing the building was horrible as no one wanted to work and be responsible for caring for 30 residents.  They tout that they are a senior solutions company but they have no clue what they are doing with seniors residing in a Skilled Nursing Facility.  The hardest part of my job was the guilt I dealt with knowing the residents weren't being cared for as they deserved.  I dealt with rude, unappreciative staff on a daily basis who had no business working in healthcare and being able to terminate them was a total joke so the care was subpar.  The most enjoyable part of my job was the management team we had withing the building, we always had each other's backs and worked as a team...funny that all of those team members have left as well.  I learned very quick how to manage the building with what I call ""Crisis Management"" which is not my style at all.  I had to save my sanity and get off a sinking ship."
bad,"Unrealistic expectations, conference calls, and endless emails are the majority of each day.  Brookdale made all sales managers hourly, expect 50-60 hours of work but will not pay overtime (affects their ""bottom line"") and expect you to do it all in 37.50 hours each week.  Completely disregard the safety of sales people by expecting completion of home visits, actually visiting the homes of prospective residents.  They prefer you visit in pairs however, they expect so much of management, the majority of sales people must complete the visits alone.  Upper management micromanages, offers assistance and then never follows through.  The most important thing to Brookdale is the money in their pockets; the pressure they place on their sales people is monumental.  Anyone below a district (regional) position is simply a pawn in their game.  The hardest part of the job is selling a product you don't believe in, most enjoyable part is definitely the residents.  All you need to do is look at all of the open sales positions and you will see there is most definitely a problem with Brookdale Senior Living."
bad,"bad company, do not work there. very poor management.no place for advancement, non competitive wages. ,"
bad,I feel that the care staff is amazing and pays detailed attention to the residents and their needs. I believe that the management is the part of the company that has forgotten what they got into the business to do. Definitely the most rewarding job that I have held and the most passionate that I am about helping the senior community.
bad,I assisted residents with all ADLs. I did charting as well as reporting to nurses and other RCA's that I worked with. I learned to have tougher skin for the more difficult residents and how to just jump right in and assist at the most confusing times. I enjoyed some management but they are not the best. There was barely any support when things were mixed up in some of our more confusing situations. I loved my co-workers because we had to stick together to get the job done. We supported each other as much as possible. The hardest part of the job is the not so pleasant residents that were unhappy for many different reasons. The most enjoyable part was meeting new people and hearing some of their amazing life stories.
bad,"I understand that every facility has their issues but the one I work for is ridiculous. Everyday there's another major issue and the higher ups don't want to help you out, until their job is on the line and corporate is called in. The training is horrible you don't learn anything until they throw you on the floor by yourself and that's not even a week after your training. Employee turnovers are crazy and people are constantly calling out. So much workload most shifts for the CNA's and Nurses with no other help. Also, barely ever got a break."
bad,"I worked at Homewood Village for a while. The management is very poor. They treat everyone in lower paying positions poorly.  The head nurse is lazy, mean and extremely rude. The ED doesn’t talk to anyone but the ""chosen managers"". They like to take advantage of staff and there is no team work. The management doesn't care about anything. Every resident is just a $. "
bad,"a typical work day: being tattled on, hearing residents complain of rude uncaring co-workers, short breaks, being asked almost daily to cover shifts because management has taken us down to barebones staff and wont hire any new employees."
bad,"I didn't care for this job as much I felt I could have. The management was poor and most the employees were unprofessional. People would get fired for no ""real"" reason other than a member of management or a managers friend didn't like that person. There was a lot of family's that worked there. So a daughter would be working under a mother or a cousin, that kinda thing. I also noticed that there was tension between different shift. Everyone was always reporting one another rather than working as a team. Working as a team rarely happened. I would not return. "
bad,"I was a driver working about 6 days a week ,but yet could barly break 500 for two weeks of pay the manager was great until she brought back an old employe ( if its not broken don't fix it)  from the first day she was a cancer treating the people who live there like dirt and upper management seem to be oblivious.  the residents were the only real reason to work there but knowing one day you may  come in they may have passed on starts to bother you. This place is going down fast the focus is only in getting new residents and putting up a good outer image with no substance"
bad,Lack of leadership
bad,"Horrible place to work."
bad,I would be asked to take 2 residents with Dementia upstairs when new people were coming to get a tour. It was not nice. Very frustrating. Also very 2 faced and lazy employees. Too many people playing the boss role.
bad,"I worked for this place for 2 years. It's supposed to be an Assistant Living community but you clearly are working like your in an skilled facility. They take anybody in the building just so the place is full. You dont know what your gonna walk into dealing with that mess of a job. The higher up staff is a joke and dont give to nickles about the residents, nor do they appreciate the staff. Less not add that your working for pennies. Dont send anybody you love to that war zone... Thank me later🤷‍♀️"
bad,"Normally I never disparage a company but in this case, the San Antonio Branch of Brookdale is a basket full of lunatics."
bad,When I first started working there it was good and I loved it but than the true colors came through if your in the kitchen don't expect to any weekends off or holidays if your new and they don't take requests off for holidays in the kitchen as well. The co worker are awesome and management is as well if your in their favorites list. Constantly under staffed and over worked don't expect overtime and when you do have to work over time your will get n ear full about it.
bad,Staff was not helpful to other staff. One coworker made my life horrible everyday. Other staff was accused of witnessed abuse of a resident and was allowed to work on the floor and continued verbally abusing the residents. 3rds left people soiled and excoriated. Food was horrible and activities were insufficient. Housekeeping was minimal only running with one house keeper most of the time for 8 hours and 2 maitnance men running around swinging their arms together to make it look like the my were working.
bad,"The management didn't have our best interests in mind. Everyday seemed to get a little more tasking, and it was never enough. The only ""enjoyable"" part of it all was the relationships you'd build with your coworkers because they're experiencing the same thing, just someone to relate to I suppose. I would recommend going somewhere else for employment, but if you had no other options I would take it."
bad,lack of leadership little respect to people who truly help or do what they can to help but with little time they have nor raise. but nothing going to change
bad,i came to work at this place as a qmap but then they placed me under r.a which lowered my hours and my pay and didn't just keep me on one set schedule
bad,"My direct supervisior was good but my district and regional directors do not care about residents, their families or associates. They say they do but when it comes to supporting a community, their actions are based on money only not retaining associates by educating and spending time on them."
bad,"I see this as a starter job, not meant to be permanent. The residents suffers due to the low moral. The pay is trash. Employees are over worked and under staffed."
bad,"If you like being overworked, stressed out, constantly having staff call in or not have enough staff to client ratio, then this is the job for you. Depending on locations can involve some major lifting and care that is beyond the staffs abilities. No license required. Very limited opportunities to advance. Management doesn’t care about the clients, just how much the client is paying. Management doesn’t care that it is assisted living, they will bring on a total care client if it means a lot of up charges for care. Yet there will be no additional staff to help accommodate these clients that are not within assisted living guidelines. Depending on the location, residents may describe the community as nursing home like."
bad,"Only pay minimum wage. Shifts are either 6 hours or 3 hours for servers, and they are extremely against overtime, making it difficult to get a full 40 hrs/week. Always shortstaffed, never a regular schedule, it's different hours/shifts every week. Despite a promise of having a free weekend every now and then, I've worked every full weekend since hired. Management doesnt leave office but wont hesitate to tell you to 'get your butts in gear' despite being understaffed."
bad,"The residents are great!"
bad,"Regional managers don’t know what really goes on with their properties.  No consideration for how people feel, very blind one sided opinions. They also don’t care if you have enough staff to take care of the residents."
bad,"It's an ok job for kids entering the workforce and living with their parents, but cannot sustain even a single income adult living the bare minimum in Austin, Texas."
bad,All Brookdale cares about is money. They say it is personalized care but it really isn’t. They keep managers tied up in conference calls when it could have been a email then get upset because you are late on all the reports that are due weekly.  They don’t pay staff enough then don’t understand why they can’t keep anyone.
bad,people call in constantly or just don't show up so there's extra hours to pickup. theres a group that have worked there for a long time and are very clicky. if youre good at what you do and agree with them you'll do just fine.
bad,Don't waste your time with these guys if your a worker that goes beyond your job you will get no appreciation nore a thank you lazy staff get caterd to and staff has attitude problems but don't catch one back or you will get fired the staff they have can get away with everything if your in the management/staff click  low pay and the AM cook will try to test you off the rip thinks they own the place because being there many years and the part time PM cook is lazy and don't do there job requirement and comes in high and never got writen up or fired and been there a year now getting away with it but if you are a lazy worker you will love it they will praise you..
bad,"Management could not get malicious gossip under control leading to questionable terminations and misdirected ""corrective action"" plans. There was a definite ""clique"" culture and ""it's my way or the highway."" "
bad,"Administered medications in accordance to all company, state and federal regulations. Dispensed at appropriate times to proper person.  Assist residents with daily living task i.e. showering, dressing, cleaning and organizing. Cleaning  and sanitizing all common areas, bathrooms and resident apartments. Record keeping, computer documentation, and operating system use.  Answered and used multi-phone system, with routing, and paging. General use of Microsoft Word, Excel, Outlook and other   e-mail communications."
bad,"This company treats their employees terribly. They force people to work unscheduled overtime, sometimes up to 20hours straight. They will have zero empathy if you are sick and will insist you work your shift even if you have fever/vomiting. They also have near constant management overturn which makes the work environment VERY chaotic, but will still blame any mistakes on staff no matter how poor the management is. Communication between management and staff is dreadful and management will frequently change policy and expect staff to adhere despite not clearly communicating it to staff."
bad,"No comment about this company.  Read everyone else’s. Mine will be worse... there’s nothing else to say except that the x ED was a thief, only one diversity    And no remorse"
bad,"Working here a little while now and the food is great as is the staff. The scheduling is a disaster so management brought in someone untrained and had minimal attempts to train then they would fall asleep in training. Med records is somehow involved and consulted on major decisions? Constantly saying nurses are horrible and I'm going to go where they deserve me while being the laziest employee. Watched a floor nurse get promoted to adon then a ton of agency don's come and go, The last one ended up hired and worthless. Heard corporate people including one with black short hair that was there when state was literally raise her voice and freak out on the adon. Night shift is difficult to give report to while downing the patients and company in general also the rest of the staff but contributing little themselves. Everything reported to HR by fellow employees completely ignored and no trust built. Management is very young and seems very green as well, Hardly seen. Overload on floor staff and constant barating of floor staff. No towels available to shower patients. Such potential just killed at the green mountain location."
bad,The elderly there are great and always happy but the management there was not great no one ever thought about your scheduling hours they just put you when they felt like it the work was back breaking
bad,"The residents at Brookdale are outstanding. They provide you with a job that is unique, and no two days look the same. During my time at Brookdale I learned to love my residents as if they were my family. I would say that the residents are the most enjoyable part of the job. However, this did not outweigh the chaos that rained down behind the scenes. The management and job culture were almost unbearable."
bad,"brookdale owns several properties in several states, trying to complain to corporate offices falls on deaf ears as long as owners make a profit. I would not let me parents or friends live/die there."
bad,"Very poor management. Overworked, underpaid and don’t be surprised if your hours get cut or your shifts are given away without your knowledge. Perks & bonuses are only given to some employees, not all! Absolutely loved the residents and loved caring for them."
bad,The over night shift was fairly easy and laid back. Rounds every two hours and the rest of the time was down time or doing laundry. We would clean the kitchen and bathroom area and the rest of the time between rounds I would read a book
bad,"Nurse on Call is a fantastic HH agency, but after their merger with Brookdale, the bad habits and traits were forced on Nurse on Call and Quality of Care went through the door."
bad,"Residents and staff are fantastic, management and upper management is lacking. Mixed messages, poor culture of taking care of staff and treating them with respect. Leadership is sorely lacking despite feedback. Tenure is not valued, Great community, sad culture for staff. Weak leadership all around."
bad,"Indeed requires a posting when should not be a required as those that leave will not have something good to say. If I was happy I would still be there, and high turnover should be enough said."
bad,The company needs to try and meet the state guidelines for staff to patient ratios. Staff was overworked and not paid enough. If the company focuses on employee retention it will result in better care provided to their residents.
bad,Not a good place to work ! The management isn’t great . Unfair ! The pay isn’t great . It’s a lot of work for such little pay . Negative environment. Managers talk down on you .
bad,I’m still working here but seriously contemplating leaving. During my review last week I was told that I was a good employee but wasn’t offered a raise because I wasn’t part time. I’ve worked in the same field before for a different company as a PRN employee and gotten raises several times. I understand each company is different but I feel Brookdale is just using it as an excuse not to pay me more. Running from one resident’s room to the next and trying to keep a positive energetic attitude while doing all that the job calls for just doesn’t seem worth it for 9.00/hr. My direct management is pretty ok they do lag on doing schedules which makes it difficult to plan. I get notifications for shift one to two days prior (if that) and it makes it hard to plan. The only reason I truly took this job was because I want to work with elders when I finish my graduate degree and felt the experience would compliment my resume but with the poor pay and poor work life balance provided with this company I probably won’t last much longer.
bad,Does not like to take patients with special needs or any sort of psych needs. Many service failures. Lack of support and direction from management. No follow through.
bad,"The team I worked with in the dementia and Alzheimer's unit were not the friendliest and provoked the residents more rather than helping them. They were difficult to work with, ""they"" being my co-workers did not want to help and also incited arguments between employees as well as instigated the arguments."
bad,"The ED was rude and unprofessional. Worried more about her appearance and how ""rich"" she could look to others than she was running a business. It was a sad environment the way she bullied her other management. The ED when I first started there was amazing and of course after a couple years advanced to a higher position."
bad,It's a horrible place to work. They underpay you for the work you do. They are so understaffed because of the high turn over rate.  They treat their employees like they are nothing.
bad,Very busy front desk. What I enjoyed most about the job is being able to help the residents in every and any way possible. However the phones never stop ringing!
bad,i love working at brookdale because of the residents they all hold a special place in my heart just to know im one of the ones making a difference in their life
bad,"Working with the residents are great you have to be very caring because they need it , management is horrible and so are the co workers no one works as a team and no one tries to do stuff together and only focus on thereselfs and some people are only there for a paycheck and that's not the job to be there for just a pay check"
bad,It was fun seeing the seniors everyday. I have new respect for waitstaff now. Management was discriminatory. Coworkers same.
bad,"the only problem working there are the coworkers and our boss making excuses based on age and personality to justify their poor work ethics and behavior. a typical day there on a good day would start with reading the health alerts notes from the previous shifts then noting which residents have showers and laundry in your section, taking the orders for any room trays placing the orders to the kitchen going to any residents that request you at a certain time as well as the ones calling/paging you, assist with restroom/diaper changes, showers,escorting down to meals, putting them to bed and more."
bad,Executive Director was a snake and she was a horrible leader. Sometimes all it takes to bring down a good team is one BAD APPLE!! For the amount of work that was expected vs pay.....Not worth it!!! And not to mention the care staff was so under paid....it was ridiculous....people flipping burgers make more!!! Absolutely NO WORK LIFE BALANCE!!!
bad,"This job is great for people who have never had any work experience but if you expect to move up or have benefits from this company, think ago. The pay doesn't match the work at all, but it's good for first timers."
bad,if you care about working hard and helping people this is a great job. it's not crazy pay but for a working college student like i was it worked. it's been many years now and they have new management so maybe its gotten better
bad,"A job is a job to some of the employees. They leave some elders in wet depends over night, they dont watch their mouths at all, theyre very rude. The elders are loved by many nurses, theres just a select few that shouldnt work there. Managment sucks."
bad,"New building so not too organized in management. Lacks team work and communication but when you'r there to genuinely fulfill  the needs of the residents, you can gain a great deal of love for them and there stories...which makes it that much easier to do your job."
bad,I love my residents and their families.  Management never does anything but criticize and ridicule.  Can never find anything good in what you do no matter how hard to work.  Salaried employees are royally screwed. Management shows favoritism and it is obvious!  Such a shame.  Good employees quit after sheer frustration and no support!
bad,The company does not provide sufficient training. They do not compensate their employees well and under pay them substantially. There is a high turnover and little support from upper management.
bad,Never had what was needed for the menu for the week. The menu was not meant for the senior population. They cooked everything in maragine and bacon grease
bad,Love my nursing team. The nursing team is more than willing to pitch in to help one another.
bad,"Terrible place to work, they don't care about the people that work there , and the pay is a joke for all they expect, and they have nursing home residents there in an assistant living facility."
bad,Too many micromanagers who've been promoted to their level of incompetence!
bad,"did work orders all day,,i learned that the more you do,the more managment wants you to do,coworkers not happy,hardest part,was getting more help for a tremendous work load..working with the elderly.."
bad,I wish I didn't have to leave but being stress from the people you work with and not the actual work is not healthy.
bad,At the time I was employed with this company it was a revolving door with employee's. One of  the Direct managers which I believe is no longer there was rude to employee's. They expected to much from little staff. When you couldn't complete a task because of to much being asked of single person doing the tasks they would come down on you. When I left the company there was improvement from some of the management staff but not the ones that were directly over me. When I hurt my back assisting a resident I felt like as if they looked down on me in a very negative way.
bad,"I’ll be brutally honest, once census tanks or they have another Medicare audit and patients start getting discharged en masse, you’ll be the first to go.  Not only will you be the first to go, but they’ll make up some type of story and claim you were termed for “misconduct”.   They will make something up and it usually is off the wall or a flat out lie   The Phoenix office is very much in disarray with many executive directors and interim directors   But please trust me when I tell you that you’ll be the first to go as soon as census is low   They won’t care either    Brookdale cares about one thing, making money   Not the place of you want a stable career"
bad,"Less pay, staff sucks... The nurse at the time was very rude and the company wasn't the best place to work.. I really enjoyed my residents thou.. that was the best part of my job ❤️"
bad,"They ask too much for caregivers do than regular job requirements, caregivers help in dining, do housekeeping as well as doing maintenance and not only caring for residents we do more and have little pay!"
bad,"Their programs were exciting and kept me busy with the residents but they were always pushing for more or different, and it was never enough. I wasn't recognized for the level of quality of work I put into my job while there for 3 years, nor was I comparably paid for it. I asked for a raise 3 times the last year, and they ignored my request. I was sexually harassed by a resident and they did nothing about it.  Very money huh very driven corporation."
bad,"The company needs to check the people they put for management, management are one sided people and dont appreciate the hard working staff, they fire people qho are working hard just because they dont like them."
bad,"The people currently working don’t want to train unless your Med tech the pay is horrible "
bad,"Typical assisted living facility, management bad, long hours, low pay. The only thing that makes it worth while are the residents. There are few to no true assisted living facility, there is only fill that room."
bad,I just saw the job I was hired for. They strung me along for over 6months for PRN Social Worker position only to say now my availability doesn’t work even though it was disclosed at the beginning.
bad,Anywhere you have a ton of women working there is the backstabbing and gossiping mess which management never nibs in the butt and are a part of it....
bad,I loved working with the residents at this location. I unfortunately had a bad experience with employees here. And management that only looked out for themselves.
bad,"I was shocked at how the kitchen was run. People in charge were giving conflicting information and not following safety methods to ensure food was organized, well maintained and properly stored or prepared! It was a nightmare and managers were walking around with blinders."
bad,"This was my least favorite position of all time. Building relationships with physicians, case managers, referral coordinators as well as patients and families are my strengths. The pressure with the position is to focus on Medicare referrals as opposed to managed care Medicare referrals. Any referral other than straight Medicare have no value to Brookdale. I would not recommend thiBrookdale Home Health."
bad,"Brookdale is a large corporation, and that aspect bleeds into and corrupts all facets of working there. The corporate level of management make top-down decisions with no consideration towards the circumstances of individual facilities; effects are benign at best and outright detrimental at worst. Payment is substandard for all but heads of department, and under-staffing is the rule. Low level workers are treated as entirely disposable, and turnover rate is horrendous as a result. Because the bottom line is priority, as many corners as possible are cut at every opportunity and both the staff and residents suffer from it. Equipment in need of repair or replacement is left unaddressed for excessive periods of time. Communication is poor or nonexistant between management, and interdepartmental cohesion simply does not occur. This is not bad for a starting job or for something in-between better prospects, but nothing else. Long term employment does not make acceptable returns for the time and work invested. Raises are capped at 2% and there is no overnight adjustment. Benefits are mildly mediocre, but not terrible. There is a bonus given at Christmas time each year, but it is generated from donations to a fund made by residents- the actual company will pay you nothing. Holidays are acknowledged, but due to the perpetual state of under-staffing, expect to work them often. I have worked on all shifts, and you should expect every issue mentioned above to be amplified on the overnight shift."
bad,I was working in Brookdale as a cook I was a cook there for a year they fired a manager that was a good manager they lost a manager due to lack of food then the head of the Sea of the building became the kitchen manager she cut my hours I was working three days after that I ain't working 2 days they say the food didn't have enough seasoning to 8 okay if you don't put seasoning in the food then what could too much season then what they complain so I put in my two weeks notice they say I didn't put it in but I did
bad,Everything is very secretive and the work ethic and what was going behind the scenes I could not be a part of. It went against everything I believe in.
bad,Terrible management and too many cliques. Office politics are consistent. Too many meetings. Do not recommend. High then over and corporate doesn’t care.
bad,People definitely get special treatment and the higher ups are bullies care givers broke the rules all the time but never got in trouble and the bosses were abusive with their power
bad,"Enjoyed working with the patients and staff are great. Management such as DON and ADON talks about employee down the hallway and other employees can here the gossip, and the gossip gets back to the nurses they talk about.  Found it to be unprofessional. Found DON and ADON talks down at a nurse in front of others instead pulling the nurse in the office and discussed the issues out 1:1. DON and ADON are very unprofessional that's why there's a big turn over rate with cna's and nurses. DON does not have a open door policy and that's why I resigned, DON was always on a defensive mood when I had a few problem to addressed and I realized it was time for me to resigned. I encouraged a few employees to report the issues with HR and there are afraid of retaliation just the same way when I worked as a employee for Patriot Heights snf. Yes, I'm the nurses voice that are afraid of retaliation. Let positive energy, peace, happiness and good work ethics flow in the work environment at all times therefore staff can stay."
bad,"This job is great and rewarding, but if you’re not willing to work multiple 16 hour shifts a week, management doesn’t care for you much. I loved my residents, they were all sweet and helpful when first starting out. Coworkers that put in little to no work often complain and get attitudes, hiring on takes a bit of time, and meals often feel rushed. Time off rarely happens, but when it does, you sleep the entire time. Scheduling is terrible. Manager doesn’t understand how to move people around so that there is always two people in a section per day. Constantly understaffed. But that means more overtime pay."
bad,I just want to put out there for all people thinking wow a $1500 sign on bonus!!! ITS A LIE. . . Make sure you get it in writing and keep your copy because this company screws everyone out of promised bonuses!! I loved my job there until we got a new admin that was not qualified for the job and did not know what she was doing she said and did whatever made her sound good so she wouldn’t get fired herself but when it came down to it she didn’t care about her team at all. The residents are wonderful and a lot of the ra and medtechs but all the higher ups that are salary paid are like ghosts and leave the floor to fend for itself but as soon as state walks in they put on a real good act to cover it all up it’s really sad actually they leave the floor short staffed constantly which makes for neglect to the residents and they won’t work the floor to help! The company lies about encouraging growth and advancement when you try to they just threaten to fire you for wanting to go to school for CNA or LPN! They allow there staff to neglect residents in memory care and talk to there families way out of scope of practice! I won’t be surprised if hillside in mcminnville gets sued by the residents and the staff because of how screwed up it is there all the hire ups are only worried about themselves and make there assistants and the medtechs do everything while they go shopping on company time or sit in meetings all day long every single day or leave early all the time! You don’t want to work here unless management is all fired and hired new and trained by corporate!!
bad,the ed was always outside smoking with the head nurse. they was always in other departments budget. when confronted of neglect and abuse they get rid you.
bad,The home health manager at the oklahoma city office from 2016-2017 was very unprofessional.  There was a lot of patient dumping.  The patient load and admissions were so overwhelming including the oncall that there was it took away from personal time with family.
bad,"Too many whiners, to many cut corners, proper care not given most of the time, terrible pay for the work done. Low staffed almost everyday. Thankful for the chance but didn't feel it was worth it."
bad,Job place needs improvement in all aspects. Salary for the tasks/responsibility isn’t equivalent. Under staffed which makes its harder for current employees.
bad,"It depends on the facility you work at it. Unfortunately for my experience it is run by poor management. They hire just about anyone including friends, relatives or spouses. Under certain circumstances would I classify the place as Un professional and Un sanitary. The residents pay way more to reside their and get less for their money along with poor dining service. Corporate needs to be on top of things instead of just seeing a number"
bad,the residents there were awesome. i had a great time working with the residents there. management could be worked on a little bit but all in all i really enjoyed the residents and that's what helped me get through my day there.
bad,Jobs are not extremely hard. Management is okay but they mainly look out for themselves. Most of the employees are friendly and the residents are sweet.
bad,"While I did enjoy my job & always went the extra mile to take care of the residents, not all other shifts took the time to care as much. With no real management on 3rd, it was difficult to communicate with anyone & felt very underappreciated. They had no where near enough staff sufficient to run 3rd shift & didn't seem to care very much. I would assume 1st & 2nd would be a far better choice when working there."
bad,"I took this job because I wanted a no-brainer phone job that I could leave behind every day when I punched out.  Instead, management created an inhuman environment that stressed me out.  They threatened termination almost as a casual joke, especially during all hands meetings. I have genuine loving kindness for the elderly.  But conversations w ppl going through the worst times of their lives were Quality Controlled to max.  It always felt like at any moment someone would you during a call and extract you from the center.  MUCH turnover of staff...people would disappear one day and not be mentioned until someone asked weeks later ""whatever happened to....."" At which point, a supervisor would get very quiet and carefully quote the company mission. "
bad,You can't trust the Administrator. Plays favoritism. HR tells everyone's business regardless of their position. Tries to pretend she's on your team but will use what you tell her against you to get the results she wants.
bad,"Every office is different, it is luck of the draw, but in my personal experience you are used up and spit out. It is an ok place if you just need a job, but don't make this place your career."
bad,My RCC was terrible. She didn't visit the residents to update their care plan and she was intimidated by others that had drive. She worked off the clock for her boss and that's unacceptable. These two individuals are gone now so hopefully things are better now. More resident focused...
bad,"The managers did not care about their employees, and the job was not worth the pay. They accept clients that were way above the amount of care that is defined by an ""assisted living"" facility. They need more employees to complete tasks as well as they were never happy with the job done."
bad,"Management suck love my job,and the residents and that's a lot of the reason I stayed so long the management is not good at all all the way to the top"
bad,Can you transfer to another brookdale if the one  you work at suspends you for something you didn't do but a resident says you did it. I've been suspended and I feel they are gonna go with the residents word.
bad,"most enjoyable part of the job is definitely the floor staff/coworkers"
bad,Not a good company to work for.  Hours are long.  Well past the traditional 40 hr work week.  Management is unorganized.  The structure of the company is constantly changing due to high turnover at corporate and branch level.
bad,Need to do better at training employees. Need to get their stuff together. They didn't explain what all my job duties would be.
bad,They don't pay the staff much but require large amounts of work with no praise or positive reinforcement. I would not recommend that any person ever work for this company.
bad,"Residents who require nursing home care are constantly being accepted into facility requiring more demands than we are able to provide in the correct manner.No room for advancement, little pay, no overtime, and forced to take 2 hour lunch breaks."
bad,"Transport seniors to and from doctor appointments. Transported all wheel chairs, maintain vehicles, proper paper work. Keep vehicles clean, fueled and maintained at all times. Schedule all appointments with seniors, confirm appointments."
bad,"brookdale expects tou to serve them at a moments notice and does not care about how it effects your personal life ,,,.the managers dump responsibility on you with out thinking about what is happing around them and they dont care about the end objective.they just want it off there back, so they can enjoy there life... some of the workers are realy great and very nice to work with  ,, but not all of them there is a few that just want to make your life miserable  to save them from dealing with the job as a whole,,,they put you down   to get away out dealing with the problems that arise and hope they can be management  some day so they can set a secondary set of standards for themselves,, .slow driving the people that care out , too work at other company's,,,and destroy your desire to be proactive"
bad,"Interaction with the residents was a wonderful experience! I miss them. However the job experience was somewhat tainted by terrible micromanaging supervisors.  The company misrepresented itself posting the ""Bus Driving"" job.  It was a fact that, as a bus driver, I was ""inside"" more than outside and despite the fact that I thoroughly enjoyed the residents, I wound up performing other duties not related to bus driving and was micromanaged while inside, which resulted in a stressful environment."
bad,was not happy or with the management it was not the job for me had a hard time moving stuff in the rooms with no help
bad,I enjoy working with the residents and talking with them. I have learned a lot from the seniors there. Co-workers do work hard and are team players and helpful. The hardest part of the job is the dining. They need dining staff to focus on that job totally. Management can be re-trained or take leadership classes.
bad,"They are quick to cut hours and the pay is terrible for the work you do. This company does not value its long time employees, and does not mind over working and under staffing its departments."
bad,"Too many residents, not enough staff. When staffing is low and all beds are filled, they just double up on rooms and do not increase staffing. Administration bold face lies to staff, regional directors and families. Administration will pretend to help as long as regional directors or families are watching. Resident falls, med errors, abuse all get covered up and hidden to avoid state review. Incompetent, lazy, foul-mouthed, disrespectful staff have no trouble finding jobs here. Employee turnover rate high - for good reason. Horrible. Values of this company sound awesome - local facility has no clue what any of it means nor do they have any interest in figuring it out. "
bad,I worked almost 2 years for this company. One plus as a caregiver and six months as an activity assistant. I was promised a pay raise when I took the new position. When I quit last week I still hadnt received it. The ED quit a few weeks ago and everyone is blaming it on him. Shifts were most always short. Sometimes with only two caregivers. I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone looking for a caregivers positioning
bad,"would gladly go back to working for them, if head management were to chan."
bad,"Most work days you are busy. Always short staffed, no enough equipment to work with, no and I mean no overtime available. Ok management only think of themselves. Coworkers are okay as well, they get the jib done most of the time, 80% of the time. Good place to start off if you are new to the feild. Good pto if you are full time."
bad,"I did not mind it at first. I got to like our residences. Unfortunately, as time went by, the more I felt those above me were acting unprofessionally. I did not hate it, but it was not my favorite."
bad,OVERWORKED AND UNDER PAID . The management acts like they care just to impress families to get more residents to come live there so they benefit. cna are treated the worst by every other staff and are treated as maid/ slaves and are reminded everyday that they can be replaced. work environment is not diverse and the immigrants are treated poorly owner loves money and management team does alot of bad stuff and cover it up. I'm s happy the day i quit
bad,"Great residents, and residents family. Enjoyed the majority of people whom I worked with, but when it comes to management having your back..they dont. The work environment is stressful, and the management is very unprofessional. The requirements put upon the staff in such a little time is ridiculous, and overwhelming as well. They talk really good game to get you into the job, but dont have any serious family issues and have to miss or be late, if you arent one of managements favorites you will get punished."
bad,Short on supplies. Short staffed. Med aides that are on a god complex and afraid to get their nails dirty. Co workers that would state not my resident not my problem. Lots of miscommunication. Couldn’t step off the floor for a 15min break. Yet others got away with standing around and gossiping for the the first half of the shift. Lack of organization. Micromanaging at its finest. Residents and their families made the job worth it.
bad,"If they like you, you're promoted, you get pay increases, bonuses, recognition and unlimited overtime. If they don't, you and your work and contribution to the community is ignored.  The residents are the only reason for working there."
bad,Totally unsatisfied .people were just placed just to fill in not necessarily because they were qualified. They were all about the money . No concern for staff or residents.
bad,"Employees aren’t treated fairly and management is rude and threatens employment. Residents are looked at as a revenue access and will be kicked out if payments aren’t paid. Not sure how other Brookdale’s are run I only worked Brookdale  Wickcliff, OHIO"
bad,"Wasn't a great atmosphere. Had different kinds of residents in the living assistant department, some were not dependant and others not needing a lot of help."
bad,Stared off as a great job with great management. Ended up with bad employees being promoted and good employees being let go . Scary that inexperienced nurses move up the management chain quickly due to friendship. Disappointing and very unprofessional place to work .
bad,"They severely underpay you here for all of the hard work you do, and there is very little opportunity for raise. When I switched between locations, they paid me a dollar less than what I had worked myself up to earn at the previous location. Not to mention they hire people that will always be late, always call in, and do nothing about it so you have zero work life balance. I would not work here. I am now stuck for the experience."
bad,"I loved working with the residents and will miss them. I loved doing the job that I did, Lead Cook.  I loved working with the crew that I had and will be a reference for them any time. "
bad,I left this job after whistle blowing things that were unethical. My manager had posted my job after my report to corporate  so I resigned before she could fire me.
bad,Great Job experience. Love residents on dementia unit. U have to love your job to the point where it doesn't feel like a job anymore. Exciting & New Activities to try with the residents always brings joy to them.
bad,"Do not recommend, especially if you wanna keep working as a caregiver. They pretty much treated me as an outcast while I was there and nitpick everything I did. They’ll try to make you feel inadequate and that you’re not doing enough when in reality you’re doing all that you can. No wants to help you with your residents that are bigger and need to be transferred. I could go on but this is enough."
bad,"Poor management led to poor working environment. Unhappy residents and employees. Loved the people I worked with and the residents but the upper management was a joke. They never backed us ""inferior"" employee's and some of the managers made it a priority trying to get people fired instead of doing thier job. Residents and thier families were upset with the lack of care that they were paying for. ."
bad,Itt was a pleasure to work overthere cause he dont pay well qo om leaving thats set i have other job its done see u next year or in 20 years maybe or more
bad,"Yes, you get benefits  I just do not get any of them due to my own reasons. It takes forever it seems to get 8 hours of paid time off. The way the add up your paid time off is weird and confusing. You will be short-staffed that is a given. You do not get mandated so that is a huge plus, but you end up feeling guilty and staying late. Bonuses for picking up shifts will vary and you have to chase down management to make sure you get them. Co-workers are awesome although some are very lazy and lack basic common sense and should never work in the field. Managers can be lazy as well. Do not expect much and you will do great.  Weekly pay is awesome! Not many places pay weekly anymore. The work itself is easy, but it can be tiring. Just check it out and give yourself time to adjust to the hectic life of working in healthcare."
bad,This company makes you wear several hats so they don't have to hire more people. Work load is far too much. Underemployed and overworked. Upper management is lazy and expects other management to do their work.
bad,"I have never been so disappointed in an employer. The wages aren’t even close to being enough considering the work they expect of you. The lazy, do nothing employees are always the ones being praised, while the hard working employees never seem to be doing well enough. Management has accused me of stealing several times with absolutely no reasoning behind that accusation. Half of what they accused me of stealing were things I didn’t even know we had! And instead of them coming to me about it, they went behind my back and told all of my coworkers that they weren’t allowed to leave me anywhere by myself. Pathetic. The last incident that occurred when I finally stood up for myself, was this. It was two hours after my shift ended and I went to leave because my ride had arrived and management stopped me and yet again accused me of stealing even though I had nothing with me. I was physically blocked/restrained from leaving the building all because I got accused of stealing silverware that I didn’t have. It wasn’t even real silverware anyways. I said repeatedly I didn’t have it and I needed to leave because my mother was there to pick me up and she would not let me out of the break room. After ten minutes of her refusing to unblock the doorway for no reason whatsoever, I actually had to push my way through her. Every person from management that I have dealt with besides the man who hired me (who retired shortly after) has been manipulative, abusive, rude, and has treated their employees like absolute garbage... just like their wages."
bad,"Not good enough raises poor management everyone for themselves "
bad,Horrible working environment. The management in the Orlando branch are so catty and back stabbing. You can feel it when you walk into the office. That is why so many people have left.
bad,"I worked at an independent living facility for a while, and the other servers would do nothing except talk bad about you behind your back or even to your face, multiple disagreements with the Manager and there is no advancement opportunities available."
bad,"Job was good, benefits ok, pay good, just no way to balance work and home life ,long hours, not enough help , upper management did not or would not listen to staff, need to screen more closely candidates when hiring upper managers, residents suffer when management wont listen, would not reccomend this place to live or were or at"
bad,"Stressful, no care for residents well being, all about the money and moving people in. District Management doesn't care how hard you work, if you don't meet their expectations you're out. They aren't at the property level and have no idea what goes on at the property, just see the numbers and the dollar signs. Horrible place to work, don't waste your time."
bad,"Brookdale has a very corporate structure. The work life balance is non existent, and the hiring process to new associate takes too long. The company isn't innovative or flexible  the residents or associates. Nor does it truly cater to the preferences of residents. Also occupancy is the deciding factor for everything. If occupancy of the community is below 70 percent, then stay away."
bad,Brookdale residence are Pleasant for the most part. And could be a joy to be around. This job was stressful and could be overwhelming. When you need management to take you serious about situations it doesn't always happen necessarily. It's not that Brookdale isn't a good company to work for but you have to have a strong personality and a good backbone to be able to work for them. Patience and kindness
bad,Good job with nice benefits. However has problems hiring. I work as a cook for 6 months on server pay because I was never switched in the system. They would not give back pay. There is also no ability to use the paid time off due to there being little to no staff. If you have any kind of background at all do not bother applying. Also be prepared to work 12 hour shifts at random and sometimes for weeks.
bad,The DON is rude & uncaring. No true leadership & lots of favoritism You're not appreciated & most of the time you're just there to cover a cart. Some of the nurses are very helpful while others are mean and out for themselves & will let you drown. The atmosphere can be very negative. The turnover is outrageous. No work/life balance.
bad,"As a care giver, we are paid like lousy. People at McDonalds make more. People rely on us for care and they pay a whopping 7 grand a month and we got 11 bucks an hour. 37 1/2 hours is the max that you can get. 90 percent of the workers need to also rely on assistance because rent is so high. Most are single moms. I started out 34 years ago and made more  than what they are paying nowo"
bad,"it was a good exprenice but i would've like more help with the management and more understanding with the CNA felt like we were the one only on the floor, in overall they are good but you wont be going far with the company. they did offer cool holiday party, and the pay start it not worth working for."
bad,"Management was always lacking. No sense of priority for employee needs. Unnecessary and rude comments from management. No incentives, company parties, etc."
bad,Working with the residents was the motivation for staying there. There were some good workers but mostly lazy ones. If your a good worker you will pick up the slack of others. There are favorites. Management is bad.
bad,"At a corporate level there is good communication and leadership. At a community level poor communication, lack of professional leadership, and dishonesty is prevalent."
bad,"I worked for Brookdale.  Life was ok, and then in came this crazy district manager who pulled me away from a 10 minute break that I had to stuff my food in my mouth  (after being on the clock for 7 hours with no breaks at all) to bully me over being in the dining room when it wasnt even my turn to be in the dining room.  This company should not at all have memory units.  The buildings are too big.  They say they ""staff by acuity"", but the staff is stretched so thin doing multiple jobs.  They are there to make $$$$$$$$, and that's about all."
bad,"When I first started I was happy with learning something new. But there is to much back stabbing and favoritism, if you don't fit the mold your out. No matter how hard you try its never enough. There are a few good people who see the same thing, I've just learned to keep quite.  Would not recommend this you anyone. I love the residents but some of the management really needs change."
bad,The most difficult part of the job is management follow-through. Some issues take too long to be resolved than necessary and compensation. Employees are cheated out of overtime pay which should be time and a half but it is much less. Employees are also cut 30 minutes short everyday making it impossible to make rounds with the oncoming shift.
bad,"My ED expected me to pull shifts as a dishwasher, and cook and then I couldn't get my job done.  She was never in the building because her personal life consumed her so I had to make decisions that I wasn't trained to make, but I had to make them for the residents. I spent a year covering for her and doing her job and ultimately lost mine, and she did NOTHING to stick up.for me. I worked a whole lot of OT that she would delete just to make her #'s look good, and I'm not the only one she did that to....need I say anymore???"
bad,the only thing this place has going for its employees are the benefits. the pay is not worth it. I love my residents and I love my coworkers but the work that is required for this company is worth way more than the wages that are being paid.
bad,"The residents in the assisted living is what kept me at Brookdale as long as I did. I was employed as a third shift RCA and upon hire was told that I would not have to work in the memory care building that I was hired for assisted living. After a couple of months that was taken back and was told otherwise and that the supervisor who informed me I wouldn’t have to work in memory care was new at the time of telling me that so it didn’t stand. As an RCA you never know who your direct support is because there is hardly ever a nurse on third shift. If a problem or concern arises you must decide if it merits calling the on call or wait until the next business day to address. When waiting for the next business day, it is very hard to get ahold of any management. It seems as though management does not communicate with each other because when a corncern is brought to ones attention no one else is aware.  Another associate comes and goes as pleases, takes well over the amounted time for lunch breaks, has been caught stealing cases of food and has never been fired or reprimanded enough to stop doing neglectful behavior. Those who are there for the residents and actually care for the residents are the ones who have it the worse, any concerns or problems brought up are brushed off and nothing is ever done to fix the issues. The management team needs training when it comes to communicating with associates, yelling and defensive speaking is not the professional or appropriate way to address an associate whom has a concern. Third shift has major scheduling issues and more times than not you"
bad,Terrible Management.  You can’t believe a word they say.    Moved from contingent to full time position and then they closed the Home Care Division two weeks later.   I was out of a job.  Other Full Time employees were given severance packages and I got nothing.   Miscommunication is the norm.  Too many chiefs and not enough Indians as they say.
bad,"the residents there are great and seem to appreciate what you do for them, unfortunately they are very under staffed which leads to scheduling nightmares"
bad,Haven't been there long and managment make it hard to want to work there. Not a very positive work place. Trying sadness me how some of them change the way they act when certain people come around
bad,"Overworked, understaffed, under appreciated, disables from top to bottom, with bottom affecting the residents and community associates the most... but they will say you "" thanks for all you do "" at the end of each and every email/communication."
bad,"* Favorable working environment."
bad,"Working at Brookdale West Palm Beach is not what one would consider fair. Work that should be for the other departments is constantly thrown our way. The pay is not high enough for all the work that is required of you. And finally, management tends to treat workers very differently from one another, always picking favorites, and will rarely recognize you for going above and beyond what you were hired to do."
bad,"Brookdale is a facility that has many good employees that really deserve more from the company. The pay is not that great compared to other companies. Management was not helpful much, made the job a lot more stressful. over all I would not recommend this job for anyone that doesn't deal with unnecessary stuff. "
bad,Residents were amazing. Hourly pay was horrible compared to how much residents are being charged per month. Staff was very rude with a bullying mentality.
bad,"I worked as a chef, I had 1 assistant who mainly did dishes, when we were graced with her presence. We were only allowed to be clocked in for 7 hours per day, as the only chef per shift cooking for 125 + and little help from the ""assistant"" I had to clock out for my lunch, not eat it, but keep on working. I had to clock out when my shift was scheduled to end regardless of duties left to be done off the clock. All kitchen cooks/chefs worked their tushies off and followed the same work off the clock procedure. My coworkers and myself frequently had to RUN to the restroom and in 10 months I never took 1 break.  I only stayed as long as I did because my manager was very supportive and helpful and I felt for the residents. Upper management has no idea about the ""culture of their kitchens"". Turnover is rampant. "
bad,the have a high turn over rate it was not hard good and friendly people and can learn a lot working here but they will pick at the littlest things to get rid of you
bad,"It's hard working job! If you're an RA you have to be able to work fast but with care. You get a whole hall to yourself with residents you have to answer to. You do showers, laundry, and clean after any given accidents. The easiest part about the job is the relationship you build with the residents. I say the hardest part is watching them go whether that means move or far worse. Management is a hit or miss. You get good managers and where there's good there is bad. I learned out of this whole experience after a year and half of being there is, although it's a job that pays you you cannot go in there with the mentality that it's ""just a paycheck"". You have to be understanding that you are making money to care for people and everything you do matters. I've learned that my jobs mean no matter what the residents are always first."
bad,Is just like any other caregiving job. Lack of income to suffice for someone to make a career out of such a job. Lack of income which makes a caregiver burn out a lot easier and give less quality care to a resident.
bad,good in between job for kids out of highschool just starting college. hard to get any time off as everyone is over worked and not compensated accordingly.
bad,"No future for you. Supervisors are not helpful to see their juniors prosper. You can be fired at anytime. Nurses are treated like garbage, supervisors show no respect to their juniors."
bad,Personaly I wouldn't recommend anyone to work at Brookdale senior living they r always having people quit an getting something better an that pays better an to where there can get their full 40 hours n a week an not under an they don't like paying overtime
bad,"Management is a joke. My ED and the chef was the only half way decent managers out of them all in our community. Nurse ignores your concerns, Supervisor doesn’t listen and is unprofessional at times. Drama and rumors fly faster then malaria. Residents are wonderful and are very thankful which makes it hard to leave."
bad,Management was awful. A lot of shady stuff went on with missing medications and the RNs I’m charge. Other than a few caregivers they hired bar people to care for the residents.
bad,"While most coworkers are enjoyable to work with, but investment  to work, poor pay, and strict hours make the experience stressful and quickly drains any enjoyment"
bad,i loved working with all the resident but the management isn't the best they had favorites and there was a lot of drama sometime i would work there again if there was better management
bad,"If the director does not care the staff as a whole will not! I find that people in this business see it as an opportunity to selfishly gain easy money. "
bad,a typical workday at Brookdale was like any other job it was exciting at first than the workload became very tedious. I really didnt learn much of anything there. the management team was highly unprofessional. there was almost no workplace culture there. The hardest part of my job there was making sure all of my managers and supervisors were pleased even though they werent all on the same page.the most enjoyable part of my job was getting a paycheck
bad,"Typical - cleaning kitchen and deliver meals"
bad,I worked for many years with emeritus I enjoyed my job but the lack of leadership and the constant made it a very hard place to work!! I enjoyed working with the residents but the management team constantly changed and there wasn't ever any stability!
bad,"No Thank you.Would not recommend this place to work."
bad,Can learn a lot about patients and their culture ad meet a lot of fun people that have so many medical problems. There is a lot of stress working there.
bad,"PCT/CNA (Current Employee), Clermont Florida – September 27, 2017"
bad,I don't get enough hours.And no benefit for me.I wish I could get benefit and more hours .I don't think I will  recommend  anybody to come to work for  this company  unless things change for the better.
bad,"Set up and tear down the dining hall for residents. Serving breakfast, lunch, and dinner, 365 days a year. When not serving, you are in the kitchen preparing the next meal and cleaning all prep areas."
bad,"The most enjoyable part of my job is interacting with the residents.  I love my residents.  They bring me Joy!  When my daily tasks are complete,  I enjoy spending time attending to them and making them feel important!"
bad,it was an ok job it had its up and downs.  I loved the residents . but the management was horrible.. didn't really give employees a say. didn't do to good with conflict.
bad,very unprofessional people a lot of gossip and nothing is being done about it needs   a lot of work with the employees and needs to show them how to be professional
bad,Brookdale was very unprofessional and inconsiderate of its employees. The management staff do not treat people equally or fairly and they cause stress to those working under them.
bad,The job was too stressful. Not enough workers to accommodate the work that was required the facility. The objective of a productive worker is not to overwork them then you can not get the require job performance out of them.
bad,"The company has a mentality of ""always climbing the corporate ladder"" which leaves the residents with lower care quality. It is not a bad place. There are just better places out there."
bad,good place to start out at and learn new things but not the place you want to stay forever. the hardest part of this job is when you lose someone you have come close with.
bad,It seemed more like a skilled facility and not assisted living. Not good teamwork. Not a very good clean environment. Workers are not rewarded and appreciated.
bad,"Constantly under staffed to meet proper job requirements. Which causes Lack of proper care to the residents, who sadly, pay a large amount to get less than mediocre care. Lack of concern towards or for the safety of residents or staff personnel needs from supervision personnel on multiple levels and occurrences. Unsafe environment unless major improvement are made."
bad,Currently employee moral is very low with all the changes in management.  Focus does not seem to be the original core values it once had.
bad,"I've worked for this company for a number of years and the only absolutely apparent thing is the upper management care nothing for the employees or residents. Because of the desire to always save money, they have cut care significantly. Residents aren't benefitting from these cuts because there is ALWAYS under staffing. Although we have staff that is willing to work, that may cause overtime which is absolutely prohibited. The few faithful employees that are there for their love of the residents are so burnt out from being understaffed that even they are ready to call it quits. The stress this job puts on you is so overwhelming and it isn't worth it for what they are willing to pay. This company/building expects miracles but doesn't want to pay for a wish. Living off this pay will surely lead you to being homeless soon. The saddest part of all this is that the staff is willing to give the best care but we aren't given the proper utilities, motivation, and appreciation that we deserve. The laziest workers are the favorites and the hard workers are overlooked and definitely UNDERPAID. Why is it too much to ask for an extra dollar when I always have to do the job of more than one person? I'm working like two people, why can't I get paid like an appreciated one. "
bad,management did not always have employees best interest regarding workload and workplace cohesiveness. too much preaching and not enough leading by example.
bad,You have to be a certain kind of person to work there. The management does nt extend the rules to all employees. They protect their favorites.
bad,"When I worked there the management only cared about one thing that that is the social appearance of the place, yes it needed to look good for the residents who lived there but when it comes down to it the first should be the residents. Management played favorites with certain people. The co workers where not friendly they talked a lot of smack about everyone, they didn't want to help with the personal care of the residents, they sat and talked or played on there phones, they took to long of breaks."
bad,"If you love low wages, lousy schedules, and constantly changing staffs then this is the place for you. I have been there almost two years and have never seen anything like it. I don't know how they keep it running. Our department is in constant flux and often cannot offer enough hours to their staff. Up to recently, we did not even have a break room. I work a split shift. I work with Alzheimer and stroke patients and am very unpaid for their constant care. There is no retirement plan and they expect you to make your own on matching funds. The raises are lousy. I have seen numerous employees on all levels come in for a short time and leave within a few months. Many of my co-workers have left for unhappiness with their job, especially because they cannot provided them with enough hours. They schedule clients one on top of the other so you never get the full amount of time you are paying for. The other departments are a total mess and cannot provide the services expected of them, I know this through personal experience trying to get care for my residents. What's worse is that many of the residents are far overpaying for living there and are very unhappy with their experiences. Hardest part for me is to watch them put up with such poor quality since this company is supposedly number one in the field. The most enjoyable part of my job is working directly with them daily to ensure the highest life quality I can provide for them. I would highly recommend shopping around thoroughly before you come to live at one of the Brookdale facilities."
bad,"Difficulties scheduling"
bad,"I enjoyed working the residents & families. Management was rarely available for emploees, residents or families; they would routinely brush matters off to other hourly employees to deal with. Low pay, low employee esteem."
bad,"Alot of AM medications to administer throughout the 7-3 shift, I learned to be more patient with the residents, continue to comply with my work ethics,even on a bad day.The management team was a little unorganized when scheduling, Co-workers had a hard time on planning team work. The hardest part of my job was covering extra shift on same day when a co-worker called out like a whole other 8 hrs. But overall i love the residents because when they were happy they make me smile!"
bad,"i got hired to one of their nursing homes and i thought it was gonna be the perfect job for me as i like elderlys and ive got server background. lo and behold, on my first day of training all's ok, but on my second day, they had me working double shift and on the 3rd day, they had me working alone, serving 30 guests all by myself! some of my colleagues told me we are understaffed and the manager who does the hiring dont wanna hire enough people hence stretching the man power which decreases the productivity. AND they only pay me 7.95 and hour and i thought that was bad until i heard someone tell me that she been there for FOUR years and she only gets paid $8.02 per hour, shes only up by 7 cents to what im getting and thats unacceptable, imagine whats gonna happen to me in a few years if i stick around. and the management doesnt care to us they had us working so much for so little pay. on the goodside my coworkers are great, they treated me like family eventhough i was new, and they were very helpful. and the residents are so nice to us."
bad,"They do NOT VALUE the residents or the workers! To them everyone is expendable and can be replaced! While working there they decieved families into staying there! They would HIDE some of our more vocal residents in another halway, other than the one they live while doing showings of avalible rooms! and we constantly were working without supplies! We were routeinly out of personal care supplies at least 2-3 weeks out of the month! Like wipes, breifs, powder, and perenial wash! Most of us workers used our own money to buy our residents the personal care items that are supposed to be provided by the company!"
bad,"a typical day at work consisted of waking residents, assisting them with their ADL's, encouraging residents to do activities daily. There was alot of teamwork required so that every resident could get the best care and attention.I would say the hardest part of the job is working with people who really aren't there for the residents, and do not have the residents in their best interest, they are basically just there for a check. The most enjoyable part of the job is seeing the smiles on the residents faces."
bad,As a waiter for Emeritus my responsibility was to offer an excellent and professional service to each and every one of the seniors. I had to take their food orders and make sure they got everything as they wanted it. After they finished I had to clean the tables and set them up again for the evening meal. The most important thing about this job was to give a good attitude to the seniors and make them feel at home.
bad,This company has a values policy that they dont uphold. You can tell the management things that happen like cna's eating of the patients place after they have hand feed them or well they are feeding them and nothing is done. The staff does not get along for the sake of the patient. The kitchen is not santized and the dishwashers never wash the dishes the correct way. Food particles are left on some of the plates and the staff still serve the patients.They don't not treat the employees equally. They don't like to give a raise for outstanding work. If there is a raise giving it is a 1 cent to 10 cent raise or 1.5 percent of employee pay.
bad,I left company after 7 years. I loved my job. The lack of response to conscerns  and safety issues was alarming. I would not recommend seeking employment or placing a loved one with Brookdale.
bad,"Supervisor was not supportive of employees and made working conditions difficult. Director was more understanding and when other properties needed extra help, sent the best worker over to fill-in until the position was filled or their maintenance worker returned to work."
bad,"There is a lack of management. Often times it difficult to speak with the higher ups. If are able to be granted an audience with them, often times you are ignored and dismissed."
bad,"I started here recently I should have run like another girl did after her interview. The base pay is $13 I have been a cna for 6 years and still base is $13, I work overnight so I make $14. Don’t think you will make bank on weekends nope, the pay is your base $13 plus the $2.25 not all together. For the workload it is not even worth it. This is the same pay I was making doing home health. Most times you work short, people don’t or won’t come in."
bad,It was very unprofessional and unreliable.  Not enough staff or supplies to complete daily tasks of the job. No one seemed to care to fix anything. Customers had many company complaints.
bad,Ok place to work for. The residents are wonderful and staff. Management is horrible and they will fire you for anything. Went through ED's in less than a year. The best thing about working there is the residents.
bad,There was no proper training regimen for the dining room and I was serving on different floors within different units without being properly trained. Staff could be rude and very hard to work with. Management seemed to overlook serious issues between employees and different concerns and suggestions that employees had implied to help with service.
bad,"Was the best job I've ever has until Corporate inspected us, cut my income in half, made me feel unimportant and eventually found an unsubstantiated reason to let me go."
bad,The only reason I stayed there was the residents. Upper management is awful. Always in meetings.  Very clickish and have no clue for what keeps the place going. Make decisions on issues they know nothing about and don't care to find out or get to the truth. It’s a joke.
bad,"Coworker treated me like I was pathetic and an idiot, got a new boss just after starting who is buddy-buddy with her. New boss did not train me. She did not offer solutions when I made mistakes, instead I received a write up for making mistakes, when I had no experience in cooking by myself for 60 people. Complaints to HR did nothing. I didn't feel welcome with all of the managers. The residents did not like my food and complained every day and sometimes got me in trouble for certain things. They did not like me as a cook and would say very nasty things to me or come into the kitchen to yell at me. I followed the Brookdale recipes but I was told to tweak them because they weren't good. Then I would be judged on the tweaks I made. No opportunity to move up. In between waitressing, prepping food, cooking and cleaning, you have to find time per month to do training videos and then attend a monthly meeting on your day off or during your shift when you're busy. The schedule is 11:30 - 7 so you only work 7 hours a day instead of 8, 4-5 days a week. Not worth $14 for all of what you have to put up with, including a constant lack of food items for the menu. Poor management. Bad attitudes. I do not recommend working here."
bad,"Due to horrific corporate mandated limitations ( food cost which was less than $6 to provide 2 meals breakfast and dinner for a resident) and being chronicle understaffed (each cook produced 50-60 meals per day) it was extremely stressful."
bad,"Honestly when it comes to management it’s OK. They try to accommodate your hours and days off ; however, there is not enough employees. Some days you’re lucky if you even have 3 caregivers. When it’s just 2 of you,  and it’s for more than 30 people it’s not worth it. Regardless if it’s an assisted living, should be managed a little bit more better. They say medtechs  and nurses should be able to help but they’re busy as it is and need to focus on their Med pass. I did this to give myself some rest from doing Cna work but I feel like this is just worse than doing Cna Becos the amount of people you’re caring for and being understaffed."
bad,Understaffed for the service they want to provide. They want to provide excellent service but dont have the resources to do so. Staffing kept at a state minimum so minimum is what you get.
bad,"Company changed with disconnect between operation ""Margin over Mission"". Used to be ""Mission over Margin"". Overall great people out there with passion to take care of the elderly."
bad,"Always received a break.  Co-workers in the kitchen were easy to get along with.  Very busy during lunch and dinner.  No Point of Service system, so had to figure out hand written tickets."
bad,"Concerns are seldom acted on, nursing staff will not work on the floor, nursing staff acts superior/ better than Resident Care Associate, nurses talk down to RA's."
bad,"I love working with the seniors  at Brookdale however, some of the staff are not team players and there is a lot of favoritism amongst the employees and management staff.  Problems the other staff members may have are not properly addressed if addressed at all and the decisions that are made concerning staff/management is always one-sided. The one good thing that I've experienced working at Brookdale was working with the residents and the work load is not heavy at all."
bad,The management wasn’t the best but I enjoyed making everyday life a little easier on the residents. Hours were drastically cut and people were not getting the hours they needed
bad,I do not wish to provide a review for this company. there is nothing to add or subtract from this place as an organization. It is a multi-national corporation.
bad,I found that the company was a unique and interesting culture. There was many things that kept moving and several changes. Just work hard do your job.
bad,"I was a server.  All I can say it that the management was terrible, too much favoritism, lack of hours for full time employees, mistreatment,and drama."
bad,"Fast pace unable to get anything done, due to lack of good help. People would never listen to what you needed. You are not respected , and it was everyone for themselves.the upper mangers their dont care about staff or others members of the management and does not provide training for new hires"
bad,"Brookdale has a lower aquity level, so it is a good first caregiving job to introduce you to the field works. While I worked at this location though, management was very in flux and didn't seem to care for staff or residents too much. Working there did make me fully appreciate my next job in a better community, though."
bad,"The location I worked at was usually short staffed, and there were many times I had to briefly stop doing my medication cart/runs to help the resident aides because of being understaffed."
bad,"The job it self is not a bad job. The company gets in the way of you trying to do your job. The process of hiring a new person takes from 2 wks to a month from the time you hire the person until the time they can step food into your department to start working. "
bad,"Brook dale doesn't take care of the workers or its residents, the care takers do not do their jobs correctly or safely and pass on their duties to lesser experienced staff. "
bad,Brookdale isn't the best but it is an okay place. They have some good management and some people who should not be a manager due to the fact on how they treat the employees under them. Other managers are great there in my opinion.
bad,"At a typical day at work, expect to be physically/emotionally/verbally abused by the residents. It sucks, because they don't know better (having Alzheimers/Dementia), except half the staff doesn't care or help and administration is a joke."
bad,"Many days over 12 hours placed. Unable to perform paperwork aspect of the job due to having to cover the floor. Typically at least once a week, having worked a 8 hour day and staff called in or didn't show; had to return to facility and work whatever aspect whether it be as patient caretaker or medication nurse. Exhausted all the life out of me."
bad,"Stressful environment.  Though provided with tools, to many changes and not allowing any one direction to work prior to making the changes.  Not given the chance to manage community, as distractions and pettyness come from upper management."
bad,"Love helping and serving our seniors, just would like Brookdale to appreciate me half as much as residents do.Always willing to go the extra mile to insure the quality of life for the residents.Brookdale not so much."
bad,"Working as a server was a good experience, I loves helping the residents and serving their food in a timely manner. I do not reccomend this job to any friends due to the fact that management was poorly, and some CNAS were rude to residents. But other than management, I did enjoy my job, flexible hours for college students, and great residents, and amazing, fun loving co- workers."
bad,"Brookdale is a great place however, in the assisted living care unit it feels more like a nursing home.  Some of the employees are friendly and can collaborate as a team.  Then you have managers and other team members who can not work collaboratively and I don't think they have a passion to care for our resident's.  Some staff work at Brookdale for the income when it should be more to it such as giving back and providing care and support to our resident's."
bad,Management spends time reacting to situations rather than being proactive and developing systems to prevent these situations
bad,Residents were a joy to care for and it was very rewarding. Could have had better training. The hardest part of the job was the lifting of the heavy residents.
bad,Management is terrible there. They cut your working hour and increase the workload by reduce number of staff. Better look somewhere else. Resident are nice but they blame the management for short staffing.
bad,"Pros: Working in this job comes with a lot of fun and awesome stories from the residents. I grew to love the residents as my own family. I love being there caregiver. I was always happy being around them."
bad,This company is all about an image. They have 1 RCA at night for 25+ residents in assisted living. Usually 1 at night in Memory Care for 10-12 residents. They are all about NO overtime and will cut your week short if you hit OT but if they can't find people to cover shifts you become there BFF and they want u to stay and cover it. As long as the independent section of the facility looks good they tend to relentlessly neglect assisted living and memory care staffing. They mistreat staff and expect u to find your own coverage if u want off or want to use your earned PTO. If u can't find coverage u can't have off regardless if it's PTO or not.
bad,"For the most part, the staff is friendly and the office environment is pretty easy going. Management is a completely different story. They are very disorganized and give multiple answers to the same question on a regular basis."
bad,"I just recently quit my RA position at Emeritus in Fortuna, CA. I worked noc shift for a long time and have been trying to switch shifts for a while now. The nurse told me at the end of Mar when she hired more people she would take me off. She said she cant change the schedule. The schedule gets changed all the time. The noc girl in memory care asked to get off noc and she did. When I started this job I was on noc because I was the new hire. Well the nurse doesnt do seniority which is bull. She came up with all the stupid rules, useless paperwork to do that no one looks at and the med techs say she sluffs alot of her work on them. She has been so mean to me and I tried talking to the Executive Director but she was rude and backed up the nurse because they are close friends. I wanted off noc because I am not hardly sleeping during the day and I am burned out. My blood pressure has also skyrocketed. I resent the management not changing my shift when they could. I am considering a lawsuit for all the suffering I have gone through. If they were smart they would get rid of the nurse because she is poison. Even some of the residents have complained about her. I wasnt trying to cause trouble but I am worried about my health with little sleep."
bad,"As a nurse you must chart on your patients at the end of every shift. There was one catch though...no overtime.  So if by some chance something threw your day off and you were a little behind,  you had to clock out at the end of your shift and stay to chart. Hired a new DON who was never around, training for new nurses was horrible. Like any job, coworkers gossip. But when other nurses would make a mistake and blame it on prior shift, i wasn't about to put my license on the line any longer. Shady staff and management"
bad,"Will when I go in to work sometimes you don't know if we are going to have a enough staff, and when we are short I get behind on my work. I have learned a lot there , I like I have learn to order medication,filing and calling doctors etc.Management need to learn to mangers. There was really not hard about my job. The most enjoyable part of this job is listening to the resident stories."
bad,"The management is horrible. They don't care about anything unless it affects their jobs. The co workers are mostly ok but you do have a few lazy ones who do nothing and constantly get away with it. The only thing enjoyable about the job is the paycheck. The benefits are good as far as vacation pay (PTO time). The medical is ok too. If they had better management that made the employees be accountable for their job performances then it would be an ok place to work, until then I wouldn't waste my time. There are better jobs out there."
bad,They took advantage of my work I was under paid to be a lead. Don’t try to go to HR or ED because they don’t care about you either. I was banned from speaking
bad,Pay is extremely poor for everything that we do for the residents at brookdale. management is poor and a lot of the residents needs are not met. We are extremely understaffed so we end up taking care of more residents than we as an individual need to- for instance I had to take care of 10 residents the other night and get them all ready for bed which is a hard task when you have limited time to do it.
bad,"The turnover rate is incredibly high with not a lot happening to fix it. I am disappointed in upper management to say the least. I LOVE the residents and working with them has brought so much to my life. But the toxic work environment is so stressful it is affecting my mental health. Between coworkers who don't have their health considered to coworkers who get their scheduled vacation days taken away and given to other people, and being overworked myself (because of over 2 months of having no ED, no Business Admin, and no Sales Manager) I do not have good feelings about this place..."
bad,Only benifits was that it was flexible with my situation. Maybe desperate for workers was why they were flexible. Now my location is sunrise instead of Brookdale but still same workers and pay.
bad,The most rewarding part was actually helping the people but at the end of the day it doesn't pay the bills. I loved what I did but I only left for the pay is too low.
bad,I really enjoyed my job there. The problem was that the productivity standards were too high for what I was doing. They did not count my drive time in between buildings and that affected my productivity. I felt it was doing a really good job but continually was pressured for productivity issues
bad,I was the only female that worked in the kitchen. And because of that I got treated like I didn’t know anything and talked to like I was stupid. No room to grow or moved up in the company. Also everyone is super competitive! If it’s not done one persons way then you’re “wrong”. Unless you want to work with grown men that act like high school girls then this is the place for you!!
bad,"The other staff I worked with, I liked."
bad,"Low pay and a lot of turn over on employees. You only get 37.5 hour a week but will pay a contractor to come in, instead of give you OT to finish."
bad,"I love being a nurse, but this job has caused me to hate even waking up in the morning because I know I will have to go into work where its understaffed and the management refuses to listen to the obvious problems that are being brought up. Management does not care about the amount of care the resident may need, so they are will to accept anybody to move in, even in they would be more suited in a nursing home. They expect the nurses to watch over 50+ residents and never offer to help."
bad,"Quick work with patience is a must. Hard work with few breaks but the relationships built is worth it. The hardest thing about the job is the hours, youst be flexible in your hours."
bad,can be a productive and successful workplace at time but overall most of the people are very rude. They had a lot of favoritism & weak people skills which made the job alittle more frustrating at time.
bad,"I was a Full Time Resident Care Associate at $10.40 hourly and i was working 2-3 days per week and they were short staffed but still they didn't give me the hours I was supposed to work since I was a FULL TIME EMPLOYEE! I quit because of that, i wasn't getting paid the amount I was supposed to."
bad,"Decent place to work. "
bad,I was a caregiver and I have seen a lot of seniors that are not properly taken good care from many license nurses. poor management when problem arises
bad,"I loved all of my residents. That honestly is the most enjoyable part of the job. It makes it fun and a place you look forward to going. Unfortunately, the management structure is so bad that it negatively affects the entire staff and residents. All of the managers weren't awful, just as most of the employees are great. I didn't learn anything because I wasn't trained. It's one of those things where you have to learn for yourself or your s.o.l. The hardest part was not being supplied the right equipment to do the job correctly how it is required and in a safe manner. Safety was not even a topic that was ever discussed during the time I was working there I witnessed several injuries occur. We would always be so short staffed and busy that we barely ever get to enjoy a break."
bad,"heavy lifting is a must for this work, everyday is a different day, some are good, some days are bad. Management is a joke.  Every hard to find someone to work for your hours of your PTO"
bad,The residents are not treated the same. I work the memory care unit and they are treated like children with the activities that are provided and don't receive the respect that they deserve. They have no say in anything.
bad,working mostly on my own I leaned all management is different where are always some challenges you need to work through not having all the things you need to do the well the people I work for (residences) associates
bad,"disorganized, always chaotic. never a dull moment. People always calling in sick.Upper management dosent really care and dosent support middle management"
bad,"This facility paid poorly, gave us a tremendous amount of work and management didn't seem to care much about employees. No benefits or paid vacation time. Facility was poorly kept."
bad,"The most enjoyable part of job is the residents."
bad,"They do not focus on the residence as much as your computer skills.Pay is on the low end of the pay scale. There is a high turn over in employees.  CNA are over worked and under paid. Resident care is compromised when CNA's have more then 10 residence  to take care of. No one wont's the truth to come out, I have seen it first hand."
bad,"Every time I hear the mission statement I want to throw up. The individual managers try their best to care for residents and employees, but the corporate overhead means they are unable to. The employees themselves either leave shortly after being hired or end up burning out a few months later. Very few stay longer than a year. The ones who do truly have hearts of gold, but often end up working six or seven days a week to make up for the high turnover of new staff."
bad,Not a well managed company. No training for job hired for. Strong lack of support and inefficient practices. Wouldn't recommend company to others.
bad,Job seemed ok at first then realized how abusive the company can be. No confidentiality they expect your life to be an open book. Not much of a culture.
bad,This company will have one nurse working an entire building with a census of 55+ residents. If there are any emergencies than the whole building suffers. There is no accountability for peoples actions or lack thereof. The company is supposed to be assisted living comm but their greed for money has them dragging in people who need skilled care. The raises are terrible. $1.50 for four years of employment there. Management is terrible and the Executive director is a bully and very vendictive if you do something she doesn't like. You work a 6 1/2 - 7 hour med pass before you can even take a lunch break.
bad,We have a great team. But when Something happens when one of the mangers don’t like it just kinda throws our whole day off. But for the most part we have a great management team.
bad,do not recommend working here. Staff and management very rude. Unbearable working conditions. AC broke in the kitchen and staff would no call no show and would leave us short staffed.
bad,The management was the worse they didn’t care about the residents or employees. No one ever knew what was going on and I went through 3 Executive Directors in 7 month period. The concierge was so unprofessional and loud mouth with a horrible wardrobe. The kitchen was barely clean. The RA were so unprofessional is pathetic. The Maintenance Director work was sloppy and he never fixed anything. The head nurse was always running from issues and the lady under her was careless.
bad,Just work hard to get through the day the residents are fun to talkto they make the day go by fast but sometimes they have their days where they seem a little geumpy
bad,The management changes a lot sooooo they are always changing how they want the building ran the managers there now aren’t managers they are very bossy and only give orders they don’t know how to deal with their employees and they are always short stuff on all shifts if short the managers will not come in to help so you have to do double the work basically
bad,"Working at Brookdale was a rewarding experience, because of the  environment you were working in. The residents living at the facility showed great respect for my fellow coworkers and treated them the  same way. On the other hand, the managers and supervisors did not give any sense of sympathy to my fellow coworkers when a family member has passed away. the workers at Brookdale truly give there heart and soul to the residents. For this Brookdale to thrive, there needs to be a change in management and supervisors."
bad,it would be a very nice place to work if management cared about their employees. Witnessed way to much injustices within the work place. Management is very quick to say they are there to help but will turn a blind eye in a heart beat.
bad,This would be a great place to work for the employee who likes to work and help the elderly. It was heartbreaking to see that some employees did not even care about the residents at all. I found it very frustrating to seeing that the residents were being neglected and not being helped with their basic needs and personal hygiene. When neglect situation was brought up to management they see you as a troublemaker and start giving you a hard time.
bad,"Brookdale is unwilling to change its archaic approach to problem solving. They dispatch their cooperate officers to help ""fix"" problems, but actually waste more time by their mere presence in the building. An analogy would be lets say, your house is burning and a fireman show up and points at the fire and says to you ""Put out that fire"" then leaves without helping at all. Never expect cooperate office to support you!. They will overload you with more work than a single person can handle then blame you for not getting it all done. Any new person starting should expect a set up for failure. I do not recommend this place."
bad,The skilled nursing & care staff was great - upper management did not seem to care much about the memory care residents so that made it a difficult work environment.  I enjoyed my time with the residents but there was little opportunity to advance and compensation was poor.
bad,If you aren't in the click then forget it.  Management does not care what anyone thinks.  Its all about what have you done for me lately.  No advancement unless youre blond or a nurse.
bad,"a few employees at this location treats the residents horribly. cleaning habits are horrible. management is disorganized . I loved the residents at the facility. This  job consist of you bathing residents, washing clothes, setting the dinning room and serving residents. clean and take out trash at the end of the shift."
bad,it was a very sad place to work and management was bad. You have split shifts which if you live far away can be a bad thing. The people there are very jugmental.
bad,This is an OK place to work as long as everything is organized as far as scheduling upon hiring new people. It's convenient and close to home for me. Its OK.
bad,"I worked in many different situations and I would say, it was very stressful. I did not feel like the management had a good grasp on what the workers were doing."
bad,"Typical day cleaning resdents apartments and collecting trash and laundry. Checking the public laundry areas and bathrooms. "
bad,"It was never a 9-5 job. "
bad,"Enjoyed the experience with different residents and training classes."
bad,"While employed here I absolutely loved my residents and caring for them and became close with their family members."
bad,"I performed skilled nursing visits to clients in home at assisted and independent living communities. The most enjoyable part of the job is that I met a  diverse group of people , associates and clients and enjoyed in assisting them in care and the healing process.  The hardest part of the job were long hours, being under staffed and work overload. My co-workers were great and team work was very important to me. Management needed better organization and communication skills. The company as a whole should show better care of their employees. Caring for employees will in turn make client care better. there is no job security with this company. It's possible to be terminated without warning or notice. I've seen it happen to quite a few associates. They can over work you and think nothing of terminating you if mistakes happen.  I learned not to let myself be pressured into work overload"
bad,"There was no training. If you enjoy doing 75 percent of the work while the ""lead"" stands and eats, talks to everyone, barks orders at you and is negative/toxic , I highly recommend this job. Oh and the best part was when I went to management NO ONE DID ANYTHING. Went into the HR office and another worker just walked on in and sit down. Yes the door was closed, that's just how professional she is. While in there she said it deosnt matter how you're asked to do something, you do it. I am a human, not a dog. I don't get yelled at to do something. Kitchen manager sits on his butt majority of the time (on facebook), when he is there. ED and kitchen manager never really worked a whole week. All around had a great experience, would recommend to absolutely no one. Residents are sweet and for the most part taken care of ,so that's one good thing to say. Met some good people. But everyone else was miserable and hated their job and it showed. Not the best thing for our elderly but who cares right?! Not Brookdale."
bad,"They don't give you enough hours to do the job, therefore you're working like a crazy dog getting the work done with no help, constantly being nagged about the total hours."
bad,Resident population declined from approximately 70+ to 35 during the time I was there. Sales team was ineffective in getting in new residents. Building needs updating and residents were very elderly and unmotivated.
bad,"As much as I love working with my residents, they were my second family. We were expected to do too much without the proper tools.  Understaffing, going without personal hygiene equipment for the residents. Some residents that needed more care. And no cooperation from managers. Constant gossip from staff and managers. A big highschool drama."
bad,"Brookdale is a bad company to work for. The management does give you support, however, training is non-existent. The position(s) there are almost set up for failure due to the aforementioned. I would not recommend working for that company."
bad,"It's an okayy job if you reaaly need the money but as far as trying to get a raise, i don't think so. The environment is sometimes a friendly environment depending on who is over you on your shift."
bad,"Very fast paced and requires a lot of multi tasking. I enjoy the residents and their ability to share their past experiences. Working in the memory care unit was quite challenging but also very rewarding. Meal time was always a little stressful, as long as you stay focused in runs very smoothly. You must have residents preferred times when the require bedtime,showering, and toileting . The hardest part of the job was to remain focused on the task at hand and move quickly to another task then trying to remember where you left off. The staff work well together, we always cover each other and work as a team. When you need assistance with a resident there is always another team member to assist in helping."
bad,"Long work hours, inadequate nursing staff, frequent miscommunication between several teams and their schedulers, fast turnover of nursing staff, sometimes unreasonable expectations from nursing staff and allied health professionals."
bad,"Working for this company was very stressful. We were constantly low on staff but yet they kept filling each room with residents but not enough people there to take care of them. I felt like a lot of the residents we not meant to be there, with us being a living assistant, they allowed so many elderly people to live that were too far gone to be there. Were they needed special care, instead of getting that they received half caring staff and half caring nurses who didnt listen to us when we reported change with the residents. I felt like the RCA were looked at as the bottom of the food chain, we were over worked and under appreciated. We were so under staff i was working 115  plus most of the time but always having to work over time cause there were so many open shift. I am talking 20 plus open shifts per pay check."
bad,"The management has no interest in working with you for your needs when it comes to the balance of personal life and work life. You get mandated 5-10 minutes before your shift is to end. You work short all the time, and management does not help AT ALL."
bad,"Easy job!"
bad,The job had its ups and downs but it was fun watching residents  dancing when we had music playing or just watching them play bingo
bad,"not much training, a lot of substituting for food menu, not much help when your work load is over whelming and you get behind."
bad,The job was not sanitary. Residents were treated poorly. The overworked their servers. Environment was horrible. I would not recommend this job to anyone.
bad,"Relaxed environment, didn't seem to appreciate their employees. The best thing about the place were the residents. They give you a free meal when working, but the food wasn't worth it."
bad,70 percent of workers do work but the other 30 percent smoke outside all day and slack around it is not fair to the hard workers. And nothing was ever done.
bad,There were issues. Overall it was a good company to work for however it was very difficult to get days off. Being expected to work every single weekend was very tiring.
bad,"Long days and VERY short staffed. Had the flu and they asked if I was sure I couldn’t come in. The place isn’t clean, stinks and it’s unorganized. Quit without a 2 weeks notice."
bad,Company is definitely failing in that location. The staff are running thin and paying a outsource company twice the amount as current staff because staff wont stick around for such short pay. The turnover rate is so high in that building that the job postings just continually get renewed.
bad,"This place could be so much better,  there's alot of favoritism from management and that's not fair. Management ( In the nursing department) can be pretty rude I've experienced it myself and its ridiculous how grown adults can act so rude for no reason.  They have a high turn over rate and its because of management which is sad , this could be a great place to the facility is nice and the pay is decent could be better especially the way this place makes money. It's short staffed alot due to call offs because people get tired of working here either because they are overwhelmed or because they no longer desire to work here and usually quit due to poor treatment. It's not hard to get hired because they are always hiring. Their are alot of people that have been here for a long time because they feel they have seniority over everyone and feel as though they can do as they please and management wont do anything about it because they don't want to lose employees due to the turnover rate so alot of people get away with alot which is sad but what can you do? I'm only speaking on behalf of the nursing department and not the facility as a whole . Proceed at your own discretion."
bad,A typical day would be to make sure your tasks are done and do activities with the residents and engage in whatever the resident would like to do and make sure the place is clean.
bad,"The place is overall nice but I didn’t like the management. Job is overall okay, the dining staff isn’t very organized, overall the coworkers are pretty okay"
bad,"Management was the worst i have ever had in healthcare. They want u to cook, wash dishes, clean and wash pots with no help. Nobody can run a kitchen by themselves with no help. I was on my own every weekend with no help for 6 months. Until i got fed up and decided to go elsewhere smh. There was no growth or advancement all they do is hold u back from other opportunities in the company. The only thing i liked besides the residents was the pay it was awesome but u will work to death to get it. I recommend nobody to work for this company"
bad,"Alot of interruptions,upper management some times does not know answers to questions.The pay is not good.Some Residents are very hard to please.Employees have to account for every minute."
bad,"Glorified telemarketing position "
bad,Definitely not enough pay for the amount of stress. Seems like all they worry about is the bottom dollar. Good place to start of looking for an introduction to home healthcare or geriatrics.
bad,Management is not very knowledgeable of the different departments and tend to micromanage often. Management doesn't try boosting moral or pay well. The residents are usually great.
bad,Not a good place to work they don't pay good for the work they ask you to do. They also had bed bugs and didnt let employees know for example I had to hear the news about that from a co-worker and it was secretive.
bad,This workplace could be a little bit more professional with better communication from management.  Not too good with getting back to employees about inquiries.
bad,They Fired the division President then hired a pharmacist to replace who has no idea the rules and regulations involved. Was sending highly unethical expectations down the pipeline. Hence why they got in trouble in Florida.
bad,"A typical work day there was very stressful. You had to give out medications to residents and also supervise other CNA's to make sure they were doing their job. When emergencies arrive such as a fall, a lot of paperwork was involved."
bad,There is no communication between departments or within your department. You are expected to do the work of multiple people and still get critized. No on takes responsibility for ANYTHING
bad,"Brookdale Senior Solutions overworks their employees. The food servers are given 5 hours worth of work that is to completed within 3 hours. No overtime, hardly any benefits, and a measly once a year pay raise. The only plus side to this company is the connections that are build with the residents. in addition to short shifts with fairly flexible availability. Overall this company has a lot to be desired and much to be improved."
bad,The residents will definitely make you love what you do. But as for the management team and some of the work you have to do isn't really that great. This job consists of hard work and lots of free time.
bad,"Not fair to review them haven't been there long enough. More equipment should be provided when lifting heavy residents, some are not able to stand or walk. overall rating is fair, good benefits if you are full time and have a history with this company, no room for advancement in this area."
bad,"This is a great job to have. Here is what a typical day is like:Greets visitors in person or on the telephone, answering or referring inquiries."
bad,I was a RA.  I did not get properly trained and there is not enough staff for proper time management.  Management has weekends off when they are needed the most and  the staff is not friendly.
bad,"Unorganized, stressful working environment. Nurse aides were overworked. Short staffed and often left with a nurse."
bad,"Walk the community to make sure the building is presentable to prospective residents and their families, 30 phone calls a day, home visits, accounting, deposits, invoicing, building tours, daily meetings, counseling families and residents"
bad,"I work as a server. Most people won't stay because the amount of work you do, is way more than you get payed. At the property I am at, it pays eight an hour. I have been there for over three years and have not even gotten reached 8.50, with a raise every new year. We do get bonuses, which is nice. They come from the residents though and that's not fair. They are always short, constant people quitting because of the pay. I love the residents though. It's a great place to start and learn how to serve. Also they take advantage that you are a good worker. If you're a good worker, you will get more work while the worker who is not as good gets payed the same while they do minimal work."
bad,Assisted the elderly residents with any needs they had. Helped them with their tasks of daily living.
bad,"A typical day at work would involve passing medications, transcribing orders on occasion, and supervise home health aide's work performance. I learned how to prioritize care and communicate with physicians addressing resident's health and well being. Management was poor, and communication is lacking. Co-workers were at times unaproachable with inappropriate attitudes. The hardest part was having to work with limited resources. The most enjoyable part of the job was working with the residents and getting to know them and make a difference in their lives"
bad,"The management seems to really genuinely care for the residents and staff...But, to actually make a living and be able to pay bills is impossible. Pay is low and there's no overtime available"
bad,"If you enjoy drama more than you do taking care of people, this is the job for you. In order to get along with everybody, go to work and be willing to get involved in the ""extracurricular activities."" If you don't participate, get ready to be harassed."
bad,"Lack of kitchen staff creates a stressful work environment. The residents can be really picky and give a server a really hard time. The situation there hasn't got better whatsoever. In fact, the care staff have had to start serving the food due to the lack of kitchen staff. Also when I worked there my co-workers were extremely flaky and I found myself having to constantly pull their slack. However, my manager at the time was am amazing person and was more than willing to work around my schedule. Although there is a lot that was wrong with this establishment as far as work environment goes, there are also plenty of really sweet staff who work really hard to meet the needs of the residents."
bad,"This job was my first job and i really enjoyed it, after a while they started asking me if i could work more hours and me being my 16 year old self at the time, said i can work whenever. I was scheduled to work breakfast, lunch,dinner everyday for 2 weeks. It was over a break at least there was no school. But that many hours in one week is illegal, let alone two full weeks, so the middle of the second week i left."
bad,the best part about this job is having the relationship with the residents. The job is fast/ quick so time flies really fast. The job is however exhausting and the staff members always work short staff. The manager has a lot of energy.
bad,"Management at the Sterling House of Lancaster, OH is so sorry. Yes, it is a business. Everyone gets that. But these are human beings! They are our seniors and people's parents that are spending their final days getting the short straw. They have one nurse from 6a-10p and no licensed staff overnight. They get away with this by calling themselves an assisted living facility. It's a total nursing home with many residents with severe dementia, in diapers, can't feed themselves, etc etc etc. I am a nurse with 12 years experienced and I was required to wash all the dishes after dinner, give showers, and do laundry in addition to administering medications, treatments, and documenting assessments on all the residents because the turnover of nurses aides was so high there just wasn't adequate help. It's unbelievable and sad."
bad,"I absolutely loved caring for the residents, building relationships  & learning about their lives. Unfortunately, as with most nursing home/assisted living facilities, we were always short on help. This meant rushed care in order to be able to help everyone not only on my assignment, but my coworkers as well. Team work was a must as many individuals needed the assistance of more than one aide. The physical aspect was very challenging. As we were an assisted living facility, we didn't have mechanical lifts to aid in moving individuals who were unable to assist with moving amd weight bearing. This put the intense strain on the aides which is ultimately why I left."
good,"It’s okay for an extra job or an in between job but not a main job. It’s fast paced and the dining room is chaotic, not due to workers but due to the residents..."
good,"Much multitasking all day, I learned that even with my skills, I am only one person and can not do it all. Alot of empty promises from management, no respect for the diversity in culture and the hardest part of the job was no team work."
good,The best part of my job is helping people. Sitting with them engaging in conversation and laughter and even the tears so they no the are cared abot
good,work started at 6 AM. Get residents out of bed. shower and dress them and bring them to breakfast. Tend to call lights.
good,this place is awful. i would not put my family there. the mangement sucks there. not enough HELP. THE PAY SUCKS
good,At first a great company.. But then you'll realize employees are generally unhappy.. Benefits come around only once a year.. Can trust most co-workers
good,"Busisness office manager very profesional and friendly. Nursing department if you not haitianos don’t waist your time applying there, I felt discriminated because I wasn’t one of them , never give me a permanent schedule, they hire me in June 2019 and I wait almost 4 month for them to give me a least 1 day a week permanent, and I had to resign because I never got it, they  always given me excuses."
good,A great stepping stone. It was nice to care for the elderly. They teach you a lot especially when you are just starting in your career. The entire job teaches you many life skills to carry with you.
good,I loved my job in activities and later I was mean bus drivers. It was a lot of fun to take the residents to go to everything from lunch to shopping to medical appointment to just driving around. I would do the job again in a heart beat.
good,Management is more focused on the financial aspect than patient care. Turn over is high and the nurses are expected to do more and more with less help. Nurses are also expected to care for independent care patients that they know nothing about.
good,Brookdale is a wonderful company to work for here and meridian your management is horrible you have dedicated and longevity workers they want let you make the hours the insurance they have is threw the roof they don’t care about there workers they make all the money and management and ra don’t even get 40 hours and you can be full time it’s sad all they employees looking for work elsewhere are already have second sometimes third jobs
good,Days were busy and long typically working 8-5pm. Hour long breaks were nice. Free meals while working was a plus. Not much room for advancement in my opinion.
good,Over all it can be a good job for the right person but not everyone is meant to do this type of work. I loved working their because of the residents however the management pushed me out when I had a child because they couldn't accommodate me back into the schedule even though I was on FMLA and I was terminated.
good,The resident are great most coworkers were kind. They lack communication and team work skills.  Never enough help. If someone required 2 people for care you could never get anyone else to help you.
good,"Unfortunately in the ten years that I have worked at Brookdale I have seen it go from a ""RESIDENTS FIRST"" property to one that focuses on profits to keep the shareholders happy. I LOVE THE RESIDENTS at Brookdale Carriage Club Providence where I have worked for the past ten years but management sucks and Brookdale only gives 2% raises every year, not nearly enough forcathecwork we have to do!"
good,"Environment overall was great, meet some awesome people working there. You spent most of you shift along in a kitchen, doing prep, preparation and cleaning of food for unit."
good,Are you coming to the great company thinking that you can be promoted and there is career advancement. You will be over looked for someone outside of the company. The managers and directors are condescending everyday. There are minimum perks.
good,"When selected to start as a  caretaker most times the new employee is thrown on to the floor shadowing a employee showing them the ways to assist the residents, overall when it's time for the newer employee to work the assigned floor they are completely lost because of noncomminication from staff and nurses"
good,I loved my job and work in with my residents I just did not agree with them staff and management about how they went about certain situations when it came to resident care or staff.
good,I struggled with leaving because I cared so much for my residents but over all it was the best thing for me to do. The management at Brookdale continued to make poor decisions that was not in the best interest of the clients or staff.
good,"Brookdale in Newberg was a great place if you want a lot of hours. I felt like I was overworked and underpaid. "
good,"Awful for taking time off, had to write down all your days off for an entire month, the month prior. Very fast paced and stressful, constantly getting yelled at by the residents."
good,"Over all this company is ok. The management is the worse.I really enjoyed the residents, they are what made the job worth it.They did not appreciate the employees performance."
good,"management is hardly there "
good,".I have learned how I do not want to treat my employees,  I really enjoy most of my co workers,  Management needs work.....I Love working with the residents"
good,"I don't have an opinion either way."
good,"i loved working here, people were nice and for the most part everyone worked really well with eachother. while working here i have had the oppertunity to join in some of the fun activities they did with there residence. kings games, budweiser factory and many more"
good,"I work only part time and should have 6 days per pay period but most of the time it less and it is my nursing license and almost all residents are at risk for hitting other residents or a fall risk and some other things have been swept under the ""rug"". No benefits unless your full time. Most times short staffed. Pay not great.  You really just take a chance when you walk into work."
good,I love the residents I work with but the management is terrible. There are favorites. I was trained and promised a pay increase which I didn’t see for a month and a half after I was delegated. They do not do disciplinary actions very well either. It’s either get fired or nothing happens. It’s a lot of work expected of you as a med tech with little benefit/pay/reward. I am looking for a better paying job now unfortunately
good,"poor management of scheduling, poor management of staff, on nights where two qualified persons were needed to complete tasks there was only one available."
good,I think the teamwork at the facility could be addressed a lot better than it is and the management could be a lot more professional and understanding them they are.
good,Nice place to work and management is bad.. A lot of attitude and not enough teamwork. The caregivers are lazy at times. . Don’t go there unless you plan to work temporarily.
good,Super busy at times but sometimes it slows down. I have learned a lot and the managment is ok but it can be better. the most enjoyable part of my job is my patients i love them and some of my co workers.
good,It was ok at first but then I started to not like it at all they treat you horrible and the pay is not that good I don't recommend people working there at all
good,It's a good place to work the work is not hard the residents are nice most of them there is no over time so if you need extra money you need to find another job some days you may have to work alone and you may have to do 2-3 different jobs on 1 shift.
good,"Brookdale is in need of better management, better training strategies, and overall better care for the residents. The residents are being taken advantage of and aren't getting the proper attention and care that they are paying for. The lack of staff and staff  training is so bad, that the residents notice, and causes them to stress out. And they don't need that."
good,I worked there for awhile and it was my first time working in an assisted living facility. I quickly fell in love with all them. But then we got a new director and all he!! Broke loose.
good,Work can be stressful. Communication between management and staff is horrible  Pay is extremely for all the responsibilities we have. Enjoy coworkers and residents
good,"I would have 36 apartments of the residents that I would have to do light Housekeeping, laundry, resident showers, toileting assistance, transporting to and from the dinning room and their rooms, then answer any call lights from the other half the building of supposed independent residents if and when they had emergencies. 8 hour days, zero breaks, going non-stop, ZERO help from the other aides or management, lowest amount they could pay us, building poorly maintained, NEVER staffed correctly, hardly ever was a nurse on staff, disregard for our safety, no security on the building"
good,"My residents were wonderful. Some of the associates were freaking awesome. Management lacks communication, they don't try and help you solve any issues that have come up. Now that there is new management she feels as if its ok to replace our staff with her staff from her old facility. Its nothing but drama. If you're not kissing their behinds they don't notice how hard you work or your dedication. As far as career advancement you could forget about it. They rather hire from outside than hire from within."
good,"Worked here for some time. and some of the staff truly care and are awesome with residents. However Mgmt was horribly rude and condescending, to down right cruel."
good,"If your have flexible hours, want over time and want to get into dementia. This is the job for you. Stressful they hire anyone. Management is a joke.."
good,Working with resident could be fun or challenging due there lack off memory loss but we are there to support them and help regain there independence and fill in where they cant help them selfs
good,"Great place to work. Staff turn over very high. Wages are very low."
good,I love the residents but is no team work and the management is not good at all times some time is slow and shorts staff right now and is different from the beginning
good,"I liked working there because of my coworkers, we all got along very well. The management however was lacking. I also felt as if the residents weren't being treated as well as they could've been."
good,"Enjoyed the friendliness of the co-workers and getting to know new patients as well as build rapport with current patients. Environment can be fast paced at times, co-workers worked together as a family as well as a team."
good,"Nice place to work, residents are very nice but everything is unorganized."
good,drama between co workers and managers. unorganized and unfair.
good,I worked 10 or more hours usually a day. If you are not the golden child you travel from one end of town to the other. Frequently see new patients you don’t know.
good,Brookdale is a low-paying business for high maintenance patient care facility. New employees may fill in gap for high employee turnover.Residents are very loving and appreciate thd care they receive.
good,"Residents of the community here are absolutely wonderful! The community is aesthetically pleasing, clean environment, great teamwork among the employees in all depts. However, Management is horrible and extremely lacking in communication and organization. Schedules are posted on a weekly basis, consistent reduction of hours without notice, hours are never consistent from week to week. Bi-Weekly Pay. Benefits are pretty costly and you may find yourself paying out of pocket a great deal of the time. There is no hands on training for those who have never worked in this field before. There is really no room for advancement here and they will not certify you for CNA, Med Tech, etc. Starting pay is not what they say and is extremely low in comparison to what other companies offer for the same position."
good,"Very unorganized, you hardly ever got the time off you wanted/needed when asking a month in advance and being told you would get it. The only thing I missed about working at Brookdale is the residents."
good,Poor management. Wellness director does not do anything other than take breaks and smoke.. Left because there wasn't much I could do anymore without management and wellness director doing their part.. I was on my own and care was awful and dangerous.. Not worth losing a license...sad people pay so much for care they don't get..
good,I was deceived with the whole 32hr per week and 40hr week full time. I was hired for 32 hr weekly and I worked 40 hr week on a 32 hr pay. Management did not treat me fairly and deceived me from day one. Management placed high pressure upon the RNs to get numbers up when we were short staffed. Impossible to meet their expectations. Advocate for yourself!
good,"extremely strenuous work, our ED didn’t care about anything beside for making herself look good. Residents CONSTANTLY ringing callbells for minuscule reasons, they themselves can take care of and absolutely nothing being done about it. our 2nd shift got cut down from 5/4 people to three which is extremely stressful and difficult when 5 call bells go off at once. PICKING UP residents because they won’t use their walkers when getting into bed or they can’t put heir feet in bed, Having to setup and serve the clean then reset up the dining room is ridiculous and a complete waste of"
good,It wasn't my greatest job and sometimes was more stressful then a cooking job should have been. Ijust wasn'ttreated fairly so I had to quit. But hope the best for everyone who works there
good,a lot of back stabbing and and its a struggle to keep your job if your face doesnt fit in they seem nice at first .there is also a huge turn over in employees
good,"Lack of organization, leadership competence is mediocre. scheduling issues and hostile work environment. Training received was not professional, rushed and did not apply to my duties at the job. The job required me to learn everything on my own. assistance was rarely available."
good,Working at Brookdale Senior Living can be so much better if wages were increased so that the average employee can get along in life. It's so stressful working so hard and there's no motivation. The hours leaves a lot to be desired. Wages are very poor
good,"The staff is phenomenal. They do the best they can while overworked and underappreciated by management. If you can handle disorganization, this is the place for you."
good,"Management was not involved and didn't care about the employees"
good,"If it wasn't for the love I had for my residents I would have left long before I did. Management was juvenile. New management came in and it was almost as bad. When it came to co-workers  work ethic it was about 50/50. Shift supervisors who had been there for multiple years would dictate to the managers what needed to be done and those ""orders"" would either be followed blindly or totally ignored. Management only seemed to be concerned with finances. They did not care if we could or should accept certain residents with physical or mental issues that we were not capable of caring for,"
good,"Hard to get breaks.  No team work.  Too much drama, nick picking.  Cant just go to work and do your job.  Very negative environment.  But residents were just loveable.  Most of them."
good,"I felt at home, the carestaff were a tight-knit family. Everyone knew each other's kids, we were a well oiled team. For me working night shift was the best option as I was going to school, but as some people left to further their careers, those holes were not filled. Still to this day they are short staffed. Us night shifters worked 5 nights sometimes 6 a week even doing half shifts because another person was burnt out or a PM shift person needed to go home at 2am. Management took a nosedive in 2014. I stayed on till 2016 but I just got burnt out with no reprieve for too long."
good,Working with dementia patients is a challenge. You have to have patience and always on your toes things can change in a second. Also be compassionate and want to be there for them not just a pay check.
good,Low pay.  Pay us more. We work hard. I don't want to get paid the same as a person at McDonald's. We need more money.  And we need more room. For advancement
good,the residents are fun and enjoyable to talk to and care for. job work and home life balance is terrible im basically home to sleep thats it. management is not good they favor seniority and bully the new people. work load is easy and benafits are good
good,"Large variation of what a work day may consist of."
good,"The job was not easy, but the co-workers were the reason it was fun. The management was more put together than expected. Residents' had fun in this time of their lives. Team was a big positive note. Everyone liked helping each other, but the work compared to the amount paid was unbalanced for most."
good,Working as an aide is a very physically demanding job and with how hard they push you it takes an incredible physical toll on you. The managers seem like they don't care and much rather hide in their offices. They do not follow state rules.
good,"I was enjoying to work there but they made me leave , I was trying to be the best as I could. Your bosses don't appreciate your help I have been asking 3 times for a 4 days vacation and I have never got it . Sadly but true"
good,"Lunch is not readily available, productivity level requirement is too high they will work you to death, they converted from hourly to fixed salary so no more overtime pay and they require you to work at least  1-2 weekdays in a month, again with no overtime pay."
good,"Helping the residents with bathing, grooming, and dressing is how we started the day. Throughout the remainder of it, we helped with other personal care tasks like getting them to and from the bathroom.  Companion duties are those that help keep the residents from feeling lonely.We  had activities set up like cards or looking through old photo albums.We were often so busy with all of their other roles; that we didnt have enough time to dedicate to this one, but they had activity directors who did. We also served breakfast and lunch in a formal dining room setting. We took care of house keeping duties such as washing personal laundry and  linen fixed beds cleaned rooms and threw trash."
good,"A typical day never ended while expected to be on call 24/7 without help. My duties involved maintaining the campus, plus running life safety codes, such as fire drills,. elopement drills, disaster drills, and manage the department."
good,"The community is beautiful with wonderful residents, but unfortunately it is being run by poor management that demands over worked RCA's without appreciation!"
good,"this job gets very stressful .Management is constantly looking to cut costs, like short staffing. The RA working hard and get no appreciation form the management,either local or corporate."
good,I worked here as a kitchen help for 3 months only to be hyped over advancement that never happend and taken advantage of. The kitchen is in shambles and is more of a work in progress than a kitchen on kitchen nightmares. The leaders are stuck in tradition of laziness and are not open to change for the better even when the ideas are served to them on a silver platter. Only work here if you have a disfunctional personality and low ambitions. But hey there's benifits...
good,A typical day at Brookdale went by fast. I was the only nurse and had two aids for 40 plus semi- independent residents. I provided two medication passes on second shift and was the manger of the facility. I learned time managing skills and effective communication techniques. The management was unprofessional and displayed a lack of support for employees. The hardest part of the job was the lack of management. The most enjoyable part of the job was the wonderful residents I got to care for. 
good,Assist people with every day living needs. Its mix of nursing home people and assisted living. Most assisted living places are more than just assisted living needs.
good,"This place show favoritism to workers who work hard, learn all the roles as other title holders. Controls you off of gossip. They don’t show any appreciation."
good,Rewarding job.. I enjoyed helping the resident and families. Each day you are given an opportunity to make a person's day brighter.  The ability to serve the seniors was the most important thing I enjoyed..The meals in the dinner hall were exquisite..the cooks and kitchen manager are the pride of Brookdale.
good,I absolutely love this job. But the pay an hours didnt make me wanna come to work everyday. I did it mostly for the residents but at the end of the day i still have a family to support.
good,"I don't have much to say. I do not have nothing to say about this company; they were always short staff; and management was very poor there. it is all depending on whom your supervisor is. however, there are good supervisor also there and i must say; it is too bad the good site i used to work is been sold out to another company; before I was transfer, i had an excellent experience. It just that everyone is different"
good,"One of the directors was so out if touch that many employees didnt know who he was. Constant turnover. The main director was a nice guy. But everthing was micro managed to a T. If you missed work for sickness, even if you had sick time, it woukd affect your performance. Constsnt changes to the script. I did like the hours."
good,If you work in the kitchen. DO NOT EXPECT WEEKENDS OFF! ANY WEEKENDS! UNLESS YOU REQUEST IT OFF ATLEAST A MONTH PRIOR. The Dietary Director takes off every weekend and have you in there cooking every weekend.
good,"Working with the residents is wonderful and I enjoying growing with them each day. It's really one of the reasons why I still work there. Staff on the other hand, .... Too much drama."
good,My time with Brookdale was where I gained much knowledge I am grateful for the people that took the time to teach me.  The hardest part was the instability that took place there with the amount of clients we would gain and or loose.
good,I would recommend it if u just got your  cnas but if been in it for a while they dont pay well so.......... that my insite on it but it would be good to learn at
good,It’s not a bad place to work I had to deal with working to much and never really being home with my family management wasn’t all that great I had gotten hurt and was on crutches they expected me to work then when my daughter was in the hospital they got mad about it
good,My direct supervisor was always on my back for the smallest things. I was not able to make any decisions for myself and was constantly in his eye for trouble. I am getting older and cannot keep up with all of the young ladies that work in the same department. I feel that I was victimized and pointed out because of my age.
good,The brookdale i worked at was poorly managed. The supervisor was bad evryone that worked there only watched for themselves with a few friendly people there. The residents are ok some mean some are nice theyre ok. The place would be great to work if only they would get rid of few people and added better ones
good,I enjoy the residents but not the managment style. The turn over for the company is very high. They want you to work for pennies on the dollar. There is not a lot of support for the staff
good,"If you need a job, it’s steady and guaranteed hours. Low pay and dispensable staff.  Employees are basic and not valued................................"
good,"A broken company, 2 years behind on yearly assessments.  They have gone through 3 administrators in the year that I worked there. They are not appreciative of the other work you completed.  They expected you to fix their broken company, but at the same time complete the other work that is required.  You end up staying there late hours as a DON. Plus alot of call.  You do not get team work with the other nurse that works with you.  The company expects you to not care for the patients, but complete the paper/computer work, only. I was told by that from the other nurse, that I spent too much time caring for the residents."
good,Decent company to work for. Absolutely no work life balance. No teamwork in my current building. Directors nor managers work together as a team to get things done. Everyone seems to be on their own island.
good,"I wouldn't never place my loved one in this facility.  Never a Rn on shifts, no lpn on each shift. No proper lifts for residents,  poor food, dogs faeces everywhere,  geriatric patients that shouldn't be there. Nurses get attacked my resistance.  Feel very Sorry for the residents that understand what is going on. They feel very unsafe.  An under staffed daily.  Need more pay to get hurt at work."
good,"This was a good job to have in high school. As time progressed, I outgrew the job and it became something that I could earn money from on my breaks from college. Management for the majority of the time caused a stressful work environment and there was too much drama amongst my fellow servers that I was thankful to not be a part of."
good,"when i was interviewed for brookdale and hired i was hired for 7a-3p, 8a-1p, and/or 5p-8p. when i started work i was not put on the schedule for them desired shifts. they through me on to the overnight shift 11p-7a. i sucked it up and tried it nut due to lack of care for my children and medical issues with thy self i had to go to management to request and permission to NOT be put on them shifts. at first it was okay then they took the 30+ hours i had away and were only giving me 15-20 hrs. i was livid and kept asking and requesting more hours and i wasn't being heard or acknowledged so i went to the highest up to get my hours and when i did that i got suspended by scheduler for insubordination for going above her head and getting my 30+ hours. so at that time it wasn't in my best interest anymore so i quit. it was an ongoing problem for 3 months."
good,Working at Brookdale has its pros and cons. You must always be active and know what you’re doing and you should be able to work under pressure. It’s not an easy job but at the end of the day it’s work.
good,"very stressful environment , management extremely rude and disrespectful."
good,I enjoyed the staff. Management consistently changed. There was lack of communication. Favoritism with management. Yearly recognition and Christmas bonus.
good,Upper management needs to offer more incentives and pay. There is not enough training provided so the employees are thrown in to their job; sink or swim.
good,management needs to communicate with each other better. a lot of miscommunication. quite a bit of employee turnover. but loved the residents of the community which is why I stayed son long.
good,"I am looking for a stable company for Assisted Living. My day, Fast pace, great care staff, having fun and laughs with my residents and families. Making sure staff and resident are safe and taken care of."
good,"I liked it, just not the people I had to work with and how unprofessional they were. I think if management handled issues better it would not have been so bad."
good,"I have always enjoyed taking care of people so that was great but be careful who you trust. Focus on work then leave, don't try to befriend anyone they will just disappoint you."
good,"Horrible ED & upper management.?  ED expected other management staff to split her job, so in essence, she did nothing but sit back & take all of the credit."
good,This place lacked in stability. People were always quitting regardless of position or job. The managers rarely lived up to their title. Mine was either in his office all day reading or out shopping at Walmart. I would not recommend this place to anyone seeking full-time employment.
good,typical day of work would consist of dressing showering shaving toileting feeding entertaining or anything else necessary with my residents in order to obtain an accomplished sense of Life towards the end stages. I have learned how to continue my residents Comfort through Comfort measures and coping skills at the end stages of Life management has a very high turnover rate and you might feel brushed aside at some points . what I have found hard was the idea of me getting close to somebody who I will not be seeing within a couple of months. short-staffing had been an issue and schedule changes also. I do enjoy being there as a shoulder to lean on and appreciation from family and residents when doing a great job taking care of their parents in their final days.
good,"I disapproved of value language on the job, disrespectful employees and lack of teamwork hours were unexpected and no competitive pay their we're no breaks no ac so sometimes I was dehydrated"
good,District management is unethical and not interested in the day to day functions of the floor personnel.  Management only cares about money and benefits and not the residents well being and safety of floor personnel.
good,Great residents very sweet and nice I love what I do at Brookdale once you meet the staff they will make you feel right at home friendly and courteous to all guests
good,"Could use better management and incentives to stay longer.  Hopefully in the future, Brookdale will pay their employees better for what they do at the communities."
good,"Emeritus Senior Living merged with Brookdale Senior Living in 2014. I spent 6 years working for Emeritus in many different roles. I was grateful for the opportunity, but once gaining experience, I chose to move on."
good,Management will work with you and allow you to be flexible with your schedule if need be. You have the option to make your time up or use your PTO. Memos are published so that the employees are always in the know about things.
good,"I really enjoy my job, caring for the olderly. It was organized and I really had a good relationship with coworkers. Good working hours. Got Aline with management."
good,Many of the staff members where angry with management not a very good environment for elderly people to be around. Lots of turnover.
good,i loved my job at brookdale but i didn't like the way management did things. no one was held accountable. or they put all the blame on someone for everyone elses mistakes. i loved my residents but they were the only part i like about the job.
good,"Work life balance is horrible they expect a person to work every shift bouncing them around a lot. If you decline then they try to guilt you into working,by saying thing in your interview you  said you are a team player. You are not being a team player now.. stuff like that"
good,As a current employee this company really lacks a good working environment. They choose favoritism over getting things done in a timely and correct manner. They chose not to hire people when they have positions open. If a dishwasher breaks or anything else they wait until it might as well be too late.
good,"Management here sucks. Employees aren't treated with dignity and respect and moral is very, very low here. Communication among staff is not good at all. Accountability is non-existent here. Something needs to be done about it."
good,I haven't found this company to have good communication skills.
good,I loved working with elderly residents with dementia.  They have such a rich history to share and a wealth of experiences to learn from.
good,"Always came in and was never the same, exspet the resident. youd be either cleaning, laundry, kitchen passing meds or sitting one on one with someone. I learnd nothing is always the same. my managment was amazing always making sure I was happy and the resident were taking good care of."
good,G er t rid of hr at the whartford and clear bridgedmpersonnel and you will see a change in that place for the better
good,I have been with this company for some time. Within the past few months we have had a turn over in our regional team. It has become a hostile work environment directed at sales only. The care is great from staff but not encouraged by regional. The micromanagement is nothing less than harassment.
good,"Worst company to work for you are on your own trying to meet your patient needs without support.  "
good,"It was a steady job, but there wasn't much room for advancement. One thing that stood out is that it seems like a revolving door, hardly anyone stays."
good,"very negative environment.  The position was misrepresented"
good,They pay $8.75 an hour and you can get a 5 cent raise after a 9 months or so. It is a good entry level job to help you build some skills for work. However many jobs pay higher than what Brookdale pays so many people leave and find better paying jobs. It is so bad right now that we should have 11 people at work to be fully staffed but we only have 8 people most days.
good,"Monitored and replenished medical supply inventory, facilitating optimal availability for patient care. Collected specimens, monitored vitals and maximized patient comfort."
good,I believe Brookdale could be a wonderful company if not for evil ED's and strategic management setting you up to fail. Corporate will not do anything but back them up.
good,"The DON is a very challenging person to work for and worse if she wasn't directly involved in your hire.  Very quick to accuse, tell and criticize and the opposite for compliments"
good,Don’t pay well and will not increase pay. Require a lot of hours and frequently understaffed. Call offs frequently leading to understaffing again. A lot of drama and talking about people by nursing and mgmt.
good,"I started with Briokdale and I immediately drank the corporate kool aid.  I loved what I did because I knew I was making a difference In the lives of my residents.  I quickly realized that this company was about the dollar and not about making a difference in the lives of their residents.  Budgets were tight,  associates were paid very minimally and expected to work in poor conditions.  They made it sound amazing and quickly the tug was pulled out from underneath you.  Great experience but it took a toll on work life balance!  Beware!"
good,"Management don't know what going on"
good,I truly enjoyed working at this facility. I enjoyed interacting with the residents everyday. When something wasn't right for them I never hesitated to make it right because their smiles made my day.
good,Other than the resident care associate coordinator the management is horrible. The resident care associates are rarely on time. Management does not try to find coverage so forced to work 12 or 16 hour shifts.
good,I enjoyed my time working here because of my love for people and especially the elderly. If you have a passion for helping people this is a wonderful experience.
good,In general Brookdale is a very friendly and comfortable place to work at. When I had first started working there everyone was super welcoming and friendly. Everyone is still that way today. The thing about it is that there can be a lot of drama without it being handled my management for a while. So I’d say management should really step it up. There is always a shortage of associates. Which means a lot of people have to work doubles. There’s also a very big issue at Brookdale which is favoritism. What i mean by that is that people who may work in the office area may think and feel like they’re better than everyone else in any other department. Which obviously makes other associates feel bad about themselves.
good,"The job is a good job but it is unorganized. I love the residents and how open the community is, and I love how they have different activities for the residents"
good,Brookdale was a nice place to work and I am so very great fun for the experience. I would recommend Brookdale to someone who wants to gain the experience as a nurse because any opportunity is a great opportunity.
good,"A routine work environment filled with active duties. "
good,"Its a good job/environment with good benefits, just salary is not good. They work with you and your schedule which is good, and its a good place to work if you like working with the elderly, but every department is under payed."
good,"High stress job working with 40 or more at a time residence. But do enjoy my job. My typical day, set up tables,  I prep to get ready for breakfast to serve juice, coffee hot cereal, and cold cereal, serve prepared breakfast, lynch and dinner, clear table wash dishes clean my area..Take juice, coffee and food to residence for lunch , breakfast and dinner. The hardest part of my job is sometime dealing with unhappy people, I do my best keep them happy. Would really like to work more hours, this job doesnt give enough hours for me."
good,"I worked from 7:30 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. Monday. Tuesday, & Friday. I drove residents to their medical appointments and drove them back home. How very fragile the elderly are. Management seemed oblivious to the needs of their employees. The employees were very nice and cared much for those they served. Loading and securing those residents in wheelchairs. I enjoyed conversing with the residents and their escorts."
good,Over worked and under paid. The turn over is surprising. Lack of care for the aides that work there. Don't follow protocols and you get written up if you try to.
good,Patients were one reason to go everyday. Not enough help on each shift. No RN on night shifts. Weak management.The patients taught us how to put up with working alone and anger management.
good,I worked there over ten years ago and it was a very comfortable enviroment and fast paced. Also too much controversal w/ management. I dont know how it has changed now?
good,"Working at Emeritus was not geared towards group efforts, it was encouraged to work independently of one another, which isn't good while working in an assistant living environment."
good,I am a nursing student and had no opportunity to advance while i was in school. I was a QMAP and caregiver and had many responibilities that the managment did not listen to me when things were not correct or working the way they should be working
good,This place is/was managed poorly. They could not keep any employees there. The place was not operated effectively by maintenance or management. They had to many issues.
good,I told them when I started I wanted days or evenings due to going to college. Instead they made me a double and I worked both mornings and evenings and the only way I could stop is if I wanted my hours cut. But everyone else could work one shift a day and have all their hours.
good,It honestly depends on what rep you work in. Some are good and some aren’t. Some managers are good and some aren’t. Every building is diifferent. We should all be following the same guild lines but some don’t
good,"It was nice working with elderly with their family that there in so much fun."
good,I loved working with the residents. but some of the staff members did not care about the residents and what they wanted.if a resident didn't want a shower or to get out of bed they would make them. management expected you to never get sick and to work all the time.
good,"I enjoyed working here because of the residents and the staff.  I worked a LOT of overtime because at the time I was single with no children, so I was a staff favorite.  There was a ""clique"" culture there, which I avoided.  loved the residents and got along well with the majority of my co-workers.  very low pay, getting called to come in all the time when someone called out, and very low raises that took at LEAST six months to kick in are all the reasons why i left."
good,Medicaid employees are bullies and caddy. Management overlook hostile environments when reported. Everyone should feel safe and want to come to work and not worry if they are going to be bullied on the job. When reported it's over looked.
good,I loved working with and helping all the clients. Due to poor management and communication is the reason I left. If I had a chance to do it all over again with a different management staff I would definately return.
good,Cooking was easy and enjoyable managers were nice and laid back enjoyed going to work ..... but trying to move ahead was not happening so I had to move on and didn't want to
good,"I love working with elderly patients, but didn't like the company itself. They were not very good about showing appreciation for the employees most of the time."
good,I loved my job and the interaction with family and residents at the community. It was the expectations of corporate and all the repetitious reports for regional directors to micro manage staff without having a clue about the families we helped. It is business and money but I feel like the reason they have all the revenue is due to the clients that move loved ones in under duress from situations out of their control. The caring piece is getting lost in corporate America. But on the flip side so many good people are front line staff that really care about the residents and families. I do feel blessed to have had the opportunity to work with so many wonderful individuals.
good,"Brookdale was fun to work at, but the pay was way under what it should have been. All of the work of a CNA was expected but half of the pay was compensated. The hours were daily flexible and they were accommodating with school scheduling as well which was very nice. The residents were very sweet and made working there such a joy!"
good,A typical day was drama filled with constant job duty neglect and failure to complete simple tasks. Everyone was self absorbed and was only worried about themselves and their social lifes.
good,"The corporate philosophy is good. Brookdale offer good compensation and room for advancement. The current Executive Director is difficult to work with, she is difficult to talk to often unreasonable."
good,"I loved the residents here and I hated to leave the company, but the department staff was very harsh, never concerned about the employee and never spoke to you with respect."
good,"loved taking care of the residents and doing whatever they needed of me, and i loved the responsibility along with it. i felt like management wasnt their like they couldve been for the benefit of the residents."
good,"Poor work environment with inadequate staffing to care for residents. Unethical leadership at the corporate level. Poor maintenance of facilities, unless the condition of the property rose to the level of potential fines from the state."
good,"Residents get excellent care by associates. Associates are well taking care of for holidays, meetings this community would go out of their way to provide gifts and meals for associates. Very well deserved the RCA work very hard for minimum pay."
good,The management is not the best. They promise you hours but don't work with you. Management doesn't listen you when something happens. Some of the residents are great and fun to work with some are not.
good,This company was worth a shot but not really a great place to stay for a long time. I feel like all the company cares about is to make money and they don't focus much on the employee's complaints
good,Very large company at which upper management has no idea what is happening on the local basis.  Decisions made across the board whether they are feasible or not.
good,"You will assist the residents with ADL's, help with dining, do light laundry, and cleaning rooms."
good,I enjoyed my residnets and working hard. I usually picked up extra shifts all the time. But the management was not so good. At certain times there was no manager for my department and then when there was one they didn't know what they were doing. So the benefits of that were I had to step up and manage the kitchen at times.
good,"Personal Care Supervisor (CMA)"
good,"Overworked with decent pay. No praise for going the extra mile. Constantly short staffed by nurses and cna's due to high employee turnover, low morale etc.  Managment not big on confidentiality which makes it hard to talk to them despite their ""open door policy"". Rehab unit slowly turning into a nursing home just to get beds full."
good,"I worked mornings , I would come in assist those who needs assistance with dressing, bathing, personal care. I would take the residents down to dine, if needed help out in the dining room with pouring coffee, taking orders, and serving. The RA's also helped with activities. The hardest part of the job is the company allows the residents to age in place, which is fine if the company had all the equipment needed for that transition will go smooth"
good,high stress environment. Good leadership but usually no advancement opportunities.  
good,"As an employee at this emeritus, you had to move very fast, each employee had 30 residents to give meds and was responsible for during their shift, with showers and diraper changes and getting them dressed and also to their meals and activities ..as an employee you ran all day..someone in management was having big problems at home and was bringing it to work, which made the enviroment impossible to function positively"
good,"A typical day at work would involve passing medications, transcribing orders on occasion, and supervises home health aide's work performance. I learned how to prioritize care and communicate with physicians addressing resident's health and well being. Management was poor, communication was not always effective or promoted. Co-workers were friendly and approachable. The hardest part of the job is being unable to work at time with limited resources. The most enjoyable part of the job was working with the residents and getting to know them and make a difference in their lives."
good,It was an ok experience. I loved the clients but management was terrible. They treated me as if I was a child that they could run over and talk to any kind of w
good,Not a bad place to work. Never enough help.  No one works together.  Kitchen is a mess. They pull people out of kitchen to work nursing. And pull nursing to help kitchen.  All about saving money.
good,"The resident appreciate the care that they received from me. I took care of them as if they where my own relative. It was alot of work but i didnt mine doing it, cause that is what i love to do is take care of the elderly, and make them feel comfortable in there last days."
good,The Residents were the best!I loved them dearly.My coworkers were also a pleasure to work with.No drama.Management kept themselves hidden.They were hardly ever there.
good,They fire people for no reasonor tell you  to quit cause they're  firing you  any way. It's  clean and assisted living.the residents are  very happy. The food is safeok.its bomey and safe. Residents  can have a car .
good,"I loved my job. But management is crooked. The ED is very self centered, money hungry and cares about herself only. We had to buy our own supplies most of the time because their ideas of a budget is a joke."
good,Didn’t really care about the residents thoughts. Had many staff members that did not give good care. Third shift employees did not do rounds on residents till 6am.. most of the time so the residents stayed in soiled diapers often.
good,Management was very unorganized and very understaffed. The staffing issue made for a stressfuk work culture and unhealthy work enviroment. The shifts were often longer than scheduled due to call offs
good,My boss was great which made corporate very upset because she didn't follow the norm. The pay was complete garbage. The benefits are terrible high deductibles low coverage. It's ridiculous if you have a family. Ive worked in senior living for a decade this is by far the cheapest and worst benefits ever. This company only takes care of their regionals up. Anyone below is insignificant
good,This is a good place to work if you are wanting to get your foot in the medical field door! You can start off as a personal care aide then after being there for a few months they will send you to classes and allow you to take your state test to become a med tech.
good,Well to begin this facility is NOT assisted living as portrayed by management. One wing is not only long term but hospice. Most the residents sleep on twin sz beds even the residents that should required hospital beds. My back was so sore from bending down at the end of my shift. Most the staff were highly dramatic and loved to tattle for brownie points-and management promoted those behaviors. There was plentyof time to care for the residents but the facility was carried by the few staff that did do their job vs the ones that worked the clock by smoking in the parking lot once management left.
good,they tend to pick favorites. lazy people seem to get recognition while hard workers go un noticed. managers are all nice. nursing staff for the most part is wonderful. not a bad place to work but not a permanent one.
good,"come in at 2pm medtech,i administer meds,set up dining room,answer the door and the phone .serve and clean up dishes.Mangement plays favorites. Hardest part is watching the residents not get quality care. Enjoyable part of the job is taking care of the residents"
good,"Brookdale would be a GREAT company to work for, if the higher management did not overpromise and underdeliver. They are not the best in giving proper compensation to their employees (that for the biggest company in the senior industry). They do have great programs and training. I would recommend Brookdale."
good,Keep in mind that I haven't worked for them for a few years but I did not have positive experiences working for them for the most part.  The management changed a lot when I was working there.  The job itself is fine with mostly ok.  Keeps you busy but the management makes or breaks it.  I have had such bad experiences with my last manager there that I wouldn't recommend working for them unless the management has changed.
good,Everything about interacting with the resident is amazing and families are amazing. I love a fast pace environment and this job has that. The only problem is that waitresses are not allowed tips and there is no room to grow only if you decide to switch departments but sometimes there is so much favoritism that even doing so is impossible. There are many locations around that are paid more than our location which is unfair since its under the same company. The raises are unfair also. I been working there for over 2 years and all i have got is a 10 cent raise. I don't think that the experience of the location is bad is what happens behind the experience is what makes working in Brookdale unfair which is why plenty of people really don't last more than a couple of months or even weeks.
good,"Enjoyed working 6am to 2pm.  Always available shifts to work whether you would like day shift, swing shift or NOC shift.  Enjoyed assisting residents."
good,I liked the commraderie. Enjoyed doing my best for the residents. It should be more affordable for the residents because they deserve the best. Employees deserve so much more for all their hard work and dedication.
good,"I truly loved working at brookdale senior living. The residents made life fine and exciting. Management was, at times, very difficult to handle because they wanted to micromanage constantly, and if they didn't like you, you were not able to grow in the company, no matter how competent."
good,"Nice facility, friendly coworkers, great residents.management could use a little adjusting as far as understanding and patience. Overall nice job if you just go to work do what you’re supposed to and go home."
good,Hard time keeping staff making for a lot of burn out days. Schedule is always changing and asked to work on your days off. Everyone is very nice but there is more care than caregivvers
good,"Its a fast paced environment, learned how to handle multiple tasks"
good,"This is one of the worst places that I have worked. Working night shift I have never been somewhere that all the employees sleep for hours at a time. Even with it being one nurse in the building she sleeps for 4 hrs while people are looking for her. No overtime, low pay for the work that has to be done. My first night working all the employees complained about management and told me I need to make sure I watch my time so that I get paid correct. No supplies for the residents that are needed. Just a horrible experience."
good,"This company is profit driven. The quality of care down is definitely down from when I first started. So many budget cuts. Staff overworked, and not enough for the number of residents."
good,"On NOC shift, cleaned common areas, restrooms. I learned how to balance time with job and residents. Management can be critical, but you learn from it. Co-workers are helpful and friendly, positive help. Hardest part of job, the cleaning. Best part, the residents."
good,"When i worked here, it had a different name. im sure many things had changed in 4 yrs. when i was working there i had the entire 1st floor to myself which was very exhausting and it was too much, other than that residents were very nice and sweet"
good,All of the wait staff were teenagers and just didn’t show up and had a huge lack of respect for the schedules that were made. There was very little disciplinary action taken when people took advantage of our manqgement’s leniency. They had 2 or 3 people in charge of serving 60+ people.
good,"Rewarding. ability to make a marked difference in the lives of a venerable population. I learned how to get what is needed for people who cannot fight for themselves. Upper management is detached and the work place culture tends to be over worked and underpaid. The hardest part of the job is also the best part of the job and that is dealing with people: resident's and family. work/life balance is also a big issue, the job is never done and can take over your life if one is not careful."
good,"No problem with doing with the community, but most of the time you jobs of two different positions but only get paid for your main job. That being the reason why people quit a lot"
good,"I worked in two different departments while with Brookdale. I worked as a receptionist  had communication problems with the full time receptionist. I also worked for the kitchen as a server. the job was hard and fast passed with servers pitted against each other  instead of helping each other  the feel of ""every man for himself"" was the attitude  in the kitchen.because of this  there was a lot of turn over with most people just not coming back to work."
good,"I love taking care of my residents and their families,  the families appreciate everything that you do for their loved ones. I enjoy interacting with the residents."
good,The management was very unorganized.  The staff was not willing to work together.  The pay was not up to what other companies  were paying.  The patients were really great
good,Every day was busy.  Working with residents was enjoyable. When there was time to interact with the residents.  It was always nice to get feedback from the residents about the food that was cooked.
good,Loved working there and the residents were amazing but I worked the night shift and the management was terrible and all over the place and I was a bit older than all of the other coworkers I had and I had complained numerous times of 18 year olds that worked there and would fall asleep or have their boyfriends come in the middle of the night and refuse to answer the call lights and were very rude. Eventually I could not get along with them anymore and management would do nothing and I had to move on. Otherwise I loved the place it was beautiful and I miss the residents dearly
good,"If you work the morning shift, you come in at six in the morning. You set the tables, take the orders, wash the dishes, fold the napkins and do it two more times. At the end, around eight o' clock, you're left to do the dishes, clean the floor, clean the tables, refill the water bottles, and do it all within two hours, regardless of the mess that is left. I learned that I had an overwhelming ability to help people. The management was tough, but fair. The workplace culture was distant at most, I barely knew many of my coworkers. The hardest part of the job was cleaning up at the end of the day on time. The most enjoyable part of the job was seeing the happy faces of the residents when I brought them their orders."
good,I have known this company for over two years now and have seen the employment turn over several times. Very disappointed in the management and their lack of communication and dedication.
good,"No issues, an okay place to work at. Set schedule. Could be very exhausting having to take care 20 residents per shift that means 20 residents wearing ""lifeline necklace"" that can call you at randomly same time to come and help them."
good,"24hr 365 facility. Fast paced with tons of advancement opportunities, under staffed unfortunately. If you have a caring heart you are more than appreciated by residents, however the constant understaffed issue resulted in poor care for the residents who may not be of most urgent care but still needed quality services. I absolutely loved working for the residents and there was never a lack of hours needed to work, many individuals would try and lift your spirit throughout the day. If they were consistently fully staffed I'm sure this location would be much better than my personal experience and of those I worked with. Meals use to be provided free, and now I believe they are provided at a discount. Monthly required trainings."
good,"being with residents all day is so much fun, getting to know them and helping them with daily tasks."
good,"Since I was the 2PM-10PM nurse, there could be extremely stressful situations when I was the only nurse on staff. If my med-tech didn't show up I would be responsible for dispensing medication for 60 residents by myself, up to 80 residents if the memory care nurse didn't show up.  I was hired for this position straight out of school & there were several nights when my med-tech didn't show up and I was left to pass the medications and do treatments myself. I was also under extreme pressure since the evening staff I had wanted a friend of theirs to be hired as the 2-10 nurse and refused to follow my directions.  Management was made aware and I was let go the next day I worked."
good,"The absolute best part of this job was getting to see the residents every single day, they become a part of you. The Resident Care Associates do get used for things they should not be doing.. I personally never complained just kept my mouth shut and continued to work."
good,"The facility is very small containing only about 80 to 100 residents so work can sometimes be slow but is very relaxed for the pace. A typical day is non repetitive and goes by fast. The kitchen closes at 6 so weather morning or afternoon, any kitchen employee will be out at a great time to enjoy the rest of their day."
good,"The residents I cared for were amazing people, but the management there was poorly put together and rarely did anything when we had a problem concerning a dangerous resident."
good,"A typical night at work challenging. I learned a lot about how to properly take care of older people, and how to help elderly who suffered from Dementia and Alzheimer's. Management was alright. The hardest part of the job was trying to help patients who suffered from dementia, and loosing patients. The most enjoyable part was being able to help people, and be a friend to them."
good,experienced workers who help you out when running behind very reliable. its one big happy love and hate family relation but always fun and the residents always come first.
good,"A lot of the employees are negative, not many available hours, required monthly meetings to discuss issues that are probably never going to get fixed and manager is all about money when it comes to the resident care.  Oh and never sign up to work floor shifts, you have to clock out for every 30 minute break which makes a 6 hour shift a 3.5 hour shift."
good,Home health is a relatively new division with Brookdale. They struggle with defining and perfecting this division. There is a high level of turnover company wide.
good,"I work nights so the residents are asleep when my shift start. I check them periodically, wash their clothes, and shower them. I usually do my last round about 5:00 a.m.. I then get them dressed for breakfast, and make up their beds. By that time morning shift is headed to the floor. We do a shift communication, and I am able to proceed to clock out."
good,"Typical day was answering and directing calls.  Making coffee keeping kitchen clean and neat.  Scan documents, upload (using data entry skills) and filing hard copy paperwork.  Management changed 5 times in the time I was there, leaving environment tense since you never knew what the rules were and had very little direction."
good,"Industry standard working conditions for a corporation. Great working with residents, and families. Helping with placement of loved ones in need of assisted living,"
good,"After Brookdale took over Emeritus, our business has gone down hill. I feel as if employees are kept in the dark. Corporate has been breathing down our necks for no reason!"
good,Working for Emeritus gave me a solid foundation in understanding true Marketing. I was able to utilize my Anthropology degree to coordinate with company training to become a success.
good,a typical day at work was assisting residents with all of activities of daily living needs.
good,"Most of the people i work with are fun and caring people. My work day consist of preparing drinks and helping the Cook wherever's necessary, cleaning, dishwashing, and writing temperatures in logs. I've learned that preparation plays an important role in having an efficient and productive day. The most enjoyable part of my job is caring and attending to the needs and wants of our residents."
good,"Asst resident in day to day common activites of home living. Office staff well put together, a mutual understanding between co-workers, time frame to accomplish task, the love and care for our seniors."
good,I loved working for the company since I could switch into different departments and move up. Most of the time management sucks. I hated management based on them believing anything a person would say instead of hearing from all parties. I lost my job based on hear say and due to our relationship being an 'at-will employment'.
good,"I worked with a variety of clients from different culture, economic and geographic backgrounds.  I have the enjoyment of escorted them to the dining facility and assisting them with basic motor functions of eating. I assisted with activities of daily and medication reminders."
good,I would serve food and beverages to the elderly people according to their special diets and I worked with some interesting people. The hardest part of the job was washing all the dishes and finishing on time. The most enjoyable part of the job was getting to know about the residents past life.
good,"Worked in dining services, would serve the retirees. Coworkers consisted of teenagers mostly, adult management."
good,High management turnover
good,I love my co workers! A work place with job security and a pleace to be able to learn.
good,"I enjoyed this job because I love the residents I worked with,also some of my co-workers. The hardest part of this job was working with noone and trying to take care of 60 people on your own and meet there needs.As far as management goes I have no comment.Working there I have learned to be more independent,apreciate my co-workers,and know that no matter how hard you work you can not please everyone.I love the elderly so much!!! They taught me alot at this job,there age range from 70-100plus so they have alot to give if you just listen."
good,very fast pase. you learn about different types of medications and how they effect the residents. Co-workers are very easy to get alone with.The hardest part of the job is getting certain residents to take there medication. The most enjoyable is they tell u little stories about there life.
good,I enjoy working with Brookdale Senior Living enriching the lives of seniors everyday. One of the hardest things I have faced is having to work with those who don't share the same values for Brookdale or the people we serve and are more worried about getting paid at the end of every two weeks.
good,"I loved the culture and helping seniors  I loved my staff and my direct manager however the regional sales manager wasn’t helpful and would always put me and other down  "
good,"you go room to room with the medication cart on whatever floors you have, and pass medications. you have alert charting, diabetics, faxes, and certain things that need to come first. some are early risers and some like to sleep in"
good,"Night shift doesn't always show up to work leaving us short-staffed most of the time and making it hard to complete all of the work assignments by morning. The entire morning care team is unnecessarily rude. They complain about the smallest things, it'll drive you crazy. Not too many team players here."
good,"I worked at brookdale for a year and I love my job, but the job was simply passing meds and would be boring at times. They do have a no call off policy when was a pain to deal with at times when you were sick or had an emergency."
good,I work 2nd shift there.My day is very fast paced from begin to end of day but the residents are amazing they are why I come to work everyday if you enjoy caring for and helping people this is the job for you
good,"None at this time it's ok place to work turn over is not so good. People dont stay very long. The pay is not the best. "
good,"Company has been struggling lately with quarterly earnings, but seems to be turning the corner slowly. The right leadership seems to be in place. When a company struggles, tension is high. But overall, a good place to work."
good,"I enjoyed my employees and working with the residents, Getting to know each and every one of them and there families."
good,"-Management is a revolving door."
good,I worked for 2 Brookdale's the one in Barberton was great but the one in Wooster was awful over worked and under paid it was a rough time. I really enjoyed working with residents at the one in Barberton and I feel as though they were family but Wooster was a whole other story I felt like a stranger in and unwelcome.
good,"I worked there a few years ago and at the time the company had just changed ownership and was suffering with some management issues. This was six years ago, things could be different now."
good,Brrookdale over abuse there employees. Too stressful to work under 12 residents on one shift. Having to care and provide care to all residents. Takinf them to dinn in.
good,"An average day is doing what your job description consists of, while providing customer service to residents. Most of everything you do in this community is to please the residents. The hardest part of the job is always having a ""say yes"" attitude. The most enjoyable part of the job is putting smiles on the residents faces."
good,"Before working there I was employed at Ace Hardware which was more of a laid back job and I was moreso working stock for majority of my time there.. Therefore , Brookdale taught me how to be more structured , punctual , and it enhanced the way I interacted with people. Also, I learned how to work as a team instead of an individual. There were some things I didn't know that was taught to me by my peers that helped me better as a server as well as me using what I know to help others. "
good,"Turnover rate was the highest I've ever seen at any workplace. The management was terrible, the co-workers ranged from lazy do-nothings, to the hardest workers ever. The heart and soul of the whole job was the elderly people who needed care. They made every day a joy and worth every hour spent there."
good,Hardest part is working with a lot of people from a different culture. They don’t want to adhere to company rules and continually fight the system. Also health insurance is very pricey and most people can not afford.
good,"I think that everything was average here, the management was ok. I don’t anything about there benefits because I never had anything with them. I think it’s a lot of work to be doing there."
good,A typical day there is just waiting to be called and get there meds take them to dinner change them if needed replace there trash bags linens i think its called. I learned what i want to do with my life while working there.
good,"Immature Management, co-workers. Kitchen Staff overworked. Bad work ethics. No privacy, no confidentiality with complaints. Game playing. Retaliation among management. Kitchen and all cottages need remodeling. Cost too high for the rate they charge seniors. No compassion for residents."
good,I prefer not to speak about the company. It was just unorganized the director came in whenever she please. New hires didn't have a clue what to do neither did the leads at the time. I wouldn't recommend a love one to this location.
good,"They place was an ok place to work? Loved the residents and there family members, my employees were friendly and helpful and they need new management, management is poor"
good,I believed that I was helping others with their post-acute care needs and helping families place their loved ones in a caring environment. I had the opportunity to work with marketing and clinical staff on a regular basis and to help them understand how we needed to partner with health plans to provide access to care needed by our residents.
good,communication needs improvement  management  at the community level was good but  the corporate people are to far away in Wisconsin or Tennessee very removed from the communities
good,This job is quick and easy but very low hours and pay. You can’t get tips. You got to be very fast .always working no stop. Free food for you. Long breaks in between work
good,"There aren’t many consequences for doing your job well or poorly. It’s what you make of it, but you will typically be asked to do more than one persons worth of work."
good,"it is a good solid job, upward movement has been hindered  though due to lack of vision above.  The company has grown too fast and is now in a stagnant era."
good,very pittaful management sucks very rude to residents and and managements doesnt care bed bugs and nobody will take care of them no matter how many times you mention it
good,"You are expected to answer after hours without any type of compensation while using your personal cell phone. They add different tasks for you to complete all the time on top of what you were hired to do, this makes it difficult for you to be effective and productive on your every day."
good,"Didn't work here for very long, management wasn't that great and they were very short on staff. The residents were very nice though. I don't think I would go bavk to brookdale ."
good,One nurse per shift responsible for many patients. The work environment was not great at the time I was employed with them. Management was fairly good!
good,"I received a great starting salary and ability to work from my home which were 2 of the best things about working at Brookdale.  I will also say that the organization should be proud overall of the excellent care provided to residents at their communities.  My team was a group of solid players.  All of these great things were overshadowed by the most wretchedly evil superior I've had in my 20+ year career.  Lies, inappropriate comments, lead by fear and intimidation, scheming and backstabbing, undermining work, taking credit for others work, favoritism, unethical behavior.  These things were taken to ethics committee by several employees including myself along with others who resigned via exit interviews but absolutely NOTHING was done to her.  I went from a very high functioning SME on my team to total demoralization. "
good,"my time working there was great as far as working with the residents, the staff however was very unfriendly since the day I started to the day I left I always felt unwanted and unappreciated, i was the only new staff in recent years so i was singled out a lot. was promised a position, trained, signed and accepted this position then was not given that pay and put back on the floor as a caregiver, they wanted to give two separate pay rates. I had gone to management multiple times about being singled out and the pay and nothing happened, that is why as much as it killed me to leave the residents i grew to love, I left the job."
good,"They have a hard time keeping good people due to low pay and short staffing,staffing is the biggest problem.no team work every man for himself.im done with this review I don't have anything else to add."
good,"The job is ok,  the managment is a litter out profecional and communicate is very poor with the employee. I like to work with thre resident.and meke them happy and confortable."
good,"Sometimes fun to work"
good,It was an okay place to work they required the workers to provide A1 service with low pay $11.00 you had to pay for your lunch. The residents are  nice some require more attention than others.
good,"love the seniors,learning watching life run its course,like my benefits!hours are cool.need higher pay.need more hands on training.computer training.managemet training"
good,Not everyone has the same work ethic or held to the same standards. Not always having the support from management. Not always having the support to get the needs of residents met. You have to push yourself to get it done.
good,"Didn't get along with the management about the care the residents received. Management was not willing to work with me after getting into a major car accident and needing ""light duty"" work."
good,I absolutely loved the residents I worked with but it was the staff I didn't like. There was no good communication between the coworkers if there was an issue and that always made the problem worse. Everyone was always talking bad about each other and no one liked to work together whatsoever. I worked in the dietary department and there was one coworker who would always yell at me because I didn't do things the same exact way she did. Everyone has their own way of doing things. I didn't do it wrong but it wasn't how she did it. I brought it up to management multiple times and they never once did anything about it.
good,"I would say Brookdale is a pretty laid back facility. It has its pros and cons though. There are days where we are really lucky and fully staffed, when that happens everything is smooth sailing. On other days, it can be very unorganized, employees just not knowing where they are scheduled to be at or employees not showing up at all. That will make for a very hectic day. But in all this  is a very friendly facility that takes care of their people."
good,"Police all properties. Check Maintenance book for problems in building. Meet with Maintenance Director, prep any rooms that need to be painted, repaired and cleaned. Follow direct orders from Maintenance Director. Carpet cleaning hallways. Drive small bus for residents' appointments. Power wash buildings, at times replace air conditioning units in buildings. fire drills, evacuation drills and elopement drills"
good,"The management always seems to be reacting after the fact. A lot of ""no exceptions"" which really made it hard to have a work / life balance. Not paid for mileage if you are PPV. A high quota for FT nurses, 7 patient's a day. You can't give quality care. Company values quantity over quality although they say otherwise."
good,Brookdale Citrus Heights can be a great place to work. If you have a passion for taking care of seniors with Alz/Dementia this is the place for you. But Brookdale as a company needs to care about there employees and not there pockets. They dont realize when they have good staff and thats why they have such a high turn over rate.
good,My experience with working for Brookdale was really good with the exception of them not allowing me to excel into the field I was currently going to school for.
good,Everybody is nice to work with. Very supportive. I have work there for only 5 months and I don't have any regrets. It's just the corporate requirements that is too much.
good,"would probably still be there but the building had no full time positions available. The ingredients i had to use were of a better than decent quality i could really put love into my food and take pride in my work. We had filet mignon at times lobster tails boneless short ribs, The breads which we proofed and baked in house were really delicious."
good,"Poor management is all I have to say. The main reason I left. Benefits were great, as was the pay. There is a reason they paid so well, they can't keep people in the case manager positions."
good,"very quiet , very slow. sometime friendly senior citizens, other times not so much. working as a server, should write everything down if memory is not so good."
good,"I really enjoyed help people I wash residents stuffs also some times I fix theirs clothes when need fix not only wash I bring love to them."
good,"not enough workers to do the job. too much work for the amount getting paid. management not knowledgeable of their role."
good,It was a slower company. Needs to work on treating employees better. Should invest in different staff helping out. Doesn't care if employees are overworked.
good,"A typical day at work always involved something negative from other co-workers who were not happy with their position because of the amount of work that was required. Although there was so much negativity, I still did my job and others jobs because they would just complain about it. The reason I stayed for over a year because of the residents, you get so attached to them. The management at the time was no better than the co-workers who didn't want to be there. They either could not be found, or didn't want to help out their employees. The most enjoyable part of the job was spending time with the residents because at the end of the day, that is all what they wanted, someone to talk to."
good,"Needs better management and better benefits for the employees.  I have worked there since high school, I like the company as a whole. They treat the residents with love and care and are really family oriented."
good,it was not up to my standard i think that they need people with more creative ideas to make the company a more interesting place to work
good,"A typical day at work was showering residents, keeping the facility clean, serving food to residents, cleaning laundry and dealing with incompetent residents. "
good,"This was a good place to work, but under staff. I think if they got their staffing issue under control it would be better. The only thing is if you're working as an LPN there don't plan on advancing, there was no advancement available to me."
good,"with the latest transition, opportunity for advancement have came to a halt. promotions and bonus are unheard of here. Job security, barely."
good,Work orders just keeps coming in to maintenance for the interior and exterior of the residential property.The hardest part of the job; we are short handed a lot of the times with individuals that do not have the skills required to perform the job classification. The enjoyable side of the job is that the day goes by fast when your teaching and training co- workers how to do repairs and accomplish work orders and tasks.
good,"I don't recommend working there.  The place has poor management.The good employees are leaving while the bad ones are kept around. The same issues never get fixed. The problem is really due to the top managers. They aren't fixing the big problems. They are focused on the small little day to day problems. They don't have any real solutions to the overall big problems like employee turnover or low sales. They blame staff when the problem is mulit- faceted and can't be placed on a few people. The building needs more attention and staff morale is very low despite their ""employee appreciation program'.  Some of the staff is running rough shot over others and nothing is being done. They need to take a closer look at the managers before they point the fingers at the employees. Some are really doing a good job but never get recognized. The place needs a lot of work before things can get turned around there. The main goal is the bottom line but they need to look at what is causing them to fail to increase this."
good,"This is a new facility, it beautifully built, but always short staffed, not as bad as some places I've been. The pay is average . I believe it would be a great place if we could get a group of seasoned staff who wanted to work."
good,"I worked at one of the smaller facilities. So as an RA I had to cook and clean, didn't like that. The focus should be on the residents especially the ones with dementia, not the constant cleaning."
good,"*Good working enviroment. micro-management"
good,"I love this work ... that is why I have continued to do it as a volunteer since my husband passed away and I had to move.  The residents care very much for me and daily thank me for all that I do to make the community more inviting.  It has it's problems for sure, but I would move back in a minute if I was able to (rent is too high for me without my husband's income).  This really isn't work for me -- it is purely FUN!"
good,"Come in and count all Narcotic meds in cart, sign off and take keys from morning med tech. Read shift report of what has happened in the previous shift, note any different/new med orders. Fax doctors for requests, write in new orders, make one round to see residents and ask any questions. Hand out duties to the 3-4 resident assistants that work with me. Answer phone calls always, and room pages. Start pre dinner med pass at 4pm to 5pm. Pass dinner and collect plates. Start put downs at 630pm. Start bedtime med pass 715-730pm till around 830pm. Do any paperwork from earlier. Help the one remaining resident assistant who remains with me till 11pm with any duties on the floor, such as, changes, restroom duty, dressing, basic resident assisting. Count with on coming med tech and hand keys over. "
good,The most enjoyable part of the jobs is getting to know the residents. Knowing the Residents and their family members really help the day go by smoothly. The worst part about working there has to be the inconsistent scheduling which only came out and Saturdays.  And the Lack of effort put into fixing and repairing necessary tools to help your work flow run easily.
good,The house was nice however the management lacked caring of residents and because you do not need an stna to work there a lot of staff needed better training to deal with residents that should technically be in a nursing home.
good,Great co workers to work with good at learning and teaching new employees but the lack of management is not good. The lead manager for the facility i was located at was not good with her duties and caring of the residents so i choose to leave the facility.
good,"Brookdale Senior Living, Inc., is a wonderful company to work for.  They seem to appreciate their employees and respect the work that is completed, offer fun food days and incentives to show their appreciation often.  However, the Treasury department in the Milwaukee office needs new management and therefore I do not recommend that particular department for career opportunities.  They expect at least three years before a promotion is even considered, let alone offered.  The pay is good, but not enough for how much work is required to be completed in a very short time frame.  The current manager and supervisor have too much desire to control the little details instead of focusing on the importance of the residents care and happiness, and require too much time to be spent updating them on the jobs you perform in order to pawn it off as their own to the director of the department.  "
good,"General maintenance, fast paced, variety of work, alot of responsibilities. Corporate support is very disjointed, expectations are unrealistic and in chronic state of under staffing, high rate of turn over. Most coworkers are great just trying to make a living which for the most part can be difficult due to the low end salary range. Company trys to sell benefit package to future employees  but neglect to inform them that it is financially out of reach to the majority of employees at $10 HRS. The hardest part of the job is to keep up with the endless State and Govenment regulations and the interferance by management to stay focused on priorety tasks. Many of the builing infrastructures are outdated and in disrepair. BPPV has come a long way to improve overall conditions. The most enjoyable part of Job is to work with seniors, for the most part they are greatful, interesting and direct. No comment on BHP!"
good,A good place to work to gain experience with different cultures and age groups.  You have the opportunity to work in a very challenging atmosphere and learn to adapt to many different situations.
good,Management lacks in communication skills. Some managers are more easy going with staff members they bring into a community than to those that are there prior to their hiring.
good,Not a bad place to work. Great immediate supervisors. Don't like the hours very much. Not the best work life balance
good,Brookdale is a nursing home I did walking rounds passed  medications. I took off doctors orders . I did wound care using wound vacs. I worked 7-3 mon- Friday. I really enjoyed the residents.
good,"Very demanding and challenging position as RNCM working 10-12 hrs per day. Managing home health for a 75 bed AL facility as well as clients in the community within a 20 mile radius has taught me that time mgmt skills are imperitive. Scheduling visits, meetings, phone calls, emails, conference calls, training, administrative tasks and drive time was difficult but necessity bore efficiency in a short time. My co-workers (other RNCMs, LPNs, Therapists, HHA, Facility Staff and Supervisors) are all professionals and team players. We all work together to provide the best possible care for our clients and we help each other when needed. I thoroughly enjoy home health d/t the relationships I developed with long term clients and their families, fellow nurses, and the entire team of devoted and caring professionals I work with."
good,I worked as a manager and for the most part loved the position I was in. The resident's were always so kind and welcoming. Every day was a new challenge that brought the element of surprise. The hardest part of the job was that there was no work/home differentiation and it was difficult to manage unqualified staff without support from upper management.
good,"A typical day at work is setting up meals in a professional manner and listening to music to keep the workflow going."
good,"•	Assist residents with daily activities ensuring quality care"
good,"Management is the worst! There either never there or when there are there bossy and dont know what there talking about! um where have you been all week! and you want to come in here demanding.. i dont think so! they dont care about the residents just how many they get! its all about the money here at emeritus! they only show they care if someone above them is there. i loved my job as a RA only because of my residents they are all blessings and i am very thankful to have gotten to meet most of them and i am thankful for the expeirence i got working with them. coworkers are very cliquy, if someone does not like you they wont help you.. you are not helping me you are helping the resident ahole!! "
good,Worked with some really great people. The feeling that you matter and you make a difference to peoples lives.
good,"I have to say that Brookdale overall had been a decent place to work.  I genuinely enjoyed working with the majority of my other associates, developed friendships in and outside of the workplace and felt that all of the residents were treated with kindness, dignity and respect to be coinciding with their core values.  I did also find that a change in management resulted in some operational changes, espescially with commission plans, but still a quality organization and I would recommend a friend to work there.  I would say that the hardest part of the job is having a new manager in the position that did not have answers to questions that arose.  It would often take weeks, and sometimes months to get an answer, if you were so lucky to get one at all.  However, understanding that I would be the same if I were new in the position.   I have to say that the most enjoyable part of the position was the opportunity to meet and work with the residents who were wonderful historians and created the road map for my generation.  "
good,Great teamwork environment. I worked independently under very stressful deadline constraints and enjoyed the challenge.
good,"Working a noc shift as a Medical Aid. The staff hired is minimal, so if someone leaves, there is uproar. Supervisors do not communicate with one another or staff. There has been no written schedule, so I've been mistakenly called in a panic to come in on my day off."
good,"good work environment, Brookdale has a proactive model for client and staff."
good,"A typical day involved seating and serving anywhere from 4-8 tables in the main dining room from 3-7. Some of the coworkers were enjoyable, however others were extremely drama oriented and liked to start arguments. The management got the job done and made us want to do our job correctly. The hardest part of the job would be the two sections that had the most tables with overlapping times, however the most enjoyable part would be getting to know the people that lived their and hearing stories of their youth. All in all I learned how to balance multiple people's orders at once and provide quick, friendly, and effective service."
good,1.create my daily aging in excel
good,"Fast paced enivornment caring for senior citizens. HElping with activites of daily living serving meals, and administering medications should they need it."
good,"The residents were the biggest upside to this type of job. The downfall is you are there more than you are with your actual family. Especially on holidays, and they were short staffed so if you called out it was kinda a big deal. Some of the management weren't willing to help some of the employees out."
good,"no rewards for extra work, residents are the biggest rewards, varied hours and corporate controlled benchmarks that are not realistic for every community in every area"
good,"The staff was great when i started, but then they started just hiring random people that did not care for the job or to show at least a small effort in their work. I had my own little group of coworkers that i enjoyed working with because their actually did their job. A big problem here was with  management. They never really listened to the advice that was given to them. They still kept employees that called in several times, that got complaints numerous times (not only by staff, residents would complain too). It was sad having to leave this place because it was the first job that i really loved, but it is easy for poor management to ruin that"
good,"It is a ""independent living"" place but there are more and more residents with dementia and Alzheimer's. Just wants your $$, could care less about ppl."
good,"It was ok working their"
good,"It's a very hard day at work Brookdale, from start to finish, also to much turnover. i can't believe that so much confusion that goes on in assistant Living."
good,Great company to work for! Been with them many years!  My concern is their management team makes frequent changes to processes/models often which has had negative effects on employees positions. Job security concerns.
good,"I work in the dining department, and my coworkers are, for the most part, fun to work with. If you're weird then you'll fit right in. However, the management lacks proper leadership skills, especially when it comes to addressing serious concerns."
good,Working there was a bit out of control because of the lack of management control and also not good communication within the company as well as being behind on a lot of paperwork within the administration and management control.
good,Management was excellent with a great staff.  Staff was dependable and were very positive regardless of circumstances or situations. Nurse managers are knowledgeable and set a good example on how a teaam should function.
good,"Its an ok job, stressful at times and short staffed. But I got along with mostly every one and they had a good group of residents. They also are national so you can transfer if you need too."
good,"The don’t treat people with respect, they never have enough staff members. They don’t really don’t care for the residence & are always on their phones and never on time for any of their serving times"
good,My typical day at Brookdale was good I love working with my coworkers and helping the residents. It needed better overheads overall and if it had that it will be a great place to work
good,Their is so much turnover at the lower levels and local managers trying to work their way up the ladder by cutting corners. Hard to feel appreciated by this company.
good,Beautiful facility with great residents.Staff is expected to do a lot.It can be very overwhelming and stressful. Lots of mandatory overtime. Call light volume very high.Can get very crazy at times.
good,"Lots of opportunity to learn industry standards for newcomers to the senior living industry. Number of reports/phone calls took much time away from managing the building and actually being able to focus on what the most important parts of your job should be. Overall, not a bad company to work for..."
good,"For the environment advertised to patient's and their families the employee salaries are non reflective of that culture. Management has a very high expectation of work ethic yet they don't want to compensate. Also lots of favoritism. "
good,"spoke with all staff and residents, conference calls, budget, collaborate with other team members, review budget with leadership team. Culture at Brookdale is good. Working 24/7"
good,Brookdale is a beautiful community. Experiences with the residents are priceless and are rewarding. Compensation is too low for the amount of work you do. Frequent changes in management make staff and residents uneasy. Nice place to work IF you plan on advancing.
good,Biggest complaint about this job is they are understaffed and unorganized.  There is a lack of communication and management can be unapproachable at time.
good,Brookdale has a great mission but with stock prices plummeting oftern the senior level leadership forgets the mission that was written for us as employees.
good,"Very small therapy department to work for, therefore the fellow therapists are close and fraternizing. Management is fair, flexible, understanding, and relaxed."
good,Noticed that there is favoritism there.   That the hard working and the nice people get treated unfairly.  The aides talk behind your back there which is very degrating.
good,"My coworkers are extremely fun to be around, and they care about the residents completely.  There is a high turnover rate of care staff because of the management's inability to be understanding. A co-worker of mine just recently had her mother pass. HER MOTHER. The management kept calling her asking if she could return 4 days after that had happened. She was not ready to return, crying all day and unable to focus, but she returned just because the management in her eyes forced her to."
good,"did not like the way management lied to you. loved my work and co-workers. Was a great company until they changed management.When it was Nurse on Call and not Brookdale it was all about patient care. Then it changed to how much money can be made each month, not about the patients."
good,Great place to work. Unity is key to a productive work day. There is gossip and favorites among staff. If you focus on enriching the residents lives nothing else matters.
good,"I worked as Director of sales and marketing for Brookdale for 12 years.  I will list the pros and cons below..."
good,"Brookdale grew very rapidily with many aquisitions during my employment. The loyalty and attention to long term employees became lost in the transitions. Rapid growth then led to internal audits, loss of census and ultimately reducing overhead by reducing employees."
good,"Was a ok place. Got along with the managers and coworkers. Took care of the residents. Give showers, wash their clothes. Support the highest quality of day to day life"
good,More staffing opportunities and higher pay needed. Excellent activities for residents. Loving staff. good communication between staff...often families and public are invited into community for special events and normal visitation
good,I started off very happy and pleased but as time went on the quality of work diminished. Friendly staff! Should hire more employees seeing as demand is higher than the current supply.
good,Enjoyed working there. Worked with good employees and nice people. Enjoyed Memory Care. Very caring people in this facility. Cleaning this unit was easy. If you needed help  there was no problem.
good,"Brookdale is an average company in my book."
good,It was okay. Not bad but you were pretty much stuck in the position you were in and hardly any raises. There was a lot of drama but it might have just been the one I was working at
good,"I left because it was emotionally stressful, and the senior employees were less than welcoming and very critical. The management was wonderful but the environment could seem cut throat and aggressive at some times"
good,"Great environment, hardest part of the job is balancing work and having a personal life. Having a passion with working with seniors is a plus. Being able to know you helped someone is rewarding."
good,"There seems to always be a lack of structure with management. Very business oriented instead of resident/family oriented. Wages are not the best, but are better than nothing."
good,"Nice environment, fast paced and fun loving atmosphere. My residents taught me early on how to be patient and to look beyond the right now. I love life and my residents."
good,"Overall okay place to work, Staffing is ran by CNAs who tell nurses how and when they can work, if staffing does not like you, you don't get hours point blank, Way too many PRN working full time hours, other PRN get no hours at all, CNAs back talk and tell you no feeling entitled, Environment is great other than that, plenty of supplies, If you can handle being told what to do by CNAs, who make your schedules."
good,Brookdale had a great group of girls to work with. It is a good job if you enjoy not having to be supervised and like the freedom to move around all day instead of sitting at a desk. The residents are kind and easy to get attached  to. The hardest part of the job is when a resident passes away.
good,The upper management didn’t always listen to the lower level management even though they were conveying what the families were saying. It was very stressful working there. The residents and families were fabulous. They kept you going.
good,"Working at Brookdale was a nice experience. Being able to work in different departments was a wonderful opportunity, figuring out what was most interesting to me and with each department having more interaction with the residents"
good,"Great people, fair workplace environment. Often can be disorganised when it comes to proper training and they need to make sure everyone knows all their job tasks and that the job tasks can be realistically achieved in the alotted time."
good,"This place of employment really was a great place to work when I was initially hired. There were a lot of administrative changes and changes to work load and job requirements that were not in the favor of the nurses, however. Management was difficult to work with and appeared flustered and unorganized. Compensation was great prior to changes."
good,Management was horrible they could of did a better job of organizing and getting stuff together half the time they didn't know what was going on kind of lazy too
good,"I love the residents and my co-workers. unfortunately, management micromanages you and sets unreachable standards. quite a few incidences occurred where the good workers are reprimanded for the bad workers' issues."
good,A typical day at Brook dale Senior living Solutions was great working around the senior citizen was hilarious . Working at in this type of environment taught  me how to be more patient with the seniors and also with myself.
good,Training provided; interactive team members; place to learn new business models within a large corporation; always striving to be competitive within the industry
good,"I personally did not like to work at this location, having to change 300+ lb people by myself, while having 19 other patients i had to take care of by myself. I feel terrible for the people who cannot speak for themselves for care that they actually deserve."
good,this place overworked their employees with much to do after hours at home. the manager did nothing to help the employees. not much training for new hires and very different than my other home health positions.
good,The best thing about working for brookdale was being able to spend time with people and getting to know them while they live their lives. That was the absolute best thing that the company has to offer
good,"I love the place . Residents are nice , they treat you like family . Kitchen staff are excellent . Place is quiet and very friendly"
good,"Don't get me wrong it's a great place to train and get experience but few the workers are rude, there are un willing to work with you if they don't know you at all. The pay is low but residents are great. I would not stay here for the long run."
good,"Working at Brookdale can be very stressful at times. It is not a clean place to work, there are bugs everywhere, you can get sick very easily from the residents, but aside from that, it is a fun friendly environment."
good,I learned that no person working for this company is appreciated by management.    The most enjoyable part of my workday was seeing the happiness and smiles on the residents faces when I would walk into their rooms.
good,Great place to work if you keep to yourself. Higher management is rude and will not take responsibility for actions and will blame other staff members. Must document everything via email. Patients are great. Benefit are not great except for scholar ship.
good,"Hard work, time consuming, difficult to balance work and personal life, management team was good to work with but there were some departmental barriers in which made work difficult at times."
good,"Good place to work to gain experience working with the elderly if you're trying to get into the health career. You work with many different personalities and all sorts of situations including medical care, dispensing medications and personal care to the residents."
good,typical was stressful depends on what was going on that day. i learned alot of new things. management doesnt care about their employees. co-workers are easy to get along with. hardest part was i was the only one that cared about the patients. the most enjoyable part of my job was making the patients smile.
good,"I worked here for more or less then 8 months, I did learn a lot and enjoyed my time being there. It was a different environment for me at first that took some time to adjust to, I gained a lot of experience and met a lot of great people but in the end management turned out to be a little to all over the place ."
good,I have to make sure my work area is clean and everything is put into place before I clock out and go home. My co workers would help me if and when I needed it. My hardest part of the job was serving a 160 residents by 5 and cleaning up the dinning room by 6:30. My most enjoyable part is having my co workers help me and getting a smile on all my residents face.
good,Was a job a loved to do. I have never worked a job that I could honestly say I like my job. I was told many times by other employees that it's so nice to have a guy that can fix things right and so fast.
good,"late night cashier and food service worker list of daily duites"
good,Brookdale Senior Living has a good work atmosphere and reliable co-workers and management. A typical day consist of assisting elderly residents with activities for daily living. I learned to boost my patience level and how to work as a team. Management reflect positively on the workers and are there if problems shall arise. The hardest part of the job would truly be nothing if you are willing to be a caregiver. The most enjoyable part of the job would be working and creating personal relationships with the residents.
good,Hardest place i ever worked for. Too many cliques. Management expectations unreasonable. I did the very best I know how for the Home Health Department but didn't seem good enough.
good,"A typical day always went by fast.  The most enjoying part of going to work every day was seeing, visiting and helping residents and families."
good,My job is giving out medication and over seeing staff and residents.I learned many ways to redirect agressive residents.Managment is alright and staff is over roll good you always have some lazy staff at any job.The hardest part of the job is when the men get agitated and is hard some times to redirect if no men care aides are working. Just having fun with the residents doing activites and just talking to them and learning about their lives.
good,I experienced a lot of corruption within the management.  My direct manager was not always in the facility and there was a lack of management at all times.
good,Brookdale is okay job to start and put your foot into the floor but its an good opportunity to know how it feels in the Medical field.
good,"I find that with being a director in any place, you should be compensated for saving the company lots of money"
good,"i come in and start hot cereal and cook bacon. I fill up the steam table with water. I make the breakfast list on the menu, and start puree food. Dish out the plates and do short orders. Start cleaning up about 8am. Start cooking off the soup and the meat for lunch, and the starch and vegetables too. I will do puree food for lunch, will help wash pots and pans when have time. Take a lunch before 11am. dish out food for lunch and do short orders. Clean up from lunch and wash the pans. Leave after that is done and the temp logs are done."
good,It was a great first job for me. It was ok while I was there. I have nothing else to say.
good,"A good place to work but you will know you are working for a major company. The resident's best interest does not always come first, if ever."
good,"My regular office hours were 8-5.  Except the 2 nights a week that I was required to help serve supper, when I left around 6.  There was much work inside and outside of the building to be done.  The atmosphere between the workers could have been much more wholesome.  The management was many times unprofessional and stressed out.  The entire region found that many times the monthly expectations were unrealistic. The most enjoyable part of the job was when we would host an event and people from the community would come in to take tours and learn more about our services."
good,"On Call 24/7  problem solving,"
good,Great place to work with excellent employee benefits package
good,"I enjoy the residents, but new manangment and budget cuts force me to look for a new job"
good,"I worked for Brookdale for almost 15 years - through bankruptcy, acquiisitions, mergers, etc. Saw many many changes. Overall I always loved Brookdale - but it depends on your department and manager. They try to incorporate a strong culture, but it is not across the board. They struggle and it truly depends on your manager/department. It can be a great place to work - affect the lives of seniors which is awesome - but it also can be a really tough place to work. Just be sure to ask enough questions and go with your gut as to the supervisor. They do a great job with communication, and are working on being a great place to work - they just have a lot of work to do yet."
good,Provides a home-like environment for the residents with Alzeimers who live there.
good,The place  was good to work in giving patient care poor communication with employees working together as a team player and supervisor lack of communication.their benefits was okay.
good,"It was ok I didn’t like working there. Work was ok, some the  employees are lazy and they do want, and I did like that other wise working there was ok I guess."
good,"Nice place  to work, can use more staff across the board. Teamwork is good when enough staff in place. Nursing is very compassionate job which requires more nurses to be well effective."
good,"Work was demanding working with residents. Also hours were erratic but I enjoyed my experience there over all. I would wake residents up, get them ready for the day. Take them to and from meals and bathed them when needed. My co-workers came from all different backgrounds and there was some tension on how thing were done opposed to how they should have been done. In then end, I kept my distance and did my job to the best off my ability."
good,"I liked most of my co-workers, especially some of the managers. My least favorite people were also managers. My job doesn't exist anymore. I think it's broken up into a regular C.N.A and a driver, whose only responsibility is to drive."
good,"I like Brookdale, the residents are sweet and the other employees are great to get alone with, but to be honest, CNAs are over worked and underpaid there."
good,"At Brookdale Senior Living Solutions, we, the Servers (waiters/waitresses), wait and serve food and drinks to elder residents in the dining areas. We also provide room service for our residents where we serve the food directly to their apartment doors."
good,"Technically a little behind the curve.  Management isn't clear about goals, direction.  Possible changes in leadership and business directions, could result in job turnover."
good,"Find good people to work with, and this is a great job. Very rewarding and you become family with those around you. Management needs improvement. Pay is not the best."
good,It was a good company to work for I learned a lot. I appreciate the opportunity they gave me. The residents were great and I got along with the old staff.
good,There are good days and bad days. The company is understaffed and kneeds more help. For the work that is being performed on a daily I feel like they don't pay you enough money. The fun part can be talking with the residents and learning about some of there last experience in the work field and about there family.
good,Love working with the elderly! Due to my work restrictions certain jobs outside my title could no longer perform. However I enjoyed the online classes that they kept us updated on safety and hazardous and first aid also adding better ways to care for a senior citizen.
good,". “If you love your work, if you enjoy it, you're already a success.” “You have to love what you do, to give your best.” “If you don't do what you love, you will never love what you do."
good,a typical day is alright. pretty busy. youre basically a waitress that also whipes butts and puts people to bed. you serve meals and clean up after while getting everyone to bed and ect. also the next oncoming shift was ALWAYS late
good,The pay was okay but my hours were good because there weren’t many servers   Then my boss got five new servers and that messed up my schedule and I need to make enough money to cover a car payment and I currently can’t do that now
good,"overall I felt like I was doing too much work, for the amount of money I got paid. I felt like my skills and experience wasn't taken serious enough to have gotten paid more. Our dining room director never really made us feel like we were doing a good job, and I felt like I couldn't go to him for anything."
good,"decent place to work. Senior care facility in fort wayne. The people are nice management is good. Ive been with them since july. menus are simple, the residents are all friendly"
good,Would rather not comment as management was not appropriate / had several roles with Brookdale in my 10 year tenure/ was denied Director of Marketing position even though my experience proved me to be an excellent candidate
good,Enjoyed working at this business but the company made cuts and the branch was shut down.  Unfortunately it was one of the better health care agencies I have worked for.
good,"Brookdale as a company is not doing well starting with the upper management.  Individual communities will vary depending on the Executive Director.  Network selling is not working and does not give the sales team the best incentive for growing the company.  The company as a whole as forgotten what made it great... the staff at the individual communities.  They are not stepping up to take care of those people and good people are leaving as a result.  Until the address what upper management is doing and how the company is being run, starting at the corporate office, Brookdale will struggle."
good,So far so good the residents are not all bad my co workers are deff differently unique managers are easy to talk to and very understanding. Kitchen crew are all down to earth
good,I made all meals for senior citizens who had Alzhiemers. May of the residents didn't know who or where they were most of the time. They wandered around.  You really need to be a person that has a lot of empathy for people with this disease.
good,"Have patience, that's all I can say is have patience. Keep to yourself, don't listen to gossip, try to stay away from it. Nice place to work some of the people there are nice."
good,"Admistrate medication, I have learned that patience is the key to making every resident comfortable. Management is very understanding. Working here is fun and you never have a dull moment. Hardest part of the job is losing a resident to this disease alzheimer's esp when your attached them.The most enjoyable part of my job is making a resident smile and  giving them the confidence that they once had when they were younger"
good,"Spending time with my residents was always the best part of my day. The job was stressful, but extremely rewarding. A lot of cultural learning opportuities with residents and families."
good,"Low pay, raises are pathetic for regular staff but management gets significant bonus when the community scores high on satisfaction surveys, paid time off is pathetic, accrue one day a month but then are made to feel guilty when we put in request to take it.  Sick time or vacation, it doesn’t matter it’s all the same.  Only 5 paid federal holidays.   Management more concerned about outward appearances than quality of life for residents.  Marketing is completely out of touch-they overpromise services and low ball costs for prospects and then staff has to handle complaints and try to make residents happy after they move in.  hourly employees are expected to be on call 24/7 and respond to salaried managers calls and texts when off the clock.  Not professional."
good,"it has enhanced my skills in Oasis Review, Coding and care management of patients, and it has improved my interpersonal relationship with other disciplines to include therapists, case mangers, staff and supervisors. The experience was rewarding."
good,"Acquisition of Emeritus and exit of key upper level managers resulted in the company being unfairly criticized by analysts and devaluation of stock prices.  "
good,As any healthcare has its ups and downs sometimes overtime sometimes not everyone treated equal new employees get treated the same as the older employee
good,"I really enjoy my Job at Brookdale Senior Living,  the residents are amazing people and its a great feeling knowing that you do make a difference in the lives that you touch."
good,"Excited for this new Journey. However i am not sure i will be able to keep this position due to the amout they pay for CNA /resident care."
good,"It's a overall good place to work many opportunities for overtime! However the place did have some upper management employees with racist habits. And the supervisor did play the ""favoritism"" card."
good,I enjoyed learning and caring about the residence as I assisted them with ADLs. They will always teach you something if you are willing to learn. I loved them all
good,"Good food hot and ready for the residents Provide then with pool theater organization good breakfast 3 meal a day "
good,"I have nothing to say, It was not managed well would not advise friends to work there. Overworked underpaid, not appreciated, that is all I have to say"
good,"It wasn't a bad job at all. I really loved talking and working with some of the people there. but management was bad lack of communication plus we were super busy one day and the manager was playing a game on her phone as we walked round with our heads cut off. And another was maybe its just me but the manager would talk about  her employees and once I overheard her while she was talking with another server that I was to slow... ive only been there for probably 2 weeks. I was trying my hardest giving all that ive got and it just wasn't great to them(I have a bad wrist , shin splints and knees lol got to make a living).. in other words don't talk about your servers behind their back really shoots the confidents bar down. but other then all that drama mama residents were amazing <3"
good,"A fun place to work at, secured job, easy pace and well structureted, excellent team work and never a conflict between employees, all of them team players and always willing to help each other."
good,The leader ship is poor. Everything you learn you learn on your own. Crabs in a bucket when it comes to lower level management. Kind of hard to climb into a higher position. You have to know your stuff.
good,"i was hired as a med-tech but most of the time I was on the floor as a caregiver. but i enjoyed working as both. breakfast, lunch and dinner are free for the employees."
good,Wasnt under the best management while I worked there but loved all of my clients. Understaffed in the department I eas in. Definitely would still give it a chance. It is under new management.
good,"Staff is so friendly and always willing to help. There's a lot of training! But all the training keeps employees sharp and informed. Great pay. Great benefits. They don't have sick leave but they do have PTO so if u get sick you will be dipping into your ""vacation time"". Overall nice place to work."
good,For the job you do there's very little pay. The employee togetherness isn't really there. I got some experience dealing with residence because I was in school for RN though.
good,I really enjoyed working for this company. I was there for 4 years. The experience was good. Staff members worked together as a team. The facility is pretty big on the inside. Could use some work around the building.
good,Too much turn over burn out of employees.  No room for advancement growth in company .I loved working with the residents- putting a smile on their face. I feel we should always treat everyone as we would l8ke to be treated - our lives can change in the blink of an eye. Downfall - death if resident .
good,"I have learned a lot about management, working for big corporations. People I worked with were very friendly. Most enjoyable was working with the residents."
good,Big company focused on sales. A good manager is very important. Also the culture and ethics of the office determine your success. My office had these values.
good,"The overall work enviroment can be good or bad. It really depends on management, but sometimes the corporate red tape can make things more difficult then necessarry"
good,Working there was great it's just that some times we get really stressed out about the manager and what ever you do don't trust anyone there if you have something about someone to say or any concern
good,It is Alzheimer's & Dementia care so it can be hard at times. Of course alot of physical labor. But at times it is rewarding because of the residents; management was okay. High turn over rate like most facilities. Good opportunities to work over time if they are need of another hand. They to tend to overload the CNA's only cause they are almost always short staffed. I did learn alot about this type of care. So it was a good experience to have under my belt. The nurses always left after dinner (around 6 pm) and never really responded when we needed to call them. They treated the CNA's decently. Once in a blue moon we got a reward or treat.
good,"Culture needs to loosen up."
good,"I got report from the shift before me,  and then would serve a meal. I assisted them with their daily activities or whatever they might need. Management was good. Worst part of job was losing a resident, best part was learning something new everyday."
good,"When I was there it was mostly young people due to the pay and and it was a simple job if you were on top of it. It was easy for me but the problem came from some of my coworkers, they would work so slowly and not care for others work space and just leave it messy even thought they know we just cleaned said area. The management sucked, they didn't know what they were doing running that place especially the kitchen."
good,"Polite and friendly staff, good environment, good meals for residents, pay could be better, great client activities and very accommodating to residents' families."
good,"Brookdale didn't show employee appreciation. They only recognized 6 holidays, the health insurance was mediocre. Facility was clean. Staffing was appropriate. Workload was manageable."
good,Its a good company to work for but i dont luke you gotta find on corverage to be off emergency sitation they not supported enough for or concern about other people well being.
good,Good management at the time and very flexibility. I did enjoy working for this company. Positivity environment and teamwork. Management cares about their employees.
good,i enjoyed the residents more then anything and getting to do activity with them it was hard to take time needed for appointment for my kids because i could have earn sick time or vacation till after a year
good,Hard work for a great goal. Many corporate systems in place to assist with daily tasks. Some difficulties in place regarding Coporate affiliates and their ability to connect with employees in a meaningful and supportive way. I don’t think this is indicative of Brookdale as a whole but rather if this particular building as it has a history of difficulties. Applicants to this building should come in the door with a lot of experience and a strong outgoing personality.
good,ok company boss was mean staff was out of control just a mess with all staffing in all areas of this particular location all the other locations are fine.
good,"I was the Receptionist for this former Assisted Living Facility.  My favorite part of the job was just being there for the residents if they needed someone to talk to."
good,"My job was amazing I loved what I did . Everyday was wonderful, I got so much joy from the residents that lived their  and there families. They became family . The management was just not on one accord with each other ."
good,"Typical entry level nursing job. Management cares about employees and residents! Hours can be difficult to manage at times due to turn over. Otherwise, a good place to work for entry level nurses."
good,Was an ok company to work for. Benefits were good. This was a start out company for me and I performed well there. Happy for the experience............
good,"It's a great place to start while being in school. Managers would try to make your schedule work around school and priorities. You get to serve the same residents you would see everyday, and learn a lot from them. You get to interact closely with them. Those are the things that I enjoy the most."
good,it was a good place to work residents there were all so sweet. the only thing was they didn't want to pay the right amount for all the things you would do.
good,"patient to nurse ratio was to high for the acuity of care they were to provide, more staff would have made this a great place to work, it was beautiful but the emphasis should have been on patient care"
good,Typical day was busy prepping food and cleaning. What i learned was how to prepare food in an assisted living setting. The hardest part of the job was learning all the different diets. The most enjoyable part was cooking for the residents.
good,A Great Place that taught me a lot of Culinary and Different Diets learning more about presentation of food also staying in budget and and learning the correct way in keeping kitchen in good standards with health Department
good,I am by no means in any mood to actually do this review I enjoyed my time there I was fired for unjust reason based on a biased opinion and that is all I have to say about this company
good,they pay well if you are willing to devote your life to them and give up all of your extra curricular activities they almost cost me my marriage and cost me a lot of my health
good,"It was hard work and expectations are high, but management was respectful and inclusive.  Lots of brainstorming and collaborative efforts.    Some Regionals were bullies and management allowed this to go on after many reports to our hotline.  They should act sooner and care more about the building employees."
good,"It’s hard most of the time because we are always so short staffed, it’s physically draining and very fast paced. Most of the people there are really nice but sometimes the residents are very rude and impatient. It has good pay although raises and bonuses aren’t great. Overall good place to start."
good,"The stars were based on the company not the community I was responsible for. The company grew very fast and corporate associates had no time to fulfill the mission. We had frequent request for information that was available in a corporate system that the requester had access to. We would get at times multiple request from different disciplines for the same information. When a problem was identified at some communities  corporate would create a system or solution and apply to all communities instead of keeping it their tool box to use where needed. This resulted in frequent roll out conference calls related to roll outs forms etc."
good,It is a great place to work for. The people are great and the families are very involved. Pay was good and their benifits are good. I enjoyed having everyother weekend off so that I could enjoy life.
good,There weren't enough CNAs doing the job in the building.  The resident's required more care. There should have been better supervision and more of a division of duties.
good,The most enjoyable part of the job are the residents. The hardest part of the job is the residents leaving the community. More employees need compassion for the elderly.
good,"I loved my job at Brookdale. My coworkers on my shift got alone really well, we enjoyed helping the residents with what they needed while also having fun with them at the same time."
good,"Everything was good there until the GM that hired me left the community. New Management changed the workplace culture, wanting instant changes to occur."
good,"Salary and mileage are good, management seems disorganized, need to hire more clinicians, staff is generally pretty easy to work with, decent 401(k) matching, good health insurance"
good,its decent and has a minimum range of assistance need for certain residents. they require a lot for med techs when it comes to their responsibilities.
good,"Overworked due to the lack of organization, constantly under-going change in management. The residents are great and make the job worth it, but the culture is slacking,"
good,Brookdale was a good place to work temporary or part time.  There is no room for growth within the facility.  The residents were a pleasure.  Need more opportunities and training for caregivers.
good,I started out loving my employment with this company and was based in one county .  Then they changed from pay-per-point and mileage to Salary. They do not pay mileage if you are full time it is all included in your salary. The the hours became longer. I would spend 8 hours in the field and then another 2-4 hours at home.  I was hired for one area and then was being floated to 5 different counties in one day.  On-Call was not used for emergency purposes.  Your week of on-call you would work your normally scheduled day hours and then work after hours to open new cases that were non-emergent or provide care that was non-emergent. Would average 500 miles per week for the on-call week. The company is about its budget and not its employees.
good,"Good company to work for, wish other employees had a pasion for the elderly, or found different jobs. Other than this, everyone was pretty easy to get along with."
good,"I would not recommend this job for a nurse, because the pay could be much more considering cost of living and the fact that you are a nurse. A nurse should not be making the same salary as a deli worker at Kroger."
good,At brookdale assisted living our main objective was to make sure our residents were being taken care of and make them feel like they were at home to be more comfortable
good,It a good enivormemt to work their. U have friendly people their .Some respect u and families is nice kinda it not a horrible to work their. U caring for da dying resident and their families.
good,"There was always something new to do.  Never a boring day. We had 100+ residents which kept me , as a nurse and care coordinator, very busy. Overall the experience was positive, but often I found it stressful to complete all my duties to my satisfaction within the time frame of my shifts.  Being one nurse to manage 100+ residents was quite the challange."
good,Making sure the residents are ready for the day. The management staff is okay. The workplace is very friendly and filed with families everyday. Making the residents happy.
good,"A typical day at Brookdale ."
good,Honestly some parts were bad and some were good. They could definetly pay more for taking care of old people but that wont happen any time soon. they need better workers
good,"i loved my residence at this job, i loved the fact geting to help people and knowing they appreciated it,it was a nice place to work if you are not cna certified."
good,"Management does not communicate well for scheduling work"
good,seemed to have time to do everything but what was required of a maintenance man meaning you had to focus more on care for the residence which is not a maintenance man job also spent a tremendous job at meetings
good,"Typically I did reception, I learned Customer service, HR, Marketing, and accounting. The day to day was pretty repetitive but like I said the residents are the reason I worked there"
good,"I am on Am Shift, we need to get them up, do ADL'S, assist on their meal times."
good,Brookdale has a diversity of culture and everyone gets along. The staff work as a team and care for our residents to the fullest. A typical day at work is getting residents engaged with quality activities and keeping them engaged at all times.
good,I enjoy working for Brookdale. The only complaint that i had was their attendance policy.  I didnt agree with the finding a fellow coworker to cover your shift even if you had a doctors note for the flu our even if you were ion the hospital.  I didnt like that even if you couldn't find someone to cover you were expected to come in regardless.  I personally don't agree.. if i have the flu (for example)  in not going to come in.  But that's me.  They need to lighten up a bit on the policy.  But it's understandable why they do it.
good,an ok place to work  fast paced and cold have had a competitive salary with more benefits management was ok but could improve more if they had an open door policy where we could voice our opinions
good,Excellent work place. Patient were very happy to have therapy and our services were well received. Very supportive staff and vey patient focused. They also provided free meals the staff which was a happy bonus.
good,STNA work is a fast paced and physically demanding job but the nurses and employers were very nice. I worked first shift and there were always three STNAs
good,Its is not a bad place to work. They really need to pay more and more people would be happy. To work for them. We work really hard.  And we deserve better pAy
good,"I was just a part time worker at BrookDale in the evening."
good,I've been working with this company for over 5 years and I like my job alot. But it's time for me to grow and expand my knowledge and skill with other wonderful company. Brookdale is a very friendly place of work. The management and staff are nice and I like to work with them. I definitely gonna miss the people and Brookdale.
good,"The residents were nice and the employees are fun to work with, but they changed management and the placed suffered. I enjoyed the bonuses you got at the end of the year"
good,"Must be goal oriented, able to keep up in fast paced setting and compassionate. Mentally you have to realize it isn't just a job it's people's lives at stake."
good,I choose not to rate this company they have their pros and cons and at this time I choose not to disclose any information about my time at Brookdale Chestnut Hill.
good,"Provided direct care to residents, including, but not limited to dressing, bathroom, bathing, eating assistance, medication administration, and laundry and housekeeping services."
good,It's good if you need a quick job. I would not recommend trying to make it a career unless you work in management. The people are usually willing to help you advance.
good,I love working with my residents but I feel as tho management could be a little better but overall it's pretty good job and I enjoy working here for the most part
good,Even though my co workers for not professionalism and about serious patient care like myself. I still enjoyed the job. And absolutely love patient care!
good,"Overall, a good place to work. Nice flexibility. Overall, staff is helpful and works together nicely. It is a for profit company which is important to consider"
good,I found Emeritus a great place to work.  It was a laid back atmosphere while still providing quality care to the residents. Coworkers were amazing to work with and made shift go by smoothly
good,Brookdale has many wonderful residents who will brighten the toughest days. The people I've worked with are fun and easy to get along with and to work with. Most of the management is easy to approach and to talk to.
good,"Perfect for students but pay is inadequate. There is also a high turnover rate since most of the time, caregiving and dietary departments do not have enough people scheduled to cover the work load effectively."
good,"As an activities assistant, I have scheduled activities all day long.  Sometimes I have to change things because the residents do not always want to do what is on the activities calendar.  I have worked with both assisted living and memory care residents.  I love working with all the residents and making them happy, however, that is also the hardest part of the job.  I enjoy going on outings with the residents and seeing them having fun."
good,"Good experience for me, and met many good people, both co workers and residents. Like most places, you'd have a negative person, but over all I loved my residents and worked well with everyone there."
good,As of late there seems to be constant changes happening with management which can get frustrating. the Co workers are all great most of us have been here for years which says a lot.but the yearly raises are poor considering the cost of living
good,"Brookdale Senior Living Solutions started as being a daunting place to serve at despite the seemingly simple requirements in the position of being a server. Overtime, mistakes that I performed were corrected and allowed me to be one of the most favored servers at the Southside department for food services."
good,"The job is okay, the thing is that one has to be in a fast pace once you began to serve the residents and if you do not it will be difficult to start."
good,"I was a fine place to work; however, I had no problems leaving when I was in nursing school. I felt like employees did not want to work together, staff took their patient load and that was it."
good,"Large company, great benefits. Does have a medicaid license and does a great job supporting our seniors. Location is awesome for business. near airport and on busy street for easy access."
good,I enjoy working there it a very good working environment to be. My work day are productive and fun. I would recommend that job to everyone. I work from morning to night.
good,I wish the company would pay their employees more money. The job descriptions are completely different from what you are doing. What I did like about the company was the environment of people and working with the seniors.
good,"It was a fun place to work. management was ok, the hardest part of the job was just me working the night shift but other than that it was fine. The most enjoyable part was my coworkers and my nurses."
good,Each day at Brookdale had different challenges. I got to know the staff and residents really well. I also developed many different server and cleaning skills to apply in life.
good,"I have not worked for them for some quite time, however, I can comment about my experience before they became Brookdale. This place is large and just 3 CNA's are not going to cut it. The CNA to resident ratio is ridiculous."
good,"Corporate work environment,Flexible hours, Room for advancement, Work from home positions, Café in building. Hardest part of the job would be learning the different lines of business and all the different systems and spreadsheet used."
good,I'm always talking and asking them about what was there lifestyle was like. they are always talking to someone you will never be bored having conversation with them.
good,I absolutely loved working at Emeritus! It was a great company! There was a lot.of structure for both caregivers and residents. What I loved the most about working at Emeritus were the wonderful friendships I developed with my residents. I enjoyed doing activities with my residents like playing Bingo and doing Memory Jogging exercises. I worked in the Memory Care Unit so we did extra activities. I enjoyed singing and Reading to my residents.  I also liked the fact that Emeritus really made sure that thier staff was trained.
good,Healthcare Management is terrible. they pick favorites and are rude. The residents are great and overall its an ok place to work. Brookdale as a whole is great but Cypress is meh
good,"Beautiful place to work and probably once of the ""nicest"" SNF/Rehab in the city; however, management was far from helpful, very political, and always seemed to punish the good workers and let the lazy walk all over everyone due to their seniority."
good,"Could be rewarding, could be stressful working with people with dementia or co-workers that were unhappy. Low pay at the time, only enough to reach minimum wage, but some healthcare options."
good,"A lot of management turnover, seemed like every week a new person in chain of command. I did like employees, and residents were good to get to know. Facility was undergoing remodeling, it needed it"
good,Nice place to work. Love the passion to helping people. The residents teach you things and make it fun. It was a nice place to work.
good,"This is a growing office, with alot of turn over. New processes are places quite frequently. Great place to work if you love change!"
good,I liked working graveyard at Emeritus due to the workload was a lot different. I enjoyed watching over the residents and providing quality care for them. The hardest thing about the work there was management. They never understood what it was like to be in our shoes.
good,I enjoyed the people I worked with and exceeded great quality customer care service during the first year. How every it reached to a point after the new company ( Brookdale ) took over they brought a new way of making the schedule which was every hard for us. I felt like I will not reached my full potential and I was no longer challenged
good,"Helping the residents get ready for the day. Helping with bathing, feeding, housekeeping, and everything to do with everyday living"
good,A great place to work. A day at work involves greeting residents making sure they are doing good. I learned how to take care of people in a nice manner and to pay close attention to your environment. the hardest part of the job is lifting the residents and the enjoyable part of the job is seeing the smile on the residents faces as well as their families faces. The bosses have a lot of work to do daily as far as dealing with their people skills and they listen to the employees and the issues they have with one another as well as the residents.
good,"This job offered the opportunity to learn the Home Health and Outpatient process from start to finish and collaborate with team members to bring service to the residents. I was able to work with a team of therapists on a daily basis. The hardest part of the job was the excessive documentation, the easiest part was working with the residents."
good,Its a great company. I would like to have a better insurance for me and my family. Also wants to grow and get better pay as well.
good,"Co-workers and management needs to work on communication."
good,"Seems like the company grew too big, too fast.  They forgot about their employees when they merged.  Raises are few and far between and working on holidays is crazy.  Managers take action before investigating...too late to say ""my bad"" when the damage has been done.  If you kiss butt you get what you want.  If you don't, well then you get ""let go"" for ridiculous reasons."
good,"I enjoyed working for Brookdale Senior Living it was a clean, safe, dependable job. Majority of the time we had all the available resources, however as in any healthcare job resources and staff were not always available. When I first started the benefits and bonus' were incredible but after time I noticed  somewhat of a disconnect between corporate, managers, and employees. We were expected to perform more work with less people and  less equipment. The more residents we had the better corporate was to our specific location, which caused our admissions director to bring in several patients that we did not have the ability to care for up to Brookdale expectations."
good,"a typical day at work is busy and, for the majority of employees, short as most positions are only part time. the only people that are actually payed a living wage and get benefits are people in management positions. all of my co-workers are amazing. the hardest part of the job is when the residents that you have come to know and love die. the most enjoyable part of the job is building personal relationships with residents and coworkers."
good,"Company has some flaws,ok benefit,okay bosses,low payment, no tips on food service, poor management,crazy schedule,had to work 7 days a week at some point"
good,Emeritus was a difficult place to work as the organization was more committed to self preservation as  opposed to doing a good job.
good,I like working in my department my boss in my department is very good my coworkers are great  the head management needs a little help a lot of red tape in different departments  it would take a lot for me to put somebody there
good,director really cared about residents and how to provide them with best food possible  other departments made working there more difficult.
good,Fun work place with supportive management. Not all about the numbers but how you personally grow and develop.There was a lot of variety in what I did each day.
good,"I had an OK working experience. I loved the residents, they made each day at least bearable. though the job itself wasn't challenging it was the people I worked with that made it a challenge, every one looked out for themselves and would undermine you if you got even a little ahead of them. I really cant rave about anything and it just left a bad taste in my mouth every time I walked out the door to go home. every one would rather gossip than work. No matter who it was I had the impression they were always looking over their shoulders afraid of getting yelled by all different kinds of people, bosses and coworkers alike. it really was a depressing place to work. the only thing I can think of that was a pro was the residents they made my day and I made sure to keep a smile on for them. I did my best for them, they motivated me to make sure everything I did was to the best of my abilities."
good,Always productive serving/cleaning up food and dishes for the elderly. Working with all ages was a plus - gained a lot of experience being able to work effective and efficiently. The management started to grow weaker the longer I stayed which was a main factor in finding a new job.
good,I think Brookdale as a whole is a good company to work for. The time off for hourly employees is the worst I have ever been offered. I think they could do a little bit more for their employees now that they are such a large company.
good,"Great Company but the staff there were very unprofessional. Management took care of bad situations between co-workers accordingly, but I do not work to work there again."
good,It is A great Place to work but there ws jua t bad management in the bilding thwt I was working in Also this is a great company to work for as long as you have the right people and woerk with people that loves to do this job
good,"I enjoy working with and getting to know the residents here at Brookdale, their stories are remarkable. Fun place to work and management is enjoyable."
good,"Brookdale is overall a great company, but certain individuals who run the place of business make it difficult for others. A typical day working here is very hectic and busy and can at times be very over whelming, but through it all I get the job done. The hardest part of the job is working first shift because it requires more work that is considered too much for one residence assistant. The enjoyable part of working here is the connection you get with your residence as they become more like family."
good,On my first day of volunteering I started off by working in the dining room. I had to take the residents orders and take it to the chef. I picked up dirty dishes and took them to the kitchen. Refilled their beverages. After helping in the dining room I played a game that I haven't played before. The management was very good. The co-workers worked together very well and didn't have any trouble. The hardest part was carrying loads of dirty dishes to the kitchen without dropping any dishes. And carrying a lot of dishes got pretty heavy so I had to be cautious with every step I took. The best part of volunteering was getting to drink any juices and get free cookies. And see the smile on senior citizen's faces knowing I can make other people smile.
good,"When I was first employed at Brookdale, I enjoyed it very much. I finally found a job that I actually enjoyed working. My co-workers were like family When I first accepted the job, I helped people. .  If I helped just one person all day, I felt accomplished. Then, We got another director and everything changed. It became a very cold and negative environment. I dreaded going to work. We were no longer allowed to help the customer anymore--- It became about numbers. Even though they say, ""We want to help you find the best solution"", They really just want numbers. It became to impersonal for me."
good,i loved emeritus. I learned that you have to take care of the residents the same way you would want someone to take care of one of your loved one.
good,It is a okay place to work at. It has areas that need improvement management is one of them. compensation for work can be a lot beter.
good,"Amazing residents and also some pretty great coworkers. Employers on the other hand did not seem to appreciate and time, OT, or the above and beyond attention that was being giving. Employers seems to be more concerned with the 4 day weekends and the bonus that were coming up for themselves, than the care or emotions of residents and workers."
good,"Management was hectic, but all in all it was a fun place to work. low pay, and very little opportunity for advancement. would prefer a better system of organization."
good,Working with elderly. I learned how to respond quick to the residents. Management was good they worked with you if you needed something. Co-workers were not very helpful. The hardest part was working both floors knowing you were only assigned to one. The most enjoyable part was knowing that the residents enjoyed having me around I was a great employee that satisfied their needs.
good,"I love working with people!  My clients and my staff is my ultimate goal to making sure that they are satisfied and taken care of daily.  I strive to ensure that my day runs smoothly, efficiently and affectively."
good,"Management needs to focus on the most important things first.  "
good,"Day started with getting therapist setup with patient's charts, then making sure the gym had all the supplies it needed. Next going around setting schedules up for patients to see Therapist for ADL. "
good,I enjoy my position for the most part. I love interacting with the residents and co-workers.
good,"N/A"
good,"I did not really enjoy working for Brookdale because of the management. I never got assistance on swing shift. i learned that patience is a big thing in this field. The management was not well at all, it seemed like they did not really know what they were doing and a lot of bad stuff started to go on and happen. The co-workers were nice, some of them were a bit lazy. The hardest part would be if i needed help but could not get any, i had to come up with a different solution. Especially when they were two person transfers. The best thing was seeing the residents everyday and their smile."
good,Get to work by 2PM cook food start serving by4;30PM done and gone by 6:30PM
good,Treating residents with Speech/Language/Cognitive impairments is a rewarding but challenging task which I enjoy. I learn from my patients on a daily basis and enjoy working with each of them. They are the most enjoyable part of my job.
good,"A day start going in and reading your books to see what has happen during the day with your group I need to take care of. This job teaches you something new every day. Because its a Assistant Living the residents always teach you something new. The hardest part of the job would be losing a resindent, because they have past away or because they have moved. The most enjoyable part of the jobe when I hear a resident tell me I am doing a good job helping them."
good,"I worked there for 2 years and 7 months. The work was easy once you got into the swing of things and even though the residents had their good days and their bad days, they were always the biggest perk of the job. The only real con was certain memebers of management. A couple of them were very rude, unprofessional, and plain disrespecful. My immediate supervisor even went as far as to tell me ""You have no life, you have no friends. What do you have to be so tired from?"" in response to me having a huge breakdown from being so exhausted due to being understaffed and overworked for 3-4 months straight."
good,Fine dining fast-paced kitchen. You must know how to mulit-task.
good,I enjoy working with the elderly. The management is cooperative.
good,"pro:"
good,"I loved working here, but the management was sub par at best. They were all over the place and there was no set schedules. Typical day at work was going in, setting up the food preparations, take orders, and deliver the food to the customers. We would then tear down the dining room and change the table settings as well as fold napkins for the next shift. Co-workers were a little chatty, and gossipy. They were more worried about sitting in the back and gossiping then they were working. The job was simple but the seniors were the most enjoyable part."
good,"Great employees to work with , management changed a lot always & room for advancement , company pays for a % for college. I loved working with Geriatric residents."
good,"Clean, professional, well-run facility.  The staff is friendly and very helpful to the residents."
good,"A typical day at work would be to set tables, do laundry, clean and change selected residents, pass scheduled (as well as PRN) medications, and monitor selected residents. I have learned that teamwork is really essential in the assisted living community. There is a lack of positive management. The majority of my coworker's do not understand nor do they care about the importance of teamwork. The hardest part of the job is dealing with the ""trickle-down effect"" that happens when all parties do not complete their responsibilities in an effective manner. The most enjoyable part of the job is is knowing (through the resident's) that I am providing them with a comfortable and enjoyable experience in their new home at the community."
good,"I enjoy this job a lot. It has wonderful residents to care for. Not only do you get to care for them but they care for you as well. You become a part of one big family when you work here. However, there are no advancements."
good,Hands on calendar of activities related to the 6 components of a resident's health and well being.
good,Great experience. Caring for any individual is a great opprtunity to take advantage of. A way to show you care for others.
good,I love the residents. the other employees are great to be around as well
good,job is ok but management could be a lot better. there is lack of communication between managers and employees and the turnover rate for employees has een very high lately
good,"Extended family."
good,Learn many things at Brookdale to enhance my work experience as I move forward.
good,The pay is minimal for the care we provide.  Not enough hours available.
good,"Perform all the business office functions. Following 3 separate calendars of daily objectives (printing reports, AR/AP, billing Medicare, and invoicing / interacting with residents). The hardest part of the job Juggling the office work, and meeting with residents that needed a great amount one on one interaction to resolve their issues & concerns. The best part was helping the less able residents with what ever they needed help with!"
good,"Love and miss the tenants. I enjoyed my time at Brookdale, it was a great working environment."
good,I learned time-management and management skills that helped my work ethic once I left.
good,"that could be your mother father grandparents,so you treat them like family."
good,Fast paced environment with a great amount of communication and interaction with residents
good,There were not enough opportunities to utilized clinical nursing skills and there was not enough valuable training tools...
good,"Fast growing senior living company. Well structured with support and feedback for community administration. Well developed culture and set of values. However high level managers not held to same expectation as front line staff. Executive Director positions very demanding and require 110% dedication. Typical work day is 10-12 hours a week. On call 24 hours a day, 7 days a week."
good,"I have learned about taking care of geriatric patients on all levels of care, from residents needing little to no help with daily cares to residents that need help with all of their daily cares. I enjoy conversing with the residents, it makes me say ""I am glad to be here."" when I can make a smile and a connection with a resident."
good,very small facility with few employees and the company was very tight on money all the time.
good,"Brookdale Senior Living is  nationwide corporation running many senior communities throughout the country. In Scott’s Valley, CA the seniors seem to enjoy their living arrangements although the cost is above normal for services rendered. Most employees loved the residents although many in the caregiving and nursing positions continually complained about their job duties."
good,"I have been doing home health on and off for the past 6 years, full time as of the past 3. I enjoy providing care to people in their own environment and helping them achieve their goals in the privacy of their own home."
good,I worked there 8 years. I enjoyed the environment overall until new management came in and started making unnecessary changes. But i loved my residents and miss them greatly
good,"A typical day at work at Brookdale is stressful, to be honest. A lot of energy and dedication is needed for a shift talkless of working a double shift. The most enjoyable part of the jo is the residents getting to know you and engaging with fun and interesting conversations with you. Some even go as far as helping thus, making your job easier."
good,"It was a fantastic place to work. Residents were always nice and so were my co-workers and managers. Some days were challenging,  but that happens anywhere."
good,"Brookdale is a great company to work for. Decent benefits. Very nice facility. Management is very unprofessional. They will bend the rules and hide anything to get these private pay people in the door and to stay in their facility. Staff often entertains gossip, fighting, sacrifices anybody and anything to keep their own nose clean."
good,"* Promised full-time work, used a point system, never did get full-time work for a full salary"
good,Brookdale castleton is a good place to start a working career. Management staff is good housekeeping was really good .living conditions were ok .it is no longer  called Brookdale Castleton it was taken over by a new company
good,Brookdale is a large company with many locations. It offers advancement opportunities and many benefits.  As a nurse there is extensive training and conferences you are able to attend.  There is required travel with mileage reimbursement.
good,the people that work there are funny and easy to talk to. you can make a lot of friends and everyone is chill. sometimes we pull pranks omn each other.
good,Ok for a first job but not for a life time. Too many residents assigned to one nurse. Poor management. Really nice facility. Great location. Ok pay. Good schedule
good,"My immediate manager is a Chef, it was understood by all kitchen staff  that he had to follow company policy, even the residents were disappointed at times with their meals. Many had different diet requirement which added steps to the meal preparation process. However I enjoyed working at my craft preparing different meals and desserts, though it was imperative to follow protocol so that residents would have their meals according to schedule. This job was demanding for the pay."
good,Brookdale is good for working for a short period of time. After working there for 7+ months you start to realize that it’s time to leave. Brookdale is not a place I recommend staying at for too long unless you enjoy helping the retired.
good,This job is well revolved around time & you must have patients when working with the  elderly  it teaches you hands on skills & good costumer service.
good,Brookdale is a good place to work. Taking care of the residents is what I enjoy the most at my job family members are also every nice. If you like caregiving you’ll like it.
good,"Most Residents are very kind, workers are hard working but unappreciated. No cell phone policy for workers. Plenty of parking space and always hiring."
good,I learn that its a team effort it should not be all on one person. team work makes the dream work. the hardest part of the job was convincing future residents that brook dale was the place for their loved ones. the most enjoyable part was seeing all the residents happy and enjoying life even in their bad days.
good,"As the maintenance manager I oversaw all duties in my department and was the supervisor of housekeeping. My duties included but not limited to completing daily work orders, weekly and monthly building safety tasks, managing my own department budget, working with contractors, and completing all necessary restoration work in empty apartments to get them rent ready."
good,"Nice place to work. management wasn't always around when needed barely showed up, when called never answered her phone doing work hours. showed favoritism to other co-workers"
good,"Overall experience was good. Operations and sales worked well together. As a tenured sales executive, I was allowed to work my accounts/territory with a great deal of autonomy. Current managers are not micromanagers. Corporate training is completed within 5 weeks of employment. A marketing budget is provided. Reports and conference calls are limited; allowing me more time in the field for selling."
good,I learned a lot about working there. They hired new managers that don’t know how to do there jobs right or treat their employees with respect. The scheduling was all messed up barely had off days because the scheduling manager didn’t know what they where doing
good,Very dedicated team members. I enjoyed my time there and the people I worked with. We set high goals and typically celebrated all met goals & holiday.
good,"I always work well with others. Although it can be overwhelming at times because of too many over turns, which meant having to train new staff pretty often."
good,"assist in turning and positioning exercising bathing, bed making, feeding and checked vital sign. I assist with diaper changes. changed clothes assist with bed making."
good,I enjoyed my co workers at Montclair Park for the most part and I liked working for the administrator but the corporation made unrealistic demands of managers and I decided that I did not like that and left the position on good terms.
good,I love my job because of the residents and the hardest part about working here is when one passes away. The employees are friendly and welcoming. Its not a bad place to work.
good,A nice quiet place to work. Slow paced. Management not bad but not great either. Resident are friendly. Staff is not professional. Have great discounts
good,"The company is a good company some the management team I work for can ba little overbearing, other than that I would recommend any one who loves elders and has patience should apply"
good,"Working at this location I have experience life and death overall being with the residents is my favorite part. On the other had it felt as if girls were leaving other girls behind including the new incoming girls. Overall its a good paying job, work good hours, able to get by.."
good,"Worked alone between 1:45 pm and 4:00 pm on the weekends.  Learned to handle emergencies and identify which one was the most critical. Management encouraged us to take classes and attend meetings.  The hardest part of the job was seeing someone in pain, or losing a resident.  The most enjoyable part of the job was talking with residents, laughing and helping them with anything (especially when they appreciated it)!"
good,"Like Kindred at Home, there was a lot of turnover in the home office and amongst the therapists and hours seemed to always be limited. The territories therapists were asked to cover were 30 miles from one end to the other. Not appropriately staffed."
good,"A typical day at work is coming in for two shifts (lunch and dinner), and serving the residents efficiently with a smile. Workplace environment consists of high school students."
good,Clock in then go to the kitchen and the chef would tell us whats on the menu and the ingredients so we would know when the customers ask us. I learned how to multitask and be quick. Work place was good. Hardest part of the job was tending the needs of up to four tables. The most enjoyable part was you do get help sometimes and at the end of your shift you get to take home the food they made.
good,"- Workplace was great"
good,You need to be a fast-paced worker to really do well here. But there is down time to do slower work/tasks after Serving Time. I adore the people I work with.
good,i love working with older people so it gave me that time to be there for them . the staff made alot of things uncomfrotable but if you can hold your own you are good
good,Great job and experience but staffing was a big issue always gotta wait for next shift who are never on time wich is an issue if you have a busy schedule
good,"typical day is filled with direct patient care, scheduling, consulting with other team members, nurses, and doctors concerning patient's POC and discharge planning"
good,"I love the Brookdale culture!! Residents and staff are so friendly. You typically have fun during the day. Its a nice, upbeat atmosphere, some management is really nice."
good,"Taking the residents food orders, and meeting their goals for a pleasant meal. Working as a team to get the job done, and satisfying the residents and their families."
good,I enjoyed my time at Brookdale.  The managers were very nice.  I enjoyed the hours of operation.  It was nice to cook for the residents.  They were very nice.
good,"I love working with elderly, they have a great sense of humor. They are very smart and loving. I have grown to have build a relationship with them. The hardest part of my job is leaving after my 2 days (Saturday, Sunday) and come back the following week and hearing that someone has died or got sick and is back in the hospital."
good,"working at Brookdale was pleasant. The residents are kind and appreciative. Hardest part of the job was getting coworkers to work together and not focus only on their ""job"" but to work as a team and do whats best for the residents and the company."
good,"Entire company works as a family and puts the residents first. I only wish they paid a little more. But overall, great company to work for."
good,"I honestly love where I work, but I feel that I have no advancement opportunities as told that I would. I do everything I can for everyone and I truly feel that an opportunity was swept out from under my feet because they didn't want to rehire for my position that no one seems to want. Besides that it really is a wonderful work place, everyone is nice and they take care of you. It's almost like a second family."
good,"I have learned quite a lot working here. My day is quite busy from the get go. Most department heads wear many hats and have to be flexible and may jump in and assist in other departments to aid in the success as a whole. My day consists of daily census, AP/AR, customer service, payroll, new hire orientation, paper work and the list goes on. I've gained a high degree of respect for my co-workers Everyone works hard and I value all our teams in all departments. The hardest part of my job is when we lose a resident due to needs--whether they move out or pass."
good,The management was not good at all but the residents were fun and nice the co workers are good people. I enjoy working there
good,"Work ethic is everything. When no one on the team, including the hiring staff are lazy, everyone is. There is no motivation to the working team, and many repercussions if you make a mistake."
good,"Fun, upbeat work environment. Good at putting the residents needs at the focus. There is a lot of red tape and hoops to jump through but it is a corporation. Not much in house advancement observed, most open positions are filled by outside applicants."
good,Very busy I worked alone and had 19 residents to take care of.The hardest was everyone needed you at the same time.the best part of job was all the love the residents had for you when you help them.
good,The therapy staff in the skilled nursing facility is amazing. Productivity requirements are 80%. The building is clean and well maintained. Teamwork mentality within the therapy department. A typical work day consisted of 7-12 patients with various minutes of treatment. Rarely treated more than one patient at a time.
good,"It can be very busy, but the main focus is the residents. I've been there a few years, and honestly I can say I've gained a lot of experience from the two positions I've had in this company."
good,"All meals run similarly. Pre-meal settings place. Service of food and dessert. Bussing, cleaning, and resetting major table implements along with cleaning or assisting the dishwasher. I learned much about dietary, in regards to service, special diets, and behind the scenes of the entire department. I also learned about dementia, among other age-related diseases, in conjunction with how to properly and efficiently deal with problems that arise from these conditions or afflictions."
good,"The hardest part of this job is, getting attached and losing a resident."
good,A typical day would be getting everyone dressed and ready for breakfast. afterwards entertain them with an activity or game and help them celebrate life everyday.
good,"administer medications to residents before and after supper, help with everyday living"
good,it wonderful job need a new environment something close me in hartford ct
good,The work was quick yet attention to detail was the upmost of importance.
good,Great place to work overall. People who we take care of are incredible individuals..
good,"Assist the residents with bath, dress, and be ready for their daily activities. set the dinning room for their meals of the day, help those who need to be fed. pull up their laundry and make sure their rooms are tide and clean."
good,"I gained a lot of self-confidence through working at Brookdale. I learned how to come out of my shell, as well as, standing up and stating my opinion."
good,Nothing really that I have already answered some not all of the managers are butts I will never work for a manager like him again other than that I loved working there
good,It’s was okay the job was good I love the residents was amazing I love taking care of them bath them feeding them and putting them in bed and playing games with them
good,"Good place to work, but they cut a lot of hours. The pay was about 9.20 or so. The managers were nice. They do drug test. Interview was kind of like a comfortable conversation."
good,"Be sure you are familiar with their documentation process, they are very strict with that, and rightly so. They are helpful however it is difficult if you have a full time job and work there PRN."
good,I would not recommend this company to work for. I don't believe they still own a lot of communities like they once did. The company has gone downhill a lot since the time I was employed with them.
good,"Keep to yourself, do your job, and you'll be fine. The med passers did a lot more than they should've, but that's typical in healthcare. No real room for advancement."
good,I really loved and cared for the residents there at Brookdale just wish the managers were better at what they do they were very unprofessional one manager made me do a injection and I wasn't even licensed and I get fired I just hate it because im not able to work at another because of that one on Jones Maltsberger in San Antonio and I live in Houston now
good,Brookdale has good intentions and great workers who believe in taking care of the residents. Management will over work employees with no overtime or bonuses usually are short for the same reason. You only meet your managers once or twice they are never asking how things are on the floor nor do they care if you are stressed and over worked
good,"Basically, a typical day for the evening cook was to cook vegetables and starches, fresh or frozen, for hot service. Entree's were usually already cooking or cooked. Served the meals to the residents and then cleaned up."
good,"I worked the evening shift at brookdale, a typical day involved bringing the patients to dinner, helping them eat dinner, bringing the patients back to the rooms to get ready for bed; giving showers and helping go to the restroom as needed. I would take all laundry needed to the laundry room and trash out to the dumpsters. Once all patients were in their rooms I would do rounds every hour and help as patients needed help."
good,Great place too work but some of the staff was very unprofessional . The management hired all family members and their was much confusion in the company.
good,"While working for Brookdale I learned about the corporate world.  The position I filled gave me a lot of autonomy, however I did not like the fact that I was always on call."
good,"Over all the job was okay it didn't ask too much of you , the one thing I would say is you need to have tough skin and patience the elderly in the nursing home aren't always nice and sweet ."
good,"loves to promote from within."
good,"the harder you work the more you get yelled at for doing too much, the workers spend more time on their phones less time working. also when I was working there management had favorites and let them slack off."
good,"I enjoyed catering to our residents and taking care of their needs. Putting a smile on their face gave me a sense of pride, a job well done. It was very fast paced and I was usually under staffed. The work load was to much for the time aloud to complete side duties satisfactory. I did everything in my power to train and coach all service staff proper procedures.With service with a smile being one of our motos.I tried to maintain open communication between the front of the house and the kitchen in order to have all entrees served to there proper tables at a proper time. Serving techniques were always followed."
good,"I loved the job I had as the Health and Wellness Director, but I was offered a promotion and within 6 months incurred a RIF and was offered a lower $ position.  I left after 10 years with the company accepting the severance package that was offered.  I would have never have accepted the promotion had I had any idea that the position, within 6 months of accepting, would be dissolved."
good,overall my experience with brookdale is not bad at all i have my good days and bad days .. the residents are friendly and good people but they’re some that are nice so nice the pay can be better though !
good,it was ok working with i just wanted something way then brookdale i wanted to homecare and then go to school for medical assistant i wanna do the medical field
good,"I loved my job at Brookdale. when I first started there it was called Emeritus, they then later switched over to Brookdale. A typical day there was hard to say because anything could happen. I don't mean that in a bad way but I dealt with the memory care patients and u just never knew with them. That was the part that I enjoyed most about working with them , they are spontaneous and you never know how they might wake up an feel that day. so I enjoyed being part of that in trying to brighten up their day."
good,I have had the opportunity to grow and learn multiple things with Brookdale. It has come to point where I do see any other positions available I am interested in. It hurts to see when census are low in a community then the staff loose their hours. Managers come and go like other businesses. I work with seniors providing activities which has become so routine. Seniors would like to rest but at the same time it is pushed for them to participate. I need and look forward to a new challenge. It can be stressful at times.
good,The team I had worked with at Horizon Bay were wonderful and there was a great management team. The ownership changed to Brookdale Senior Living and the new management team was very unorganized.
good,"Awesome coworkers and facility staff. Wonderful environment with clientele within Independent living, ALF. family response and involvement in loved ones therapy was great."
good,"Promotions are not done from within the company. Workplace is mixed ethnicities with foreign ethnicities getting preference. Unless you find your own replacement, you can not get time off.Hardest part of the job is getting the training you need.Most enjoyable part of the job is the people you take care of and some of the staff. Manlius EMS who come in emergencies are excellent."
good,"Well managed community"
good,Going in not knowing what to expect when you get there. Not having enough of help on your shift. I liked the family events that we held for the residents and their families.
good,Everyday is a fun filled day of doing activities with the residents. From Bingo to movie night. My goal is to see that the residents have fun activities to do on a daily basis.
good,"I have worked with Brookdale going on 2 years now. I would say it is definitely a place where you can advance quickly if you have the right attitude. I have gone from RCA to QMAP and lead to a cook in the kitchen all within the first 4 months with Brookdale. Working with this population takes a special kind of person. It is not easy by any means. This job requires your utmost patience especially when dealing with the dementia population. The work load can be a bit much when caring for 12-15 residents alone and the pay is definitely not where it should be for the care that is given. It is a taxing job both mentally and physically. It can be stressful and also emotional but overall the residents make it worth it. My heart will always be with my Brookdale residents. With that said, I feel like this company really takes advantage of it's loyal employees. I have been promised vacation time and then had it stripped away last minute because of being under staffed. We are consistently understaffed therefore the current employees are pulling doubles, working 10-12 hour days, 6 or more consecutive days straight and are just burnt out."
good,"A typical day at work starts with, First floor trashes, cleaning all bathrooms, common areas, break rooms, second and third floors included. I Foled clothes, towels blankets, etc..) Maintainance, on roof leaks, hospital beds, tvs, etc..) The hardest part of the job was pest controle, most enjoyable part of the days was seeing the smiles on the residents faces and the internal rewards of accompleshment."
good,"I mostly worked in the kitchen loading and unloading the dishwasher, recording freezer, refrigerator and dishwasher temperatures, taking out the trash and delivering meals. I learned team work and gained customer service experience. Everyone has been great to work with and we all do our best to help each other out."
good,I enjoyed working at brookdale and working with all the people I have met over the years. I wish I could have stayed with the team longer but I had to move. the hardest part of my job was taking care of 65 to 85 people by myself brookdale really needed more staff.
good,While working at Brookdale I learned a lot . Some days were more challenging than other due to high turn overs . I enjoyed helping the resident despite that .I also enjoyed working with my co-workers we always had fun working together and with the resident. I feel like management here needs to get more organized . The most enjoyable part of my job was helping the resident to best of my ability.
good,although I had  basic daily tasks  there was always some new experience to make the work day interesting.  I was never bored. my co=workers were amazing individuals. the care they gave was sincer.
good,"The workplace was very relaxing "
good,I love assisting people as they need help but this company draws a very fine line between assisted living and nursing home for the value of the dollar and I do not think that it is good for their employees or their residents and it certainly is a risk and safety factor for both as well.
good,"Arriving at work, I helped the residents prepare for lunch. This often involved getting them changed, dressed, and fresh faced. I assisted the transfer from bed to wheelchair for those who used them, or helped with the shoes of the residents who were able to walk on their own. I served meals and helped those who could not feed themselves. "
good,"Typical day at work: setting up the tables before we opened up the restaurant."
good,"Helpful coworkers, Not just productivity driven, very supportive with onboarding process, leaders are approachable. Huge community that has pros and cons."
good,"I have worked as a server at Brookdale Sr. Living for almost a year. Pay is about 10$/hr. Pretty easy job, basic routine server stuff. But recently there have been so many cut backs on basic food choices and the quality of food offered that I don't feel comfortable representing the company anymore. Management says they, ""Above all, care about the quality of life for the residents."" But it has become clearly not true. They only care about profits and are willing to cut corners on staffing, food choices and food quality. It makes me feel sad for the residents."
good,It was a good experience working at Brookdale. I remember coming home tired after a long day. I had to go to school and was working two jobs at the time.
good,"I work night shift 7p-7a. It is pretty calm most nights, but although some nights are hectic like all places nothing is ever inadequate of getting done."
good,This company can do for important for the health care a long with the people working and the resident. The corporate needs to work the floor to see how to better run care for the residents that live their. There is always need for improvement in all care homes a long with how the bring on staff. And their is all was a short staffing on the weekends and the days. Makes for a harder work load!
good,I learned to work as a team treat people how you wanna be treated treat people with respect . Management they are good get stuff done and they also work as a team. Hardest part of seeing the resident not be able to take  care of them self and when they are confused and don't know where there at. the most enjoyable about it is that i love helping and taking care of people if they are little kids or older people that's my passion.
good,"To be honest when I worked at Brookedale they had a few co-workers that were a Big help to me when I first started and even though, I'm not working there No more I'm still friends with one person that warm at Heart.... and for the Residents they'll have their days but hey there are old what do you expect Lol."
good,Loved my residents they make your day.there is some good co workers will miss them just like the residents.just sad when your money and hrs are messed with after you worked it.
good,"Brookdale Cypress Station is a great place to work.  The management is very open and easy to approach.  They care about you as more than an employee because you are important to the outcome of the company.  It is a difficult job as a care provider and the only thing that I wish is that the company paid more.  I know this particular location has no impact on pay but Brookdale overall would have a lower turnover rate of employees if compensation was aligned to the work that is being done for the residents.  Overall, I enjoy going to work and enjoy working with my coworkers. We work together to make life enjoyable for the residents.  The executive director is also a pretty nice and professional person which makes it a nice work environment.  She expects you to do your job and be professional and there are no issues.  With that being said, Brookdale is a good company and the Cypress Station location is a great place to work. Overall, Brookdale could stand to pay the care providers more.  We do a lot of work and interact with the residents very closely.  It would make sense to me that you'd want to keep good workers by paying them what they deserve.  The majority of the people that I work with go above and beyond the call of duty on a daily basis."
good,"It was a good place to work little, Flaws with some of the Co- workers Basically when they started hiring the younger people, without any experiance . They where always calling of from work. Most enjoyable part of the job for me where the residents."
good,I like what I do because I get to meet different people and cultures. Management needs to step up and fight for the workers.
good,"I worked on the weekends where there was not much management there because I was more Saturday and Sundays when there was only a couple of staff to over 20 residents and One nurse. There was no one there upfront to answer phones or let family members in because the desk assistant was off on the weekends so it was hard to really do that as well. "
good,"Preparing 3 meals a day for 40 residents, as well as doing all the service dishes, preparing snacks and ensuring top notch quality."
good,"A Typical day at Robin Run normally went by pretty fast, because you're serving people food all day long. Also because the dinning room at the nursing home was little small, we only had to serve the people who live there. I learned how to keep a good memory of my orders, also time management. My co-workers were over all pretty nice and we all for the most part got along. Management we basically had one manager who was like the really cool laid back type and another that was always on us about every little detail. The hardest part of the job was trying to take care of all the seniors at once and everything they wanted in a orderly fashion. My favorite part was the people they were great very friendly, they act and treat you like family,"
good,Typical day is walking into the office and greeting everyone. Get my coffee so I can start my day. Log into my computer and check my emails for any applications so I can order employees purchase cards. The hardest part of my job is waiting for confirmations. The easiest part is policies and procedures are at my finger tips.
good,"Most thing I enjoyed there was working with some coworkers and getting to know residents. you tend to get close to them and begin to see them as family.  typical day at work is usually busy, coworkers I had my shift were great to me. hardest part of leaving was saying goodbye to residents as well as everyone that was kind to me."
good,My experience here isn't one for the record books. The only thing I loved about working here was my patients and some of my coworkers. Honestly I was miserable here except when I was taking care of my patients and talking to them and their families.
good,"The work-load in this job is light, but still there are learning opportunities that goes with it. The best part of the job is knowing the residents and becoming a part of their life while maintaining a professional relationship. The residents are quick to show appreciation to the staff and this inspires staff the most in providing excellent services to the residents."
good,The company is very good. only thing is that the schedule is not out on time and it changes every day
good,"The residents are fun and very active."
good,Usually pretty Busy most days ~ Staff is very friendly and encourage each other ~ management is ok could be more supportive and helpful ~ Hardest part seeing residents in pain or dying or knowing it’s the last time you’ll see them ~ Enjoyable part / seeing there smiles seeing how they interact with each other or staff / some of them know me by name or know what I do there
good,It was good place when I first got in than things begin to change over times it was favoritisms like of pay job load was terrible and short staff.I would not go back to work their because I was not treated right when I left resident was good sometimes food was good like of communication lots of that everyday.
good,It was a lot of physical work but very rewarding. Having to bath the residents when they refused was the hardest part about the job other than seeing sick people all the time.
good,"Clock in"
good,A company that allows you to grow and gain experience in different roles. They are good to their employees and they have many communities in the United States if you ever had to relocate.
good,"My role was to assist patients with weekly schedules, insurance verification and signing necessary paperwork.  Also answered phones and took accurate messages for department."
good,"Working as a server in a retirement home is quick paced and a lot of heavy lifting with the trays carrying dishes. You have to memorize all the names of the residents or you won't know what meal goes to who, it gets easier over time. Management was excellent and super helpful. The most enjoyable part of the job were the senior citizens."
good,It's ok here. Every job has its pros and cons at any company. Keep an open mind and do your work to the best of your ability. Seek out all training for your career to advance.
good,"I have worked here for 2 years. In those 2 years, I have earned more serving experience than those I have analyzed at actual restaurants such as BJs and Olive Garden. Honestly speaking, working at one of Brookdale's diners is the hard way of learning to be a server, but is one of the best. There is nothing like putting an honest smile on somebody's face by simply bringing them a glass of water. You can gain a lot of respect here. Expect to be rushed like youre working at a fastfood chain while providing 5 star service. This job isnt for everybody, but those who do work here end up loving it. Now that I've been here for a while, I basically do what I want after I finish serving my tables. All in all, its a good work place."
good,"If you are a CNA or an aide looking to learn how to administer medications and much more this is the place. You will learn how to give medications, do treatments, assist with insulin pens, charts and so on. You will also assist in different areas such dining services."
good,"It is a large company, you can transfer anywhere you need or want to in the United States. There is a high turn over rate. There is a lot of pressure put on the management staff."
good,"Management will step on the smaller guy to advance themselves.  Residents are herded in to fill quotas, with no regard if they fit the culture or environment."
good,"Present living facilities and services to organizations and families needing residency care. Conducted all business and emotional support for new residents.  Provide administrative, clerical and marketing support to the Sales/Marketing team."
good,I start my work day by talking with some of the residents that sit in the lobby drinking coffee and reading their newspaper. I have seven apartments to clean. Dust furniture in hallways. clean and shine up elevators. on some days I have to detail clean apartment for a move-in. I get along with my co-workers. The hardest part of my job is when one of the residents passes away that's makes my day hard. Getting to know the residents their stories and what makes them smile.
good,"Preparing and planning 3 meals daily is the majority of the job requirements. Typically, I would follow detailed recipes while paying attention specific diet requirements. I learned a variety of cooking technics and organization skills."
good,"Brookdale is a great job for someone with a lot of patience and strong lifting abilities. The job is super fast paced, you barely have time to grab a drink or sit for a 2 min break to rest your legs. The residents are not understanding and again it is too fast. There are times I carried 10-13 food plates to reduce the amount of tension that the residents gave me for being even a minute later than they expected. So moral of the story if you have patience it’s a good job. Also the hours can get horrible so have another job to prevent this."
good,Working at brookdale senior living has helped me grow as a person and in work environment it has helped me to deal with overwhelming situations on the spot in a calm manner so that everyone is happy and helped me learn to be more responsible person the best part of working there was seeing the smiles on the residents faces at the end of the day
good,Friendly environment. Staff sometimes are courteous and friendly also. The residents are a delight for the most part.  Other then that it would not have been a bad place to work for.
good,"Still getting the feel for the company but so far it's a job full of ups and downs, High turn overs, and a broken management team but good residents whon I'm here for"
good,"Brookdale is a great place to work, I work in the Memory Care department. This job requires a lot of task, and hard work. I don't believe they pay enough for the jobs and task they require. But overall the job is great and I like it ."
good,"•	Provided patients assistance with feeding, moving, dressing and personal hygiene "
good,"A pretty decent place to work.  The benefits are slim especially time off.  It is earned at a very slow rate which is not conducive to a good work/life balance."
good,"I truly enjoyed working for Brookdale.  The core values are amazing.  There is potential for growth with in.  When hiring resident assistants, I felt more focus should have been given to the person's appearance and attitude.  Sometimes a resident assistant was hired just because they were a body.  Otherwise, Brookdale is a solid company.  "
good,I love working with the seniors who live at Abingdon Place. I wish there was more training in how to help and care for people with Alzheimer's disease since there are more and more people being diagnosed with this awful disease.
good,Work is rewarding and challenging. My location has an amazing leadership team and wonderful residents. Most of the opportunities that arise come from the associates. Always working toward improving shift coverage and staff morale.
good,Brookdale is connects very well with their residents and make sure their needs are taking care of in a timely manner. Brookdale considers residents in every decision they have to make
good,"A typical day at worl for me would be running around doing activities, taking residents to appointments and outings. Hardest part about my job is that I have no assistants to help me. The most enjoyable thing about my job is knowing that I can do something to keep the residents happy and entertained."
good,"I was able to complete my assignments on a daily basis. I had some co-workers that were a challenge to work with almost every night. The hardest part of the job was following a nurse that made numerous med errors and would not complete her tasks, including notifying families, which is difficult to follow up at 11 pm. The most enjoyable part of the job was that I had good staff members to work with on my shift and had the same patients nightly which allowed me to have continuum of care."
good,"The job is fulfilling and it is awesome helping people, the management wasn't great when I was there, particularly with overworking employees, but was fixed and got better. Overall I would work here again, just has to be at a location where the management really cares for the people who live and work there."
good,Creativity and new development of each department. Reaching and achieving new concepts to bring future concepts to the healthcare industry. Bringing purpose towards the senior living environment.
good,Management is terrible...I left this company because the management didn't care about the residents they only cared about getting more money for themselves. Some of he resident aods were terrible people and should not have been working there at all!!!!
good,"Management only there certain hours during the day,wellness director does not supply med techs and or caregivers with the proper tools to complete a job well done."
good,"It was an experience,able to learn and work different positions,hours and schedule can change,demand was high with less number of staff,felt that residents could of received better care if there was higher number of staff,but assisting residents was the most rewarding got to learn about life in general thru the eyes of a Senior.overall the pay was terrible did not match what was required of an employee."
good,A typical day at work was stressful because all of the drama the people would start there and you start the day clocking in and getting your walkie talkie because that’s what residents use for emergency help all of the resedents there have there own special way of us RA/cna to help them they were all great residents and very respectful. Just go there and do your job don’t associated with anyone because there not all your friends I learned a lot about about all of are residents the residents was the most enjoyable part expecally one on one with them and management was messed up they never gave u the shift you wanted nor the time or days u had to work for it and there is leads there that got exactly what they wanted they definitely have there favoritess!
good,"making food from scratch,washing dishes,make sure food is served in a timely manner and meets required food safety temps."
good,"I started here to gain more experience and to help others. Brookdale is a great place to work, with great co-workers. i would say they need more constant hours . one week you make work 40 hours and another week only 3 hours."
good,"I had a great experience with Brookdale for 11 years but when I decided to leave was blamed for things turning sour.  The ED took no responsibility in the work culture- turnover, atmosphere, family concerns, etc.  It was very stressful with trying to balance home and work (10-12 hour days) when the ED was there maybe 6-7 hours per day.  I was expected to be on call 24/7 as well. Corporate was blamed for my dismissal by  ED but I had only good scores and worked at the community for 11 1/2 years and we were deficiency free for all of them by both state and corporate.  In the end I had told them I was relocating and was used as a scapegoat for the lack of ED talent and the  community suffered greatly since I left. as there were new communities moving to town and the core employees left as well as many residents as they saw the community riding off the coat tails of the previous management and their hard work.  I feel bitter, yes, but God works in mysterious ways."
good,I love the people that was living here and it’s was a relaxing job sometimes everybody was nice we did a lot with the older people but I was mostly in the kitchen cooking and they love my food
good,"If you're not look to advance and just want to come in day after day after day to do the same job, since they're always understaffed than Brookdale is the place for you.  The executive director is a joke and doesn't care about the patients"
good,Brookdale can be a great place to work at but if anyone is in the San Antonio area before you decide to work there ask questions on the facility and its management
good,Great place to work ... The environment is good. I love to work here. The management could use some work but overall its good.
good,Overall it is not a bad place to work. The Starting pay and pay increase is very low.
good,"In 2007 I was a mall security guard at Brookdale Mall. The mall is now closed and torn down. All the remains is a Wall-mart now in its place. Working at Brookdale Mall was a crazy experience into the world of law enforcement. Its no secret that Brookdale had crime problems, we dealt with on a weekly basis drug dealers, gang activity, car thieves, and violent individuals. Needles to say we had some wild times working security."
good,My supervisor was a poor leader. The ED was very stressed and made my own day stressful. I was on edge from the day she took her position. I knew she was going to let me go. I started working 9 months before I was officially trained and even that training felt rushed.
good,they do not keep you posted of who is on leave of absence and if the emplyee should come in the building or not. HR is not honest withtelling you when you ask her a question.
good,"Brookdale is a very fast pace environment. Patient care is top priority. Communication can be flawed at times. Cool co-workers. Immediate supervisors are the best. Shared stories are alway relateable. Work hours are great,"
good,I worked as a nurse and there is a lot of turn over . The schedulers get burnt out. There isn't enough of schedulers for the area they cover. The schedulers will change your schedule without informing you or add to your schedule without notifying you. There is too many chielfs  in the office and not enough Indians. Communication is lacking.
good,"Management needs to be better, need more staff. Really short staff so that makes days longer and are not able to get stuff done that need to be done such as showers"
good,From the first day I was getting the run around on my schedule. They had two managers working on the schedule and they both had me scheduled for opposite days which confused me. I was promised a certain position before my trasnfer and a year later I still didn't get that position.
good,"Throughout the morning I tend to the needs of my co-workers by stocking the kitchens, making sure all the coffee brewers and ice machines are functioning properly.  Call for repairs on equipment when necessary.  Work the switchboard at the receptionist desk during her breaks, lunches and when she is on PTO.  My afternoons were spent processing incoming and outgoing mail, FedEx and other courier packages.  I also ran the yearly flu clinic and holiday giving tree.  I was part of the safety committee."
good,"This was actually my favorite place to work. I absolutely loved and grew attached to my residents (even the not so nice ones) and I loved to take care of them. The challenge with this job was mainly the crew you're working not caring as much as you do about the work you're doing as well as the people you take care of. Once it is established that you are a person who genuinely likes to take pride in their work, you end up carrying the rest of the place on your back and pretty much helping in almost every department, but not getting the pay to match it. I decided to find another job and relocate because I was tired of being a problem solver without a problem solver's pay."
good,The one i once worked at did not listen to the pca concerns when it came to patient.  Activity director got away with everything. Loved all the patients and families.
good,"Overall Brookdale was a good place to work at,got along w the co workers,loved the residents, the only con was the schedule mine got changed every week for a mth which made life outside of work difficult.If the scheduling wasnt a issue i would have retired from here."
good,Management is blind when it comes to some employees. No Call No shows are allowed to return over and over. Associates break into offices and nothing is done. Associates can do whtever they feel like they can do and there are no repercussions.
good,"Short and simple: hard work "
good,Great people there the resident's is great staff is ok some better than others fast pace on your feet a lot but it's a nice place to work. A nice environment could have more staff to help out because it's really hard to have a lot of residents on your hands so definitely needed more rnas but either than that i liked it
good,"This facility is very fast paced, which often means we can not get RA's to stick it through. Also you deal with deaths. which is very hard if you actually do stick it through. The pay is quite awful. Also the current nurse lacks in time management. She is often all over the place and never finishes one task before moving to the other."
good,I worked at Brookdale for 6 months. During my time there I noticed that there were some great aids. They were attentive to the residents and their cares. Each shift Had a considerable amount of work to stay busy in the facility.
good,"My morning would consists of me looking for a menu that changed daily and never matched the other menus."
good,"Working at brookdale was a challenge but fun enviroment job. It is a place where you are on your feet all day, it is lovely working with elderly resdidents."
good,"I enjoyed working with the residents but I did not enjoy the hours. Often times we were short on staff. However, the staff members are all very helpful to other staff members."
good,Nice place to work if you have a genuine concern for looking after the elderly. Not too bad but only wish it was full time.
good,Brookdale does everything to ensure your family or friends of the facilities are kept in good hands. We strive to encourage residents to participate in daily activities and physical therapy to keep them healthy and happy as well.
good,Management suck at there jobs I work in dietary and that's is the best department there. The CNA sucks. I love the residents that's the only reason I come to work everyday.
good,"During my time at Brookdale I worked both shifts, 6am-6pm &6pm-6am. For 3 of the years I was there I worked as the Activities Director.  I enjoy working at Brookdale and love the management/coworkers I have."
good,"Nothing fabulous about working here, I think basically all of the Assisted living places are the same. Low paying and not enough employees. I worked in kitchen, however I had to cook, serve, wash dishes, clean kitchen, etc.  It’s a lit of wrk for the pay received."
good,resisdent they all do their thing i just have to remind them that its time for a meal and always just keep on eye on them made i sure knew were they were and tat they were fine. hardestprt of the job is when a residents want to go home and ihave to help them understand that is their home.i just love it when they share their stories with me.
good,"With working for Brookdale Senior living, I had my up and Downs. As a sales person I had many successes and received many awards.  District level management was at time very difficult to work with. Feel free to reach out to me personally if you would like more detailed information."
good,"Brookdale provides excellent training to their employees.  "
good,I enjoyed taking care of the seniors and assisting them with their everyday needs. Taking care of seniors is a passion and something I enjoy doing....
good,Brookdale University is what I've heard it called. We graduate and move along. Low-ball salary going in and very small raises- and hard-to-attain bonuses.
good,"Busy at times but great atmosphere, staff was very helpful during my training. Very welcoming place. The residents are pleasant.Hardest part of the job was leaving. I miss the staff and residents"
good,Working with memory care patients has been very rewarding. Residents and families care about you and want what is best for you and the resident. Very home like
good,"My day starts out at 7am by clocking in and going up the hall to get report about the night and day before. Next start to call everyone for breakfast, make sure they are dress, toileted and dried. in wheelchairs or have the proper footwear on to walk with their walkers. If i am on the medication cart i will count off with the Med tech from the night shift and start doing blood sugars and insulin shots if needed. Pass out all morning med which taker til about 10am to give with a 30 minutes break for them to eat breakfast and you help in the dining room."
good,I left because the Executive Director at the time would not let me hire an additional cook so I had to work long hours. Also in the winter time the pipes froze over night and flooded all the seniors out of their rooms. Nobody did anything for a long time. Didn't want want to be a part of that story.
good,"I love my job, but the pay isn't good at all. The only reason I stay is simply because I've become attached to my residents. The residents are amazing, they're the reason I go to work every night, they've become family"
good,"The company is careful who they hire. The most impressive part is how the staff cares for the residents. They all do their very best to make the residents have a comfortable, safe, and clean place to live. The neglect some may see in other communities, does not happen at Brookdale. The local management at Brookdale are all impressive individuals. I enjoy working there."
good,"Very busy work environment, residents are great! Management changes frequently. Offer flexible schedule and 8 hour shifts which is great. Co workers easy to get along with."
good,One of the most caring and loving facilities Ive ever seen. You can see the love and care that our Resident Associates have for each resident. We are the only Brookdale that  tends to just Alzheimer's and Dementia.
good,"working here is such an experience every day , its never the same thing twice . working ere taught me new things outside of my education like medication aide and supervisory skills . the environment is welcoming as soon as you walk in the front door . the hardest part of the job is getting outside healthcare offices to comply with the time frame given , the most enjoyable part of the job is the residents and the conversation !!!"
good,It's amazing going to work everyday and seeing the smiles on the residents faces when they see me coming to work. It's like I have nearly 100 grandparents in my life now instead of just my blood related grandmas and grandpas.
good,The organization is a very good Company but they do not pay well and ask employees to do things outside of thire jobs as they have a low retinchen rate.
good,"Loved the residents, co-workers were great, mgnt team needed work, great divide amongst them that the rest of the staff was aware of, caused friction in the work environment."
good,"High turnover and terrible benefits lead to a bad work environment. What used to be a fun and caring workplace has become solely numbers driven, with higher management consistently making threats about job safety to ""inspire"" performance."
good,great enviroment to be in and great clients great staff and management as well as  a fun place to work just wish the job payed more for the work you do and the things you have to put up with at times
good,"Take care of residents, taking them to restroom,prepare breakfast or dinner, Checking vitals, righting their report. Laundry, making sure faculity was clean and things was in order."
good,"Over 100 residents with one nurse to take care of, No Director of nursing over 2 months, managers are lazy and not doing their jobs, so floor nurses have to finish managers' work (eventually, both of them are getting fired at the end of this month for not doing their work), floor nurses are all brand new grads with no experiences."
good,"The hardest part of the job is the attachment to the residents. In my experience of working with seniors, you establish bonds with your residents, and it has a high rate of move outs or moving on to the after life. The job is very rewarding and you are introduced to people in all walks of life. Saying Farewell is the hardest part of the job in my opinion."
good,I love the job and the residents and wouldn't change the experience for nothing but the management could have been better and more caring. Some of the so coworkers was there for the paycheck and others actually love the job.
good,Great for entry level positions. Great environment. Upper management was disorganized and often did not communicate well with each other and especially with the teams they were working with. The team leads had your back and the team was mostly great. Training was often a miss and very difficult.
good,The job is what you make it.Nice place to work not much room for growth.Could use some better supportive mangers.Also think they should have a better system for disciplinary actions.
good,Working as the Program Assistant I had the opportunity to engage with the residents in an interactive way. They had technically I was new to which helped keep me excited about the role. I would encourage others to work for this company.
good,The facility is very nice for residents to live at. The facility offers 3 meals a day for residents. They go to Walmart and do other activities. There is a LPN on staff at all times.
good,"The place was decent to work at , I had the best co workers, they made u feel right at home. Management at the time was definitely not good . Balancing life & work was a little difficult because management was so demanding with hours"
good,The young and very new director was looking for ways to write up staff and showing favoritism towards her age group of co workers. No understanding of someone who was struggling with depression and having major hormonal changes. Could have put me on FMLA or extended leave but chose to ask staff to write statements regarding why they didn't want to supposedly work with me. She however quit before I chose to move on. Almost 13 years I dedicated to Brookdale and I miss working there.
good,"Fine place if you need experience. They have flexible hours and management is welcoming. Some days are very stressful and others aren't. Busy work days are just part of the job,"
good,"Acquisitions group was very busy, which made work enjoyable.  Rapid pace was manage by intelligent and capable people in the acquisitions group.  Property underwriting was questionable though, and there was no process to review acquisition underwriting to actual results."
good,Each day is different. Fast past. Rewarding and  also stressful . Trains are good and very state compliant. My learning was steady throughout my many years with the company.
good,The supervisor was not the most helpful. A lot of time spent in the office. The administrator was much more helpful than the immediate supervisor. Coworkers were friendly and helpful.
good,"You can really build relationships with residents at Brookdale, strong ones too. The extra things you have to do in order to finish the shift can seem redundant or monotonous at times but you find it helpful and worthwhile to do it for the residents benefit."
good,"a typical day at brookdale living would be, you come into work and clock in. after that you would then find out where you would be located for the night (there are 5 dining rooms). Once figuring out where you were located you would get the dining room ready by; folding napkins, gathering bread plates, silverware, coffee cups, water pitchers, and bread baskets. After serving for the night I would reset with; fresh table clothes, folded napkins, polished glasses, five pieces of polished silverware, and a center piece. Then I would complete side work. Over all I've learned how to time manage tables, deal with confrontation/ problem solving. Management is Okay for the most part the only thing I will say that it is very hard to get your hours increased. in addition to its not a very friendly environment. the hardest part of the job would be when the dinner rush comes through and it gets crazy from the hosts not properly seating etc. the most enjoyable time by far would interacting with residents."
good,"Brookdale senior living solutions is a good place of employment, like every other job it has ups and downs. Work schedule can get a little crazy, it is nice to know that you are helping and taking care of people though."
good,"Help residents in their daily tasks. Help them with their medications and have control of narcotics and prescribed meds. Vial signs, insulin and blood pressure."
good,Brookdale is a wonderful facility with wonderful staff. It is clean and well organized. The residence love it there and all staff seem to love there job.
good,"Each department in the building is understaffed and that leads to stressful situations. You will be asked to do more than the what initial job description requires and your problem-solving skills will be put to test. You will deal with frustrated nurses and even doctors and you must maintain composure as you must understand that their goal is also your goal, to provide and protect our residents. The job has gotten harder since my first day as the kitchen staff continued to dwindle and tasks that were 2 or 3 person jobs became a 1 person hob."
good,"Busy place to work, very very understaffed. I loved the residents, but the management did not hire enough staff or put out ads for jobs and at times I would care for 20 Alzheimers / dementia residents by myself."
good,"A very fast paced, fun work environment to be in with very cheerful management staff and co workers. A typical day at work, anything can happen, I learned that senior citizens matter. Management staff was good but not the best, they didn't appreciate the little people who truly did more than asked of them"
good,I really enjoyed working with the residents. They really care about you. The workers are mostly really understanding about different situations that come up in life.
good,The atmosphere is very positive and very laid back. The elderly are very loving and understanding. There is not a moment where you will not feel welcomed.
good,This is a great place to work just not a lot of room for growth and sometimes management is not where it should be. Wish I would of never left this job because of how easy it was as well as the people that I worked with
good,I loved working for brookdale. The residents we're the best and my co-workers were pretty awesome too. Everyone worked well together. We we're all there for the same reason. To make a difference in the lives of those we served
good,Everyday is a new and exciting experience. I love the people I work with. I would definitely refer people others to work here.
good,I have worked for brookdale for 3+ years. I have worked in many different areas for this company. I do love the community. I do not like the corporation
good,"Emeritus is a nice facility, great residents and services"
good,Good work place  but no room for advancement.. Alot of mis management and no structure.. Like the location was close to home and hours were good .. other than than nothing else good
good,"A typical day for me is arriving at work around 4pm. By 6:30 I am serving residents and their family/friends their dinner. Seven is closing time, so I am resetting my table sections and finishing any last minute cleaning I was assigned to do by my manager. My coworkers are a huge help when it comes to leaving work on time, which is at eight. Overall, this job has taught me about the importance of team work and time managment. The hardest part of the job is making sure an unhappy resident become happy. However, the most enjoyable part of my job is the relationships I have created with my coworkers and residents."
good,"Working with seniors and knowing that you have made their last days of life more enjoyable is very rewarding. "
good,"Going in to work seeing the residents.. I love working with seniors,First when u get there your work sheet is not ready u don't know what hall to go to. Then u don't always have the thing u need to work with.. The hardest part is working short staff. One person to 15 residents that is alot on one person."
good,Very friendly people to work with. Just need to move on to the next ladder in my career and broadway is not hiring for that position right now. Will work for them again and again in the future. Not the highest paying company at all.
good,Provide community service to senior citizens. Assist clients in getting to their medical and personal appointments
good,"Work Environment Became Very Tense with New Adminstrator"
good,make food prepping for the next meal to be served serving breakfast and lunch and diner howto serve food in better way it is a very  nice work place  not getting a enough hours.
good,it was good the whole first year. Then pacifica took over and everything went down hill from there new management took over and it went all bad
good,"A typical day at work was giving care to others in a gentle, yet fun fashion. Having the patients that they needed to feel comfortable with the care I was providing along with a smile that was beautiful to them. I learned that you will have to deal with things in different ways and that I really do enjoy caring for others. Management was ok it could have used a few adjustments. My co-workers was ok at time everybody is different with different levels of care they are willing to provide to get the job done. I really don't consider my job hard because I have a passion for what I do. I will say some challenges was difficult and it was mainly with my co-workers but because we all were grown we knew how to handle them. The most enjoyable part of my job was completing my duties in a eight hour shift and leaving the people I cared for with a smile on their face even when they didn't feel like it."
good,"Check e-mail for updated or recalls. Prepare breakfast for residents,"
good,I enjoyed working with patients in assisted living and establishing relationships with them and their families. The management at assisted living was very good.
good,"Love the residents, i feel secured the employment is outstanding"
good,Hardest part of the job: lifting
good,"The ED was wonderful, but some of the nurses didn't care about floor staff. Some of the floor supervisors will write up the good staff, but allow staff that ignore residents left alone. Coworkers always complained and caused issues. Some lacked care towards residents and wanted to pursue a personal vendetta instead."
good,"Good work environment politics reasonable and friendly personae. Leadership skills and active use of lifting, healthcare survices and managment responsibility"
good,It was a good job for a job to go through high school but I would not look into careers here. I liked the people I worked with and had good bosses who cared
good,I really enjoyed working for brookdale. I loved the residents. My coworkers were great. Its all about teamwork and being there for the residents! Office staff could have been more involved...
good,"I have learned how to properly lift, move and care residents with disabilities. Also how to administer medication at prescribed time and as needed. Time management with residents."
good,I loved working at Brookdale. I loved the residents I took care of there. It was very rewarding and I was always very busy.  The management continues to improve working conditions.
good,"They utilized their staff as best as possible. Sometimes we didn't have enough staff, but we always worked together to make the day go smoothly. I loved my managers at the time, and the residents were such a joy always."
good,Got to work with amazing people. Love all the seniors I got to help. Overall amazing job. Love all my time spend working there. Just amazing workspace and people.
good,Good environment feels like family. Management could be better was a lot of favoritism with staff. Most staff member were ready to help out when they could.
good,getting residents up and ready for the day grooming food activities. Learned that you have a amazing bondage with the residents. Management was understand when you had concerns always listened. Environment was awesome with the residents and there families. Hardest part was not being able to work as a team always alone or had to wait for someone to come in and help you assist with transferring a resident.
good,Staffing can be short handed and communication with management can get confusing at times. Overall they care about their residents and it is a good company.
good,"No growth within the organization. Job advancement is the expectation of every staff in every institution especially the "
good,I loved getting to know the residents and their families. Activities would take them out to lunch once a week. The hardest part of the job was seeing the residents that had Dementia and Alzheimer and their declining state.
good,"May feel overwhelming but it's rewarding & not for the weak. If you're not compassionate & only looking for a paycheck then please, do not enter this type of field."
good,"Having worked there as both a staff therapist and in a management position, I would highly recommend working there. All staff members quickly become like family, flexible supervisor."
good,"It was a good place to start a new job. I started as a server for about 5 months and then was able to advance to a prep/cook. With the same salary as if I was still a server.  Which In my opinion, is very unfair.  Because you should be advancing , it's a higher position, you have many more responsibilities. But, that just doesn't work out for me anymore."
good,"Brookdale has a high standard of care for their residents. They appreciate their employees , and offer training so that employees can be promoted from within the company."
good,My DON here was incredible. Easy to approach and generous with helping nursing staff. Took the time to educate me on the ins and outs of the nursing department. Gained so much knowledge from her.
good,The work here may have been stressful at times but nothing made me feel better than the smiles I could bring to the residents. My co-worker were always great people to work with and the management did what they could for their staff.
good,Brookdale was a quick paced environment. We were often time under staffed which made it difficult to serve all of the guests. The employees were terrible.
good,Collaborative and supportive. Very caring toward patients and their progress and comfort. Flexibility among staff members to allow for coverage during personal needs.
good,You would greet the residents at 7:00am for breakfast with coffee and juice.  You would take there order and proceed to the kitchen to place your order and deliver there food in a timely manner.  We worked as a team to help each other in bringing the food out to the right resident.  Residents would leave the dinning room at 8:00am and we would reset the dining room for lunch which is at noon.  A break was taken from 10:00 to 10:15.  Lunch is served the same way with taking the order and bringing coffee or soda to the resident.  Lunch is over at 1:00pm and we would reset for dinner then take a break and come back around 3:30 or 4:00 for the 5:00pm dinner.  After dinner was over you would clean the dining room help the kitchen clean and leave by 7:00pm
good,I would work there again at Brookdale at the Charlotte location. They were so nice and very reliable to work with and understood when I had to work at my other job. The hardest part was the legal laws and when people needed more help in certain areas but it had to deal with the families in charge and them paying for the extra help.
good,"This is a good place to work , with a team that pulls together and works with each other well. the workplace is clean and most all the people are nice"
good,"I love my shift at Brookdale, I worked 3rd shift and we have a great group of ladies at night. I love taking care of the residents we have. I feel very lucky to be taking care of them in their last walks of life."
good,I loved working here because it is a great job that you must be self reliant and capable of working independently! I also got some of my friends to apply and every day was a blast
good,"The job itself was not bad, meeting residents and the pace of things were relaxing."
good,"I start with rescheduling visits for the day per request of the clinicians request.  I lead conference call every morning with clinicians regarding SOC for the current and previous day, any discharges scheduling issues. Verify paper visits and scan and attach documents. Review all emails."
good,"I worked at brookdale white chapel for 3 years, but unfortunately it has switched over to a new company by the name of paramount senior living solutions. I worked in the kitchen and it was a really good time while it lasted."
good,All about Relationships and getting to know the families and residents.  Very rewarding if you put customer service first and treat everyone like they are your parents.
good,"I had a great experience at Brookdale and an amazing relationship with residents, their utmost care was priority in understanding the late stages of dementia."
good,"Brookdale has a great culture in theory, but had gotten so big that the message did not carry from the East Coast to the West.  This was even prior to the merger with Emeritus.  I was up for a promotion and with the merger, those promises were lost.  I like their structure and their policies and overall, we had a great culture within my community.  Great staff makes for a great culture!"
good,"Spent most of the time helping residents go through various strength exercises.  Occasionally took the odd field trip with them to help them shop at stores. Laid back, and everyone was very friendly."
good,"Brookdale was having many changes when I worked there due to its recent merger with Emeritus Senior Living.  The company had capable staff members to provide Home Health services, but needed more managed care contracts in the Phoenix, AZ market to match the Seniors who were members of these Medicare replacement plans in order to compete in this Mature home health market."
good,The executive director had a great sense of humor that made bad situations seem easy. The staff meetings helped keep everyone in order. The staff had a problem with no shows for their shifts with no punishments so I was forced to work 16 hour or more shifts.
good,It has a very good environment. Everyone is able to help each other on anything they need. We work as a team to accomplish our tasks. Management is good.
good,"Nice place to work, good managament, very accomodating and approachable. Staffs concerns are addressed right away. there are days that residents are hard to deal with but management are willing to help."
good,Not enough staff on duty so the work load is huge and the compensation does not compare. The coworkers are nice. most of the management is nice with the exception of one bad seed.
good,Painting and more painting current Maint manage was suppose to retire 8 months ago. Changed his mind now administrator can not afford us both. The residents are wonderful. All other workers are great. Management is fair .Benifits for company are good and fair. .Kitchen staff provide food for all shifts
good,"there were a lot of promises made to the employees that were never delivered, promotions were given to employees who were not qualified for the positions"
good,It was an ok Job. It was my first but it wasn't the best in my perspective. I wouldn't go back even if I was given the chance or the opportunity. But serving the Residents was a great opportunity.
good,Most of the time where short staffed and worked with patients who could not understand what was going on which made the job very difficult.We worked as a team to get the job done
good,"I love working with the residents and my coworkers however, it is very hard to manage my life around such random schedules. It also depends on what department you are in, every department is different."
good,I worked on the activities side and there was always something going on for the community. The community was kept in pristine condition and everyone who works there makes sure that the resident is taken care of.
good,I had to return to school so they cut my hours not wanting to work with my shift. Other than that Brookdale is a fine company to work for. If you not trying to better your education than it's a good job.
good,"Can be stressful at times.  No teamwork between shifts.  Management tends to be complacent about concerns.  "
good,Working for brookdale has been a rewarding experience. The work is hard as with any job but the management works great with you. They help you and we work as part of a family. Con - pay.
good,Good place to work. Enjoyed the residents and working with my co workers. The nurses are great. I enjoyed being apart of the family and meeting the families
good,"This company was actually really good. the residents were a little difficult, but what can you expect in a retirement community. The staff all worked as a team and the manager was extremely involved with everyone."
good,"Assisted living business where individuals live that have some health issues, have no family. They help individuals be comfortable with their health situations."
good,it was a good working environment though they had too much work to do and just paid less but at least they had everything that was needed to do the work
good,"This was a fine place to work. The employees were great. . However, the company was purchased by a different company and may no longer exist. Overall, the atmosphere allowed one to help the elderly."
good,"Brookdale as a whole is a good place to work. Like any other healthcare community you have your challenges, but it is how you handle those challenges."
good,"I enjoy working here and i will continue to. It is fun, they don't tolerate workplace bullying and everyone is usually friendly. Every is pretty close there so it makes the time at work go by faster."
good,"Brookdale can be a great place to work if you love the residents that depend on you 100%. It is no easy work, but caring for them can give you satisfaction. Having the right team work right along you is something else; it is hit and miss, high turnaround, and people that are not dependable which cause unnecessary stress. Management seems detached from the team and therefore in the monthly meetings, it is customary to hear negative complains that usually brings the morale down."
good,"Telecommunications Consultant:"
good,"Good Place to work, friendly staff and patients. Clean and well up kept. quiet place with beautiful view. Residents are well taken care of."
good,"passed medication and narcotics to residents, monitor the health and well being. Hospice care, vitals. filling and sticking medical items. Assisted with ADL's."

good,"busy everyday,the management was ok, co works was ok too, there was not hard about the job, love my job, I love the resdents i was there to take care of"
good,I work graveyard two nights a week. You have to be very patient with the residents because some of them have advanced alzheimer's disease.
good,Traveling was a major factor in working for this company. I enjoyed going to new places to care for people with all sorts of different needs. It definitely allowed me to broaden my knowledge as a caregiver.
good,"Brookdale Senior living is a strong corporation, and I greatly appreciate the skills, experience and growth I have achieved during my eleven years with this company."
good,This job provided great full time hours. The co-workers were great. The management was very attentive to employees needs. The hardest part of the job was residents passed often.
good,"The work is non-stop. I learned about my passion to care for those with dementia. The management was friendly and outgoing. Co-workers would come and go, likely due to the low pay rates. How much work needed to be done, in relation to how much a caregiver was being paid ...no one sought fair. The best part of the job, was the ability to spend meal times with residents, and help put a smile on their face. The hardest part was dealing with death on a weekly basis. Laundry, dressing, bathing, caring, etc. for residents was included in daily living."
good,Brookdale Vancouver Orchards is an amazing community with many loving residents. The people I helped take care of made my job there that much better. The management could care more about the residents and their staff than they do. They can be more considerate about their resident needs and how we are limited staffing and have a hard time reaching people when needed. There are so many activities for the residents to be involved in. There was no overtime for any workers. Benefits aren't that great and pretty expensive. I learned a lot about people skills and how to help others and listen to their needs.
good,I learned Microsoft Excel.  My learned work skills were successfully utilized in this position.  I enjoyed celebrating Life with the Residents and their Families.
good,"35 hour work week, kitchen staff had great team effort; interacting with clients was enjoyable; management could have been more supportive."
good,"The home itself is beautiful well kept, I would live there. as for management, they are a joke. Hiring untrained inexperienced individuals to take care of residents that need skilled care."
good,"The hardest part of the job, is working with associates that lack the experience or drive to succeed. Pay is competetive."
good,"A day at work would begin with checking with the RA on your hall before they leave. Making sure all Residents have the care and medicine that they need at any particular time. Making sure all residents that need assistance dressing or getting to and from the cafeteria are aided. Picking up laundry to do for the day. Giving showers and basic care to all residents that need it. Helping residents with day to day task IE; mail, writing, reading, mobility, trash, and other essential tasks. The hardest part of the job is helping residents with mobility. The most enjoyable aspect is dealing with the same residents daily. Getting to build a solid relationship with them and understand their care better."
good,"very big company, in recent years theyve switched there focused on care and reputation, to being more centered on the money. Getting body in rooms no matter the situation. aside from a few things i would use the company for work experience and move on to better situations."
good,930 to7 to work with people cooking management seeing people smile is good company to work for work as team and working with all kinds of food
good,"Brookdale has set up a ""Red Dot"" system for employees. If another employee calls out of work or does not show up you are authorized to stay an pick up the shift, We often have a lot of call outs & nobody receives a corrective action form to solve the issue, Broodkdale will not allow another employee to be able to receive any overtime at all if you do get overtime they will take your days away from you without notice and find someone else to work your scheduled shift. I feel that it's not a lot of opportunity for growth within the community and I would definitely like to take my career a step ahead."
good,They were fantastic until they took over Emeritus. They became Emeritus. Emeritus was know for being unethical. It seemed as if the upper echelon that came from Emeritus brought their bad habits with them. The company is now a turn off. I just wish they had stayed Brookdale. Things would be so much better.
good,"Love the public this is the place to learn and help lots of people, You work  as a team player. Management is great and they work with you and the Senior that live there are wonderful."
good,This was a great place to work.  I had to leave due to daily commute.  The management was great and the hours were flexible.  I would consider returning if the relocated.
good,A typical day in the Brookdale Dining Corporate office can range from extremely busy to very intense.  It has been very rewarding to grow and change in this company over the past 8 years.
good,"Fast paced working as a Med Tech.  Learned to be patient, listen, advance in communication skills.  Co-workers were awesome, made work a fun environment.  The hardest part I would have to say was coming to an end of a friend and family.  Residents become family, friends.  An understanding, lovable, companionships end on both parts was a healthy one though.  Most enjoyable part of the job for me were the residents."
good,"My job as a Concierge is one of the most important positions to have at Brookdale. We're at the front desk, so when potential residents and/or guests come inside, we're the first person they see. It's important to be professional and to have a good impression. After all, we represent our facility. It's very exciting to work for Brookdale because our residents are so full of life! You would never imagine them to be the age that they are because of their personalities. After being here for as long as I have, I am very fortunate to know every single person living and working here. Brookdale is like another home to me, with a whole new group of family and friends."
good,Typical work day you smiling enjoying the conversation with the residents learning something new each time. Co-workers are easy to get along with manger staff is very understanding.
good,"I really like my job, coworkers, immediate supervisor and the friendly environment. I learned a lot from this job, it provided me new ideas,  skills and knowledge to do my job well. Also, my coworkers are helpful, reliable and team players. Recently, there have been some changes in the senior leaderships. For that reason, there are some changes and new job process implemented."
good,"you have a lot of residents but the employee's really truly care about the residents, you can sense the feeling of family there and how it has a impact on the residents."
good,Great company to work for. Great co-workers. Mileage paid.
good,A great place to work serving lunch and dinner to well deserving residents. Putting a smile on the residents face was the most enjoyable part of this job. Great co-workers team work is very important to be successful in the food service industry.
good,sirene environment and good work ethics.learned to love and accept people no matter .
good,"loved the residents they were sweet"
good,love this place it is typically pretty clean spacious rooms and environment for all very good people to work for
good,"A typical day would be when were running short on employees we have more work to do. I learned how to be a certified dishwasher, prep and cook. Managment at work needs a little more perfection. The hardest part of my job is when I have plenty of orders to  serve. The most enjoyable part of the job is after work when we get to eat our delicious meal."
good,It was a great company to work for.  The employer and the employees worked together as a family.
good,A typical day at work would involve the treatment of 8-10 patients in sub-acute facility.  The management and staff worked well as a team to deliver excellent patient care.  Hardest part of the job was the physical demands of the patient population.  The most enjoyable part was the relationships with my co-workers.
good,I learned about how to manage staff members and problems that may arise.  My co-workers were hard working and knowledgeable.  The hardest part of the job was the distance of travel.  The most enjoyable part of the job was becoming connected with the families and residents.
good,"At this job I was responsible for the safety of the residents that lived here. I was the manager, and had to do staff scheduling, order medications, and work one on one with physicians. I learned about the importance of scheduling a productive day. The management team was very complex, with high staff turnovers."
good,"We would start out learning about the menu for the night, then serve food, then clean the dining rooms at the end. I learned how to be professional, and give good cstomer service. Managament was okay, my co-workers are still some of my good friends. The hardest part of the job was when residents would become ill, or even pass away. I realy enjoyed getting to know the residents."
good,I had a very interesting day at this job. I learned no matter how old you get you can still have fun. My management was very helpful and fun. My co-workers were polite and kind. The hardest was nothing and the most enjoyable part was this 107 yr old lady.
good,"Great place to work! Enjoyed hiring management level candidates to work with our seniors in our communities."
good,"If you have a good love for residents, this is the place to be.  They really are wonderful to be around and to hear all their stories."
good, Perform nursing procedures as outlined by the state.
good,Enjoyed my job at Clare Bridge. My boss worked hard to give the schedule the worked best for me. Co-workers were nice to work with. Clare Bridge haired an excellent activities director who really seemed to care about the residents.
good,"A typical day was entertaining the patients. Making them feel special, was my goal. I learned allot about the human brain and the different stages of dymensia. Management was very friendly. My co-workers were very supportive when i first started working there, to teach me the different things about the different patient. The hardest part about the job was when there was death. The most enjoyable part of the job would have to be when you see the sad patients, smile and laugh."
good,"Productive and busy with very helpful and supportive management and co-workers. The best part of the job is helping the residents and placing smiles on their faces, the hardest part is having to let them go."
good,"The reason I stayed so long at brookdale was because of my residents, I loved every one of them dearly."
good,"Very busy fast paced multitasking, the best part by far was the honor and privilege it was to work for and with senior citizens from every walk of life and from all parts of the world,very interesting and never a dull moment."
good,I did a great job getting to know other employees and I feel like that helped me connect and bring a good culture to the workplace. I also think this helped in regards to teamwork and working efficiently.
good,"Good experience working at this company great management, great working environment. Enjoy working with coworkers. Enjoy giving quality care to resident"
good,Great place to work if you enjoy seniors the care is the most important task in the company the pay could be better but it paid my bills. i am no longer working for this company but it was good working there...staff was excellent!!!
good,On a typical day at brookdale I will say its joyful because I love working with seniors.. I learned nothing from there I came in with the skills... Management need to be watch closely because they have they picks and favorite employees... Workplace culture is some what it really depend on who you work with... The hardest part is lifting the residents... The most enjoyable part is hands on working and helping when they need help...
good,Enjoyed working with the elderly. The crew were very supportive and helpful at all times. Managers would lean a helping hand voluntarily. Vancouver is an awesome place to work!
good,"Ser mas proactivos, educativos. Tengan programas de educacion sobre su cultura organizaciona"
good,"Brookdale was a PRN job that I kept just to fill in time due to low per visit rate.  Most of the time I could get multiple visits at one stop which was helpful to justify travel and visit rate.  From field ""worker"" standpoint, I had minimal interaction with management, but enjoyed her.  When needed to call in for patient concerns, I felt patient needs were attended to.  "
good,Brookdale even though it is a large corporation has smaller regions and district teams. These teams really seem invested in their associates. They are very supportive and work hard for associates to be successful and advance in the company. Just wish the caregivers were paid more than they currently are. Overall better than most senior living companies.
good,Competitive wages and benefits were great.  Coworkers were very open and warm to me when I first started. Got promoted right away when I showed up everyday and on time and they saw my work performance. Wished I would have never been let go but that’s what happens when new management comes in they get rid of the mangers so they can bring the own people there..
good,As a person in charge of the kitchen staff the Director of the property would allow employees that was suppose to be following instructions from their direct manager/supervisor was able to do whatever they wanted without any consequences per the staff in charge over kitchen. Would not recommend working here as supervisor or manager due to the fact the Director of the property would still allow employees to do what they want.
good,"I HAD A GREAT WORLKMG EXPERIENCE AT BROOKDALE.  Working with elders was a  pleasure. , I admired there strength.Many clients were lucky to have such devoted family members. "
good,The overall experience wasn’t bad here. Good people that you work with and an overall decent environment. Management needs to listen to their servers a bit more but otherwise good.
good,Great experience with Brookdale in corporate roles except my very first and very last supervisors.  The community and other field associates are the heart of this company's success and it was a pleasure assisting and training them.  The corporate experience really depends on the team and managers.
good,Staff get along well and each shift works as a team. Management addresses concerns promptly. Continuing education classes are provided online to be completed at staff convenience.
good,"I worked for this location for over 5 years.  I enjoy my work, but for the Cost of Living in Colorado my wages are not enough to support my 2 small kids.  I will need to leave for a higher paid job, get a part time job, or go back to school"
good,I’ve been there for three years and haven’t even had a dollar raise. I only like the coworkers because majority of them are my friends but the management could better. There could be better a better pay as much as the amount of work we do.
good,"I don’t have many complaints. It was stressful due to working with Alzheimer's and Dementia residents, but it was very rewarding getting to know them."
good,Brookdale was a decent place to work. Hey was okay hours was okay. It is a huge company so it was very much a corporate atmosphere. I would recommend working here though
good,everything worked perfectly well. i was a waiter for the senior living. ive learned how to cook on a massive scale. the pay was ok. i got along with my co workers and boss. had to relocate other than that i would have stayed
good,"Misunderstanding regarding work behavior versus company standards of work performance. Friendly staff towards residents and management, healthy food options that met dietary needs."
good,"They do a great job of caring for the residents and families.  Constant interruptions in my position which made it difficult to process work effectively.  The pay wasn’t great but doable.  I had to let visitors in/out the front door all day everyday which made it difficult to concentrate."
good,"Working here, you have to have an abundance of patience. You have to be able to make quick decisions and always put the clients feelings first. You have to also be able to keep positivity and liveliness while being stressed because thats what makes them happy. You need to be able to listen and learn, not only about the job, but about them."
good,"The residents become your family.  The love they give is unconditional.  If you love children, you can easily see through to help comfort them and reassure them.  Although there is never enough time in the day to spend with them,  you will truly cherish any breaks you get.  I miss them,  but couldn't deal with the constant loss,  or the feeling we as caretakers, weren't doing a good enough job."
good,"tough company to work for as they go through organization changes regularly. "
good,Working with the elderly they become like family to you and they look forward to seeing you everyday. It’s very fast paced and it’s fun. The only bad thing is they don’t pay you enough for the amount of work and hours you put in.
good,"Great place to work, I have worked at Brookdale for 4 years it is very competitive wages a friendly work environment and a great team of people to work with"
good,I liked it at first be then my hours where cut and I needed to move on. The management is good but there are a few loose ties that need to be taken care of or people will continue to leave.
good,"Staffing seems to be a tricky part, having to bring in temps. I enjoy helping the residents with anything they need and seeing smiles on there faces every day."
good,"One benefit of working at Brookdale is the extra family members you have.  Not only your co-workers but more importantly the residents!  I inherited Grandmas, Grandpas, Aunts and Uncles.  It was wonderful!"
good,"came in at 7 and was given our patient assignments, we would help people get dressed, shower, ADL's."
good,"Despite having the toughest schedule, both the residents and staff consisted of nice people and the managers are hardworking people who encourage a pleasant working environment"
good,The type of patients we are now receiving from our admissions department are not able to be rehabilitated. Recent change in leadership has resulted in a facility decline as a whole. New employees brought onto the team show to be almost incompetent. Teamwork with the Nursing Assistants is almost non-existent.
good,It was a lot of wrong things going on in the dining department.  I Think If We Had Better Management Things would Of Been More Enjoyable For Everyone.
good,"In charge of passing medications to residents at designated times, make notes in resident charts, contacting pharmacy for refills, reporting to nurses, contacting family when needed."
good,"Open up the front office, unlock the desk and change calendars"
good,"convenient for patients and families whose loved ones can benefit from the continuum of care ie: home health, assisted living, memory care, skilled nursing facilities."
good,"Constant change in Management and staff"
good,"Brookdale has a wonderful legacy of culture. There are many wonderful people who work for Brookdale. The associates are very supportive of one another.  In the senior living industry, you will not find another company with the breadth of resources, talent, and established practices that you will at Brookdale."
good,"Visits for patients can be spread out as far as 40 to 50 miles, but some are in same community building. Would be great to pay nurses for at-home charting  time in addition to per visit."
good,People who care and make the difference in the residents daily  living I love the fact that there is structure and they keep the vehicles up to par and the people are able to be talked to it's a great atmosphere
good,"I worked here for 4 years, I saw a lot of changes. Overall, I loved it. But when new management came on board and they expanded, it started to be not such a great place. My residents were always the best part and I keep in touch with a few of them still. They started hiring people that shouldn't have been in the healthcare field at all, a lot of neglect and theft. It eventually got to the point where I couldn't watch it go on any longer after already reporting it and nothing was being done."
good,"The management I worked for seemed to be uneducated though I loved all the residents it kept me to stay there. I loved everything I did there, I was well liked, but the management changed so very often."
good,The work culture is pleasant. Hard workers can be found at Brookdale. It is easy to be yourself with Brookdale. I have learned a lot about excellent customer service working at Brookdale.
good,I love all the residents their and love to he feeling that it feels in their and how Evey little thing that we can do is really appreciate and the love we get from the residents..
good,"Great place to work, has good management for the most part, big home for the elderly, beautiful apartments, has a great therapy dept, food is amazing, have lots of functions for residents and families of residents"
good,Everyone is friendly and it is a very easy place to work in. Everyone helps eachother out. Will make you work all weekends if you allow it.
good,"Glad to be a part of this growing company, I started as a resident assistant, 3 months later I became a cook 1 yr later I'm th dining service coordinator.  Love this position get to show off my culinary skils."
good,"During my short time at Brookdale I was under extreme pressure which is not an issue but the management did some shady things. One of the main things was my schedule I had split days off working noc shift (overnights) and morning shifts and even on my off days I was getting my phone blown up to come in to work. I was involved in an incident in which a resident fall situation had arose, as one of the answering employees on duty I oversaw the helping of this resident to her power scooter, but to make a long story short the employee that entered the room first had not reported the fall and I was blamed for the whole situation and was written up for the ""negligence"" and ""poor performance""."
good,My coworkers were awesome. We worked together to get the daily tasks done. My supervisor was outstanding. He was a very understanding boss and was flexible with me when my schedule got a little funky.
good,I cooked breakfast and the lunchfor residents and sometime famly members as well I just really enjoy to cook knowing that I can put a smile on a resident face at the end of my shift makes me happy
good,"It's a joy working with others who share the same concept of helping senior citizens live a good life, especially because that's what they pay for. Sadly, there is only so much you can do serving others before you get tired of it."
good,Serving food to seniors and making sure service was exceptional. Three course meals a day serving 45-80 residents each meal. Was promoted from server to dinning manager in 2 months. Responsibilities then included managing a team of 4. Problem solving if issues arrived and making sure things ran smoothly. Pre-planning meals and orders.
good,"Absolutley love this place, I am server in the Vernon hills location although the servers are looked down at (mostly high school and college students) the place is great, I love the residents, I am hoping I can move up working here since my major is healthcare management. The staff is really nice, pay is a little on the lower side though."
good,"Brookdale had a decent work environment. During my time at Brookdale, the hardest part of the job was finding our direction as a company. We are changing strategies constantly and while that's healthy in some cases, some strategies need to last longer in order to realize it's success."
good,"most enjoyable job is working with the elderly"
good,"Target was a fun place to work. Job security was a big issue being a seasonal hire, and the scheduling was all wrong. Overall nice place to work with great discounts."
good,"A typical day at work is checking on my residents needs by answering our paging system, I pass out medication for my residents on a scheduled time and assist them with needs through out the night. Management at the facility is amazing I could not ask for a better team of directors! Co-workers are friendly and helpful. "
good,Good place to work with wonderful residents and management who are willing to work with your schedule. The only con is the staff shortage.
good,For me working with Alzheimer's was just as challenging as it was rewarding. It opened my eyes to a new world and brought to me a passion which I plan to follow in my future.
good,"Considering that this facility caters to the elderly, our work day is full. The company bends over backwards to bring comfort, ease, cheer, care and humbleness to their residence and they do not expect less from their employees. It is a place adult children can find peace knowing that their parents are being well taken care of,  I have learned patience, humbleness and I continue to practice my traits and learn new ones. Everyday is a new day, it can be difficult when I have no one available, however I always take up the slack and complete a job, or it can be productive. I enjoy seeing the grateful smiling face when they know they can depend on me and my staff."
good,company is an excellent company and would like to continue but thecircumstances do notallow it
good,We are are family but needs improvement in appreciating workers
good,"Greet everyone with good customer service skills, stay busy and get the job done, learn something new everyday, easy job some days are challenging and co-workers are okay."
good,I find there is no advancement available from shift to shift. There is alot of interaction with residents and families. I really enjoy the time I can spend with the residents. My co-workers are willing to go the extra mile to help the residents. The hardest part of the job is staffing and at times support for the issues.
good,My typical day as a waitress at Brookdale Senior Living was fast paced. I learned different skills that pertained to being a waitress and working in an environment with elderly people. The hardest part of the job was having patience and being able to keep up with the fast pace. I really most enjoyed being able to provide excellent customer service.
good,Fast pace and fun all the coworkers and manager got along great.
good,Kind of an Old Boys Club atmosphere. Hard work often goes un noticed. Very Nepotistic enviroment-encouraged by ED-who is very hard to work with. A very huge turnover.
good,"Enjoyed working conditions, flexible schedule, team members. Frequent supervisor turn-over very problematic. Lack of available training for electronic health records made my job miserable for at least 6 months. On the other hand, I loved the older population I worked with: very rewarding."
good,The pay is fair here. Management has a high turnover. Management also has problems with attention to detail. Large building and lots of running around. Low staff to resident ratio.
good,Brookdale is a good place to work. It was a good first job to gain experience in nursing. Understaffed and sometimes underappreciated but overall the nursing part is great.
good,Working at Brookdale Senior Living care could be a Challenge for some people if they are not use to help older people with dementia because you would have to take care of them just like you do to yourself everyday
good,"You put the residents first, its a simple job cleaning up serving them food and cleaning up after them, its a quick learning process but the relationships you form with the residents make it worth it."
good,Overall I enjoy working at Brookdale. Management try’s to work with your schedule. Very organized and the benefits are awesome. I would definitely recommend a friend to come work for them.
good,"The atmosphere is that of a truly happy home. Its small, comfortable, and gives you a lot of time to actually leatn about and interact with the residents you take care of."
good,They are in a state of flux as the location I am at is being sold to another company so no one knows how or what will be going on as of yet. The new firm has not spoken with either employees or residents. I do not feel like they will be trying to keep any of us at all.
good,"Work there at the work place was great, I love the elderly so I enjoyed being there! The people in the  facility was great the hardest part about the job was tryna not to get attached to the resident!"
good,"Well, to start off, I LOVED all of my residents. Loved my co-workers and management. The pay was actually really good for only having a high school diploma ($13.50-Findlay, OH location). There were many opportunities to pick up various different shifts and extra hours. (Which I loved.)  I had to relocate so I was forced to quit which was a huge bummer for me. If you enjoy working with seniors and know before hand what an RCA/STNA does, then you would love this job. If you love helping seniors and enjoy making a difference if their life, then you wouldn’t love this job. I will never forget my first experience as an RCA at Brookdale and the amazing people I met along the way. This is just the start to my journey in the assisted living field. 💙💙💙"
good,"I would have enjoyed this job more if management would have directly coached me through my employment.  Instead I’d get secondhand comments from residents or rumors from staff until I quit.  Complaints were made but never addressed.  There was not protocol for my job.  That could have been great, but it didn’t work out that way for me."
good,"It wasa decent place to work. Salary was adequate, management changed too much. Notheing else to say, trying to get out of this screen.It will not let you out until you have reached 150 characters."
good,"This was a great place to become a good aide. Great mentors, flexible scheduling, awesome superiors. The residents become our family, and you find it hard to leave."
good,High turnover and stressful but fulfilling at the end of the day. In a kitchen position you will be expected to keep up to date with resident's health requirements and to maintain a professional demeanor and clean work environment. If your team is short-staffed you can expect to be pulled aside to pick up the slack. Breaks between meals can be around a couple hours. Lunch and dinner being the most hectic
good,"I worked as the PL coordinator for Personalized Living... I was also a waitress, housekeeper, caregiver and receptionist. Brookdale is a TEAM environment, no one is better than the other. We all took part to help one another out, regardless of the job duty...and we were happy to do it."
good,Overall a great place to work although they are very understaffed but everyone worked as a team and management always helped in any way they could. They pay was low for the amount of work everyone did but it's a very rewarding job when you can help someone and make their day a little bettet
good,Had a great time while it lasted. If it wasn't due to lower pay i might go back but unfortunately cost of living is too high in Prescott valley to continue working there.
good,"Brookdale's training programs are great.  They leave out a ton of the day to day operations, but most of that is relatively intuitive."
good,Kind residents who appreciate what we do for them fast paced work but we have good teamwork skills we know what people like and don’t like so we can suggest something they would like to eat
good,Love working there. Love the residents and there families. The job is super fast paced but that's what makes it fun. They do pay enough for what the work is my only complaint
good,"Many people quit while I worked here, and when I quit I had been there longer than 2 of the members of management. They were not very flexible with hours, and the head manager got upset at us very easily. Even so, they truly cared for the residents."
good,It was nice working and caring for our seniors although they could be a little off at times. Pretty laid back and easy work. Can be a little tiresome but the associates are very helpful.
good,Working at Brookdale you will become attached and genuinely care about your residents and their families. The associates all care about the work they are doing and it shows in our every day work. 
good,"A typical day at work. I learned to be the doctor. As well as the patient. I receive A nice paycheck. And Am active With the care of indivisuals. with a little buissness/ sports thrown in. And Laughter, As We Form Teams."
good,"I was a server at Brookdale, serving residents food, delivering food, cleaning up work stations, provide great customer service, interact and communicate  with residents."
good,"Very nice facility to work at. The other employees and management were all very nice. The residents were great. Going in as a PRN from another job though, they did expect me to work every weekend even though I told them up front I could only work every other weekend."
good,"Its a nice working place to work at. The management are good at listening to the welfare of their staffs. no job is hard because i have compassion in what i do, i love to make my patients happy and feel comfortable in our facilities."
good,Good working experience and environment at Brookdale Club Hill. Worked 8-5:30. Culture was good. Great team to work with. Enjoyed working with both AL and IL residents. Did not like all the meetings and phone calls. I got in the business to help the residents and not be in meetings or on the phone all day.
good,"This place was amazing! Some of the people that worked here too was amazing people! Some people were careless, some wasn't. This job was my life, I loved working here. Management sometimes was poor, and didn't really do anything about a conflict but in the end it was pretty good."
good,"I really enjoyed this job. I worked night shifts and the co-workers were difficult more than not. The patients were awesome and the policies of the company made sense and were safe. We cleaned the building a lot and had to do the laundry plus care for the patients, so there was always something to do."
good,This company is no longer around as they were brought by Brookdale Senior Living in 2014. It was hard to see my residents on my last day of working there as I was going back to school for music and Brookdale came in at the same time and changed everything around.
good,"Emeritus was a great jobs working with people that loves taking care of others, it made my day seeing that management notices when you g I ing above an beyond to make you staff an clients happy"
good,"The environment and staff are great.  The aides really care.  But there is a culture of complacency there that management is responsible for.  Although it is a pretty good place to work, it could be amazing if the management would be more strict instead of being everyone's friend and playing favorites."
good,"A typical day in the Brookdale kitchens varied from slow, exciting, and hectic. But overall it was nice working there the coworkers were nice, and some became my friends, others weren't that great but those people didn't last long there. I learned quite a few skills at Brookdale like how to crown a lemon, bake cookies and cakes, and certain social skills that make me a good worker. the hardest part of the job would be trying to make a cake without all of the proper ingredients because we were under stocked. the management was great until the main chef left and was replaced with someone who couldn't keep up with the kitchen."
good,"Manager respectful.  Does not micromanage.  Work load is reasonable. Coworkers respectful with each other. Pay should be higher, as in all senior care positions. No stress. Free to share ideas and take on increased responsibility."
good,I enjoyed working here very much and would definitely go back it was a very fast paced environment which I love very much and I loved my co workers and residents
good,The company provided many opportunities for advancement.  Fun culture to work in.  The employees worked well as a team and supported each other when short staffed.
good,"Good for people who like to work with senior population, good management and colleagues. There is always fun at work without any kind of stress; feels like second home."
good,"My typical work day is from 9am to 5pm, though I do work late nights, weekends and holidays as the job requires.  I learned a lot about the senior care industry, about creating and running enrichment programs and about managing company resources and finances."
good,The most enjoyable part of working for this company was the residents I took care of on the daily basis. I loved the job it was just the management staff had their picks and chooses.
good,"Brookdale at Chambrel is a good place for a first long-term job, and can be a great place to move up in, but the management of certain departments can make the commitment a trying one. There have been issues with scheduling and discipline throughout the facility in the past, and in some sectors these issues remain, but overall this location is the hallmark Brookdale for the Southeast, and the department directors' commitment to the residents makes it abundantly clear why. Despite its few flaws, Brookdale at Chambrel does provide a rewarding work environment and I would recommend it to anyone hoping to start with the company."
good,"I enjoyed my time at Brookdale. I was given the ability to take ownership of my role. No micromanaging. Free lunches were provided, when I was in the building as my position required 80% field work. My days were busy but fulfilling."
good,The best part of the job is working with the residents. The rca care about the residents well being and happiness. Communication could be better between departments.
good,Enjoyable place to work. Immediate feeling of family atmosphere when entering. Management willing to listen and help with concerns of Residents & staff
good,"my duties at Brookdale were to serve the tenants during breakfast/lunch/dinner. Other duties were cleaning up dinning area after each meal and at the end of the day or shift, we clean lounge area, kitchen, fridges if needed and make sure all food is sealed and put up properly!"
good,"I've learned that elderly people don't really have a lot of support when their living independently. Most residents families hardly visit them. i was glad to be apart of the company to assist them with what they needed, which most times was alot. I had many wonderful conversations with them and learned alot."
good,My typical day with this company consisted of long hours with short breaks. I did not mind the working environment or the personalities which were at the job.
good,Wonderful clients and patients to work with. Including family members. I learned how to manage my time better because we were short staffed most of the time
good,"Work place was great, except too much ""unprofessional"" work at my particular ""house"". Management could definitely be improved and be more open to the thoughts and ideas of the staff memebers."
good,I prefer not to talk about my experience at brookdale because I'd never try to put down my experience because someone else may have the best experience with them everyone is different
good,"When you ask or tell a manager about a problem, it seems to get put off to the side.  The other RA's and clients are great.  Many times you are working 12 hour shifts due to understaffing."
good,this was an ok job I enjoyed the resident but we was also short shifted making it very hard on others. and management would never come in to help like they was suppose to.
good,i learned a lot from brookdale i loved it there had to quit due to illness. To work there u must be fast and good at remembering names orders and there dietary needs.
good,"It's fun to work with and makes the place a home for the residents and employees they provide good promotions for the deserving staff,,enhancing individuals s to be their great level"
good,A good way to get experience as a waitress. Its a pleasure to interact with elderly residents. Its a lot of fast paced work but that makes the shift go by quickly.
good,I loved working here because I love caregiving. It can be a stressful place to be though because there is such a high turnover rate for employees. Including management.
good,"I last worked here in 2005 when the facility was fairly new. The management was ok, they were very nice but seemed a little inexperienced. Over all I got along with everyone."
good,"I enjoy working with my co-workers, I love my residents and I generally love helping others. I love working in the health field. Working with residents that have alzheimers and dementia hold a special place in my heart, I love hearing their stories of their life and its sad to  watch first hand their daily changes , their mind sharp one day and gone the next.  I have a positive work attitude and I hope I make a difference in their life, maybe my smile or ear to just listen to them so they don't feel alone ."
good,I loved working with the residents so much. Never had a more fulfilling job! The pay was not all that good considering all the work we had to do though.
good,"My experience at Brookdale, Alhambra has been very pleasant.  The staff members are humble and helpful.  It makes my job easier and fun.  Management has just changed, but time will tell if change is positive or negative.  If you like working with the elderly and have the patience and care-giving attitude, and not in it for the money.  Then this is the place for you."
good,Working at Brookdale is tough since I have to work both 1st and 2nd shift and there is not enough of other CNA's to cover the shifts which makes the day very busy. But I love the residents!
good,i worked there for two years as a resident assistant and a cook> i really enjoyed doing both yeah some days were a little harder then others but i always got through it the staff was nice and most of the residents was sweet hearts i still talk about my time there
good,"worked in the memory care Alzheimer unit,learned to more more passionate with the elderly,manager was nice to work for,coworkers were friendly, hardest part of the job, was seeing residents missing there children and families."
good,"I enjoy working there. Friendly co-workers, management is typically involved in day to day things. Activities director is always doing fun things with the residents which they like."
good,This place is definitely a busy environment and very fast pace. Management needs a lot of help. Working in the Assisted Living department was very hectic as the director did not know how to run the department. The residents are suffering because of the shortness of staff. Staff could not provide the quality of care the residents needed because of how much help the caregivers needed.
good,Overall the management seemed very unorganized. The residents were very well taken care of by staff and management had their best interests in mind at most times.
good,"I was Resident care Director and loved working with my Residents, we had a great team and wonderful teamwork, then the company merged and then was sold again with in 6 months and has been hard to move forward through the Merger, still in the learning process for the new company."
good,"I work with Brookdale senior living for now. It is a great place to work with flexible schedule, benefits, good management. Good team work"
good,It was a good and clean facility. There are great employees that are a  joy to work with and will take care of your family. Its always a relief to know that your loved ones are in good hands.
good,"Each day I like to come to work and serve the resident with a smile regardless of how I personally feel or how everyone else feel because I like to keep thing on a positive note. I like coming to work because the people I work with are fun and helpful. At Brookdale Chanate, we have a great team in the food service department. The management here are always doing their best. The job I do here is to provide an exceptional food services to the residents, so I do my best to put the resident first and meet beyond their expectation."
good,Brookdale Just Merged with Emertuis Senior Living. No new changes as of yet. I think once everything is set in place Brookdale Clearwater will be a success. I am exciting about all the new changes that have been talked about. A lot of new programs will be put in place.
good,I work here the most out of all my experiences. My mother works there so I had no real complaint about it. I love working with the elderly.
good,"Best corporate culture ever.  Closed multi-million dollar senior housing transactions as a team.  Entire team strived for same goal and we all had each others backs while managing many many projects and critical tasks simultaneously.  We very successfully closed deals with skill and earned the reputation with the lending and senior housing leaders of being great to work with.  Very effective management with clear customer service goals able to motivate staff to provide the best service to our customers and team members.  I learned the business side of these mega transactions such as cap rates, cash flow and occupancy fluctuations.  "
good,"I love this job, but the hours are terrible and the pay isn't what it could be. Management is great at this facility and I very much like all the people I work with. The residents are great too. The whole atmosphere is wonderful and I enjoy what I do there. The only real problem is I have really bad hours. Jump shifts a lot and they consider 32 hrs full time, not 40. Those 8 hrs make a big difference in your paycheck. They do NOT like to pay overtime at all."
good,"The most enjoyable aspect about wrking for Brookdale are the residents that I take care of and meet occasionally. I sit and chat with them more than the staff. Everyone usually keeps to themselves at my facility, therefore I only enjoy my residents."
good,Work place is okay. The Seniors are loving.The hardest part is working alone to prepare food.
good,Emeritus is a great company to work for and provides fair compensation for a job that is done well.  There is a lot of support from upper-management if you need.
good,"Typical day at work would be to go in and prep for all aspects of the lunch set-up. And then start cooking for the dinner setting,always with the thought of keeping lunch serving in a timely manner and preparing all things to order.The hardest part of this job is there are way to many people telling you what to do and when to do it,even if you know what has to be accomplished.The most enjoyable part of this job was the relationships you gain with the staff and the residents."
good,"Transfering,showering,toileting,changing residents getting to and from meals an activities. I learnead companionship,caring for the elderly,transfers.The managment is good always willing to work with you and help. For the most part my co workers are goof of course no matter where you work there a few people you get along with more then others but fore the most part we all work as a team.The hardest part I'd say would be the residents paging at the same time and them getting upset if there not answered right  away because your in another residents room. The most enjoyable part is getting to know the residents and knowing I can help them with the stuff they can't do for themselves."
good,Serving customers as well as residents is very rewarding. You can create long lasting relationships with co-workers as well as residents and customers.
good,as soon as we clock in we wake up residents including dressing grooming showering transfering and escorting.
good,i was working 3pm-11pm
good,Working in the hospitality business it my forte by far and what actually made this job different from others was the fact of workind around the eldearly... all males and females had some kind of advise which was great because taking advise from someone who is already been there is like having the answers to a test that you haven't done (metaphorically speaking)... therefore the chances of getting a higher grade would increase.
good,I loved working in a Senior atmosphere. The job itself was great. I had a few issues with the Executive Director's idea of my dress code. I'm a very clean and neat person and I want my clothing to reflect my personality. I like bright colors and I was told that my attire was too loud for the residents. Funny that when I wore colorful clothing the residents and the staff always told me how put together I looked and that I made them smile. The ED was the only one who had a problem with what I wore. I did comply with the dress code just not hers. I still loved working there.
good,"The job itself is self explanatory, meeting all the resident and seeing them everyday for the most part was nice, you really get to know everyone there and what they enjoy and don’t like"
good,Overall It's a great job to begin with but if you want to further your career most likely you'd have to transfer to different properties because there aren't always advancement options available.
good,I worked here during high school. It was good for someone who has never had a job before and teaches you a lot about working with different people. You get close to the other servers and managers as well.
good,Residents seem happy with activities and coworkers are kind and caring overall. My job in Engagement Programming was always fun and exciting and we love to make the people who live here thrive with much to do and offer individual as well as group programs.
good,"workplace culture centered around happiness and well-being of senior residents"
good,"Brookdale Senior Living was a great start to realizing I want to advance my career in caring for others. There are pros and cons to every job, and location of each specific community but overall if you love caring for others, I loved it."
good,"Happy working there however, they sold the building to Meridian senior Living. They closed down the long term health center to renovate. It was a nice place to work at when it was Brookdale."
good,"Brookdale is a large corporation with many associates. "
good,Brookdale is a fast paced energetic environment to work at.  The therapy department is a very friendly group that collaborates very well with all disciplines for the benefit of the patients.
good,it is a good job but you have to follow strict state regulations. scheduled meals and laundry. job is light house keeping and patient care. it is very nice working here
good,I love my job very much but after i had my surgery and came back it was very difficult i was workin a 7 and ahalf hour shift to a 11 hour shift cooking 3 meals a day then i figure out this wasn't the job for me
good,Brookdale is a fun environment to work in. The associates are cool and nice and so are the residents living there. The hours are good most times but its a good place to work.
good,"Brookdale supports it's sales team with great training and support at a District and Regional Level. Local teams are supported well. This company is goal and metrics driven, goals and numbers must be met weekly and monthly."
good,"It is a flexible work environment with opportunity for growth. Management could use reviewing, overall easy going work environment. Alot of different things to work on at a given time."
good,"I served the residents. Created relationships with the residents, call each resident b their name. Safe and fun environment. Very flexible schedule. I loved making the residents laugh or happy, liked having conversations with them about their day or their past."
good,"This is a good company to work for, I think they care about their employees, but should consider internal talent when positions open, that would provide for advancement"
good,"Enjoyed my time there. I like the people I worked with and the people I worked for. If I didn’t have to move, I would have continue to work there. Always interesting."
good,Putting the needs of the elderly first is what Brookdale does best. I love working here and hope to grow within the company. Caring for the residents is truly a rewarding career.
good,"Most days I cook, serve, order, manage wait staff, assist residents with meals choices, ordering, scheduling, working with other facility managers, vendors, and adhering to corporate standards."
good,Be self motivated and attention to detail daily. Try not to get discouraged with your surroundings and love what you do. Ask for feed back from residents on how you can better accommodate them next time.
good,All managers and supervisors were very helpful when starting out. Hours were steady and job requirements did not change. The most enjoyable part of the job was interacting with the residents.
good,Warm family environment!  We have fun activities with our residents and family members!  We have a beautiful community!  We have a strong management team!  Great staff!  It is rewarding to see smiles on the faces of our residents every day!!
good,"Assisted patients with things such as taking medication, getting themselves ready to go out into the society appropriately, assisting with any necessary assistance needed, such as putting on shoes/socks, jewelry, clothings."
good,"Quick on your feet job, being attentive of what's going on, and what my residents are in need of. I truly enjoyed my position at Emeritus Senior living. Getting to know someone in such a personal way and becoming a part of their already life experiences and reminising with them about their past the sharing of their 50+ years of marriage and trials in life the most exhilarating to me as a resident assistant."
good,As long as you do your job and do it correctly and go home you will be fine. Don't talk to management if you don't have to and don't be to friendly... they will stab you in the back later or when you least expect it.
good,I only worked there for a few mos. before my car broke down but it was a good job with good pay and the management was helpful and was there when i needed them.
good,Taking care of my residents and their needs. Providing assistant in other areas that need help. I enjoyed working for brookdale and taking caring of my residents. Making them happy.
good,I inexperience a lot of different attuides there irs a goid fun place to work but the only thing they switch companies to much and they all come with different rules and regalations
good,Good place to work. I believed in what I was doing caring for the elderly. Management was fine felt like I got a fair shake. I did get a fee lunch there.
good,"The staff and environment are great.  The management plays favorites and are therefor responsible for a culture of complacency/laziness with half of the staff.  Corporate is always worried about the bottom line so we are always short staffed.  the facility is a good place to work, thanks to the awesome care team, but it could be great if management would be managers."
good,"I really do love my job, but they are really shooting themselves in the feet by not paying their CNAs more. They wonder why we leave, but won't give us raises to keep us around. The job needs to be done, and I can't work 12 days in a row because we're short staffed all the time."
good,"enjoyed working with my seniors, some staff members as well good team , not to happy with management at the time .place needed some upgrades n soft touches ,and more communication to employees .."
good,It's a joy to work with the senior community. There is room for transfers to other facilities. It is located in a good area. Nurses are easy to work with. Excellent opportunity for the right person.
good,"For an individual with little college education, Brookdale Senior Living can be a good fit depending on what you are looking for. In all of the individual Brookdale facilities I've worked for, management has been conducive to my busy life schedule. In my experience, management tries to help subordinate associates be successful in their function and their goals. There is also room for some advancement depending on your abilities and education level."
good,"I love my job and the people. The problem is the PAY, not enough for the work that I do. As a housekeeper and the amount of work that is done I don't feel that the pay is comparable."
good,this job was a great place to work for. they always had activities for the residents and staff. they showed great appreciation to their employees. they staff was very nice
good,Hardest part of the day was lack of help and never any acknowledgement for what you have done. The shifts never communicated and you were always blamed for what the other shift did not do. over all was a nice place.
good,Very numbers orientation. The lost the focus of the people. Smaller communities have a harder time meeting the expectation with the numbers. We want to keep our residents health should be our goal.
good,It was a demanding job with middle management and sales involved. I  learned many valuable HR skills and supervisory skills in the process. It was hard to get all demands met with less than dependable staff involved. I enjoyed working with the senior adult residents and caring for them.
good,Prior management was awesome to work for. They did things to boost moral of staff which was passed on to residents in quality of care. When that management no longer worked there moral went down and resident care suffered. Management did not follow through on previous promises made regarding a promotion. So I left the company.
good,Always a pleasure to enlighten thelives of our senior community. I enjoy seeing the residents when I come in the morning. They always know how to brighten my day.
good,"The staff and residents are amazing!  I loved working at Freedom Pointe. I only left because I moved,  otherwise I would have stayed. I carry the memories of each and every resident I cared for and have made some last friendships with the staff."
good,"Pay is exceptional with reviews consistently and raised given based upon merit. Friendly and fun loving staff. Expect long hours and need to have a flexible schedule, especially working in nursing.  Learned constantly through scheduled monthly meetings and tele conferences. Miss working there; should never have left."
good,"We have nice team here, this company gave me opportunity to grow. It can be busy and stressful sometimes, but it makes you feel good when you can help residents and family."
good,I was a RA at the Brookdale company and i also completed the Executive Director certification program for Assisted Living Facilites. Nice place to work at  and great staff.
good,"I enjoyed spending time cleaning the rooms of the residents. Learned a lot of history and things about the older generation. Loved when they made me laugh and I made them laugh. Very humbling work as well. "
good,"I really enjoyed working for emeritus, I enjoy helping others and getting attached to the residents. The management was kind of lousy and the pay is not ideal for someone who doesn't enjoy this kind of work"
good,"Brocade senior living was a hard job because of the managments decisions. We had about 70 residents and only one RA and one nurse on dutie at all time. The responsibility of that one RA is to give showers to at least 5 residents a day, change linen, do laundry, take vitals, prepare the dinning room for meals, serve meals, assist residents to the restroom and back to their room after meals, clean up after meals, and even put them to bed. It is just a lot of work when you are the only one scheduled for a 12 hour shift."
good,"I love the residents and I love the manager, but, the memory care unit is a lot of work for a little bit of pay. The staff is hard to work with, nobody gets along and there is always personal drama going on. A majority of the staff calls in with little to no consequence, leaving the good employees over worked, tired, and underpaid."
good,"I absolutely love serving and nurturing the elderly in my community."
good,"I worked second shift, so a typical day at work would be me coming in and getting all residents together for lunch, do all the things they need and ask me to do, then take them back to their rooms until it's time to get them ready for bed."
good,"I was a cook and got hired in with no experience. I would cook meals often times all by myself. It was a pretty enjoyable job, I didn't really have to talk to a lot of people, and could just zone in to my duties. Need to be quick at preparing food items though, otherwise this job would be very difficult. All the food preparation is on your head so responsibility is something they look for. Management was never super well in my kitchen, though."
good,"While i cant speak for the company as a whole, working in the kitchen at brookdale is as fun every day as it is a challenge. Dynamic and very helpful team. Theres always something new to learn."
good,"Assisted Living and dementia care is a very rewarding career, especially for those who care very much about their residents.  It is a very busy, non stop day every day, and you never know what may happen.  If you need a well-planned out day, you wouldn't want to work in this field, as there is always a ""drop everything and attend to"" situation happening.  It is rewarding to work with these people who have so much life experience."
good,"Brookdale gets a bad rap, and I imagine it depends on which location you work. I worked in independent living, and it was a joy. The staff and management were all the most dedicated, best people I have ever met. Unfortunately, they do not pay very well. That is okay, because the pace of the job is very slow - you would be making less and doing substantially more work at a fast food restaurant than here."
good,"Freedom Village was a great place to work, I was able to gained a lot of confidence, and knowledge also. My typical day, started out by doing rounds of (common area) residence floors, P.M. check of the main kitchen equipment. After that I would work in empty apartments and get them ready for new occupants."
good,All that I have to say about this place is that they need more hands in the kitchen and better communication between all staff members
good,"Brookdale Is a wonderful place to seek employment. It is more than a job, it is a calling. The amount of training is wonderful and it is full of advancement opportunities."
good,"Nice place to work, good work ethic, great  employee team work which makes it exiting to work there. Management and staff members are cheerful and always ready to meet the needs of the resident. It is a clean facility and looks like home to the residents."
good,"Very small and friendly environment,coworkers one can rely on. Salary is decent,( can be better) a little too much on the numbers sometimes takes away from the care. I guess that  has to do with butget.Management is supportive gets crazy at times when the politic levels outweight good jugement."
good,"A very rewarding environment taking care of senior citizens."
good,"Very fun place to work, with a lot of teamwork and family orientation. Job was very easy going, residents were loving........"
good,If there's anything that I've learned at this establishment is compassion and patience. My co-workers are team players and we help each other hand to hand whenever the help is needed. The most enjoyable part about my job is the smile that comes on the face of the residents whenever they have someone that'll listen and take time out to care about their needs.
good,"i worked at noc shift,usually the resident are asleep..but sometimes they call for help and im with them to help.i learned alot of things about my job and the people around me.my co-workers are very helpful specially when time needed.sometimes the hardest part of my job is one of the resident had to let go.when they're time has come i cant help but cry.but the most enjoyable part of my job when the resident appriciated my work from them,by saying good compliment it makes me happy.."
good,"The location I worked and in Dunedin was formally Emeritus Senior Living. After Brookdale took over, everything became a lot more organized and more professional. Very pleasant place to work"
good,"I like working with the staff and clients of Brookdale; they are amicable, pleasant, and easy to get along with."
good,"A typical day always went by fast. The most enjoying part of going to work every day was seeing, visiting and helping residents and families."
good,"Working in the Home Health was never in my life plan, but it happened and I have enjoyed it greatly.  Unfortunately unless I want to get a clinical degree I have maxed my potential within the company. I have been acting as the business office manager for three years, while not an official position I have learned a lot. I have also been the acting local HR, IT, Procurement and Intake coordinator. I have a lot of hats to wear but enjoy the challenge."
good,love dealing with senior citizens. made me appreciate life more & would love another opportunity to work with them
good,".•	Assisted elderly residents with daily duties such as dressing, bathing, feeding them"
good,"a day at emeritus was fun i really enjoy my time there."
good,I enjoy being with people and helping them to attain the holistic well being. I am happy with the job and aspire to achieve more progress in career towards healthcare management.
good,I'm a prn status and so far i'm getting less hours of which I hoped could be more as I was expecting. Working procedures are good; I have no complain.
good,"A good company to work for"
good,This was my first official health care job and I loved it. I worked with a great group of people and the residents became family to me. When I left I was told they could never find someone to replace me.
good,"A typical day at work would be clocking in, checking any notes left behind from the previous shift, checking on your residents, assisting them with anything needed. showers, escorting residents to activities, dinner, movies and then to their room, assisting them with any late showers and getting them ready for bed. What i learned was to have patience, time management, i learned about lifts and wheelchairs, i learned how to left heavy residents, how to take care of some skin tears, I learned customer service and providing the very best so that the resident and their families could be comfortable and satisfied. Management had their good and bad times. Overall they were just okay. My co-workers were good and helpful for the most part there was some drama so I rather would keep to myself. The hardest part of my job was to bond and making amazing connections with residents then seeing them move away because they needed more help, or simply seeing them pass away. The most enjoyable part was meeting such inspiring people, bond with the residents and hearing about how they looked for me on my days off. Even though they couldn't remember my name they let me know I was their favorite. "
good,I Learned that team work and communication play a very important role in todays work place.
good,"Process insurance claims to the primary, secondary and tertiary insurance companies. Call on balances to get payments processed or for clarification on partial payments or denials."
good,"Enjoyed working with Seniors, staff and family members"
good,The residents are great and I have learned a great deal from them.
good,"PROS- Good place to work. flexible when needed. Support available from other departments. Salary good with good benefits. "
good,Friendly work environment. Easy to do job and fun at times. Management was good. Residents are friendly. Gained a good cleaning routine in the kitchen and dish pit.
good,Brookdale was a nice place to work I would still be there but have relocated.  The unit I worked on was assisted living with couples it was endearing to see how they took care of each other.
good,I enjoyed working for Brookdale and wished they had an opening closer to my home because the main reason I left was due to the long commute. I would reapply for another job with this company which is not something I can say about other senior living employers.
good,I have worked here for a short time. It has been very interesting because I worked for them in two different states and it was different from state to state. my co workers have been a plus and has made the job a fun place to work in both states. Only time will tell but so far so good.
good,As the Executive Director at Brookdale I was able to work with many amazing individuals who gave their heart and soul to serving our residents.  Brookdale has the system's to run a very efficient business.  It's the people that make the difference.
good,"Brookdale is about taking care of people who are like family. The residents are fun to be around, and there's always a fun event going on that celebrates them. At Brookdale, we celebrate life."
good,Everyday is different there are some days that I know what my day is going to be like and there are other days that I am not certain on how my day is going to go. Management is sometimes terrible at finding enough people to be able to give quality care to every resident. Coworkers are willing to work as a team and try to work towards the goal of giving every resident good quality care.
good,"The job is great, I really don't have any issues there the nurses are easy to work with. I work double weekends so I don't have much interaction with management."
good,Brookdale is a nice place to work but their communication isn't much. The management is terrible. Certain employees can get by with more than others. They have policies set up but they are not enforced on everyone. The pay is decent for the area.
good,I worked at Brookdale Carlsbad for 5 years as the HR Director and loved my job!  You’re only as good as the team you work with and I truly worked with the best!  All of you are amazing at what you do!  The staff really cares for the residents as if they were their own family.  The community runs well because of the great staff and the leaders who really do care and do their best to support each other every day.
good,"Nice place to work, good environment, nursing staff is friendly and helpful, areas are clean and well cared for, not much room for advancement or raises"
good,The staff was geared to meet the needs of new clients within 24 hours.  In most cases everyone worked to achieve all goals within the expected time frame.  The nurses and therapists truly worked as a team and I found there were very few instances when the staff did not do their utmost to get the patients needs met.
good,Challenging environment in a fast paced atmosphere. The most fulfilling part of the day was knowing that you accomplished all of the tasks required to satisfy the needs of the residents and by being told by them just how much you were appreciated.
good,It's a good place to work it gives you the flexibility to work on the time and days that is convenient for you and also be able to deal with different types of people without no excuse
good,This was an Assistant Living Facility. No two days are alike. You are there for the residents and family members. Things are known to change on a moment notice. You keep daily weekly and monthly logs to stay organized.
good,Good place just made a lot of changes that wasn't helpful to the workers. Good place because of how many locations if you need to relocate at anytime but just isn't good for non salary workers.
good,You must love your job to work in a high stressed field as feeding and cooking meals for senior citizens. You have to make sure all three meals are ready for service. There are restrictions that most be followed. But getting to know your residents is the plus.
good,"excellent opportunity, who is looking for challenging fast paced environment."
good,I worked at several Brookdale communities. Some have great management which is reflected in excellent community. Others have very poor management and that is reflected in staff dissatisfaction and lower level of patient care.
good,"Fun Workplace because I am passionate about working with seniors."
good,Nice place to work. I love the residents they are fun to interact with. If you are a hard worker and love being around the elderly this is the place for you.
good,"Flexible Hours"
good,Love working for Brookdale. Residents make it worth while. I couldn't ask for a more rewarding job. I wake up ready to serve as a helper to wonderful people.
good,"Productive and fun workplace with daily activities. Monthly"
good,Brookdale has a national presence with several communities in the Ohio Area. The company provides a competitive pay and comprehensive benefits package. Management is cooperative and encourages a collaborative environment. The workday is well-paced and a team environment is encouraged to effectively meet work objectives.
good,Fast paced and ever changing work environment. Professional management and staff. Many learning tools to keep up with the necessary changes made by the company and state regulations.
good,"Met a lot of different people, and got to learn from their experiences. Learn about their likes and dislike, good days and bad one's. The little things that they are able to do for themselves and the pleasure they're able to get from it."
good,Positive influence in the community. Worked well the assisted living and local hospital. Positive team environment and everyone supports each other. Will miss office.
good,A typical day in the office can be stressful at times but I've learned alot in the past 4 years and the hardest part of my job is claims but I tend to manage it everyday and keep a positive attitude for my co workers.
good,Enjoyed varied work assignments and opportunities to provide the technical maintenance services expected of the position.  Management was very very team oriented and focused.
good,"While some of the coworkers were disappointing, and many of my managers were inept, the residents and the easy going environment was very relieving as a server."
good,"Brookdale is honestly the best assisted living community I have worked at thusfar. The staff are wonderful and really care about their residents, and the residents are a delight to work with as well. It can get a little hectic at times, but the knowledge that I'm doing something meaningful with my time makes it worth any stress that may occur while on the job. I wouldn't want to do anything else with my career path in life than to be able to help people the way I do here."
good,"Brookdale is a very loving and friendly community that allows you to interact personally with the residents and their families.However, they did not provide any benefits to me as I was only part time. Although I was part time, I would still work 7 days in a row at times and be asked to stay over 10 hours a day with no dividends pay for working more hours than I was supposed to."
good,Residents were always a delight and appreciative! I loved listening to residents' life stories they wanted to share with you. I highly enjoyed my employment experience.
good,Not a bad place to work. Professional but laid back staff and management. Easy to work with your schedule and see patients when needed. On call still needed some tweaking.
good,Brookdale Medina North is a great place to learn to be a resident care assist. I started here 5 years ago and it's a great place to grow. I never had a job taking care of people until i came here. Its just great making the last years of someone's life special!
good,"I came to work for this company by interviewing on the phone when I was moving from Mi to Tn. I was told I could use my Medical Assistant skills for the position. I went to the interview and was interviewed for dish washer, but the ED soon learned I was there for another position. I was hired that day and began computer training the next day and ended up working Memory care the same day. Later, I was told I have to be a LPN/RN to do the job I had been hoping for. I have stayed on as a resident caregiver but the job has turned into much more, such as nursing home care. I am more qualified for a better position at this company but I do not see me being chosen to do so with the care needed and not being a certified LPN. So I would like to go back to retail and finish college toward a better degree."
good,"Professional and a fun place to work."
good,Being There At Brookdale Was A Great Experience And Helped Me Gain More Experience Up My Belt. working With Others And Being Able To Experience New Positions.
good,"I enjoyed prepping, cooking and serving to on average of 65 residence daily for breakfast, lunch and diner. I loved getting to know the residence and they will forever hold a special place in my heart."
good,"Filling the daily physical, and emotional needs of the residents. Every day is different working in memory care. I learned to be patient and to appreciate the little things in life, and family a little more. I learned that even though they are losing pieces of themselves from their disease, they still can have good quality in life. Residents with good care and attention, can have very fulfilling lives to the end."
good,"A good place to work, Daily activities include all aspects of resident care to include meal prep, dressing, feeding, bathing, entertainment."
good,"A typical at Brookdale for me is lots of residents asking questions, sitting and taking with the residents, greet residents as they approach  my reception area. Also greet visitors and direct them to where they need to go. The hardest part of my job is getting to know my residents and their families then to have them move out or pass away. One must have compassion and love for people to work in and around a senior living community. most enjoyable is learning daily the residents and that they are interesting folks and have lots of life stories. They are very loving and only want to be loved and appreciated."
good,Brookdale is a great place to grow and learn. You are able to advance in any department you are in. The culture is very good and the people are nice. Everyone is helpful .
good,"Friendly and caring staff. Typical day include working at desk, answering phone calls, and typing. Co workers are hardworking and honest."
good,An overall good place to work for. Slow getting anything done as the chain of command stretches far. Great place for advancement and causal dress code is always a plus.
good,Love the environment and the people I work for have become family. The residents get really close to you. It is a clean place that. There are many activities they do that the residents and the employees enjoy doing. There is never a boring day.
good,Prepare dining area for residents to eat...Try to make it as enjoyable as possible. All our servers work well as a team. The best part of my job has been getting to know all our residents
good,A typical day includes getting resident up and ready for breakfast.  Answering pages.  Passing medications and doing whatever else is required.
good,"Good Company.  Worked with alzheimers and dementia residents. Prepared meals daily, ordered food and supplies for kitchen. kept up with inventory daily."
good,"Busy facility, Friendly associates, Clean, Knowledgable people, excellent team work, great communication, welcoming atmosphere, secure facility, wonderful residents, fun activites. A really great mission."
good,I enjoyed caring for the residents on a daily basis. Brookdale's company foundations and what they stand for are respectable. They truly try to put the resident first! Also room for advancement.
good,"Lots of variety in work. Learned alot about Home Health, Medicare and different insurance companies.  Majority of work is done on the computer."
good,"Managers and Executive Leadership are extremly personable. Wonderful collaborative team atmosphere. Culture is fun, relaxed but professional. Many great advancement opportunities."
good,Love working with the team at my community and helping all of our families and residents.
good,A typical day at work would be to arrive for each shift on time and memorize the featured menu items of the day. As soon as the dining room doors open we were to immediately begin to care for our tables and start them out with their soups and salads as well as take their dinner orders and place them in the kitchen. In between tables we were to help to clear and set up other tables for business. Near the end of the shift we were to serve desert and then begin to clean up and set up for the next shift as well as to complete any side work.
good,"I work in a secured memory care house.  I enjoy working with memory care.  I assisted with 5-7 residents in a house with 26 beds. The most hardest part of the job would have to be seeing the residents confused through out the day and not having the correct words to always comfort them.  I handle behaviors almost daily with some residents and I have learned to be patient with assisting residents with daily activities.  I love being there for the residents on a daily basis.  Knowing that even though they are confused and unsure about what is going on around, knowing that I am there to help me that see that smile or even have a small conversation with them makes up for the hard times through out the shift."
good,"I enjoyed my time at Emeritus and learned a lot about how to deal with people with dementia and Alzheimer's. It was a great place for a first-time caregiver to get some hands on experience, and they ease you into it at my facility rather than throwing you in. My gripes are few, but they're pretty big. Instead of paying overtime they'd front you an extra hundred bucks for doing a double as a bonus, which would be taken out in taxes, so I was basically working 16+ hours from time to time for no extra money. They also had a hard time replenishing stock, especially gloves, soaker pads, and briefs. And if you're a CNA, you know you can't live without gloves. The first of the month almost every month things got backed up and supplies were short, but if you complained loud enough it would get back on track."
good,"Unorganized job place, management always coming and going so all falls down on the lower workers. strong co workers relationships and residents are very sweet and like family."

Everyday you feel fulfilled and like you really are making a difference.

I was encouraged, supported and was able to advance to higher level positions. I personally had great bosses and will definitely go back in a heartbeat when the time is right for our family. Great experience & loved my time there."
good,this company was relaxed and I didn't mind working for them they providing free meals and management was always fair. but being in the dining department meant a lot off call offs and more than often I found myself working the entire department alone

Brookdale offers okay compensation.   If you are a workaholic with no kids and no spouse, go for this job.   The best part of the job was the smiling faces of the residents. Staff that works there is dedicated to the job and they need to be treated well because without them the place would crumble, but they need to be watched as well because they try to take advantage.

The enjoyable  part of the job is interacting  with residents  during specials brunches."
good,This job is extremely satisfying. Taking care of people who have difficulties doing so for themselves is highly rewarding. Work days are early and difficult but worth it.
good,This job is very good to there employees and staff. I've learned more about team work in this company than an others I have worked for.

good,"It's a great place to work and learn. When you first get your CNA license this would be the best place to start out.

I've learned how to better understand the needs of someone older and of someone that has dementia. The hardest part of my job is trying not to get attached to the residents that I take care of. It is very hard because you should have the kind of heart to be able to do the job that we do at brookdale. The most enjoyable part of my job is going into work and outing a smile on my residents faces.

good,"fun work place with supportive management. not all about the numbers but how you personally grow and develop. Decent amount of red tape and politices, but this is expected of a big company. the most enjoyable part of the job was working alongside my colleagues and learning from them, the office started to get crowded as the company grew and it was more difficult to get to know the new people. there was a lot fo variety in what i did each day. ranging from the monotonous tasks to new projects that were challenging and exciting"

good,Enjoyed working with everyone there. Flexible hours. Sometimes the drive was not worth going to see 1 patient. Computer charting. Staff was good about coordination with each other.
good,it takes everyone to keep a community going like clockwork.days go by quickly especially ones with fun activities.it was as if you were working at home.
good,"As a waitstaff at Brookdale are goal and job is to serve pleasant food to the senior citizens that live there. We make sure they get everything they ask for, we make sure everything in the dinning room is clean and we make sure that before are shift is done, everything is done and perfect for the next day. I learned a lot of patience in this job and i learned to commun8icate so much better as well. The management and co-workers do help you with certain things. The hardest part is most definitely the patience you need. Working with the elderly is never easy.  But at the same time its my most enjoyable part of the job. I love working with them, even though it is not then most easy job."

good,"Great staff, good work environment, wonderful residents. Input valued,good in-services . Good support staff. Hardest part of the job was losing residents  when they passed."
good,Typical day included serving numerous residents lunch and dinner.  I learned how to function in a fast paced environment and getting along with teammates to work together.  Management was pretty organized.  Hardest part was if you got behind as a server trying to play catch up with as many residents as there are.  Best part of the job was the food.  It was really tasty.
good,"my day always starts in preparing things in a fast move which made me more faster moving than before making my self busy and with out even noticing the time is over. i must say ive learned a lot because of this learn to manage my time ive learned how to deal with different people even though sometimes its pressured because every single worker needs to meet the expected care they want it to be, the most enjoyable part of it is in the middle of stress i can still turn everything into happiness between my co workers and residents im always trying to kick away the negative vibes around and make things possible even sometimes its not."
good,I have learned that caring for someone who is unable to care for themselves is an experience. Most people can walk and brush their hair and for those who cant gives you a chance to provide the necessary care they need.
good,"I come to work with the intention of enhancing the lives of the residents.  It is a joy to work with them and find out what their concerns are and respond to their needs.  "
good,"My typical day began by attending my morning meetings.  I would update the other managers on what went on in Memory Care over night.  After, the meeting return to Memory Care  where the party begun.  My love for people, made me love everything about my job.  In memory care we the staff operated as a family living in a private community.  It was often hard to say good-bye to a resident passing away.  We grieved as a family along with the residents family.   I think my most precious  moment was when a family lost their love one and to pay tribute to myself and my staff , we were mentioned in the obituary.  The family wrote a letter to company expressing their complete satisfaction under my leadership.  I loved the staff and family members I worked with."
good,"This company closed most of its Chicago operations and moved them to Milwaukee, WI. "
good,"I love working for Emeritus. It is challenging, rewarding and social."
good,good place to work. great team members. they do promote you in company.
good,"I love the service that I give to Emeritus Senior Living of Towson everyday. A typical day for Me is making sure my building is safe,clean and secure. I welcome the residents every morning, I know all of them by name, I give them a very detailed cleaning of their private rooms.the most enjoyable part of my job is giving back everyday. I treat My Emeritus Family as My Own Family. I've learned that working for seniors is a rewarding experience."
good,another fast paced job but good with interacting with people was fun also. i had alot of fun working with my co-workers and good times with my managers.
good,Brookdale gave me the opportunity that I needed to work in memory care. The staff and the residents are welcoming and attentive. Definitely good memories.
good,is a awsome place for residents to live their lives in peace with no stresses of life. Just to have fun and try out luck with a blackjack table
good,"Brookdale culture teaches that even staff is the customer, hence, to serve others is the objective.  Serve our seniors and serve one another at all levels.  My Executive Director was an amazing man of integrity, always available, caring and professional.  I loved hearing the stories from the senior residents; so very rich in heritage.  The most difficult part was not enough time in the day to complete all the tasks at hand."
good,Overall is a very good company. Very busy place. Managers and employees work very hard to make Brookdale the best. The hardest part of my job is that the frienships with my residents are a lot of the time short. So everyday I smile and hope to make everyday a good one for them. The stories that they share are what I enjoy the most.
good,"work hard and too fast, if no can't complete my day duty"

good,"a typical day at work is going in set up tables make sure waters are placed on tables, make sure there are napkins, silver ware, coffee, and condiments"
good,Worked independently
good,Working at Brookdale was very nice to me a typical day at work was taking care of my Residents and hearing how their night went.The management team was alright and what I mean by that everyone had to their job but their was some that took it over board;Example like they didn't know how to talk to staff but other than that they were alright.The hardest part about my job is when a resident passed that just broke my heart.The most enjoyable part of my job was when I know I did what I was suppose to do to make my resident feel loved and felt like if they were at home.
good,I had the pleasure of working in Brookdale during two very hard transitions in my life. It was hard to stay down around fun energetic co- workers; great stories and advice from residents and instructed by well rounded management.
good,"Good people to work around, But they went through too many ideas already in the past year and have a lot to work in! Learning a new job and new experience working for a retirement home is the best thing to see how life goes!"
good,A typical day at work is assisting clients needs and wants. Management was okay. Hardest part of the job was lifting heavy clients. Most enjoyable time was spending time with the clients who were very friendly & felt like grandparents to you.
good,My night at work contained giving medication my most hardest part off the job was seeing  my residents pass away I most enjoyed talking an getting to no my residents   I don’t like that the staff is getting payed less for all of the work we have to do
good,I enjoy my job I would like to move up with the company. My schedule is flexible. I love coming into work with a positive and happy attitude. I love to cook and to meet the residents needs on the foods they like along with there diets. Love planning holiday parties and cooking clubs with the residents they enjoy it as well as the employees.
good,"It was overall a good experience. Worked at multiple locations and there was inconsistency from location to location. Most Management was awesome and supportive. They had some not so good ones that were pretty nasty to people, but they were fired and I feel the company is revamping and correcting those issues. I had an overall good experience and felt I was treated fairly"
good,Very busy and demanding.  Great  orientation and support.  No advancement for a PTA.  Need to drive an see many patients in one day.  Can be challenging to schedule them all.
good,"The management team is very easy to work with, they are all involved with the wellbeing of both residents and associates. The care staff are very compassionate and caring to each other and the residents that are here. Dementia care is hard work, but our staff performance is outstanding."
good,"Management is great worst part is difficult residents and some coworkers. Quite a bit of stress, but better than most other kitchen jobs I have worked."
good,"I think if we paid more per hour and hired better quality people who are reliable, then our work experience would be a lot better. "
good,"I will like to work for broodale again, my experience will make a difference, love residents , love watt I do . The employees make a difference for all the residents."
good,"No major complaints. Sales centric company, that does offer continuous training, and uncapped commission. They do value the mission statement and there is continuous feedback."
good,"I enjoy the daily activities in my job. The associates and residents are great to be around. I love that I can help make our community a home for our residents. We can play bingo and cards, work puzzles and occasionally our associates can go out on outings with the residents. The best thing is that we are a team and we all work so good together."
good,"very nice place to work and helpful staff always there to help you "
good,this is a good place to work if the lpn understood people problems outside the work place for an understanding they will leave people hanging high and dry.
good,"You need to memorize the elders routines. Multi tasking is essential in this job.  Some times a shift goes from 7am-7pm if the kitchen is short on staff.  It's a quick environment where you'll eventually get accustomed. Hardest part of the job is carrying a really big tray in my opinion, after a while it does get tiring..which is why carts should be used, but they're not.  Most enjoyable part of the job is making an elder's day."
good,"Brookdale hires the best in class in a person's professional field to provide the very best services possible for their clientele. The company provides great educational opportunities and has a wonderful Mission: Enriching the lives of those we serve with compassion, respect, excellence and integrity."
good,"Nice office with fair distribution of work load.  Can become overwhelming at times.  I enjoy working with employees, patients and physicians.  Only drawback is the location.  90 minute drive one way"
good,"I worked PRN, and worked all shifts.  Overall they had great staff, knew their job and knew how to do it."
good,I have enjoyed working with Brookdale over the past six years because I am able to make a difference in people's lives daily. The management works hard to recognize the good that employees do. They make it known to others how appreciative they are. It seems like they get by paying the low end to employees but the emotional rewards keep employees for 20+ years.
good,its fun to work with the residents  and some staff when you need a hand theres a staff thats willing to help you  you learn history when you can sit and tlk
good,Enjoyed cooking new recipes and enjoyed working with people. We created new recipes and enjoyed trying them and cooking them for customers.  Company had holidays off and rotated certain holidays with all employees to work.
good,It was a decent job it was a lot of fun but sometimes stressful the people there were very cool but not very flexible with the jobs in the kitchen where I worked.
good,"Every day was busy ,but fun ,but it would get hard at times when staff would do a no call no show,or tiring 2 redirect resident's in memory care,but not hard enough 4 me because i LOVE what i do .Management was great and fair with all staff,and 2 me that's very important.wonderful work place .Everyday was enjoyable 4 me i love the challenge,and i am kind,caring,understanding with staff,residents,and there families.I LOVE MY JOB,AND I LOVE WHAT I DO."
good,"You not have a typical day. you learn sow many things to learn with the residents every day is different from the last one and its fun in a lot of ways and it is sad in others it all deepens in the residents mood. The management in this job is good you can talk with your supervisor about any problem and they will work with you to fix it as soon as possible. I love my co-workers they help, if is any problem they will talk to you and resolved it. The hardest part of that job to me was when a resident past away you get in touch with that person because he/she wasn't just a resident it was your friend. And the most enjoyable part of the job for me was to finish my shift every day and had the satisfaction that I did everything I could to give the residents the best help I could."
good,hardest part of the job is when having lunch and the nurses do not want help to answer the calls so you are forced to leave your lunch and go.
good,"I work the Night shift, so everything is very calm through out the night. Unless an emergency with a Resident happens. I give out some night meds to Residents, PRN, do some cleaning and laundry"
good,It was a challenging job simly because management didn't really hire new employees. There was always shortage of people working which made it unfair for residents and employees.
good,It was great to make quality meals around people who care. Staff is caring and management is strong. If quality is your moto this is a great place for you.
good,"The typical day of work at Brookdale was fast paced but yet very enjoyable. One had the ability to interact with and get to know the residents as well as their fellow employees. The team members looked out for on another as well as for the well-being of the elderly. Overall, it was a enjoyable, educational experience."
good,"I work per diem reception as well as sales calls when needed."
good,"Working at Cypress Village is one of my favorite places that I've worked. I enjoy working with the senior community and being able to make their dining experiences enjoyable, makes me happy."
good,"I think everywhere you go, you will have ups and downs and overall I have had ups working for Brookdale. I wish that they cared a little more and that these are people and not a pay check."
good,"Assist the residents with their food orders and bringing their food,beverages and dessert to their tables. Clean up the dining room and each table after the residents leave."
good,"Brookdale has great opportunities if you want to advance in the medical field, great experience. The many resources Brookdale can provide may open doors to job advancement in and schooling to become certified."
good,A typical day at Emeritus was having fun all the time with residents and staff while we all worked very hard we all enjoyed what we did. I learned how to pass medications quickly and accurately. The management at Emeritus were hard working fun people as well. We all worked together as a team. Having a resident pass away and  trying to comfort the family  is always the hardest part of being a CNA in my opinion
good,"Diverse working environment, residents keep you on your toes, outstanding team work, hard work balanced with fun."
good,"As a volunteer for this company, I was slightly limited to the work I was allowed to do. However, even as a volunteer I gained a lot by working with individuals with Alzheimer's and similar memory disorders."
good,I was able to work the hours I wanted which allowed for great work/life balance. I learned information to help advance my career. My team of management and co-workers were great to work with. Glass ceiling was evident from day 1.
good,"Working here was like always having family . There was always someone there to watch your back ,and someone there to stab you in it. There was a lot of drama here with fellow co-worker and the gossip wheel keep moving . But I loved the job security , my friends , the residence, and I love that if I ever needed a job Brookdale would always be my home."
good,"Enjoyed my team and working with the cna's, the residents are wonderful."
good,When I worked in Brookdale senior living I love to meet others talk with them leaned about them and their family. my co-workers help me in anything I wanted such in my personal life and all so in a work place area.I always Like to be friends with everyone including my managers.
good,"process invoices"
good,Average day is to oversee the operation of the community from nursing to dietary to make sure that all families and residents have  a pleasant living environment since this is the last place that they will call home.
good,"Early start,taking on previous night issues,walking bldg. safety checks, check on with executive director at stand up meeting. Check on with marketing director for updates."
good,"Assit residents with ADL, med reminders, escorts, and companionship. Staff is great, residents were the best. the part i enjoyed the most of this job was to be able to know each one of the residents personally"

good,"I am enthusias to see the residents as I work for two days per week. "

good,They r a good company to work for  if u don't get around some of the employee that r kind of snotty other than that it is a good place to work if that kind of work is what u r looking for
good,They give you a sense of job security and there's room for growth here! There are always options to transfer and positions to work remotely as well. The company is very flexible and family friendly.
good,EVeryone and everything about brookdale was amazing. I would recommend anyone to work there. Not much to complain about. Everynone is so very helpful and fun to work with.
good,"I enjoy working for Brookdale. Been there 2 yrs and I love my residents. Been doing this for 10+ yrs now, and these 2yrs here have been the best. Yes there's some bad, but that's just how it is."
good,Everyone feels like family. When we have been understaffed there is always some co workers that help out and team work to get things done. Myself and my coworkers always put the residents needs and wants before our own. Our activity lady always has fun things for our residents to do. Our dining room and kitchen staff have made big improvements over the last few months
good,the culture of the resident comes first is evident throughout the company.  the team involvement with the regional team was great and very helpful.  I'd work there again.
good,I love working with the elderly because I serve protect n enrich the lives of those I serve with respect integrity  compassion n excellellence  n it my daily part of success of what I do best I do love caring go the elderly
good,The overall job is cool the advancement you can obtain is like nothing you can possibly imagine. The staff is fairly well the families are awesome. If I could go back to the day I left I'd change everything.
good,Great work environment with friendly therapists.  Wonderful team players. Supervisor always appreciates employees. Hardest part is management lacks appreciation towards employees.

good,"Well try to get things ready for the residents. Start to serve their drinks then after we know the menu we ask the residents what they like to eat. Then serve their food when we got their plates and serve it to them and when I see them down with their food I take their plates and give it to the guy that washes the dishes."
good,"I've learned valuable skills that will latter aid me in future endeavors. Gained valuable insight on the company and how it functions. The most enjoyable part of the job, is caring for the patients. You come to grow and establish relationships and memorable moments that you will always cherish with the patients."
good,I am a part of the management team. I enjoying helping my residents everyday and being a leader for the staff
good,"Working at Emeritus is hard work, you got a lot to do in little time, only the best candidates are selected. Every day is a good day of honest work earning honest wages, I thank God for my managers their good people, and every night I relax with the satisfaction of a job well done."
good,"Coming into work your greeted evertime by the residents. Working in the kitchen was great. we had a small team and we always got the job done on time. My co-workers were one of the best parts, they always helped you when you needed it, I had never felt like my job was in the balance. the hardest job was dealing with the extreme heat of the dishwasher but other than that there was nothing hard about the job. The most enjoyable part of the job was talking to the residents and helping them out because they showed a great deal of appreciation."
good,I enjoyed working with residents and the employees retraining old employees
good,"all around great place to work, good management, clean facility, food could be better. hardest part of the job was residents passing away (natural death)."

good,Management was very unconcerned with employees very rude and snotty but overall the business itself is great just need better management
good,"Brookdale Union has had its ups and downs. Under the new team of management changes are taking place for the good. Pay could be increased for the amount of work being done, however the you can see the change that has come about. I look forward to many many more years to come being apart of this Brookdale Team"
good,All employees work together well and get their jobs done. The benefits are great. The management here is really amazing and helps to create a very inviting and comfortable environment to work in.
good,"Good working relationship with other Managers. Took care of Residents needs quickly and with compassion. Good place to work and build a career. Not micro-manged, able to make decisions and changes without someone peering over my shoulder. The culture is well in place to promote a healthy loving home for Residents needing assisted living arrangements."
good,Working here is no challenge you must collaborate with your co-workers and work as a team . Hardest part about this job is the fact that you basically have to depend on the speed of the person working ahead of you if they are going at a certain pace you basically go at the same pace since they must do there part of the job before you do yours .
good,"the staff are a good group of people,you can have fun while you work you have the opportunity to meet the residents family and learn their likes and dislikes"
good,working there was very fun with the co workers and staff that you meet. you also create quite a bond with the elders you serve and tend to. the job was simple so long as you follow protocol and regulations.
good,"Working here was okay.."
good,"Upon arrival you enjoy free breakfast and walk through to check on residents and greet. The workday is fast paced, and stress can be a factor when working with reports and family members."
good,I invested quite a bit of time working here because I loved the job and the many different relationships I was able to build. A typical day was filled with set routines but also fun diversions. I learned about the inner working of senior living retirement homes and filled in many positions. Workplace culture was very team oriented and close. The hardest part of the job was losing co-workers and resident you really became close to. The most rewarding part of the job was the relationships you built with co-workers and resident alike.
good,"My opinion of a typical day at work was I came home feeling rewarded. I learned a great deal of information about the medical field. The management was highly organized. The workplace culture was compassionate and relaxed. The hardest part of the job was when one of the residents I grew close to passed way. The most enjoyable part of the job was having the opportunity to help those who could not help themselves anymore, learning from them, and listening to their stories. I grew as a person, this job offered a whole new perspective on life."
good,I have been in the company for 7 years. I have moved up in several position. They are not judging and allows you the opportunity to advance in different areas of the company.
good,"Working at a place that feels you're home.."
good,I work with the residents from the time I walk in the door! I put up the todays activity flyer with them. I chnage the date and the morning weather board! It is a good feeling everyday I work with the memory care seniors!
good,"The work environment at the Brookdale I worked at was of teamwork, dedication, and the do anything attitude for our residents on a daily basis.  As well as for each other, the culture their created an enjoyable working atmosphere."
good,"Super fantastico!  Ya que trabajar en equipo,en ambiente muy tranquilo y muy organizado! No habia manera de sentir  que el mismo Trabajo fuera abrumador por trabajar tantas horas con muchos pacientes! Simplemente extraordinario!!"
good,"This is my first job. I have been with them since March 28th 2013. I can honestly say I really do love what I do and what I have done there, many people that I have worked with to the people that my associates have taken care of defiantly have made every minute working there! Me personally, I think it is a awesome job for a person who is looking for a first time job. awesome hour's works with your schedule not the other way around."
good,"A day at work at Brookdale gives me the opportunity to meet people and help out those in need. It always begins with a smile, greetings, hugs and embracing our patients as we help them with activities of daily livings. I realized that just a common smile can positively change the mood of our patients and makes someone happy again. The management is great and so caring. Also working with other co-workers, makes work easy and more fun. The hardest part of my job is to encounter a patient in pain and can not physically do anything to take away the pain from them. What I enjoy most in my job is that I really have to explore all aspects my live to reach out to my patients: physical strength to help out, my psychology to understand their needs, and above all the love I share with my patients. I love doing my job."
good,great company great people great residents good co workers
good,"I have worked for Brookdale for close to 4 years. There is opportunity for advancement if you express an interest and talent. It's unfortunate people have such negative remarks; individuals need to be self responsible for their job choices. To say pay and benefits are bad is, well, a part of research employees should conduct prior to accepting a position then make the best overall personal choice. No organization is perfect; however culture is important and not always easy to get to every associate at every level."
good,Working at this community you are surrounded by team members that ask what more can I do to help you? Success is an all team approach and leadership team treats both employees and residents with kindness
good,"Very,reliable,great punctuality, and very energetic.To obtain a position where I can utilize my skills, and grow as an professional,leadership, and twamwork."
good,I enjoyed working with this company helping patients with rehab and long term care patients I enjoyed the interaction with the families also ..........
good,This job was so rewarding because i loved my clients you get attached to the m and they become part of your family and their love wouldn't want to trade it for anything
good,"Loved to go to work every day. Love my Residents and learning something new every day from them. Having the time to sit down and talk and making the day of a resident, is what im there for, they are my second family!!!"
good,Since i applied here they didnt give me a uniform. Only the one of co workers this gave me a uniform. What management is this? They dont care about the employees and who really working hard for the this company they dont value there employees.
good,Day at work was great.  I learned to interact with my co-workers as a team player.  My was always watching his workers.  Workplace was clean and workers was on time with their duties.  Nothing was hard about the job and the most enjoying part of the job was entertaining the senior that live there.
good,"There were alot of good caregivers,medication aides and nurses that worked for the company. But there were a couple of bad medication aides that made it bad for everyone else. They just thought they could do anything and get away with it which was true at this particular facility the director of nursing was letting anything pass. My overall experience was ok but could have been better without the favoritism."
good,Messy!!!!it's always something!!!The department heads have the pick and choose system..if you not one of they friends or one of they family members you will get picked on & talked about on All shifts...Everybody knows Everybody business!!!
good,Loved all my co-workers. they offer great health benefits. If your in need of hours to work then this is the place to go! The residets are the reason you stay.
good,"I have been prn since I started.  I even expressed interest in a position that opened up for wellness director. I have managerial experince and would have made a amazing director,  but they hired someone from outside.  I was never even interviewed for the position.  I have never been offered part time or fulltime.  And when I apply on indeed for fultime positions,   no calls are received for a position.  Human resources at Brookdale gives me good reviews but still waiting for part time or fultime position at Brookdale.  Very disappointed."
good,There is stuff that needs to be brought to state attention but management don’t care and allow stuff to happen that shouldn’t  and caregivers are mean to residents and yells at them
good,enjoyed working with residents. they treated me like granddaughter. Staff was different every day. . CEO has never contacted me since hurricane. Facility is nice place
good,"i worked at brookdale love the company itself the managment left little to be desired i worked alot came in 15 minutes early all the time yet i would have to wait till whenever the other co-workers felt like coming in nothing was said or the call offs i could set my watch by but i get severely sick went to e.r brung a note to manager i was told n i qoute you dont sound sick when i went to e.r. i got diagnosed with svere sinusitus, still came to wrk in which i got pneumonia n was told i wasnt sick by my manager called ems as i couldnt breathe n the admitted me to hospital, when i got out i brang my paperwork in to manager which didnt have the time to talk to me so i left a copy of my release from the hospital n i quit, it wasnt the company just the way its being ran brookdale itself is a great company n wouldve love to remain an employee, just the the politics that were going on i did not agree with its against your policy to pre pop meds yet it is being done not only that but certain employees would give out all meds at one time to residents to get then out there face they would take ffood  away from residents so they can get them medicated n down for the night so they can hang out n chat like a  little click when i report whats goin on they ignored it as  there all friends n party together the RN tina n even  the.E.D. which is the one who acted like i was lying bout my ilness n stated to my face very unproffesional  especially for an E.D. thank you for letting tell what was going on at brookdale in colorado springs maizeland n academy n thats why your turn over is so high,"
good,this company has no morals with the employees nor the clients that live there. they are not the best company to work for . they only cared for themselves not anyone else
good,"The managers in this one phase are horrible. They tell scream and stand around mocking residents. I got trained In a different phase and that lady was equally as mean awful and horrible to all the employees. I saw this numerous times. "
good,I enjoy my job very much I love working with elderly people. I enjoy working with the staff in all departments. You get to talk to people that lived life in a time without computers or Internet t0he things we have today. These people have lived through wars and knew the true meaning of family.
good,"Tons of issues with terrible management , LPNS, CNAS, and 2nd shift supervisors. Okay place to work depending on who you're with. Quickly goes by. Usually very stressful and tiring"
good,I enjoyed working for Brookdale. The census and nursing staff are better than many facilities I have worked for. The pay could definitely improve but the environment and the work place culture made up for the few dollars difference in pay.
good,Brookdale is awesome except they give u an outline of how your day should go like at this time you should bathe the residents and that's fine but when u don't meet all your tasks they ask why and its honestly because you can't account for someone having an accident aka bathroom incident or an accident period. Plus u can get hung up just trying to be nice and courteous to families and residents that u can't stay on task and the laundry is ridiculous. It would be an awesome job had they had housekeeping and I would've gladly stayed.
good,I really love the residents there I enjoyed my time there I had a very bad miscarriage so I had to rezine never was late never had rites ups got along real good with the residents n higher authorities
good,great residents and I love what I do the workplace is awesome it could use some improvement and it would be great  the hardest part of the job honestly there isn't one
good,"A typical  work day start at 6:00 am  with the pagers going off for residents who are ready to get out of bed, washed and get dressed to go to the dinning room for breakfast which starts at 7:30. I learned that management will always be management. Work culture is a sociable and friendly area, where residents and workers get along okay. The hardest part of the job was working under staff, but the most enjoyable part was spending time with some of the residents who enjoy having your company and a good laugh."
good,This job was the best job I have had. I enjoyed this job very much because not only are you helping others but you feel good doing it. This job is hard work but if you put yourself to it you can make it feel like a home.
good,Brookdale West Palm Beach has a great team atmosphere and provides excellent care to its residents. The building has an amazing vibe to it and I would strongly recommend touring the facility
good,I good back if i could..cause i love the residents an coworkers. An good hours an money. I enjoy every moment when i was there.a great place to work.i love to go nack
good,"I enjoyed working for brookddale, the residemts were amazing and i considered them grandparents of mine. they voted me employee of the month my first month there."
good,Brookdale was a excellent job the people there was amazing from the staff to the residents I loved working there if I didn’t get sick I will be still working there I would recommend anybody to try it.
good,Great place to work .  Working with the Elderly is a great experience for everyone who has a Heart. Kindness and passion go a long way. This could be your grandparents on day.
good,Loved every second of this job. I wish I didn't leave Texas. The residents made me happy to come to work and I had the greatest boss ever. I really miss working there.
good,"Excellent service, would definitely recommend families,  and friends to move their loved ones here,  Staff is friendly,  makes you assist of their family."
good,The residents are very well taken care of by admin & staff. The food us good & plentiful. Thete are a lot of activities for the residents. They could participate or not. Bingo was the favorite.

good,"Long hours, hot temperatures, co-workers joining forces to build the Jeep.  People will really come together when the need too.  Some people read a manual/book and think they can tell you how to properly perform the functions of your job.  Not seeing my children, because of the seven day mandatory work weeks.  The pay was the greatest!!!!!"
good,Great learning experience for me good teamwork and very professional. Wonderful residents and great facility to work at. ............................................................
good,Management could have been more flexible and understanding to my situation. The work that was required was very easy and I liked how there was so much to learn from different departments without actually having to be in that department.
good,"I  enjoyed my ability to both do assessments and conduction in-services and education. My co-workers were stellar: professional, yet warm and friendly. Management knew how to bring the best out of staff and we felt valued. The hardest part of my job was adjusting to softwear that I felt was time consuming and redundant. The most employable part of my job was being paid well for my skills and experience."
good,"Friendly care staff that truly care about the residents that live there. However, sometimes the center is understaffed which makes it hard for the staff to give 100% care to every resident like everyone deserves."
good,you never know what is going to happen when you come onto shift the staff is great the residents are awesome everyone makes it a great place to work
good,I love this job and the residents that I took care of. All of the managers and the employees are wonderful to work with. this job is very rewarding and it has taught me to be a better employee
good,"Great place to work if you love working with seniors."
good,Never before have I seen a group of people so intrinsically interested in helping others. A nationwide organization with 1100+ facilities and over 10 million seniors live within a 10min drive of a Brookdale building.
good,"On your own, they teach you the necessities to develop a good nurse. They challenge you in every way possible. Great therapy department."
good,Brookdale is well run and an excellent example of teamwork. The rehab team works well together and meets all the needs of the patients.
good,Fast paced.  Residents are very welcoming and inviting. For the residents to share their home with all staff and keep their spirits up is so beautiful and makes for a nice day at work.
good,Emeritus is a nice environment where we can interact and socialize with an elderly community whose families may not be close by. It is a good opportunity to show them support and friendship. Volunteer Work.
good,"Friendly atmosphere. Enjoyed everyday of work, everyone from the DON down worked together to make a difficult job at times enjoyable."
good,A very eye opening and wonderful job. I got to experience adversities while working and how to manage them. I love that I learned a lot about myself while working with different types of people.
good,"I learned how to handle hard situations. The management was very helpful with providing information. My co-workers are fun and friendly, they help when help is needed."
good,"A typical day at work would be clock in, check the ADL'S then go do m first round to check on them, take them down for dinner, do someones or a couple of there laundry, bathe them. The hardest part was seeing them pass away. The most enjoyable part of the job was talking, having fun with them."
good,Learned how to answer phones and meal plan also learned how to keep a clean work environment patients and how to be responsible. How to work in the front end of the office also on the outside grounds learned time management and how to care for others that may not have access like I have like getting my own food are even walking to my bed on my own two feet taught me how to appreciate life and the things in it. Prepared me to be a good on time respectful employee and how to have lots of patients. Also taught me how to respect people of authority. The hardest part on the job is seeing people in need and frustrated  when they cant do things for them self's. The best part about the job is I was helping to help people that couldn't help them self's. And all the staff was wonderful group to work with and all very helpful.
good,this company really loves their residents. i really learned how to care and help my patients with working here. everyone lends a helping hand to help. i really enjoyed being with residents to help them with their everyday living.
good,love the job and all the residents . everyday is different my favorite place to work is the assistant living side but I do work memory care as well
good,"Begin day with assisting residents morning showers and dressing, then assist them to the dinning room to serve breakfast. Later assist residents back to their room where most prefer to watch tv until luck time. Some residents go to the lobby where they are entertained by musicians, public speakers etc. After lunch they are later taken back to their room or they sit in the lobby where they socialize until super is served. Once super is over, residents are taken into their room where some like to get their shower and into bed; while others may want to watch a favorite tv show until they are ready for bed."
good,very nice people whenever i had a question they were able to help me  and or point me in the right direction of someone who could
good,Interact with patients adults and children.  Knowing you are doing your best to assist and help everyone.
good,"Working with elders has many ups and downs. My favorite part was walking out of work, knowing I helped as many people I could that day."
good,"Healthcare is not a job for everyone but for those who love to care for adults and dependent people with daily needs. I have passion in the feild of helping people and is what I do best. Customer care is an everyday thing and must be done. Its all about being nice and have a good attitude and that i have. "
good,A good place to work if you are a human services driven person.
good,"The residents were amazing at Brookdale Senior Living, I made sure that their food was suitable to their needs because they are paying a lot of money day in and day out to eat. "
good,I take care of the elderly.  it is a great environment and it is a hospital based nursing home.  the food is great the residents are happy and they get the best care possible. the staff is very friendly caring and compassionate.
good,"Learned how to maintain a $70,000 a month budget that included food costs, labor costs, and operations costs.  At the same time, offered meals to the residents that were nutritious and tasty.  The best part of the job was getting to know the residents and learning their history.  Worked with a great management staff that were always very supportive."
good,"I worked under the dietary manager who was amazing, I enjoyed working with the employees and the residence were amazing as well."
good,Fast pace and high energy would explain a day in the life of nursing at The Inn! The number one thing learned is communication is the key to success. Management is always available and vey helpful. The hardest part of my job is making it look easy! The most enjoyable part is helping others and seeing the outcome!
good,i volunteered to work for about a month it was a great experience.
good,I will recommand any of my family of friends to work for them.
good,"Overall the care workers are very dedicated and loving, great dietary staff."
good,"I answer phones, transfer calls to correct departments, answer any questions I can, greet guests and residents, secure the building at night. I have learned alot about the medical field. Management and co workers are great, I get along with everyone. There is nothing really hard about the job, its fairly easy going. The part I like the most is chatting with the residents and their family members, hearing stories about how they were when they were younger, where they came from, etc Also knowing that I get to make a difference in their daily lives"
good,have fun with co- worker
good,Is nice I like the diversity of people and ages you work with and for. I love the residents they make everything worth it at the end of the day is a good environment to work
good,Loved the residents but management did take a toll on me. I was going above and beyond because I loved my job but I felt it wasn't appreciated and I felt I was looked over for several promotions because I was very outspoken/opinionated about issues going on. But in reality you need a real one on your team and I've found a home and they appreciate me because of it.
good,Short staffed a lot definitely over worked and under appreciated. Overall a good company to work for if you don't have a life. No recognition for hardworking employees.
good,Brookdale is a very quick paced work environment but it very enjoyable if you enjoy working as an STNA or CNA/RCA. The only thing i don't think is fair is the pay i am getting for the work i am doing every day.
good,"Brookdale is a nice place to work , they just need more hours for everybody and then it would be better. The residents are awesome as well and it is easy for you to get along with all of them. It’s just a good environment"
good,"Great place to work "
good,I liked the fast paced environment and got to meet great Seniors living there. Also some of the staff were very nice to work with. It was a very exciting job everyday was different.
good,Great thearpy and nursing team. Hours are flexible on SNF unit. Nursing team is great. CNA care has improved recently. Therapy manager is great and personable. Executive director is more difficult to communicate with.
good,I genuinely enjoyed working here.  I loved working with the residents every day and getting to help them with anything they needed.  The only thing was that the pay was not great.
good,I enjoy working at Brookdale. We have a great team that goes out of their way each and every day to make a difference in the lives of the residents who live there.
good,Adls get ups dressing feeding showering cleaning up area making beds the different changes and how sad it is to have the disease of Alzheimer's or Dementia management was not so well co-workers were awesome worked as a team when a resident would forget what was going on and try swinging at you and enjoyable part was getting to conversatw with the resident and them remember you day to day even though they have Alzheimer's
good,"my day start off preparing breakfast for residents and assist with some feeding. I monitor the resident environmental safety and resident on resident safety. I assist with toilet  and grooming, bathing and assisting with the activities that will engage resident."
good,"Great place to work , I loved the residents and staff but the compensation is bad."
good,"I liked the work, but it is way too micromanaged from the top not leaving your immediate boss to handle things the way they need to. Made it feel like things were being changed daily so the light at the end of the tunnel kept changing distances from you. Great benefits."
good,"I worked as a food server in the Brookdale dining room, so I don't have much experience with full-time positions. Management was always friendly to me, but I have heard of some shady practices of past managers. Definitely a great temporary part-time job during school breaks, but not much else."
good,Residence are very sweet. The team works together to help the residence and their needs. No benefits which sucks but the people make it worth it. All in all great place to work if you're laid back
good,It was a good experience for me to be able to work at Brookdale assisted living. I was able to know how to work and relate with the elderly client. Good place to work
good,"You need to have the passion to work with seniors in order to go by the salary."
good,Nice environment and very nice residents. Staff verry helpful and loving. Well kept place. Great place for your loved ones. Fun activities great food.
good,"The nurses and aides worked very hard, working a lot of overtime covering opened shifts.  The nurse manager and a few of the other managers rarely helped out."
good,"The management is super friendly and the seniors living at the center were super friendly and were thrilled to interact with younger people, especially once they started to remember you."
good,Learned how to do inventory etc  enjoyed helping the elderly and the work enviorment was enjoyable no maim challenges and the most enjoyable part of my job was coming in everyday.
good,I find this company very rewarding because you get to meet and have lots of one on one with the residents.  They enjoyed telling their stories as much as I enjoyed hearing them. Staff was very friendly and helpful.
good,"Very positive, energetic place to work.  Very rewarding to get to know the residents and develop a relationship.  The residents are very appreciative of the care that is provided."
good,"Just a great place to work if you can overlook reverse racial discrimination, which is not company-wide, but it is present. After eleven years, I found out first hand!"
good,"What I learned. to be more proactive an my patients an dimension an Parkinson disease.  an be more management  an my time."
good,"A typical day would be serving residents lunch and dinner and attending their needs. The most enjoyable part of the job was the residents, they kind of adopted the staff and treated us like family."
good,I really enjoyed working here. Co-Workers and the residents were fun and appreciative.  Many activities for residents which made it a fun place to work.
good,"Pay is terrible. Kitchen workers make minimum wage, aides make maybe 11 bucks an hour. Food is great, good quality. Not enough aides to work the floor. Reception and bill the manager is awesome!"
good,"Depending on your team, you really can advance your skill set at Brookdale.  There are some issues with working from home and the benefits are not great."
good,"My co workers and residents are what kept me going to work day in and day out, the management was the complete opposite of welcoming. They kept to each other, and didn’t really offer help when needed."
good,Awesome staff. Delicious food. All kinds of activities for the residents on and off campus. The residents love many of the staff. The little apartments are perfect! Love the little screened porches. The residents love the kids. Good place to work.
good,Great people and great company to be a part off. There is someone always there to help and everyone worked as a team. They help with moving up in the company.
good,"I usually work 11-12 hours per shift. Some days I work 6-8 hours per shift"
good,A great place of employment..My supervised in my dept. Wasn't always on board or on hand for suggestions. Very unorganized. But overall i did enjoy working there. A lot of great people in higher management and residents also.
good,"good company, good management support team. would work for them again, I would get over whemed with the working hours, and call outs. No OT was allowed so it was expected for me to come in. I was over housekeeping and had to workday one New Years  day due to a call out."
good,Brookdale is a great place to work . The residents and staff are good and you'll learn a lot about resident of different race and age with lots of great stories
good,"I enjoyed my time there. I was sad to be moving on. The staff is wonderful there, it is easy to learn the requirements of the positions, and its a comfortable clean work environment."
good,Me and some close friends choice to work at the nursing home over the summer. It was a great experience and it felt good to give back to the community.
good,"A typical day at work was getting office work done in an orderly and fast pace. I learned very quickly that a change of events could happen at any even time in a Memory Care community. And having your books in order was a must. Co-workers were fun and hard working but our leaders were not the best. Went through alot of different Directors and non seem to have the passion that myself and other employees showered our residents with. The most enjoyable part of my job was talking to the residents, hearing their life's work, listening to music and taking a walk with a resident throughout the community."
good,I love the company the best manager is joan she is the best person she love the resident she cares about her staffs she’s an amazing woman I love the residents in memory care I wish I could stay work but just some of the old staffs there are something
good,The hardest part of this job is trying to see patient's around their schedules.  Patient's are very active and management expects therapist to see patient's even if they are not interested in therapy.
good,one a good day work would pick up which would mean more hours but at the same time we would not get enough hours. the residents would be able to watch movies and be able to get their hair cut and as well as their nails for the ladies.
good,Brookdale a good place to work and advance people can be ok management is ok benefits ok I would work for Brookdale again Brookdale a great place to work!!!!!!!!!!!!!
good,Enjoyed working with the elderly. Manager was always trying to involve all resident in activity. Just they could not afford a full time position for me.
good,Job was nice only problem I have is your income but other than that environment is nice everyone is friendly and willing to help succeed and learn both coworkers and management
good,Brookdale  is one of the comfort place i ever worked. no much pleasure  when you does your jobs.we worked togather as a team to make the resident  feel at home.
good,"great environment, management is constantly in contact with team members. monthly in services, meetings communication good,a lot of perks and incentives"
good,"I would refer any friend to work for Brookdale at West Palm Beach because of his friendly environment. The management always goes out of their way to assist both customers and employees. Plus, when I was working with them, they were operating in 27 states which I assume was a good way to keep your employment if you move out of state."
good,I would definitely recommend this to anyone work wise speaking and also to those families who are looking for a fun and loving home for their love ones to stay in.
good,"I love interacting with the residents whether I'm not feeling well they always know how to uplift my spirits, I love hearing how they love something that I have cooked for them."
good,Nice place to work. Loving residents. Caring staff and management. Residents are happy with their care and living status. Clean environment. Staff is very thorough while evaluating a ill patient. Activities and outings are offered to residents on a daily basis
good,I love working for Brookdale. Great management styles that allow you to be the best customer service representative with training to solidify expectations and goals of day to day responsibilities.
good,Even though it was a little fast paced it still was a fun and nice job too have especially if you like working around elderly people all day I would definitely recommend that job too someone who is dedicated too work but is also a kind hearted person.
good,"Meetings, Breakfast, Lunch, Dinner."
good,"The most enjoyable part of this job was working with the elderly, and earning their trust to do what you needed to with them. The hardest part of the job would be when someone passed away. I learned a lot about the elderly as in sicknesses, and their likes and dislikes. A typical day at work was really fast paced, always on your feet, and always something to be done."
good,"typical work day included visiting clients in their homes,mainly in the assisted living facilities owned by the company, but also some in the community.  the hardest part of the job was the on call.  enjoyed the people I worked with and visiting the clients"
good,"The company is great, the vision to serve the communities are valued by 95% of the employees both in the and Corporate Offices.  The emphasis to develop employees are more focused at communities than corporate staff."
good,I get to hang out with grandparents that I enjoy my company and the programs we do every day.  It great being a team player with my other co-workers every day. The hardest part of the job is losing a residents for many reasons. I get so attached to them since I am with them every day all day long. The most enjoyable part of my job is when a resident come up and smiles at me and give me a hug and tells me they miss me not being there.  I makes my heart glow!
good,"Very rewarding work with residents.  You may see my work at Brookdale via web site and on Facebook at the Brookdale Leesburg."
good,Loved the residents and coworkers at this job. I am just ready to find a job with advancement opportunities. In my experience the job made me feel good about showing kindness to the senior residents and I enjoyed knowing them and their families on a personal level to provide individualized care.
good,"Patience is a virtue when working here, lovable people, great atmosphere, outstanding staff. Lots of activities for residents and their families. Well informed."
good,Okay to work at . Been there 15 years. It's a corporate company. L nnir with. Managers are okay. High turn around on employees.  Residents are really nice.
good,"Nice Place to work everyone is so Happy and cooperative the atmosphere there is great, food is delicious, nurses really take what they do serious with compassion."
good,"A nice place to work, you get to meet friendly hard working individuals who are willing to help you when you need them. Management at this job is o. k . not the best, but they do work with you when it comes to scheduling"
good,I love the team work.and caring for my residents.very fun times. I enjoyed the educational part of Brookdale of Columbus the knowledge that I learned at Brookdale of Columbus the knowledge of Alzheimer's care the communication between physician and family members Brookdale is a wonderful place to work.
good,From Start To Finish My Job Here Is Really Good. I Love All My Co-workers & How We Get Along Really Good.. We All Work Together As a Team.
good,"good place to work,We only had two engineers on duty which made it hard to keep up with all the demands sometimes.money was good .hours where good .free lunches."
good,"I loved working at emeritus.. For a very long time. But when caregivers started leaving & we became short, I saw that the management didn't do their part in helping & majority of the caregivers were overworked or overwhelmed. Its a great job with great pay but the conditions at the point were a lot to deal with."
good,Supportive management that encourages teamwork. Wonderful residents and families. Clean facility. Staff strives to enforce great quality care and service.
good,This was a great company with a casual environment. My department got along well and the managers always had their doors open to us. Unfortunatly Emeritus merged with a company out of state and majority of the seattle positions are being eliminated.
good,Co-workers are always supportive. A great place to get your Nursing Career started. Seeing the residents smile is the most enjoyable part of the job.
good,great place to work family members are great and very understanding
good,I loved my job. Didn't feel much like a job at all. I would come in and get residents up. Around 8 it was time for breakfast I served them then I would clean up. After that I was prepare for lunch and assist residents with their showers. I would also wash the laundry and put it away. I loved my co-workers we're really like a family.
good,My typical day at work was helping others who were dealing with Alzhiemers and Dementia.  I learned a lot working for the elderly.
good,"I was in charge of the scheduling of all staff, payroll, correction actions, hiring, firing, criminal checks, accounts payable and many more things through out the day.  My biggest joy was working with family members and their loved ones. Especially the elderly they brought much joy to me and I would do anything to make them smile or make them happy.  Hardest part of the job was seeing how sad the familys were when their love one wouldn't remember who they were or was getting towards the end of life. You could see the pain in their eyes and all I could do was be there for them and listen.  My co-workers did the same always trying to ensure that issues were handled, the care deserved was given, and family was helped when needed."
good,"I enjoyed my position as a RN case manager for Innovative Senior Care Home Health very much.  My typical day at work started with a review of my current caseload of 40-60 patients to check for recertification need, LPN assignment, upcoming resumption of care or discharges. After ""flash' with ADS in Fort Meyers with regional therapy coordinator for updating, I started my day with scheduled home health visits.  Wound care, catheter placement, monitoring, medication management, status update with vital signs, recent changes, and coordination with PT and OT as well as with the facility health and wellness coordinator were included in my workday. "
good,"A typical day at work was long, but interesting. Wonderful residents, and great co-workers."
good,"I enjoyed my time at Sterling House in Mankato, MN. I became very close with my fellow staff members, and some residents became basically family to me. I would highly recommend working in an environment provided by such places at Sterling House and also recommend having family memebers become part of the living community."
good,"This type of work is for people who are passionate about helping others. You do everything, from serving, to dishes to resident care.  If you are working in this type of facility for only a check it will be hard. What we do takes compassion, kindness and patience."
good,"Was a wonderful experience working with the company. Management was amazing. Over the years we moved but are still a family."
good,"Perfect commute work flexibility,i love my supervisors my colleagues are friendly,lovely residents. Induction was easy my experience is good now,i have recommended friends to work here too"

good,"Enjoyed the work, really felt like I had helped at the end of the work day. Seeing the residents faces when you help them gave a sense of accomplishment."
good,Overall a good experience working here. Only left so I could be a stay a home mom and be with my girls. Management was good. Kitchen was good. I don't think I've ever been in a skilled or assisted living other than Brookdale that's run so smoothly. Lot of love for the residents and people really love their job.
good,I enjoyed my time with this company also. There were lotta demands of months to patients only because it was a few staff members and more elderly people.
good,Typical lunch and dinner rush. Working with elderly people can be fun. As a server it was a lot of fun being around the residents because you got to hear stories and have conversation with them that maybe they dont have with anyone else.
good,Hardest part of job is getting close to residents and then they pass away hearing the stories from the residents ppl I work with are great including management there very understanding and helpful co workers are very fun work with and also very helpful

good,"My review is okay.it can be a little bit better I like how it’s asking me questions about my current job,the management the pay. The workplace culture can be a little bit better as well. I’ve learned how to help the elderly and assist them with everything they need I love working with the elderly and getting to know them a lot more better."
good,This is my first job in a facility/community. They teach on the job and are very caring toward their residents. The staff is friendly with each other. This place has a homey vibe.
good,"Assisting with the daily personal and hygienic care of the resident. Assist with the food intake, make sure that activities was done as well as making sure that the rooms and clothes was clean. I also give medications"
good,Its a very rewarding place to work. It opens your eyes to the awful disease of demntia and you can so much caring and compasion for this world. Great job!
good,"Don't get me wrong, I absolutely LOVE working there, I just feel that at this point in my life I should be making more money. The residents and staff are wonderful, and for a few dollars more an hour, things would be perfect."
good,If a call light on your hall was on you had to get it in less than 3 minutes. You had to have people dressed and down at the dinning room before 8 o’clock. On each hall there was about 4/5 people who needed your help getting ready and taken down to the dinning room.
good,"nice place to work. cared about residents. excellant manager. good benifits and time off. excellant care of residents.good food,excellant menu. really cared for there reditents"

The job was rewarding  for me,  because I  knew I  was  helping residents  that appreciated  what you were doing  for them.  Helping  them to meet their needs,  and enriching their lives and  giving their families  the comfort  in knowing that their  love ones were being  taking  very good care of them.  And I  love  them all  like family. They are very precious  people. Loved my job.i miss them. But  got married  and my husband's  job brought  us here. Hated that I had to leave without notice.  They asked for 2 weeks  notice but my husband's job  needed  him immediately."

good,Team work place at times and some times work alone. Learned a lot working there. Had team building where we would go on a half day outing twice a year.
good,The management was very flexible with everyone's schedule. The workers covered for each other when need be. Most of the time the environment was a good one. It felt like home and family. The only bad thing I would say is that the workers were not compensated enough and shown much appreciation for the very hard work we had to do.
good,This is a great job and has been a wonderful experience. The job is very hands on. Every part of the job is enjoyable and i had a wonderful time working here.
good,Brookdale Pinecastle is a great place to live and work.  The schedule is constant and allows for family time.  I would recommend Brookdale to anyone interested in Senior Living.

Being the job it is, it can get stressful but the residents make it worth coming in everyday. Not necessarily short staffed but there is always extra hours to make more money."
good,Brookdale Home Health is an excellent place to find a career.  But I would be wary of corporate greed as this closed down our agency network.  Home Health does not bring in major dollars for a large corporation.   Home health facilities are what bring in the money.  So be wary and watch your census if it starts to decline.

Being able to manage time wisely to get tasks done by one self being the boss of how good of work you do. Hardest part is when you have a patient that is totally incontinent and cannot do anything and you have to do it all by your self and the patient isn't the smallest person around. Most enjoyable part of this job is hearing how happy you make the elderly and make them smile, when they give you nothing but compliments on how amazing you are and most of all just knowing your helping people who needed you, your making a difference in these peoples lives."
good,"Everyday I would start out by doing some quick assigned chores before the seating started along with setting tables for my section. Once my section was ready I would go to the hostess stand and call residents by name and seat my first table, take orders, put orders in and get drinks. Then over the night more and more people would be seated in my section and I would wait on them as well. At the end of every shift I would bus all my tables, clean my section and do some quick chores. My coworkers were very funny and made work much more tolerable. The hardest part of my job would be when we were short on waiters because we would all have to take on there section as well as our own. My absolute favorite was all of the residents because they were so nice and patient."

good,I’ve worked here twice and I quit last time for a stupid reason but working at brookdale is by far the best job ever I’m considering coming back and i think y’all should apply to because all the managers care about you and they will help you through anything.

good,I liked working at brookdale because I like to help people and make them feel comfortable in their surroundings. I learned how to help residents more than I already knew how to. The hardest part of the job is watching the residents decrease in health.
good,"I loved all my co workers at brookdale they were the best . "
good,I loved working here. I would tell anyone who wants to join Brookdale to do it. The other employees are amazing and the managers there really listen..
good,"Overall great place to work. $15/hour pay was great considering a CNA certification is the only requirement. I am a strong believer of high pay = high employee turnout. Great nursing staff, although had to deal with some difficult employees here and there. The shift times (6a-2p, 2p-10p, 10p-6a) can be hard to work around for appointments and social activities, but that is to be expected when you work in a hospital or nursing home with rotating shifts. However, they were very flexible with my hours while I was in school and only scheduled me for the days I requested as I was PRN. The job duties are very consistent although some days are better than others. Management and staff is great. Also got free food every meal after all of the residents had been served. Residents are very sweet and being able to help those who need it the most is definitely a rewarding job. Would definitely recommend."
good,Loved the residents and staff! The management at Grand Court was wonderful! The regional manager not so much! The local management staff was superb! Great team! I wish them all well! Admire them greatly!
good,"I enjoy completing a lot of different tasks and meeting new people.  The challenges are there and I see it, opportunity.  There is a variety of opportunities to learn and grown."

good,"Great place to work IF you have great management/ED."
good,"I love helping others. The residents are so nice and joyful considering their lives have changed since moving in. Management cares for residents and makes the employees and residents feel safe and cared for. For me, the hardest part of any healthcare job is to lose a residents due to death. You form a bond with them and their families and you never get over saying goodbye. The most enjoyable part of working with the elderly is putting a smile on their faces. You always have to remember to keep a smile on your face because it helps them to relax. I love sitting down and hearing life stories and they also enjoy the company. For some, relatives don't visit often or at all. So you and others in the facility are all they have."

good,I enjoyed working for this company. The benefits were amazing and the salary was good also. The downside was that it was not always properly staffed making the workload very heavy.
good,"There is no such thing as a typical day when your working in assisted living. What I learned was kindness, patience and respect go a long way.The managers are great. Work place culture is controlled chaos.Hardest part of the job was all of it but especially saying goodbye to residents if you got the chance. Most enjoyable part was residents stories they share with you."
good,"Can be a high stress environment at times and you have to be able to handle and work as a team to make it successful.  Great team and sales environment with the ability for advancement within the company.  Just as with any job there are ups and downs, and it is what you make it.

good,"When I go into to work I realize that it is not going to be the same as it was yesterday. I know that everyday comes with challenges. Some days have more than others. But my favorite part about caregiving is knowing that I make an impact on individuals. People that are not able to take care of themselves. I try to go beyond what is expected of me. I enjoy talking to each resident. When I care for them I always think, how would I want to be treated and cared for if I needed help. I take this job very serious. I believe that this residents are all unique and should be treated that way. I went into nursing because I think I can make an impact on people."
good,"Brookdale is a wonderful company to work for and there is plenty of room to advance. The problem with Brookdale is many individuals who are hired stay until they retire, this is a good thing for them but for any one who desires their position, grab a seat and wait your turn. "
good,"I love my job and the wide variety of residents that live in both the assisted living and the memory care house. Management is reliable and understanding.

good,"A typical day at work consists of short daily meetings to address any concerns, questions or complaints. In doing this I have learned that working together as a team even when we all do not agree on a particular way of handling a situation that rules and regulation are key factors  at any job and we must follow protocol in order to be successful. The management  team worked effectively together when it pertained to the residents well being. There was not any particular part of the job that was hard. Some situations might have been a  bit more challenging than others but there was nothing that I could not solve. The most enjoyable part of the job is when I am actually helping someone doing a task that requires some type of assistance and the joy and the appreciation that is recieved when the task is completed."

good,"It was an overall great job. Good pay. Great management. Flexible hours except for on call schedule which requires you to be on call on a day you're already scheduled to work so you may end up working a double (16 hrs). This was my one and only complaint about this job. Having children or a family at home, this job made it kinda difficult to juggle the two."

good,"I didn't work there long, but I remember Brookdale was a fun place to work most of the time. It sucked when you like a resident and they get put on hospice but that comes with the job. The kitchen staff always knew how to make everyone smile and always went the extra mile for the residents. Nursing, which I worked in, had it's usual ups and downs but when it mattered everyone pulled together to do what was needed and expected."
good,"It was great working for Brookdale Senior Living.  Their culture is the best. They always put patients, family and employee first before anything else. The management was great"

good,"great place to work, wonderful people and amazing staff "
good,"A typical day at work for me is cleaning up prior events at work, making sure the bar and cups are stocked properly. Setting and doing activities. I greet the residents and families and love to have conversations with them. I learned alot working here it's a very different environment because the residency here is 70-103 at the oldest. It's taught me a lot about myself and working with others and truly being of service. Our moto is integrity, respect, enriching the lives of others, honesty and trust. I try to incorporate that into my daily life. The hardest part of my job is when residents pass away.

good,"I worked in Dining Services, so I can't speak for other departments. Throughout the day, we were well informed about problems that cropped up and included in the brainstorming of solutions. When someone would fall behind, usually one of the other team members who finished early would jump in to help. Management heard and acted on concerns in a timely fashion. I've loved working here."
good,Brookdale is a wonderful company that allowed me job flexibility while I was in school. The management and guidance that was sow to me over the last 2 years has been great. I am a much better marketer of senior living as well as am more knowledgeable in the daily workings of a clinical setting such as Assisted living and Memory care. The hardest part of my job is of course when loved residents pass.
good,I have worked for Brookdale off and on for about 10 years. I began as a CNA. I'm currently a QMA. This job has to be one of life's rewarding places of employment!

good,"I started working at Brookdale Westlake Hills as a receptionist in Independent Living. Very quickly I came to care about the residents. Although I worked as a weekend receptionist, I felt a part of the Brookdale Community. My supervisor was wonderful, always making us feel appreciated. She made certain that we were thoroughly trained. "
good,i will be working there for 7 years in December and ive always been part time im ready to be a full time employee after almost 7 years. Over all great company

When meeting the CEO he was well educated of who every employee was and what they had accomplished with the company. I would recommend employment to any nursing staff."
good,I really enjoy working here. My coworkers make the job enjoyable. I enjoy interacting with the senior residents. I have never loved any of my jobs as much as I love Brookdale. I can see myself working here until I retire.
good,Working at Brookdale has allowed me to grow as a professional. I enjoyed spending time with our residents and ensuring they are receiving the best quality of care possible.

good,"I Love working there, its fun and a great place to start in..."
good,"During a typical day at work I would answer phones, transfer calls, distribute mail and greet and interact with families visiting their loved ones."
good,To come in a good atmosphere and work around good resident. I learned to work at a fast paste but also have high qualities wen working.
good,You learn something everyday it can be overwhelming at times fast pased of course it can be draining but in a good way love the people I work with
good,"A typical workday at Sterling House of Leesburg is always interesting. The first thing I do is recieve report from the shift getting ready to go home and make rounds with the previous shift. I then pull laundry, set tables for the next meal, answer call lights/telephones, and all while I am mixing and mingling with my patients - I do a little bit of everything! At first, I was so nervous about not being able to get everything done on my shift and still make personal connections with the patients/families/coworkers. I have learned over the past two years to take things slowly and steady and things always work out. Put the resident first and everything else falls into place. The management and staff at Sterling House of Leesburg are great! Everyone is always smiling and willing to help out. The hardest part of my job at Sterling House is falling in love with my patients (like they are my own family) and then having to say good bye, because my patients:"
good,"The company encourages interaction with residents who are later in life, many of whom were dumped by family members too busy to see to their needs. These people are so happy to have someone take the time to converse with them and I have never had a more rewarding job than this one."
good,I had a wonderful working for them for three years. They trained me to become a med-tech. They gave time to grow and move up if I wanted to. They where always willing to teach.
good,Very hands on and fast paced. Love the residents and supervisor’s. Wouldn’t be leaving if I didn’t live an hour away. They helped me get my certification for caregiving by sending me and paying for school.
good,I truly logged working at Brookdale. I made many friends with residents and staff. The management is very caring and willing to help. No one was above getting on the floor with us when needed and getting their hands dirty to help us out. Great group of people
good,"It’s a great place to work for the residents make me day everyday its the best Job I ever had , management is amazing and I plan to work there for a long time"
good,Good environment to work in. The residents are the highlight of coming to work and making a difference in their lives. The management cares about their staff and residents.
good,I would recommend Brookdale Senior Living to anyone interested in working with seniors. It is very rewording to be able to assist the elderly with day to day living.
good,Management tries very hard to show employee appreciation to all shifts and employees. Work schedule is not flexible. Workload is very manageable. Benefits are good. Employees that are not great team members are coached up or out. Late employees and employees that miss excessive days of work are held accountable. Many long term employees shows its a great place to work with minimal turn over.
good,"In this particular community, I found a family that cares about the well being and quality of life for the residents and employees. I've never felt like my work team was also my family, but here I do."
good,This job taught me team work and responsibility. I also learned how to work with people out side of the facility. The majority of people i worked with had Dementia/alzheimer's so I was able to experience how to handle difficult situations with many different people.
good,You never know what to expect as a CNA from hour to hour or day to day but when you have great coworkers and amazing residents you can handle anything that comes your way!
good,"I enjoyed working there because of the residents and their families. You grow closer to the residents and they seem like your second family."
good,Brookdale is a good place to wrk.. No one is treated like a child everyone is very respected.. Management is wonderful...i like it alot & the residents is nice.. & i got a good Christmas bonus & was only there a 8 mths
good,"Was very educational for a young student like I was; and rewarding to help so many elders that did so much for our community. I'm sure times have changed now but when I was employed I was in charge of skin graphs, weights and administrating perscribed drugs; including blood sugar care such as insulin."
good,"Love the community I work at"
good,Cleaning different apartments. How to clean with customer in the house with you. Great management. Good. Socializing with the elderly. Wonderful story
good,Working with Brookdale senior living solutions really helped me further my medical knowlegde and skills. Supervisors work well with you for what ever is necessary. They listen to your ideas. It was a very productive work environment for me.
good,Management went over and above to make sure you had the tools to get the job done properly. Fair appraisals that kept up with what you were actually doing not just what was on your Job Description.
good,Every work day began with a nice and friendly greeting of the staff and residents of the facility. I'm always surprised by how I'm always learning new medical treatments and medicines for our residents. Management always has an answer for our medical problems and also management has great resources as references and thus making me feel confident about my work. Our culture is to serve our residents as a high priority. I'm looking to relocate my employment for better benefits as I'm aging and the hardest part of my job will be leaving this place because I absolutely like my place of work very much. In conclusion I enjoy meeting new residents and the life experiences that they bring and share with us all and its tremendous.

good,friendly work place. slow paced and taking time to talk to the residents and taking care of them. it is a good place to work. long hours and short hours.
good,while working at Brookdale Senior Living in lewiston Idaho i had an amazing time with my co-workers and residents even when it was crazy busy we all seemed to have the right amount of communication and positive attitude!
good,Brookdale was a laid back job I enjoyed the company of the residents living their. Everyday if I was scheduled to work I would be more then happen to attend that place is full of love
good,"I loved Brookdale the whole time I worked there. I was very sad to leave (but life is like that sometimes). I was able to use my RN skill-set very well. I did many assessments, and learned so much. I passed medications, entered physicians orders, assessed the patient's skin and condition, etc. Honestly it was a great experience as well because I could bond with the patients and it felt good to hear them say they enjoyed having me as their nurse. The only pitfall was a select few of the staff. It almost seem as though to be ""let's pick on the new nurse and see how far we can take it"" kind of a thing. That was pretty much the only flaw (gossip), and that you don't really have time to take a break at least at night. The most enjoyable part of this job was working with the great coworkers that made me feel at home with family. Thank you Brookdale!"
good,"Great work environment. Opportunity for training and advancement with hard work and dedication. Great pay."
good,I like that they work around my work schedule. The location is good and not to far from my other job. They work good with my schedule for my full time job.
good,Enjoy working at this community.  The residents and families are amazing!  Love that every day is different and fun. I've been operating this community for the last 17 months.
good,"Enjoyed my time operating Brookdale Hilton Head. I took this community as a promotion from Emeritus Palm Village. Being in a combination community with both independent living and assisted living was exciting.  Working with sales, programming and clinical, hand in hand, gave us great success with occupancy and happy families. I transferred from Brookdale Hilton Head per request of my District Director of Operations and took a new assignment at Brookdale Hilton Head Court.  This new position came with a strong focus on family satisfaction, communication and occupancy growth."
good,Working with the elderly is amazing. I enjoy preparing 3 meals a day. Everyday us a different day you NEVERdo the same thing over a over.
good,"I cannot say enough good things about Emeritus. I sincerely wish they had not merged with Brookdale so I could have continued my career with a company I believed in, trusted, and LOVED to work for. I was proud to be an Emeritus employee and will never forget the family I was part of for 5 years."
good,The co-workers are really friendly. The residents always have something to do. The meals are good and hot. I only work every other weekend and I love it like that. Most of residents can do for there selves.
good,interested workplace.  Opportunities for any employee to move forward. a typical day of work will be that every plays his role in order to make the resident happy. Our goal is to provide a high quality of care. the pay is reasonable. good management. opportunities for everyone to succeed
good,This was the best job I have ever had. I loved seeing my residents everyday! Making them happy. I worked at and Alzheimer's and dementia unit and they were some of the best people i have ever met. they had their good days and their bad days but even in their bad days you can change it by how you interact with them.
good,"I have been fortunate to learn and grow so much with this company. I truly could not imagine working anywhere else or with any other team! "
good,Working here was an absolute dream and I still stop by even years later to talk with some old friends and residents. Getting to know my elderly residents was rewarding and sometimes bittersweet. There was never any stress or drama and it was all in all a great experience in how well a company can be run.
good,"The most enjoyable part of the job was working alongside my colleagues and learning from them.Fun work place with supportive management. Not all about the numbers but how you personally grow and develop. Decent amount of red tape and politics, but this is expected of a big company. The office started to get crowded as the company grew."
good,I worked on the Skilled Unit.  There were some Hospice patients.  I enjoyed working with the patients and getting to know their families. The supervisors were great--always willing to lend a hand or to answer questions.  I would recommend this facility to anyone.
good,"My current job is very important to me because it was a stepping stone to helping me be responsible ,mature, learn to be a team player, and a great employee."
good,"Coming to work to assist resident's with everyday needs. Getting residents up and dressed for breakfast, giving showers, daily housekeeping assignments, doing activities with residents. Working in a memory care unit, I have learned a great deal more on how to help residents with dementia. The management was easy to talk to if there are any issues. My co-workers come to work with a positive attitude and helping get the residents involved with activities. The hardest part of the job is when you have some co-workers who come in with the notion that they do not have to do any work. Therefore, you are picking up the slack. But I don't mind because I know at the end of the day I have done a good job. The most enjoyable part of the job is the interaction with the residents."
good,I enjoyed my job.  I was able to enjoy the ability to advance in my position.  The support from coworkers and management above me was very good.  The most enjoyable part of my job was working with the residents and their families.  The families felt free to come to my office and discuss their financial issues with me.  I loved being around the residents and help to make their daily lives worth living.

good,While working for Brookdale I really enjoyed the hands on with the residents. The residents would always treat you with dignity and respect. All were really kind and I returned the love even more to them. Very nice work place.
good,A typical day at work will be meeting new residents and cleaning their room for their desire. Making conversation with them to make their day go better if its going bad. I learned to be positive even if a resident is being mean because they really do not mean no harm. To get along with my coworkers because i'm not there to meet friends i'm at work to do a job. The hardest part of the job is seeing a resident no doing well and there is nothing i can do to make them feel better. The most i enjoy about the job is growing i became better and satisfying the residents day by day.
good,I have learned a lot from Brookdale. They have lots of programs you can participate in. Good Peoples and Employee of the month are just a couple

good,"Was welcomed by staff and residents. Enjoyed cooking for the residents and staff and visitors. Everyone was treated with respect and issues were handled in a professional manner, never in a negative or humiliating way. The only reason I am no longer there is that I had cancer, and since the surgery, my doctors have suggested I change field of employment as I cannot continuously lift and bend. The employer is to be commended for great management and friendly work environment. I miss this place a great deal."

good,"Working at Brookdale Monrovia has been a great experience for me. I have learned many things like time management, working with the elderly, as well as working as a team. Everyone there is extremely nice, from the employees to the residents. The hardest part of the job would have to be getting attached to the residents and they suddenly pass away but I love talking to them and hearing about their stories from their past. Most of them have been in the army, national guard, or the marines."

good,"Loved getting to meet and work with new and old former residents. Fun place to work, and would recommend to someone else."

good,I was heart broken when I heard the company was selling. I was hoping to retire from this company. I felt they had excellent values and management was always a call away and would help solve major problems that could not be handled inside community...
good,"I work there as a new Nurse in my first year in the field. I have been to many Skilled, Rehab and Assisted Living Communities around my area and no Facility has impressed me like Brookdale of Mentor. If I had to put my Parents in an Assisted Living Home, I would certainly have no problem leaving them in the good hands of these people. From the amount of training, the Brand Promise, the constant communication, open door policy and the over all pleasant environment and excellent benefits, I can't think of a better place to work. I am sadly only PRN, otherwise I wouldn't be looking for more work. My only complaint would be the ugly polo shirt you have to wear that is very impractical for a Nurse as we need all the pockets we can get and it also makes it hard for Residents to tell the difference between a housekeeper, kitchen services or a Nurse and sometimes being able to spot a Nurse right away is important in times of distress."
good,the hardest but im good for it listen to my guest and give a solution finding out with my own experience or the ones I have given to solve a guest issue for the best. the most enjoyable is when they tell me I did a great job at work continue doing what im doing to serve that my priority for my guest.

good,This is a fast paced job at a company that is growing in the senior living world in health care.  I start my days early and usually don't put in less than 50 hours a week.  I have grown personally with this company and believe strongly in their core values and mission.  I started out with this company as a floor nurse in a 54 bed community.  Within 4 months I became the Resident Care Director/Director of Nursing.  I was then asked to transfer to a larger community with 120 beds and manage the nursing department.  I spent 9 successful months organizing and repairing past damages at that community and was then asked to come to my current community in the Chicago area as an Executive Director.  I take great pride in my accomplishments in also being able to bring this community from 73% occupancy to a successful 90% occupancy in a years time.  The community is financially stable and continues to grow in occupancy and revenue.  The hardest part of the job is finding the right staff to follow through with the projects I have implemented.  I get along very well with my co-workers and have put together a strong management team.  The most enjoyable part of my job is going home at night knowing I have made a difference in the lives I serve every day.
good,"Working here is what gave me the most experience in customer care and home health care. I can stay I've worked with all types of customers in all types of environments. Co workers were as friendly and supportive as could be. The hardest part of my job was the fact I worked with Senors all day. Seeing someone so sharp one day and the next they cant even dress themselves, or being with someone everyday and they never remember you."
good,"Highly recommend--great regional team! Loved working here--good pay, positive energy."
good,A typical day at work is fixing meals. I have different diets. I manage my time very well. All meals is serve on time. My co-workers  work very well with me to complete all meals to be serve.

The most enjoyable  part of the job is just seeing the resident eat all food at each meals.

good,I would help residents that need assistant with ADL's (Activities of Daily Living). I learned that you have step out of your comfort zone in order to meet the needs of those who really need it the most. The workers were very kind and respectful when it came to dealing with the residents. The hardest part of the job is dealing with residents that have different moods but at the same time you learn to enjoy their moods because you get to relive their younger days with them (join their journey as we might say).
good,My stress levels were not as high but only became high in the summers when it was really hot and I had lots of people to serve!
