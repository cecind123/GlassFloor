rating,review
bad,Manager only cared about numbers.  Did not appreciate a good work ethic.  I got good reviews every year and then blindsided the last 2 months without warning.  Big life lesson.
bad,"PATHETIC management "
bad,"Poor work environment and lack of improvement to be able to work your way up in the company, managers played favoritism with employees that were friends outside of work"
bad,"I started off really excited to work for this company, it seemed a solid company. The four years I was there, it went down hill. COO, and a lot of upper management let go, financial strain, so no raises, no extra activities for the hard work we had to do. Did not feel appreciated, high volume of employees leaving and no replacement, over 300 files on employees desk for with no temps or new employees to help. No over time approved either. Probably the worst company I worked for. Their behind in times, and several failed programs and they are still working on new programs when I left. Lots of layoffs too."
bad,Really this first american company is really a worst and very bad company if u believe me or not. Huge huge huge huge huge work pressure and no respect of a single employee so plzz dont do work here
bad,"I don't want to talk about that company, I feel here work culture something different, I just felt over there is very difficult to work over there, at last resigned."
bad,"Don't believe the facade (red flags) FA created to attract potential employees."
bad,It was a total waste of time. I would not recommend working there unless you live in a state of than Rhode Island.  First American never had enough work for me.
bad,"This company's motto is PEOPLE FIRST, referring to their employees. However, this company does not care for its employees.  "
bad,Drove 45 minutes to work and again home each day. Waited on customers. Processed loans and took payments on existing loans. The hardest part of the job was putting up with co-workers.
bad,"FATCO Timeshare division is a joke. Sweatshop mentality, management afraid for their jobs will lie and throw you under the bus. CYA is the motto. Turnover is ridiculous. An employee said if the manager, who came from a timeshare company, had her way we would all wear the horseblinder headgear that attached to their chest so you could only look forward to work.  They hide behind cubicles  to spy on you. Sick mentality."
bad,"I actually really liked what I did at first American,  but I didnt stay long. when they would find something that I could have done differently they would talk down to me like I was a child. There were also too many cooks in the kitchen so to say. There was no structured training so everyone did it differently which made it difficult to do the job correctly in the eyes of who ever was the next person to look at it."
bad,"Management was unskilled, seemed to part of a long established club and catered to its subordinates who were personal friends, and that is how opportunities and pay raises were doled out....based upon friendship"
bad,"I had worked for First American for many, many years. I would have to say in the beginning years it was great, they appreciated their employees and showed that appreciation in many ways.  All that is gone, they don't even have holiday parties anymore, you will never receive a raise no matter how many years you work there.  They have people in management positions now that have no clue what they are doing.  Meanwhile, they are making tons of money and the actual employees who do work hard, show up everyday and make money for the company are completely overlooked, overworked and under appreciated"
bad,"A typical work day includes a lot of miscommunication and confusion as a lot of the workers don't understand what they're doing, they're just going through the motions. If you don't understand something, expect a bizarre explanation or a ""just do it this way"". There's an astonishing amount of gossiping and favoritism between workers and customers that goes on here. I don't know how some of these people even got hired because of the lack of professionalism and work ethic. Not to mention a lot of the workers are underpaid and overworked. The hardest part about this job is having to deal with the fact that you'll be at fault no matter what you do, even when you're following the rules. This bank will literally ruin your health"
bad,"Mediocre, narrow minded people make up this company - it is the exact opposite of what you think of when you picture an ideal obe. Pay is ridiculous, no hikes even on performance."
bad,You went in every day and never knew what time you would get out. The shortest days were 16 hours. When you asked a question you were answered with another question and so you were never able to learn anything.
bad,The management here is cold and uncaring. The people are very standoffish and there is poor training. In the time I worked there I have nothing good to say about the people or company.
bad,It is commission only so not knowing your paycheck is very stressful and they do not keep you busy enough. They do understand about family emergencies but you don't get any paid days off.
bad,"This company always kept you in the dark as to what the next step would be.  Management staff did not have open communication with staff, always in the dark"
bad,"a division of First American Title."
bad,"Run as fast as you can away from this company. There is a reason there is a extremely high turn over with this company and always open positions within the property and casualty department. The word is finally getting out how degrading employees are treated within the department."
bad,"No value at all for their people, they use them up and throw them away.  They would make us work from 8 am to 11 or 12 pm.  It was ridiculous."
bad,"Not a very good company to work for  don't treat people  with respect."
bad,"This is a place that I would not recommend to anyone that I cared about.  Its a place that is littered with people that have worked together at other companies for years, so you are an outsider to begin with and there are no qualms about it.   There is NO Consistency some QC staff will downgrade your work, while others will promote you for the exact same work.  Long story short you can underwrite the same file the exact same way and then get 5 different Qc scores from 5 different people in the same department.  Your progress and promotions/raises depend on this, if you bring this up to the training staff you are simply MORE of an outsider.  Its a place that despite your skill set, or competency you will not be rewarded for good work, you will be rewarded if someone decides they like you..."
bad,I like my day to be filled with duties fast paced. I dont want to wake up in the morning dreading going to work.Yet this is what ut has become
bad,Overworked and underpaid. Terrible health benefits. Poor Management. There is no way to move up in the company unless you are buddies with someone already higher up.
bad,"I worked with them 4 weeks, waste of time, low pay, they set your app for you, go ahead and work for them- your nightmare"
bad,"This Company started off great!  After a corporate change, it went downhill. After 5 years over employment, numerous days/hours of mandatory overtime...my total pay increase over a 5 year span was about $1. The management is on a buddy system and if you're not a ""favorite"", you'll definitely feel the tension!"
bad,I wanted to work here when I moved from California; however the office that I was I in was very unprofessional and there was no structure.
bad,"everyone was friendly. The company is big, food was great in the cafeteria."
bad,The company no longer has a local presence for Default Servicing.
bad,fast pace environment and alot of pressure and work multiple screens
bad,"sweat shop, you clock in fill in the boxes & go home"
bad,Conduct physical research of data requiring the exercise of some judgment and discretion.
bad,"I enjoyed working there but was employed only as a temporary employee,"
bad,"I was not paid enough to support my self.manager did not do much to support us Appraisers. Was not making enough to qualify for health benefits. "
bad,If you want to be tied to a desk with a ball and chain be micromanaged and hate your life then this is the job for you! Corporate to the tee if not following their exact corporate call center rules you will not eat a raise or promoted. I was a supervisor there and know exactly how unfair they can be.
bad,When corporate took over our office it was a nightmare.   They placed a narcissistic manager in charge of our are.  Customer service hit bottom as well as employee morale.  People were let go for age and time with company all to save money.   Manager was a gossipet and partied with employees.
bad,It's a sad frustration when nepetism and religion cloud a management teams judgment and ability for growth. You will be paid more here if you are a friend of the management team and have children. It's very clear that they favor this sort of life choice. It's sad that they do not recognize loyalty or longevity as a trait. Those who perform the least get paid the most. Don't expect the management team to return emails or follow up.
bad,The managers at the site don’t know what exactly the representatives are working on. They lack knowledge of the work load. They claim to have a great rating of employees being happy and it is not true. Low pay for a stressed environment.
bad,First American is too big to know who does what.  I worked overtime with little appreciation and our office was understaffed.  Despite my repeated discussions with upped management they wouldn’t hire anyone else.  Many job functions were “offshores” ie overseas.  Employees were required to do dumb online training when there wasn’t sufficient time to get work done.  Further their computer system fast was horrendous.  I worked there 8 months and could not wait to find another job.
bad,"I am a strong believer that you should at least like your job somewhat - perhaps not look forward to going every day but you shouldn't dread going in. This is the only job  i have ever had where i dreaded going in every day. The entire department i worked in hated their managers, it was toxic and i wouldn't wish this experience on anyone."
bad,"This company has issues.   They claim to be a top 100 company to work for,  but its all on paper.  Their motto  PEOPLE FIRST is laughable.  You are just a number in their world.  Management is the worst, they are all over the place with decisions.  They seem to worry so much about their jobs and the bottom line that they forget about respecting their employees. No job security at all.   They lay off and fire people all the time.  So glad I do not work here any longer what a relief to be out of there."
bad,"Negative environment. Too bad - like what i was doing and learning."
bad,They hired on a group of temps so the day shift didn't have to work from 8am - 11pm and within 3 months they had eliminated 50 positions so the day shift went right back to what they had had to do before.
bad,There are so many things that are changing on a daily basis and you are expected to have a solid knowledge of all changes regardless of how new it is.
bad,Layoffs every year.  Poor management.    No loyalty. They expect every thing out of you but give you nothing in return. They have constant turnover because they don’t appreciate what their employees do to make them profitable.
bad,"Poor management, poor communication with employees. Has a very cliquey atmosphere if you're not in the manager and select few group you're pretty much considered useless and unimportant."
bad,"I was treated pretty well by the people at that particular branch.  I appreciated that. The phones were very busy.  Other than that, there's not much else to say."
bad,"In my time with the company, I was screamed at by managers, bullied, lied about and discriminated against. The culture is very patriarchal and has not kept up with today's society. It is not very diverse or accepting of others including minorities and women. It is very arrogant and undermining of employees and doesn't foster equality in the workplace. "
bad,Terrible company with no management. They brought in a new manager who knew nothing about Title / Escrow so it was embarassing to bring him out to visit customers
bad,"First American is not welcoming to new escrow officers. The office has EO's who have been there for decades and they control management.  I was initially hired by a manager I had worked with prior.  He hired me because he knew my work ethic, but left a few months after I left Fidelity to work for him.  Unfortunately the manager that replaces him was easily influenced by my coworkers who just didn't want another Escrow Officer there to share business with."
bad,"overworked and underpaid, jobs being outsourced to India once you train your replacement, a lot of over time hours unexpectedly but may change in a blink of an eye"
bad,"Hated working there. So much stress, Terrible managers. Pay was decent but not worth the abuse. I worked there exactly one month and was let go for not ""catching on"" quick enough."
bad,"Have not had a single good day since starting here, was the worst decision of my life to come to this job. Entire department hates the company and it is known, have never seen anything like this. I find it normal that a few people won't like their job and can be negative but not like this where it is the huge majority that are actively looking for new jobs and hate coming into work each day."
bad,Management is lacking in connection with employee and needs of the business.  Unfair treatment. they want everything from you with no return..
bad,"Used to be a good company, now it has gone down the drain.- don't bother"
bad,Management at this company leaves much to be desired. Although there are many good managers at this company there are others that make you wonder how in the world they secured their position. They do not posess any qualities of a good manager or the ability to do the jobs of the folks they manage.
bad,Single handedly the worst place I have ever worked. I knew I should have left after the 4 woman fist fight that happened in the TRAINING ROOM. The worst most garbage people are also their customers. Be prepared to be told how much of a P.O.S. you are. And guess what you are not allowed to hang up. Customers being racist and swearing at you? Oh well. Customer threatens violence? Oh well.  This place is horrible and their customers are too. Miles is cool though.
bad,"Beware they pay well but it is because it is a toxic work environment. Quite a bit of backstabbing by management, not an environment that promotes quality leadership. Inappropriate leadership behaviors that our ""swept under the rug""."
bad,"This is for the retail side of this office, Builder side is a whole different profession and those members are amazing , the retail side of this office , well there are many games , treats staff unfairly and accommodates only the producers .  Let’s other team members treat assistants disrespectfully.  Looking for a new job now .  Bonuses are unfair !"
bad,"Call centers cause mental health problems.Staff continually report sick with anxiety related problems, caused by unrealistic and unsustainable expectations."
bad,"First American Title is not recommended. Worked in Sarasota FL office. Management is non existent coworkers have there own agendas and the workday environment is very stressful. Coworkers were working off the clock until 2am then coming back in at 7am Workload is just outrageous and from day 1 you are set up to fail"
bad,"fast paced"
bad,did not provide training and expected you to learn on your own.  work in Santa Ana during the day but still work at night with people at India.  requires more from you
bad,"The pay is horrible, overtime is the only time you get decent money. Raises are based on slow seasons so barley got a .10 raise as a whole for our progress as a department. They are currently not hiring and we are swamped and over worked for barley 9 an hour."
bad,"Former employee... At first I loved being apart of the FA team then as my time went by there it became more stressful. The customers are usually very rude and they scream at you on most calls. HIGH STRESS... A lot of people quit because they cannot handle the stress. If your PI is not 100% at all times you get written up or fired. "
bad,"This company is not a good company to work for it is in the commercial due diligence services department in Norman ok."
bad,Managers have no training and have terrible staff interaction skills and treat people very badly. The violate laws and basic HR rules and concepts. they are only concerned with productivity.
bad,the office is fast-paced but productive. The staff is hardworking but also personable so that made working there much enjoyable. Everyone there is also very knowledgeable in commercial real estate title insurance.
bad,"This company is a joke.  Everyone looked very busy but really wasn't doing much of anything, I was brought on to help with work that was piling up, so I was contracted for a year.  I started and the first day was already a mess.  My Manager didn't even train me, I was pushed off to another team member, whom was making so many mistakes it was obvious the first hour I was working.  There was only 2 team members brought in from 2 agency's and we were excited to work and hopeful to learn more and become permanent.  But before long we noticed that every task that was assigned we needed to repeat it at least twice because no one was on the same page and it was done wrong.  It was hard to advance and learn when the only answer received was ""I don't know"".  On the other hand their culture was AWESOME! A little too awesome, you are expected to give up your personal time to participate in all company activities and there are allot. But there is low stress, good culture and great benefits."
bad,"There is no future for employees at First American. You simply are keeping a seat warm until they can offshore your job. Management will sit on your head telling you, ""We need this now"". Then they will blame you for all the mistakes you made rushing the file. I come home from work and I cry and hit myself. That is my working experience at First American. What ever you do will be wrong. I wouldn't recommend working here to someone who spat upon me yesterday."
bad,"Great benefits but working environment in Onalaska, WI office was intolerable. Hostile and toxic to a persons well being. Co-workers and management were highly dysfunctional to say the least"
bad,"Started working for first American back in July 2016. Working there for 6 months, I thought that I would go permanent. After being told that I would go permanent after my 90 day probationary period, I was recently laid off with NO  PRE WARNING at all. Leaving my wife and the kids in a bind. The team lead for the E RECORD team is the worst person to work with and they show favoritism. I would advise no one to apply here because they're dirty and not professional at all."
bad,"Typical day was attempting to acquire approvals to pay invoices. Then attempting to fulfill a quota of processed payments per day."
bad,Poor training....Manager made office environment a living nightmare.  She would throw things... Slam things...yell and berate me.  She made many errors and would blame others or just have her sister in corporate fix it for her.  You couldn't ask her a question or direction without her having a hissy fit.  She forced the office to listen to her Church Propaganda
bad,"Zoning department is overworked, understaffed and underpaid. "
bad,"I did not enjoy working for First American. I found the work to be mindless and unable to gain advancement. The management is unprofessional. The pay rate is way low for the amount of work they expect, and not alot of chance for pay increase"
bad,"During my time with this company many years ago, I felt it started out like a typical call center, and our work was dispatching service technicians in the field. The Sales Support Manager at the time had not provided enough training, and work was beginning to pile up, and there wasn't a resolution in assisting reps with the adequate training needed."
bad,"End of the day of every month is typical day at work"
bad,"At my interview, I was told that there was a curative department that would take care of curative matters on the title commitment.  I was also told that another closer and I would share an escrow assistant.   Neither of those statements were true."
bad,"I have worked at other title companies before and 1st American is by far the worst one. If you are not in their club, count yourself out. No training, back biting, and rampant gossiping. A company that has ""American"" in their name outsources their work overseas. Total hypocrisy. Management is non existent. Never seen a company with such disregard for their employees. You are a number. Horrible experience. Run away fast."
bad,"Customer service handling refinancing of home loans with notaries, borrowers and vendors. High stress and demanding. Not a friendly atmosphere. High turnover."
bad,"Hired me and there just was not enough work to go around.  Staff is friendly and helpful.  Training period went well.  However, I would find myself going up to two days in a row with northing to do.  Fee split was only 45%, and they had very low fees.  Had to feed my family so I found an MAI in Franklin, TN to work for."
bad,Too many mid level management and unexperienced sales managers VP and President of sales have no Insurance Background Brought in by CEO because of personal relationships and not based on industry experience or merit
bad,One Manager destroys the atmosphere. Four curse words to employees in front of department and behind closed doors. Threatens  termination in front of coworkers to belittle workers into submission.
bad,"First American is a company that will work you until you are not able to work anymore. It is very stressful and they do not pay well, you are going to have migraine for days"
bad,The manager of the facility was deceitful and when it was discovered made it very difficult to maintain the position of employment. i had no other option than to quit my employment
bad,"Great place to work only if you are into kissing up and favortism, hostile work environment, work duties trippled and compensation does not match. Management hires their friends and displays a bit of racism.  You will be greatly depressed, overwhelmed and unable to relax and enjoy your life. Do not even consider reporting unfair treatment to HR as management does retaliate."
bad,"Working for this company has added unnecessary stress in my life. Demand in overtime when overtime was not needed. Then when overtime was needed, it was not allowed and we were being forced to cut our hours during the week so we can work on the weekend for ""straight time"" to provide support for our lender. The company claims they are family oriented, I am lucky if I get to see my family at a minimum of 5 hours a week. There is little to no communication between managers and supervisors."
bad,This was a fun place to work. Everyone worked together as a team. The work was very fast to complete. I never felt like I didn't accomplish anything
bad,It's astonishing that this company still exists.  They make so many mistakes in so many areas it's disturbing.
bad,"I used  to be calm in the organization and what ever work given to me I used to complete on time, I was trained on 4 to 5 processes so that whenever volume is high it can be completed on time and I used give 97-98% production, my job is completely in nights in the starting days I was not able to work due to sleep more over used to do different processes in the absence of employees it was very strain to me in nights shifts but later I got habituated to such king of work environment. my co-workers were very supportive and helpful in all aspects we use to work as a team, management all is our senior operations manager because we don't have team leader as we were in startup company so she was only person to take care of every project and she was very kind and helpful to everyone and she came from Mumbai, the hardest part of the job is multitasking because we should know each and every update of the processes we work there were many updates coming on daily but we got used to it after a certain period of time because of team work and the enjoyable part of job is whenever volume is high what we do is as a team will have fun during work one of our colleague entertains us very much, in that way we do our work without feeling stress or strain and without disturbing the other team members and more over i and my team will give good production as well in terms of targets and accuracy, that's all about me and my work environment in the organization."
bad,Its a great pleasure to work in this company.It was great.I have enjoyed alot while working with the FAI. The environment and colleuges are very good.
bad,Mentor of the processes foir HUD prep and post Closing Funding
bad,Temp job
bad,"I received a lot of training in Commercial Examining."
bad,I worked in First American india private limited..i was very well in production..i am a hardworker..ability to do more orders per day..my efficiency is very high..my process was a non voice related to Title insurance..i learn many things in that company...well cultured organization...
bad,Assisted title examiners with projects and customer service.
bad,Being a robot who only answers phones is what you need to be to work here. They advised room for movement and growth however failed to mention the call center life is a total drag. Unless some one quits or is lucky enough to promote there is no room for growth or promotions.
bad,"This was not a fun place to work, by any stretch of the imagination.  The turnover of employees was extremely high.  Not a day went by without at least one employee leaving in the middle of the day and not returning.  The pay was unfair, with temp employees making more money that full time employees.  The daily hours were unfair, with the managers making us arrive at 8 AM (sometimes earlier) and making us stay until every last bit of work for every person was done, so sometimes we didn't leave the building until after 11 PM, and we were still expected to arrive at 8 AM the next day.  Sick days were met with suspicion from the managers; a doctor's note was needed every time, even if the employee didn't go to the doctor for the one day they were off."
bad,"The management and leadership skills at the local"
bad,"Beginning at First American Title we were told there would be ""SOME"" overtime.  Living in Lansing, Michigan, and First American was in Grand Rapids, Michigan, (1 hour 15 minutes) away, the drive and long hours were not for me."
bad,"You can do your best and it will never be good enough.  you are supposed to be like a robot and fit in with their group or they don't like you."
bad,"The work environment is not very friendly, lack of training, they don't want to work with the workers regarding flexible schedules."
bad,This company is very mean girl clicks. As long as you are good at your job it does not matter how they treat each other. My closer left after 20 years of working here and they just threw mw on another team and promised me that they wanted me to stay so my customers would stay. they can about money not the people.
bad,"This is a good motto for a company to have, however, you need to be consistent with it.  They do not apply this to all employees.  They tend to favor certain employees."
bad,"The company is a solid company, sometimes the management can be toxic creating an environment that is not lend to a professional work environment."
bad,"They are constantly laying off permanent workers and hiring temps to pay them less. Those who have been there a couple of years can refuse to do work and make other team members do it, they can also come in late consistently."
bad,"First american was a decent work environment when it came to the team, but the management has no regard for it's employees, you're a number there, as soon as you stop adding up, you're gone."
bad,"This company claims ""People First"", but does not practice the claim.  It is a numbers based company that overworks its staff and places ""high producers"" in management level positions, who have no education re hr issues, or concrete abilities as capable leaders who have the desire or ability to motivate their staff based on their capabilities. This practice was exhibited and witnessed in all levels of production and branch areas, and because upper level and HR management staff are so out of touch with the reality of the aspects of the job at hand, they base their hiring and termination decisions solely on the opinion and practices of those ""high producing"" individuals without investigation. Politics, unfair and unethical practices are ignored based on sales and production numbers rather then the ethical standards the company claims to adhere to."
bad,"I worked for the company for over one year in the late renewal sales dept."
bad,Senior Management in the division is self serving and does not care about employees. Often having layoffs to purge who they don't like instead of going through proper HR channels.
bad,"I am looking for a career."
bad,"Long days and weekends when busy"
bad,"Until new management comes in and kicks people out it was a good place to work, since the low stars because of the end. Hired remote and new manager didn't like remote so found a way to make sure to get rid of those that were not in the same office as him so he could micro manage them."
bad,They let some  non workers stay because who they are related or their pets too. Mean on the hard workers if you are not in the mean girls click.  Management bullies certain people and likes to press their buttons trying to make you quit. If you want your vacation they make it hard for you to take. Management is terrible but most people their are nice.  It used to be a great work place until new management.
bad,"I worked there for over ten years.  In the beginning it was a great company to work for, but after getting new management they became the typical we say one thing and do another.  For an example, their motto, People First, what they do, they let good people go who work overtime when requested and learn new products when requested, but those who refuse to learn new products and not work overtime they keep.  Go figure."
bad,The managers are very particular and want you to keep up with there demands. they do have there favorite people so its not very safe to keep on the bad side of those people
bad,Employees are given very basic training and then thrown into active files and expected to work the file correctly. First American is more concerned with productivity and quick work then they are with quality. This creates many issues with lenders and borrows which then falls back on the employees with upper management taking no responsibility for the issues themselves.
bad,Management sets the atmosphere so if you are over 50 you will NOT be considered at all. If you are over 50 then consider other more realistic possibilities.
bad,"BEWARE!!!! this is one of the hire and fire company, they take fake interviews, Guys think n number of times before joining this company, If you want to build your carrer then please stay away from this company."
bad,"Poor management, probably due to the buddy system they are on. If you have been here 7+ years, I think there is no way to get fired. Lazy team members who get away with doing hardly any work...again the buddy system. No room for advancement here...once a peon, always a peon. Company needs a whole new group of people to start fresh....maybe then they will pay the hard working employees what the deserve."
bad,"Salary was great, they hire mainly contract workers and can terminate you at any time. "
bad,"This was a temp position.  I worked in the closing department.  Nothing was organized, the management staff did not know how to communicate with you on a business level, and the hours were ridiculous.  I literally worked 50-60hours every week."
bad,"First American Home Buyers Protection sells warranties to renters and home owners to cover their home appliances, plumbing, and electrical. duties included taking inbound calls for renewal and customer service issues."
bad,"I breifly worked for this company, mistake. The appraisers are extemely underpaid with little to no admin support, meaning if you are a appraiser your typing all your reports. The office manager is completely incompetant. The sra appraiser wants to turn and burn any appraiser that comes on board. You have no access to the clients if there are any concerns or questions, and they insist on signing your reports without you seeing the finished report and send them off without your final review if they make changes. That is why you see them on craigslist and indeed constantly posting want ads."
bad,The company does not care about how the employees feel or that we need cost of living increases. Ive worked here over 2 yrs and have not even been increased a dollar. There are double standards for people who are connected to higher ups. They want want want and are not willing to give. Im grateful to have a job but cant wait to move on
bad,would not recommend to a friend. Political and lob-sided culture. HR stands for the upper level management versus the employees. No bonuses for the employees under the director level.
bad,"A typical work day at First American - Mortgage solutions is filled to the brim of trying to work done with in the time given, while also trying to get daily guide lines. I've learned a lot while working for First American. I've learned that no matter how hard you work for them it still not enough. That as you put in 6 months of over time and help other departments and teams caught up on their work that your work will fall behind and you will be on you for not getting work done. Even though you've been stating your concerns about falling behind for months. I've learned that if you are asked to do too much in the day that you will need to learn how to say no, and try your best to explain why you can't take on more work. I've learned so great skills as to how to run formulas on an excel sheet. And also try my best to be a great manager. I the management will not care, you can bring up concerns and problems it will be disregarded for months until it becomes such a big issue that someone will end up getting the brunt of everything, but no one will ask for your point of view. The problems will escalate so bad that even the upper management will start to fight on the floor in front of their employees. The hardest part of the job is that there is a lot of work and expectations on people. But when you work so hard that you are breaking apart emotionally and mentally it is disregarded. And told to not bring in any emotion to work. The most enjoyable part of the job is some of the people that you will work with. Because they are under the same kind of pressure and know what you are feeling."
bad,"I prefer to not do a review at this time.  The job was very stressful and although there is training constantly available to attend, when you have to be at work, you are unable to attend. To my knowledge, based on my case and what others said, there are no raises. You are expected to take on more work then you can do in a 40 hour work week, yet there is no overtime approved."
bad,"Lack of management structure.  Manager would leave within a couple hours into the shift at least three times per week to ""work"" from home.  Micro management was also a huge problem."
bad,"Management is uninformed, careless, disrespectful, and lazy. I worked here for 3 years and was able to provide 100% accuracy on a months worth of work, within 1 week's time. This was consistent output of my level of work. I received a total of $1.33 raise in 3 years, with $1 of it being a flat wage increase to all employees and one of the raises being a 25 cent raise. This place was ridiculous.It does offer steady hours, good benefits, and a limited-growth ability."
bad,Management does not care about growing employee careers or innovative thinkers. Senior management is very incompetent and makes knew jerk reactions. Most of the management team comes from mortgage industry and has no title knowledge.
bad,"Normal corporate american place of employment "
bad,"I was honest with them during the interview and advised had not been in the industry for quite awhile, advised no problem would train. However, once hired in too busy to train, fellow employees advised no time to answer questions and had to cater to the third parties who generated business for the company. This included answering the phones and not requiring to get names of persons calling if they did not wish to give them."
bad,"You would think that a company this big would have their acts together, but they don't.  They made their first mistake by only answering to stock share holders and not their staffed employees.  Everyone is treated like they are replaceable at any seconds notice; all the free coffee and free employee luncheon can't make that air about that go away. There are lots of favoritism played by managements; it's not an even playing/ production ground. Very high stress, overwork, underpaid and over promised environment."
bad,"Company does not care of employee's, it was all about money. They have open door policy - take it or leave it. Employees were subject to have Merchants call in and say the company has taken there funds from there checking accounts and did not have the correct contract agreement set correctly. Employee's were set to work Long hours. They said you would work only one Saturday of the month, but in fact you would work three Saturday and if you did not volunteer, you would be punished, by not getting the set hours you requested."
bad,"I personally enjoyed working with this company for 23 years and was sorry to be let go due to downsizing. My job was good because each day would be a little different , some days I would answer phones, scan title documents, sometimes have to go to court for documents"
bad,The job itself wasn't hard but they had very rude and unskilled management. I was in authorizations so I had to authorize a certain dollar amount for the customers to have appliances approved in their home.
bad,There was never any formal training and the company is too large to care about its employees. Management was never around and expected unreal numbers. Bad management and even worse experience..
bad,This is a decent entry level place to work.  Do not expect to get promoted or receive a good salary increase.  The managers are laid back to a fault.  If you are someone who works hard then keep looking for a job.  This is a good job if you are lazy because they rarely take action against people for not meeting production goals.  If you keep quiet and be friendly with the boss then you will probably keep your job unless we lose more customers or send more jobs overseas.  They are not open to innovative ideas.  They prefer to stick to a process that they created 10 years ago.  It is difficult to get things to change.  It is not a profit center so they are only focused on saving money.
bad,"Your day starts out with a lot of employee gossip.  The management is absent.  The system was difficult and frequently down making it difficult to actually work. "
bad,"The system is very unstable, a very reactive company with extremely short deadlines where 80% of the work is performed offshore and continually fails during the testing phase. The benefits are the same as all other companies, pay scale is below average to average with the amount of work that the company demands. (A 10 hour day is considered lucky). Be prepared for late night meetings, after 9pm until 12am, weekly, 3 weekends a month. The company automatically forces you to use 40 hours of PTO between Christmas and new years making planning a vacation almost impossible."
bad,"Management plays favoritism. I did learn a lot during the training class about HVAC, plumbing, pools, water heater, and etc..."
bad,"You don't get paid enough and are expected to work a lot more than other places. It's a job, little advancement. They do have perks but the insurance is bad, and perks don't make up for the fact you can't afford to work there. If you are in need of a job, go for it, but don't expect a career"
bad,My worst experience . I have been waiting over 30 years in my life. First american was my worst experience in my entire . Management sucks overall. Favoritisms.
bad,"Mostly Night Shifts, Data Entry, Classifying Docs."
bad,"I moved to the company around the time the mortgage crisis started.  It wasn't long after that (8 months), that I was laid off.  I don't blame First American.  The banking institutions were irresponsible and it led to the fall of many jobs."
bad,I sent some time with First American Title and it wasn't all bad. It was only when I transferred to the Phoenix operation that I experienced the effects of bad management. Advancement opportunities were very discriminatory. Management was very discriminatory in the way employees were treated. The work place culture was lowered to the level of high school clicks. The hardest part of this job was to show up every day and do your job in spite of the barriers place by management. The best part of the Job is when I found another job and got out of the Phoenix operation.
bad,"treated poorly by management and not appreciated for the hard work that is done, learned about the many different types of trades, management tends to show favoritism, and not much diversity."
bad,"Does not pay well. At least when i was working at this company. Usually hire from the temp agency on contract and later hire perm. It is super professional in terms of attire and attitude. If you are used to casual work place, this is not your place to work at"
bad,"Was happy to work and got appreciation "
bad,"Worked with Real Estate Agents along with lenders to enhance their biz, while building relationship/trust to then earn their business. Management not always consistent."
bad,"Work/life balance is challenging. It did not seem as if anyone was happy there. It was a great experience though, and I learned a lot."
bad,There are good people and the head boss is great. People are happy and motivated to work and help each other out. Great place to work at.
bad,"No communication with managers and each department."
bad,"Not the happiest or most engaging place to work.  Opportunity for advancement is almost non-existent.  Conservative culture, little perks, decent benefits, though.  Most people are underpaid.  They terminated me without notice after five loyal years of high-quality work.  What more can you say?"
bad,"Poorly managed. VP was totally biased and only wanted women to work under her. Below average compensation for a corporation this large. Cronyism at its best. Truly who you know, not what you know."
bad,"Escrow is an intriguing industry. I value the experience and knowledge I learned about escrow during the extremely busy season."
bad,"I have only received a layoff notice once in my life before and it was by First American Title during the market crash in 2008.  The commitment they offer and delivery of that promise range widely in job security and training.  Upper management is out of touch with the changing market and contributions needed for growth in the current environment.  Sales and marketing lack education in the product and process."
bad,Unreasonable amount of high pressure to complete appraisal assignments. Clients constantly making additional requests when values do not reach what they were expecting.
bad,Collected Mortgage taxes for various banks as third party representative.
bad,"Typical day at work was great"
bad,I enjoyed the job while it lasted. It was during the point where the economy was slow so the work wasn't there to keep my busy. The staff was very nice.
bad,"responsibilities includes collecting technical requirement from client and working towards it within the deadlines."
bad,"No comment; Training supervisor needed improvement in her approach and attitude in training. Used inappropriate comments, tone .  Was very unapproachable is had questions"
bad,"Place is slow placed no one has drive, the place is an in-between job. Not a place to make a career for yourself. They are also very political and play favorites in every department."
bad,I wasn't totally committed to this area of professionalism.  I didn't want to put the time or the effort in as I didn't want to know peoples financial status.
bad,"Title companies are pretty much the same in terms of pay scale, job requirements, customer profiles and opportunities for training/advancement.  The one thing that can set one company apart from another is it's leaders.  Unfortunately this is the category where First American falls far below the average mark.  Their leaders are not focused on day to business goals and instead spend their time engaging in the drama of staff relationships, encouraging and engaging in cliquish and school yard level head games; missing out on opportunities to truly make a difference in the business community."
bad,"They are disorganized, one of the managers will fire you if you make her jealous, and most others will back each other up, even if the manager is verbally and mentally abusive. I have seen more people walk from that office whether they have a job or not that deal with the abuse."
bad,"The culture at First American is not as glamorous as it seems even though it is being rated as the top 100 companies to work for.  The management team has unrealistic expectations.  There is no work-life balance and employees are treated less than what they deserve.  There is no collaboration among departments and company/division's mission is to generate as much profit as possible at all cost (including long working hours and no appreciation).  "
bad,"I have been a certified appraiser for 2 decades. The lowest pay I have ever gotten for full appraisals. They charge for EO, and ACI software, take it out of your check bi weekly,  do not compensate for your license, or CE. This job for the last 2 years has made me poorer. Its a split of a split with AMCs, very possible to get fees as low as $110.00 for a 1004, also no auto/mile compensation, and you are a commission employee only, so when its slow prepare to starve. They just started time and a half overtime from a Chase prior lawsuit. May want to try UBER before this company. They were just purchased by First American 04/16 and there has been no notification of pay increases, just the same old bad pay currently."
bad,The co-workers are wonderful and you will forge long lasting friendships. Very fast paced working environment.
bad,Good for Team Lead & Next Level also house wives. who are purely looking for career wont give that much exposure.
bad,"At first I would go to work at 9:00 am and begin working all of my files. Some days were stressful and others weren't. I liked working REO compared to refinance, I also liked my co-workers."
bad,"Title Plant Manager at the Houston Texas office, very hostile, uses bullying tactics and profanity against employees. Morale around the plant is horrible. Employees are leaving due to threats and harrassment from management if productivity are not met! They keep sending orders to offshore and our jobs are not secured!"
bad,"Enjoyed my job and worked hard for several years meeting the management goals and personal goals, was a job I put my heart and soul in, learned a lot of the business."
bad,"Medical benefits have a high deductible and very high copays when you go to the doctor. The health benefits could be much better at a company this rich. "
bad,"When I first started at FA, it was a GREAT place to work and had alot of room for advancement. The culture has changed,.. Jobs moved to other states and zero room for growth"
bad,This job you need to have no heart for. Just think of every call as a number. People cry and are angry and so forth. You have to just be hard and say there is nothing you can do sometimes. The management encourages you not to get help from them. They just tell you to get to the next call. Hurry and finish your notes to get to the next call. Always should be on a call.
bad,"Great benefits.  The department is very clicky.  "
bad,"It was good when i started as a a fresher. Just out of college and started to learn many things. There were many opportunities to learn. We got exposure to BPO. People came in from other companies and spoiled the environment to showcase themselves differently. Growth is a tough question, can say impossible. No support from Managers."
bad,"Great pay, strong employees. However there was a lack of training with the team leads and management team. Would not recommend to a friend unless the training was improved."
bad,No management support.  Leadership support is limited due to management occupying time of supervisors and not enough time to support their team. Severely understaffed. Do not hold vendors responsible and allow their customers to be taken advantage of.  Poorly trained/knowledgeable support staff.
bad,A typical day was long with no breaks and a very stressful environment. With the lack environment support made it very difficult to do our jobs from 8-5.
bad,"The most enjoyable parts of the job are getting to help people afford their homes and the challenge associated with the fast pace and high expectations. The hardest parts were the long work hours (8 am-11 pm maintained for months), and the general negativity of the employees created by the competition and extremely high turn-over rate (typically losing 2 people a week)."
bad,"no communication or help from supervisors, great pay but not worth the harrasment from unhappy customers"
bad,"Pros: "
bad,The company would be a great company to work for but the manager was awful. She yelled and screamed and threw papers that she grabbed out of my hand. You never knew the mood she was going to be in any given second or minute of the day. She was rude to customers as well. Very little training and communication.  Talked to her boss and HR and nothing happened to change the situation.
bad,"Very cheap compensation did not drive employees to want to do more"
bad,First American did not promote a positive atmosphere. First American did not encourage employees to try and advance in the company.
bad,A quality company should strive for proper training and adequate support in order to provide an enduring experience with customers. Employees should not be expected to work 6+ days per week at 10 or more hours a day for extended periods of time.
bad,"There were many duties to complete in this position to break up the monotony."
bad,Never enjoyed any assignments at FATCO. It was most likely unlucky timing. I have great respect for the title company however as a temp employee I had occassional assignments in an unfriendly atmosphere.
bad,"Non Stop from the start to end of the day, learned some new Skills, Chain of Title, Complete Foreclosure Process, co-workers were for the most part great, a lot of cursing on the floor allowed.  They had several Charity Events, which I found wonderful."
bad,Has great work culture.  Campus has it's own café for breakfast and lunch for their employees.  Has a Wellness program to motivate employees to engage in a healthier life style that has good incentives.
bad,Management always hires form outside with little to no training which makes everyone else job harder when their sup or manager how no idea how the company works. Lots of favoritism.
bad,"If you like the mortgage business this is the place, they have good hours. You get paid fairly for the work you do. You get benefits which is nice. But there is no job Security with this business and no room for advancement."
bad,It is a good company to work for as far as benefits. But to much nepotism and favoritism drives it from being a company of professionals. Poorly trained and unqualified managers makes the working environment a place where nothing can get done.
bad,Company appreciates their employees so much they offshore their jobs to India. Company fires all parties involved when a Supervisor is reported to HR for threatening their employees. Ten cent raise after serving 3yrs.
bad,"The job was ok to work for but the people where not friendly at all,  just come in to the office do your work and leave.  Never tell you they want  you to work over time until 30 minute before the shift end."
bad,this job was a temp and it was a good place of business and the boss and the co workers was nice and they showed me how and I just like how the hours are
bad,It was an okay experience. Long time ago so not sure how much would be relevant. Company culture was pretty relaxed. I learned a lot as my manager was pretty dedicated but she left soon.
bad,"If you expect little...you will be impressed...the tiny checks are on time and clear.  You get a hot chocolate pack, a candy cane and a mug for your Christmas bonus.  Ooh ooh I forgot...I got a Blanket With Logo advertisement for to celebrate the Holiday too!"
bad,* first working day when i joined.
bad,"workplace was good and interesting."
good,"Generally, the Company is a good company to work for and was voted one of the best places to work in Orange County. However the Escrow Dept. Is not worth looking at. Look other places for Escrow work.  Inter-company movement is very difficult.  There is no cross training for any other field unless it was done outside of the company."
good,There always work to do so you can expect to work on holidays. Expect layoffs and large turnovers which will leave you picking up the work for others.
good,I appreciate them for employing me but I would have worked somewhere else.
good,"Great company to work for, fellow co-workers fun to associate with, always something to do. The only issue was you got in trouble just for using the facilities, including the pregnant women. No one was allowed to use the phone, one had to go to reception area to call family when needed. Couldn't get emergency calls either."
good,You have one job function done every single day. Not enough down time for training. Co-workers are like family since overtime was expected every day.
good,"roller coaster work week, poor training, and poor management."
good,The company was ran horribly. They did not pay well. I would not recommend working there.
good,"Total old school white collar."
good,Potential to learn a lot. Various departments in various states. The company has been around for 125 years. The name of the company is First American.
good,"Typical day at work was busy"
good,"Training was non existent, management was very un professional. Decent pay but would never go back. "
good,"Typical Day of work would include reviewing 70+ files, Management is helpful when needed, co workers work together to accomplish the job tasks given. The hardest part of the job is not getting resolution on important matters in a timely manner. The most enjoyable part of the job is being able to assist, service the client 110%."
good,This company would thrive if they had better organization more concise follow through and continuity of information and training. All reps should be on the same page with policies and procedures. Customers should be able to get the same information no matter who they talk to. Favoritism abounds and there are different rules regarding attendance and paid time off for each department. Paltry yearly percentage raises. Only good thing is the benefits start 1 month after you start. This is a company that doesnt reward you for your hard work and time with the company. Especially when they hire new representatives at the same or more than what a seasoned employee with years of experince took several years to acrue. Very unprofessional environment.
good,"AGM is superior and it's like just commanding."
good,"The company is a great place to work"
good,"Has turned into a do more with less company. Churn and burn attitude with employees. If you work here, learn what you can and take advantage of the contacts."
good,"Started out great when I first started and for the first 4 years of my career here.  then they went public and everything started to change...slowly at first then by the time I left they were completely corporate, adding and subtracting layers on middle management...Some good some bad.  Regardless, the Company has a whole is good, just a couple of Depts. within the company are very bad..."
good,"I am not sure how this company receives so many favorable ""best place to work"" awards. The pay is low, vacation starts at 2 weeks and then goes up by a week in 5 year increments. Although the company offers a couple health options, the deductibles for individuals/families are very high making it very hard to use the benefit. Many people I worked with were very unhappy with their managers and were looking to leave or move to other departments within the company."
good,"Pretty much was stuck professionally in my internal auditor role with state agency. Loved working remotely and the occasional travel, which prevented boredom."
good,"Enjoyed working for this company learned so much. The bad part was management because they are never in the office they are either traveling or working from home. poor pay, they don't really give you a raise unless you meet all your goals or they just give you a cost of living raise also no bonus. The company spends a lot of money paying for management to travel like airline tickets, hotels, food, car rentals, etc. there's a lot of favoritism in this office. long time, experienced and hard working employees get laid off and they keep the people they favorite or the less experienced"
good,I was a hard worker always looking for extra work to do but when given the work was criticized about wanting more work. When I was going through an extremely difficult family crisis I was offered no support and told to leave it at the door. I never felt a part of the team no matter how hard I tried.
good,This wasn't the greatest company to work. The management staff was awful. Every day I'd work and learned a lot about county recordings. Management was poor. Thing the hardest part was ignoring the incompetence the management staff. The most enjoyable the was getting laid off.
good,"I worked here for over a year and it was unbearable. If tour an adult that needs a job for your family dont work here. They do have a well balanced employee handbook that they speak of constantly but when, in the call center, you ask why things in that book arent followed you get told they dont pertain to that department. Ladies get laid off for maternity leave but are rehireable and same with short term disability. They do advance from the call center but its not about your skills its about who you know. As a young person wanting good money this is a job for you."
good,"Very high paced and high volume environment. If you cant multitask this job will not be for you. Training sometimes is lax, and you will be blamed for not knowing tasks. Dont bother reporting yelling by superiors i've been directly told going to HR is career suicide"
good,"I had a great experience working with the ladies in the Reno office.  I was only there for a short time and there were some transitions happening with our management teams, and therefore I am unable to comment very much about that."
good,"I very much enjoyed being a part of First American Title even though it's impossible to be hired on as a permanent employee. Overtime was needed in order to complete job, but I didn't mind the 50+ hours a week. Training on their system was minimal to none, you learned as you worked. Overall experience with co-workers was good."
good,"not a lot of room for growth and pay rate is very low, very pushy management. work hours and schedule are no very good. upper management very hard to talk to"
good,"lots of phone calls and email to answers, scheduling and rescheduling closings,"
good,"Good to work with this company to learn new things."
good,As of my experience i thought that work as be intresting & fun to do so much.
good,"I enjoy the work tremendously but the employees are not respected by management, and our time is not respected. We are at work anywhere from 8 hours to 15 hours per day, and are constantly told how replaceable we are. My pay is less than a temporary employee's pay, and after talking to management about this my concerns were ignored and disregarded. I would prefer to work in an environment where skill and ability is appreciated and the pay is based on experience and performance."
good,"If your a hard worker who can multi task and like picking up others slack, this is the place for you.  A lot of people in positions they are clearly unqualified for, making it much hard on those who are."
good,I was the Escrow Assistant to an Escrow Officer.  When the Escrow Officer left I was promoted to Escrow Officer and the Assistant position was never hired for.
good,"If you want your mortgage career to advance, This is a good place to start for. They will give you proper training and tools to achieve what you need."
good,"Once you started working there, you have a feeling about the management is not stable.  Re-org almost every year, people come and go.  Once the earning is bad (or will be bad), 10% work force reduction will come.  Like in 2007, a huge cut and salary reduction too."
good,Started working in 2004 moved up 2 positions quickly. Transferred to several locations within a 10 year period. Good work life balance. Poor management.
good,Remote position offered extremely detailed and constantly changing procedures and goals. Attention to quality and production stressed and supported by management.
good,A different working environment than I like working at. Doesn't seem to provide latitude to be creative even when creativity will provide less costly solutions to some issues within the department I worked in.
good,"once the project was over my job ended.  I did not learn anything, I taught them.  Management was fair.  Culture is hard core there isn't much I can say about the place other than other people were unhappy"
good,"Too many cliches and the entire management team is related to one another (all siblings).  If you get on the bad side of one of the management team, you will be penalized by all."
good,"Initial impression was great- after three years and a change of core management- the culture and focus moved away from employee advancement and more to a ""hire in from outside"" approach.  This has resulted in a toxic work environment affecting multiple offices, with many tenured employees parting ways with the company as they viewed their opportunities being given to lesser qualified/tenured individuals.  I enjoy my work and my peers, however, management's vision has changed over the past 18 months."
good,"I liked the position of being a closer; however, I was the only Escrow Officer in the office so I was often double booked."
good,"They're in transition, so the prior working knowledge is being exchanged for faster results and more one on one friendliness. However, friendliness does not provide results and this reinforces a difficult working environment."
good,I worked for First American Title for 19 years until I was let go end of March of this year.  When I was let go I was only making $13 an hour.  It took 19 years to make that much.   Before they sent a bunch of work overseas it was a fun place to work.  I enjoyed being around a bunch of people.  It was a great friendly atmosphere.  It got depressing after people lost their jobs and we had to move to a smaller workplace.  There was no room to grow.  There were no opportunities to move up in that office.  I was told if I wanted more money I needed to find another job.  The people I worked with are like family after so long and the benefits were good that's about it.
good,The company as a whole is very busy and a little chaotic but many people thrive in that environment. There are so many different companies as part of FAF it's hard to review them effectively.  Corporate is a strange animal and takes some time to figure out the politics. The branches and branch employees are top notch you would be hard pressed to find a more dedicated hard working crew.
good,The employees become family due to the long hours that are required. The hours can become very long and very quickly. The benefits are not the best but are priced reasonably.
good,First American has a campus atmosphere which is very welcoming and comforting. It is enjoyable to work and the many festivities held are amazing.
good,"Management and administrative professional with over 10 years of experience in customer service, project management, marketing, budget creation, and handling of confidential documents. Expert in people management and liaison relations. High initiative, ambition, and energy. Eager to join a dynamic team and contribute a positive attitude and high work ethic."
good,"Work day 8 to 10 hours"
good,Work is done in the evening so it allows college students to attend class during the day.
good,"A typical call center, I took 100+ calls per shift.  I dispatched technicians to homes for service calls, followed up on disputed calls to provide resolution, and closed service calls."
good,"we have a flexible shifts to work"
good,Good working environment and learned a lot of new techniques in Testing. 
good,"Management was underutilized with so many employees to lead there was no real direction of the company, which caused for mixed expectations from quarter to quarter."
good,"typical day is checking emails, go through funding conditions, work on loan documents, be away from my desk for a few hours. put all recording documents together and make sure all files are done. Co-workers are very awesome and we help each other out. Hardent part of my job is trying to make management happy. No matter how hard you work its not enough. Most enjoyable is, well im not sure. I would like better."
good,"Politics are more and not like to work in continue 9 month night shifts. Average management, good for new start for new jonnie, safe for girls. Worst cafeteria ever in seen before"
good,"I left because the management changed three times in my less than three years there.  I made more money there than I have ever made in my life, but towards the end of my time there I did not feel secure in the company moving forward."
good,"This company was a job. Like most companies that are fast paced they had people coming and going quit frequently. The pay was not very good for everything they expected from you, it was a full 40 hour a week job and the sick time/vacation time was pretty good."
good,"Prevalent nepotism in leadership, inconsistent expectations. The task are mundane and not challenging."
good,"There was no direct contact with management or department supervisors. They were all running the operation from Rancho Cucamonga, Cal in Southern Cal."
good,I have nothing negative to say about this company. It was a peaceful company and a joyful experience. I really enjoyed working at this company and hope for future job ventures.
good,"If you go through a temp agency to get a job there, and if you don't make sure it changes to a permanent position, you don't have as long as you think you do."
good,High energy work environment with lots of long days. The staff was very desirable to work with.  I learned a lot about the mortgage refinance industry.
good,this place was 100% commission had to work long hours and weekends. had to generate new loans from leads that were provided. Order credit reports and qualify customer based off their income and debts
good,"I enjoyed working from home, did not have a lot of interaction with fellow employees or management other than monthly meetings.  I knew my job well and  did a great job for them."
good,"If you do not mind overtime, then First American is the place for you. The culture of First American seems to be ""How much work in the pipeline can we complete with the fewest amount of people?"". This results in teams that are often too small to stay up to date on their workload in a normal 40 hour week, and are thus constantly working overtime. In my time at the company, regularly working 70 hour weeks (or more) was not unusual, and was frequently mandatory. I still have friends within the company and this mindset still seems to be present in certain departments."
good,If you're not in with the clique at the office you don't get to enjoy any of the perks that everyone else does. I liked my manager but she was constantly putting people sown.
good,"Management operates in a clique of cool people. Company is always under pressure to perform for stockholders, which is tough for a service based industry. Corners begin to get cut and while costs go down, service goes down more."
good,"My time spent with First American was informative, and the benefits were great.   I feel that some of the management needed to have classes to understand how to motivate and properly train their staff."
good,"You can enjoy work at your work place, lot of freedom, fun, but not expect growth in your career only some of the guys can get nice position if you work harder also"
good,Nice location.  Reputable company.  Great benefits but no room for advancement.   High volume until recently due to changes in the refinance volume with our lenders.
good,"Trained in Curative aspect of Title, learned a lot very quickly great co-workers, enjoyed the problem solving aspect of curative, hardest part of the job was keeping up with my workload while fixing other peoples mistakes. management for my team wasn't very good, part of why I left, but I've been told that it's been re-structured and the issues I was having aren't as prominent any more."
good,I would prefer to keep this information between myself and any interviewing parties.
good,"Nice facility building, in a rather remote location.  "
good,"I loved my coworkers, I loved the management I was able to speak with directly, and I loved the compensation while working with First American. The most enjoyable part of the job was by far my coworkers and customers - customer service is definitely my calling, and I loved working for and with people. The hardest part of the job was lack of training material, classes, or references."
good,"Have enjoyed 8 years with First American - great place to work and learn.  Began with company in Procurement and then began training and managing the e-Procurement application.  Was able to perform at a high level remotely as the company home office is in Orange County and I worked and live in San Diego.  Recent changes to the e-Procurement application and support model, moved me to IT.  I am learning a great deal each day regarding IT support processes and system functionality.  Direct Management is very supportive and co-workers helpful.  I still am directly involved and responsible for customer support of the e-procurement application but no longer have access to data management and resolving issues directly.  There is some difficulty getting issue resolution quickly through the many groups in control of the data and system processes but the learning opportunity is vast."
good,This is my first job. I learned so many things about the corporate field. I learned how to handle the volumes within the TAT. I even learned how to work with co workers.
good,Conflicting processes and management often not on the same page.
good,"Worked from 7am-4pm. Two 15 min breaks and an hour lunch. Learned about home refinancing. Management was a very young team, as far as age and did not effectively manage departments. Hours were wonderful"
good,Company possibly needs sensitivity training and or focus groups to ensure a high level of customer service is a priority.
good,Assigned sales and renewal sales along with multiple non sales related duites. The hardest part of the job was trying to stay focused on sales quotas and goals after handling collections calls and retention based cancellation calls. Great group of team mates would always assist in maintaining a positive work environment.
good,Great co-workers
good,handled incoming call
good,Its a good company for Freshers not for Experienced people.  Freshers can start their First Job at First American India. They can learn many things about how the IT and Non-IT sector works.
good,"Cinpany wise nothung to say it's too good, but management is worst, partiality, there is no value for honest work, management gives promotions who is good to them not who is working honestly..."
good,"Fun at work, facilities are good earlier but now company is not providing that much, more pressure regarding Quality and productivity, annual hikes and promotions are very less."
good,"First American pays well and sells a People First propaganda to try to keep employees motivated. But in the end, every December, FA has layoffs for the Holidays. If taking a position with FA, enjoy the ride as long as possible, work hard, and never take PTO. The extra $ saved from PTO will help when shown the door and looking for the next job opportunity."
good,I don't want to provide a review here today.  There's really nothing for me to say about the company that would sway anyone one way or the other about this company.
good,"Very small but busy office, lack of office management and understand of the way things are completed.  Lack of training for employees and agents.  Laid off because of recession without notice, which was very stressful and disrespectful to me as an individual with children to raise."
good,There are great medical benefits as well as room to grow in knowledge. Some areas the management is lacking in the ability to support their team members.
good,The job was great and so was management and co-workers. The issue I had was that they off shored most of the jobs to other countries and they had us facilitate in the process. There was no room for advancement and never a raise for anyone in the several years I was there.
good,"First American is a great company, but their sub-division First American P&C need to focus on their employee relationship more. Some departing manager are to micromanagement.  This behavior created a stressful work environment for employee."
good,"Fair compensation, solid work life balance, established company. Certain divisions are run extremely well, others are not. Culture is very ""corporate"", but they have a solid reputation."
good,"Company has been around for decades but management is less desirable. The only way to move up in title is to either leave the company or move to another team.  Internal or group promotion is nil even though it is supposed to be ""People First"".  Watch out the new person will get better pay and title than the person who is currently there for years! Sure they held events that will supposedly showcase their people or rather their cattles, to the world but really, it's their way of patting themselves on the back or the illusion that their people is indeed first when they are actually screwing you from behind."
good,"I received little training and was let go after 13 months.  You can tell when a company takes a vested interest in making you a long-term piece of their team.  In this case, I was let go even after every quarterly meeting the management said how profitable our division was.  Ultimately, they said that business dictated that cutbacks be made and laid me off."
good,Good company to work for but they understaff and overwork their employees. The workplace culture is fun and there is a nice cafeteria with clean indoor and outdoor seating areas.
good,"a typical day at work"
good,It was a good experience. I think more training would have been helpful. First American was a great company with good benefits. They had acquired me from Forsythe appraisal services.
good,Monday through Saturday job. Sun up to sun down. It was very difficult to juggle with 3 kids at home. I was constantly asked to come in early and on days off. Tons of pressure added with weekly and monthly quotas.
good,Great company to work for. I start at the company with zero knowlege about the title or mortgage industry. I started as an ecrow assistant and was able to advance to a team lead.  I gained a lot of knowledge about the title and mortgage industry at First American.
good,"I answered this review in a previous section.  Overall company is good, could use help in management skills and advancement opportunities or availability for relocation."
good,"Very little training. Nice building and office space.Favoritism is very evident. Fun atmosphere, co workers are great with a few exceptions of course."
good,"A nice place to learn and improve on a job . i learnt how to improve on my customer service skills and technical support. Th management helped me on acquiring new skills with the skills courses they provided to the team. The team comprised of highly motivated colleagues who prided in being the best at what they did and assisting everyone whenever needed. The hardest part of the job was to know that a customer was not satisfied when you know you assisted them to the best of your ability, whereas the most enjoyable part was when your efforts are recognized and rewarded."
good,"An American leading company which stands second place over other competitors in real estate and mortgage field. But, job security is at risk as share market keeps fluctuating."
good,First American Title was definitely a family orientated company where as it felt like family working there.  Overtime was offered often which was plus and I took advantage of that opportunity.
good,all the colleagues are very friendly and it is very good option for first job. But there is no space to go up.
good,Learned alot by trial and error.  The hardest part of the job was the constant mandatory overtime they required usually 10-12 hour days sitting all day.  The most enjoyable part was helping the clients over the phone with their issues.  Management was not so much help when you needed them.  They only pointed out the negative and we need more of the positive pointed out.
good,"Fun environment, everyone is professional and friendly.   "
good,It is difficult to move up but you are surrounded by good people.
good,"It was great at first, but too many changes over the years. The hard working employee will not get a raise, but the upper management can spend lots of unnecessary money to remodel their office and take lavish trips."
good,"Work life balance is good,"
good,"A great place to work."
good,"The corporate campus is a beautiful place to work, co workers are good people, management is stuffy. The glass ceiling here is really thick."
good,"Pleasant . The work environment. People were good to work with--knowledgeable, good trainers, professional."
good,"preparing mortgage documents, doings closings and warehousing file to send back to lender. i learned how to do closings"
good,I moved from FAHBP to SVI Insurance when they laid me off they said I could not go back to FAHBP.  This did not make me happy.  I did enjoy the people I worked with and my job as a Cancellation Specialist.
good,"Preparation and payment of payroll taxes. My original manager was great to work for, co-workers were in another office so there was very little interaction. The hardest part of the job was the lack of a back-up."
good,Different walks of life people. Open 24hours for customer service call center. Superviors were great people to work for. Was a great place to start out at on working in a call center. Assisted with training and helping superviors with daily task and irate calls.
good,First American Mortgage allowed opportunity for communities in 35 states.
good,Training was detailed oriented and specific to job duties. the environment was warm and friendly.
good,Each day changes and the demands are incredibly high & stressful. Satisfaction comes in a smooth closing. Management is interested in high producers and there is not a lot of room for movement. They find people that are good at their job & keep them in that role.
good,Best thing to do is go to the company's website and read the listing of the available positions and benefits. They are always hiring and the training is paid.
good,"A family operated business, good people to work with. Limited tools to do one's job. Need to upgrade their systems and provide better benefits to their employees."
good,"Excellent work environment. Collaborative, makes good use of peer reviews, team-oriented. Utilizes best practices and relevant software development tools."
good,"While you had a good work life balance, the company did not make any effort to make you feel like a part of the organization.  "
good,"Sending day to day quality details, production details. Replying to e-mails. Checking the TAT report. I enjoyed the work is my previous team. Work culture is good. Then it depends on the team."
good,"Working at First American was a great exposure to the work force after college.  Very professional management and office environment.  They have a great on site food court and subsidized the food at the time I worked there. My coworkers were great, management was distant, and work was mundane and unfulfilling.  Overall, it was a great place to start work and being my career."
good,I enjoyed working at First American for 12 years.  The last two were very stressful.  Management had problems the last 2 years.  Everything was very secret - employees were kept in the dark and never knew what was going on.
good,Company was a small local company that made a decision to expand out of state.  The management team relied on their local name recognition and failed to establish strong marketing ties to new area.  Led to a change in partners support.
good,Great company in terms of benefits and rich history. There is job security and longevity. The downside is the culture in some of the departments. Not so friendly and helpful to one another. A quiet environment where people keep to themselves.
good,You are expected to work with a highly unexperienced staff.  Lack of retention forces you as a supervisor to spend much of your time training new people to help you make management goals.  Due to the amount of time spent training much of the required work must be done from home.
good,Corporate but local feel in this area office. Rotation of direct managers several times. There is a need for better sales training in this area from a local manager.
good,"Provide homeowner's warranty to real estate agents, brokers & title/escrow and homeowners from inbound and outbound calls. I learned to deal with other professionals such as agents, and brokers."
good,"Out of state support very good, management team very responsive; notary unit and recording unit on top of things and very helpful to clients. Month-end and after hour support very good."
good,First American Corp was my first employer when I moved to the state of Texas. It was a good company that gave me the opportunity to learn the mortgage business. Near the end of my working for them the company was going through major changes that affected a lot of people. But overall it was a solid company...
good,Job security is good compared to other companies. Rotational shifts will be there are most of the Mortgage process. Freshers can start their career to get the corporate experience but there is no future in case of long term planning....!!
good,The overall experience was good and I really liked my team members.  There was respect and trust between team members.  Also another advantage was working from home.
good,"My co-works help me a lot. And I think we are working as a family. So it is the best part of the bank I like. Moreover, we learn from each other and improve together."
good,"Once you get into the swing of thngs, it's not too bad. There is no shortage of work to be done so no two days are the same. Upper management's vision sometimes isn't in line with what (immediate) managers see on a daily basis."
good,"Little typical at work"
good,"Very good place to work."
good,"This job is very standard. Sometimes the hours are long, but overall if you don't mind the customer service business, it is not a bad place to work. Management is average."
good,"But there was no organization, felt lost and alone.  The week I started there was a downsize and I sat in an office with 1 person per row.  I was given odd jobs and worked supporting India mostly"
good,"I worked in the IT department which is the most under-appreciated area of almost any company. I was brought on initially as a contractor but mad the transition to full time permanent about 9 months after being hired. The work was manageable and the hours convenient. The pay was decent. The health benefits were okay as well, but there was no 401k match. My largest problem was the lack of transparency in the upper management. It left us feeling very insecure and plans were constantly changing. Our team was going to relocate then we didn't, we were going to hire additional people, then we weren't. Then a chunk of us were fired, and temps brought on at a lower pay. I never felt like I could build a career here. As work to get by, it was great. This is not a place that you can really advance."
good,"Good learning place, lot of activities are conducted. Workshops are conducted. We will receive constant orders to work and not much pressure."
good,"Nice place to learn"
good,"	IT infrastructure design and implementation."
good,"Work is focused on business needs.  Not much focus on careers for employees.  They present a pretty picture to the outside world, but not quite as accommodating when working there."
good,You definitely didn't have a lot of down time and at times the consumers calling can be irate.  I loved my manager and my director.  The team was definitely diverse and worked well together.  The hardest part of the job was pleasing the consumers that called in.  The most enjoyable part was working with a great group of people.
good,"Typical for large Corporation, many efforts toward good working environment, but many inefficiencies, waste of resources, and leadership constantly changing."
good,Nice clean company. The people/ co-workers are extremely nice and they are a flexible.
good,"Responsible for product, account management, fulfillment and customer service for products.  Teamwork and coordination with vendors and clients to ensure quality and effective communication."
good,"High pressure job"
good,Had a fantastic boss that supported and encouraged me.  I learned A LOT here.  Worked with some really great people.  Wished I could have stayed longer.
good,"I worked at First American for three years and I feel that I took alot from my experience working there. This was what I considered my first ""real"" job. So I was like a sponge and soaked up all the information I could. I learned alot about real estate taxes and escrow accounts. "
good,I started from the ground up and planned on retiring at this company.
good,You have to be a self-starter there is no management team looking over your shoulders.
good,I thought I would love working from home but this job was too demanding and full of quotas.
good,Busy and dedicated work environment. Managment was
good,"A typical workday involved customer interface, team management, project planning, management briefing, and budget review. I learned I am a great team motivator and I learned how much people value being appreciated and acknowledged. My co-workers were a mixed bag of fakers, movers, shakers, and rock stars. The hardest part of the job was managing the fakers. The most enjoyable part of the job was the positive feedback from the customers."
good,"Kaotic at times because of the rules the company had for the employees/staff. We had to take both morning and evening breaks at the same set time as a large group, which was nearly impossible to take the elevator with several people."
good,I have gained a lot of experience with this company. Their training is interactive and ongoing through your time with them. The homeowners we work with are great people and give me great validation for what I do. My coworkers are amazing and yet very professional.
good,"This company offers a good benefit package and many perks for employees. "
good,"brings out competitive nature and competitive employees tend to get work done. Competitiveness generally separates great companies from mediocre ones in terms of efficiency and when you compete against coworkers in the office, that pong-fueled competitiveness gets carried through to work. Productivity is bound to go up when everyone wants to win. Setting company goals that result in ping pong tournaments can be extremely motivating to the team as well."
good,"I have been employed with the company for quite some time now and I must say they are unmatched in the real estate and insurance industry. It is a quick paced relaxed environment , the team work ethic is spectacular , you will never feel pressured nor have to meet a crazy time restraint they don’t fall short."
good,Nice place to work but doesn't have flexibility to move up within the company unless you work in corporate headquarter which gives you better opportunity to pursue other positions
good,"Small title company that is good to work for.  During the busy buying season, you may be at work easily for 12 hours.  This is a fun office to work at."
good,"Not Applicable at this time, possibly will provide my opinion sometime in the future to assist on giving an ""accurate Idea"" of the job environment and culture"
good,I traveled alot for this company and worked from a home office. I really liked working there but decided to go back to school for my masters. I resigned when I graduated.
good,reviewed loan documents prepared to be recorded in the Salt Lake County Recorders office. Checked various credit agency's records. delivered documents to the recorders office for public recording
good,Hard to write about a company that is no longer in business.  This should not be a requirement.  It was a decent job and glad I got out before it closed.
good,Working within this industry it was very emotionally charged environment with fighting amongst co-workers due to high-stress.  I was demoted once I was needing to leave for maternity leave.
good,"Production, deadline, exciting , open communication, as long as you do your job , you will not have any problems, Ownership, training Teamwork, constant learning."
good,It is a nice company to work with but policies are old school. They have good benefits but lately so much reorganization has happened that everyone is scared of their jobs.
good,First American has great real estate resources for lenders and agents . They also have great resources and discounts for their employees. They offer continuous real estate education for employee as well
good,"The people you work with are fantastic, but it can be a very stressful environment to work with. Most of the employees have worked for the company for over fifteen years but have been at the same position for that time. They do not offer much in the way of raises or advancement and often times have high turnover in the 4th quarter."
good,"The position taught me how to interact and have a better understanding of working with my business partners.  Also, learned how to manage my time more efficiently."
good,Assist clients with outsourced duties.  Prepare management reports. Participate in audits.  Conduct weekly meetings with representatives a managements.
good,Good company to work for.  They are the leaders in the industry and leverage technology and experience to meet their customer's demands.  They strive to remain competitive and make sure they hire experience professionals.
good,"I was contracted to work the summer season.  Staff was nice and friendly.  They needed to set a balance for the front desk person.  "
good,I learned a ton working for this company. I met people who have become close friends. I made contacts that would eventually lead to my next two positions.
good,You make coffee here. Very busy office. Heavy work load. Mail runs at your expense. You can take your work home. Stressful environment. Don't pay enough.
good,"Overall it is a very good company. Like any other place it has its own challenges."
good,"Working for this company was nice. They liked that staff got along and helped when they needed. I felt very supported by this company."
good,"I look forward to coming back full time."
good,Our company got bought out and department lasted a little over a year. Its an ok company to work for as it all depends on where you work in the company.
good,I liked working for First American Title.  It could be fast paced at times and attention to detail was critical.  The work environment was friendly. Dealing with different people every with their different transactions made the job interesting
good,Worked at this company for a little while and it was okay.  I was able to learn quite a bit from the people I worked with in the amount of time I was there.
good,"Complete applications for clients who are in need of a loan against their coming pay check"
good,"Typical day is busy. People are friendly and the company provide good benefits. The most enjoyable part of my job was I don't have to stay in my cube to work. I go to people personally, sharing stories while working on their issues."
good,"Protective was a good company to work for, but it started to send title examiners and title searchers jobs overseas. As employees of this company we saw the writing on the wall."
good,"FA is a place to hone your skills but not to retire.  They will keep you working until it no longer fits their budgeting.  The say their surveys are anonymous, but they are not.  They really should stop comparing themselves to other companies shoot for a higher bar of achievement."
good,"good place to work, there are differrent positions with chance of improvement. the supervisors are very attentive and professional making it a good place to work"
good,"hard worker, dedicated to my job, work well with others, team player, quick learner will do what ever it takes to get the job done, will work overtime if neede"
good,"I am not sure how is it now, but in 2001-2002 it's a great place to work and learn. "
good,Great location downtown. Good work environment. Workout room in basement. Spoke with customers on a daily basis. Issued final policies and searched records for the judgments and liens.
good,Culture was ok.  The best perk of working there was that most everyone were friends and there were many activities outside of work that folks participated in.
good,I really do not have mush to say with regards to my work experience with First American Title.  It is a friendly work environment centrally located to the real estate offices
good,Start to finish your shift was busy to beginning to end always had paper to fill out answer phone calls cut the escrow checks that closed already on the phone with the escrow officer but the company was a great company
good,working with contracts is nice because its all there in black and white. Management over all is good. Sometimes there is a wave of managers that come and go that are not that great and could be draining to deal with.
good,"Worked on Product called as FAST."
good,This is your typical corporation that cares more about shareholders than its employees.  I worked there for a little over three years and never received a raise.  I was eventually laid off so the stock price would not fall.
good,It was a good place to work. Very fast paced and friendly staff. Unit I worked in was very organized and worked well together. I enjoyed the whole escrow process.
good,"its a good job for some , but not for others , requires payig special attention to detail, all in all not too bad a place to work, would like to be hired on there again, too bad they like all other placees have a waiting duration to be rehired, 6 moths to 1 year,"
good,First American if very production driven company. Daily goals and minimum quotas needed to be met. Coworkers were friendly but there was not team atmosphere

good,"Had a company car, drove many miles being a courier. Relaxed enviroment, you had your stops at many branches twice a day and the people at your stops were generally good people."
good,Average company. Doesn't really stick out as good or bad in my opinion. a lot of politics. Helpful in helping in understanding property preservation. No more to mention about this company
good,"It was fun for until they started to outsource our jobs to other countries, then we were laid off. Management was great. But then the company hired a woman, I guess her was to streamline the company. Guess it worked."
good,management is not clear of direction of duties and lack of job proper job training. Not willing to pay employees for educational skills unless in upper management.
good,"When originally hired, was a great place to work. Freedom to work and all work appreciated."
good,"This particular job was a learning experience for me. I enjoyed the people I worked with. All the team members really cared about each other and their job performance, If you needed help, someone was there to assist,"
good,I was very unpleasant while working here as the organization was very minimal and not easy to get assistance when needed. Nobody was pleasant when asking for assistance.
good,"Work Life Balance not able to manage"
good,"Good company, but firing people all the time for no reason..."
good,benefits were okay. company culture was good. moving around the company was easy. networking opportunities were available. company lays off frequently.
good,"Hard to rate as I worked production for Mortgage Solutions production, and now all that work is outsourced to off shore so layoff killed my position. "
good,No growth. It will not suit for the people who want to achieve heights . It's a title insurance product a type a KPO. For girls it is a secured place to work.

good,"Overall nice to work, no pressure at work, lot of support with team members. Good company."
good,"Good working Environment, good management, flexible shifts for married women, nice transport facility, but thing is salary is bit concern, other than that all the things are very good."
good,"FAI is a title insurance company . They have flexible work timings and great work place in terms of learning . There are memorable moment, I spent during my stint with them."
good,"A lot of favoritism, takes a while to learn something new.  The leaders don't try to get new business.  Co-workers that don't want to get along with others."
good,I loved all the people i worked with. And it was a fun environment to be in and learn about title. great people all around in the company. Enjoyed working there for the 2 years that i did.
good,"If you want to work live and possibly find a husband all in the same place. This is for you. But if you like to work in a creative or innovative way then steer clear,"
good,"Please refer to resume herewith as it provides a detailed description of my duties. "
good,First american is a great company to work at. A typical day is researching title work. The hardest part about the job is not getting laid off
good,"My days usually consisted of meetings with our team leads, document analyst and quality control group. I received the documents from my analyst who has already reviewed the doc and marked it accordingly. I would then create or modify depending on the client specifics of the project."
good,Learned about title insurance. The best part about the job was the employees. Friendly team environment made the day more fun.
good,"Very cool going day with first american friendly work environment."
good,"Working at First American International gave me the opportunity to advance my skills in cost savings, negotiations, lease administration and the day to day issues involved with managing a medium sized Bank with 12 locations."

Review contracts, title commitment and lender and/or attorney instructions. Record documentation of public record and disburse on commercial real estate transactions. High volume and each day is different, which I enjoy."
good,It was an ok place to work. Compensation was average. management scattered and never a clear message and always changing everything. benefits too expensive

good,supervise team of claims rep and distribute daily claims. train claims reps for claims dept .approve and submit weekly timesheets.
good,Traditional corporate environment.  Surprised at the lack of training considering the nature of the job.  Great management but not the type of environment for those looking to quickly advance up the ladder.
good,"This employer suffered as a result of the recession of 2008.  This was a temporary position for me, but all courtesies were extended to me during my time there."
good,"busy only a the end of the month- huds,closing notes, title issues, deed, hud issues- office leaving when work needs to be done"
good,"Throughout the day you will be on the phone answering questions about contract coverage, technicians arriving for appointments. At times you will experience angry customers, those who were not expecting the type of contract they were promised. First American, just as any company, will only cover for certain things.

He knows how to use his team to the best advantage of our skills. I enjoy working in the team environment, the ladies and gentlemen whom I work with are a fun positive group of people. We even occasionally socialize outside of work. We are sales support/systems administration.

Occasionally we would get a special project on top of the daily work. I actually was in the office with my manager, and he was pretty hands on. But I feel some higher managers would get some wires crossed. Co-workers we easy to getting a long with, but wasn't easy to connect to do to division separation. The hardest part of the job was different sections of the company trying to tell us how to do our job. The most enjoyable was being assigned a Huge project and completing it."
good,The people there were very nice/helpful for the most part. The work flow was steady in the beginning and then fell off towards the end. The company was in the process of reorganizing the structure of the company which lead to layoffs.

good,"Management gave engineers considerable freedom in regards to what time you could show up each morning, and how long breaks could be. Engineers could work throughout the day largely undisturbed, with the exception of daily scrum meetings for each project team he or she was on. Workplace culture was rather dull and unexciting, however, and there was little sense of community."

This included a project that I initiated that eliminated close to $5 Million dollar expenditures on print and paper costs by placing all company reports on-line. Also, I eliminated a 150,00 cartridge tape library that was converted over to a Virtual Tape System saving a football field worth of floor space and increasing ease of data access."
good,IT Dept still needs some process improvements.  Management is good.  Team efforts is good.  National offices varies.  I only worked for 1 dept.  The other depts seems collaborative.

good,"Great Place to work"
good,"Ever changing processes and management - some good, some bad.  Higher level executive management appears to want listen to employees needs and ideas, but branch management appears to need to prove their competence to executive management and does not appear to ""care"" about the employees - only about being on top."
good,Great company strict policies rough balance.  The company could use more time to understand employees needs.  I  would say if you dont have children youg great job to have.

My day consisted of reviewing rejected mortgages from the county. I would receive them from our mailroom. I would proceed to correct them in a timely manner and send them back out to be recorded. The management team was very helpful and gave me a lot of insight on how to do my job. They also gave me the responsibility of training due to my knowledge and ability to adapt quickly and learn. The hardest part of my job was learning all counties in the 12 states that I had, but I created a binder of cheat sheets to help which also helped others as I trained them. I most enjoyed the fun activities Downtown and in the office. The company believed in making their employees happy so that it showed in our work."

I left the company when my services were no longer needed for my job title due to outsourcing overseas."

good,The company has a new area manager and is making major changes to the offices and job duties of employees and it appears my job is being fazed out.  I love First American as a whole company and they are very ethical and customer focused.

Hardest part of job was working in different shift timings. teamwork was most enjoyable thing.
good,"My typical day consisted of working with our lenders,clients, and notaries to ensure all closing documents for home refinances were both accurate and on time for scheduled signings. Through this employment opportunity I learned how important it is to work as a team and the value of communication in order to meet deadlines and ensure an enjoyable and stress-free process for the homeowners. The most difficult part of my position was having to call customers to inform them that signings had to be delayed or canceled due to unforeseen circumstances. The most enjoyable part of my day however was knowing that each closing that took place was helping to better the lives of our customers."
good,Reviewing of deeds was a daily routine - Management understood that when deeds where given to them to sign that they must be returned before the EOD - This was a daily routine.

good,Great company to work for.  Company did a lot of events for staff to keep moral up.  Great management staff.

good,"Typical day involved many of the same tasks applied to numerous homeowner files.  a great deal of telephone follow up with various parties involved in refinancing or home purchases.

good,kept very busy but get to expand my knowledge every day.. Everyday I got to learn more about the title business industry.
good,"A typical day might be to follow up on tasks that were not finished the day before. I wore many hats where i had many responsibilities in purchasing of new equipment, researching expired warranties on equipment statewide. Analyzing the cost of repairs versus buying a new copier, printer or fax machine."
good,"Typical work day, greet customers, administrative responsibilities. co-workers were nice, management was fair. Most enjoyable part of the job were the holiday parties."
good,"A typical work day for me consisted of coming in and checking all wires and closing which were scheduled for disbursements. I was the primary contact for all closers in the Minnesota and Iowa offices as well as the banks. At the end of the day all money must be disbursed, posted and accounted for, and properly balanced to a spreadsheet. Prior to my accounting position, I worked in Customer Solutions where I took inbound calls and completed title revisions and ""production"". I was also the direct contact for the REO department in California, a responsibility and opportunity given to me by Wendy B. I enjoyed most of my co-workers in both locations. Management was great on both counts. My last manager downtown was very nice to work with, fair, and understanding, also very patient. We were often visited by regional managers to check progress, and he really stood up for, and supported us. The hardest part of my job was the overload at the end of the month. In both positions due to closings my job became extremely busy toward the end of every month. The most enjoyable part of my job was company functions and appreciation days. FATIC does show employee appreciation and we often celebrated special holidays with pot lucks and festivities."

good,"Excellent place to work as far as the outbound sales team. Be prepared for low training pay for a couple of months but once you get rolling you can make 50 k or more. Leads are usually decent and First American  offers a solid product. Culture is laid back with a dress code of almost anything goes. Schedule was fairly flexible and you get 3 weeks of pto on year one. Negatives are they will promote externally, and not a lot of enforcement on how leads are handled and some confusion on who gets paid and why in some cases. Sometimes there are  too many fishing poles in the pond."
good,"You may be stuck wrangling legacy code. Not a very up-to-date company in regards to the technologies you'll be working with. However, the managers are often very smart and hard working."
good,At the time I worked for First American it was in the busiest time of the Foreclosure crisis around 2008. It was stressful and fast paced but I enjoyed the job and my co-workers.

good,"As an inbound call center attendance is key, therefore, there's no flexible to move away from your desk without coverage.  Associates were friendly and competitive."
good,Recruited and then laid off immediately. You'd think if a company is going to come after you to recruit you that they would not turn around and lay you off. Now no job.
good,I wish their benefits and incentives were better. Our team went through a lot of attrition as the management team was inefficient. There aren't a lot of development opportunities provided.
good,"A typical day at work is very detail-oriented, medium pace. I have had the pleasure of working behind the scenes in regards to what goes into credit card processing. Work culture is great."
good,This company is a fast paced environment to work.  I did data entry in the production department.  You had to produce quality work and accuracy every time.  The company is pretty flexible when it comes to family and needing to take time off due to illness.  They also allow for great benefits and matching your 401K plan.
good,Good place to work.. relaxed environment. Work pressure is less. But projects are less.  Ppl are not so competitive.  Hence get to learn less.  Management needs to improve
good,Work culture is very good comparing to any other BPO.  You will have the Job security. You can't expect growth quicker which it is little slower than you expect.
good,"I really enjoyed working at First American, I was laid off after the market crashed. The team I worked with I considered family and still stay in touch with even now that I am in California."

From Processing Mortgage documents,Calling appraisers to make sure Appraisals are done properly and up to code, would assist in the Quality Control departments verifying legal documents to make sure they were up to county codes before sending documents out to specfic countites for recording,assisted in mailroom when needed for overtime. I worked for First American a little over 12 years and I seen alot of different management come and go. The hardest part of the job I would say was dealing with the up and down amount of work coming in. Sometimes it could be and extreme amount of working coming in and others very little. Most enjoyable part of the job was the life long friends that I met while working there."
good,"Good place to work learn more from this company, but disappointing about pay in this company and no future growth in this company, no cab facilities allowances are less so i am leaving this company."
good,"Overall good experience with FAI. I have spent one year, it is a great place to work. Had fun along with work, good work environment, employee focused company along with business."
good,"To worried and consumed with the performance index. some of the supervisors have an I am great demeanor. Some of the leads have an attitude that is unfit for a lead. There are some that are a joy to work with. They want you to rush through your work. And at the same time be accurate and not make mistakes. Some of the things they complain about are down right absurd. There is a constant feeling of unneeded stress. That coupled with the micro management in place. The constant changes in the way they want  you to do things. And the fact that you are consistently watched, recorded & monitored. Makes for an unpleasant work environment. There is a high turnover rate as well. For what they want from you, the wages should be higher. Don't expect much for a raise only 3% increases. If you   go to work and do your job without being consistently nit picked or questioned. If you like freedom and  don't want to feel like your being babysat. This isn't the job for you."
good,"in the sense that it can teach lot of things"
good,"The hardest part of the job was knowing there wasn't much job security. I worked at the USAA FSB job site for First American Title. The workplace culture from the beginning was to not get comfortable since the position may end at any time. We were told the position may be extended but there was a constant fear that the job would end and now it is ending."
good,exciting and fast paced work environment. a variety of positions within the company. good training and friendly leadership. customers are usually upset when you talk to them but you get the opportunity to change that and help them through the issues they may be having. If you do not like talking to upset people this company is not for you.
good,"Good to place to work Very good work culture and environment."
good,First American Title Insurance Company was a good company to work at. It was a typical office with beige cubicles and a large office staff. Management tried to keep things upbeat with regular incentives for us to keep things moving along.
good,"This was my first job, learnt so many things and saw different kind of people in the world. Took so many challenges at work place, and succeeded in many things, got quality champion award for one quater."
good,"First American Title is an alright company to work for. The compensation is not stellar, but the benefits including low-cost insurance plan, matching 401k, and employee stock purchase are very nice. Management is very fair, and the atmosphere is not high pressure, however, you are expected to produce a fairly substantial amount of work, while maintaining a high level of quality. If you have this ability, then it will be a good environment."
good,"The Work Life balance is really great"
good,"A typical day would be coming in working on your daily spreadsheet while clearing Titles that have issues with them for cusomters refinances. Learning something new about mortgage and state laws on a daily basis, while creating a new professional customer service brand for the company as a whole. The employees work together to create a friendly work environment to keep the attitudes light while dealing with heavy situations such as customer's losing family members or jobs, these being the reasons for the refinances.

good,"It’s been years since I worked at FA but I left because of unethical practices by my management team. It was high pressure, which I liked but I couldn’t trust my supervisor or manager so I moved on."
good,I worked as a temporary Escrow Assistant at First American Title. The work that I did mostly consisted of data entry and could get very dull but they did allow employees to listen to music while working which helps. I did find that when comparing their pay to positions at other companies in the area they seem to pay very well for the difficulty of the work that I did. The work environment is relaxed and the people there are supportive and helpful.
good,"Driving aging claims to closure"
good,First American Title has great benefits. They provide ongoing education for their Escrow Officers. My most enjoyable part of my position is assisting the realtors and clients and giving them the best customer service experience.

good,"Great work culture. "
good,"I was very bored at First American.  I like to stay busy all day... almost to a low level of stress, and First American had very little work for me to do.  For me, the lack of work almost felt like servicing a prison sentence because I had to go sit in my cell all day and try to pass the time.  I'm young and smart and always willing to learn more, but at First American, when I asked for more responsibility and fulfilling work, they told me I could make sure the printers are filled with paper and empty everyone's recycle bin.  There were, of course, good things about the company, but the lack of work made it a hard place for me to come to everyday."
good,Always making activities for he employees. Easy to learn the job that it’s needed to do.  The people on the company are very friendly so it’s easy to work with them

good,When i was in First American corporation i learned in Administration level how to Manage people and their needs from the low level to higher level in professional way.
good,Great work environment friendly people.  Easy going. Not much for advancement unless you go into Escrow field.  Time efficiency is crucial for this job. Being on top of what the Escrow officer needs in a timely manner is important. Its ok to ask questions management is there to help.
good,Good balance between the different departments. People here have stayed at the company for years and it is understandable why.
good,"A typical day at First American included taking about 60-80 incoming calls from mortgage customers or from local property tax authorities. It may also include following up on previous calls received, when one call resolution was not possible. "

good,"1. A typical day at work will be like an outcome of a combined effort of all our team members most probably it will be like a win-win theory  of work execution."
good,"Steep learning curve but the people in the team are very supportive. Management has an open door policy which makes talking about any issue relaxing. They have ""skip-level"" meetings fairly often where one can have a chance for a one-on-one with your managers' boss"
good,"Escrow Officer"
good,"A typical day at work would consist of assisting the VP/Secretary/In-House Counsel with updating the proxy statement, sending out correspondece, answering telephones, proofing minutes from corporate meetings.  The hardest part of this job was trying to keep my boss organized.  He was unreasonable with any type of help offered to organize his office.  This made it almost impossible to maintain any type of order and/or meet deadlines.  The benefits were great as well as the salary.   My co-workers were so professional and down to earth."
good,"A typical day of work in the Customer Service department at the call center at First American Home Buyer's Protection consists of logging onto your phone and taking inbound calls.  The job requires that the agent has extensive knowledge of the contents of a home warranty contract in order to check coverage for inquiring homeowners.

I have gone through extensive 					training and have become familiar with every department in the 				customer service side of the business; as well as gone through 					MAGIC training, which is an extensive communications class, 					that has really honed in on my communication skills.  The 					majority of my job is taking inbound calls from homeowners 					who have questions or concerns regarding existing warranty 					claims they have; my job is to solve their problems.  I also 					make outbound calls to follow up with homeowners to insure 					that their needs have been taken care of and problems	 been 					resolved."
good,I worked here during the housing market hey-days so my experiences no longer truly reflect the current state of the company.
good,This was my first introduction to the real estate industry and it was nothing but positive from the word go. First American and it's family of employees has been a rewarding experience for me personally and I would consider them a great company to work for. Their training and professionalism are top notch and if you're starting a new career within this industry I would highly recommend reaching out to First American in your professional job searches.
good,"Collaborative, a lot of communication is through Skype and Outlook. I had very little human interaction every day. If not working at the Headquarters in Santa Ana, I would recommend you travel down there. The culture there is excellent"

good,"Title Insurance in Mortgage, rotational shift. Lovely place to work, no pressure. Especially ladies management is excellent. Pick up and drop was good."
good,Over all a great company to work for. It was a newer company when I worked there so they were working out the kinks in terms of their processes. The company had great benefits at the time and the people you worked with became friends. The main reason I left was because this type of work (being on the phone/office work) wasn't for me.
good,"Working for First American Title was a blessing in disguise; I learned exactly what I don't want to do for the rest of my life. The company itself is amazing, they treat their employees extremely well and they truly care about all of their clients. Escrow work is not for everyone, however. Pros: lots of free lunches, the facilities are beautiful, decent pay and great benefits if you stay longer than 6 months. Cons: monotonous work, long days, fast-paced and can get stressful quickly, under extreme scrutiny not to make mistakes, attention to detail is killer."
good,I loved working here very flexible when it came to my children.  Worked in 2 different departments while employed with them.  Plenty of room for advancement and for growing.

good,"Need to be able to work under time limits, multi task and have good organizationals skills.  The pay is good for a job that does not require college degree."
good,"Each day was working through mortgage loan files, entering in the information from a loan and verifying its information. This allowed me to learn more about how mortgage loans work and what is required to apply for one. My management team and co-workers were awesome and always helpful with any questions. Work had deadlines, but most work was work at your a normal pace and the deadlines were achievable, with occasional last minute items. Hardest part was that everything relied on the mortgage industry so job security was never guaranteed, saw many reductions of force."
good,"*A typical day at work:"
good,"Timings was v good, Salary was good, Two way cabs provided, I have learned corporate culture very well, co-workers are good and helping."
good,"This company is great. They offer great benefits, and the workplace is very competitive and fun. I would definitely recommend this company to others."
good,"Great culture. Super friendly with great benefits. Started as an Intern and moved up, but stayed. Not really simple or idealistic to move up in a solidified company."
good,Typical day at work is coming to work ready to face any challenge. Ready to help out customers and create claims for items/units in the home that have failed. Having that great feeling of helping a complete stranger out and making them feel important. What i learned most is patience. with it being winter a lot of customers had no heat and would have there moments to scream and yell but at the end of the call knowing that you helped them they always apologized for the way they behaved and thanked you. So being able to be patient and understanding is what i learned most. I loved my co-workers i loved how FA made it a very happy working environment my supervisor was the best she was always more than understanding and was always there to help out. The hardest part of the job i would say was the schedule me being in school i was not able to have enough study time nor did they offer part time positions. Other than that i really enjoyed working there i just wish they would have been able to be more flexible with my schooling.
good,"At this job I had my own desk and office space which was great. I learned A lot at this job. I learned how to use computer software, make title reports, put in orders for abstracts, talk to bankers and see how loans and transactions worked for the housing marketplace.

good,First America Title Pleasanton New Homes very accomodating to employees and clients. All employees and management work as a Team.
good,"First American is a great place to work, however management is not so great. Management lacks communication and appropriate work ethics. Very rude to clients and extremely hypocritical."
good,All the teams had their schedulers removed and put under HR from California.  The head of this dept. in California was horrible.  She let go of most of the schedulers after a month or two.
good,My general feeling is that First American is a great place to work. The exception is the Downtown Orlando Office. This office routinely promises their customers and their staff things which they cannot and will not deliver.

The management Mark Kyser and Cliff Lounsbury and John Innes are the very best management. You can go to them for anything and if you need help in training they will guide you and help you in all ways in order to succeed your job function. We have had many get togethers and fun times and yet the entire office always was a team player kinda of office. For as huge as the company is, everyone gets along and does their job. Everyone loves this place, its very family oriented and yet very professional. There is no title company that could ever compare to this delightful place. I literally looked forward to everyday coming to work and I never wanted to use my pto because I literally had a great time at work each and every day. I would love to work here and continue to work here for 20yrs or more...it breaks my heart this office is closing its doors and we all have to find something else. First American all the way down to the HR-are delightful people and very compassionate people....its like I'd say a piece of heaven on earth. Who would have ever thought? I tried a few years back to get into the largo office, but positions were filled.

There were some properties that I had to go all the way back to 1920 in order to ensure that no one else had claim to it. Whenever I encountered an issue with the deed from another company I would contact the company and make sure that it was paid before transferring it to another individual. The hardest part of the job was actually leaving it. I really enjoyed the environment, people, and leadership. It felt like a second family working with them.
