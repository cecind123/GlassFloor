bad,"Culture is cut throat, unwavering in its desire to meet profits, and doesn't really care about its people.  I've seen new hires quit on their first day, others having full-on yelling arguments in the hallway, and other unprofessional instances only to see there are no consequences to your actions if you know someone high enough in the food chain."
bad,no room for advancement.  poor management with ego issues.  follow orders and do not offer advice or any other way to do a job.  management wouldbemad
bad,"I take pride in my job and it’s always nice to see the smiling, sometimes relieved faces of those awaiting a package. For every happy customer who has a pleasant exchange with me and receives his items on time, there are three more people he tells. That’s three more people who will go on to tell their friends of their positive experiences with us and so on and so forth."
bad,"Little chance for advancement or promotions. Not a good team environment. Poor management & supervisory skills. Little or no training at your position, sink or swim attitude."
bad,"I happened to get hired very quickly for a relief receptionist role. This company seemed ok, but the Administration department was cut throat and lots of back biting in the department.  The office manager was rude and unwelcoming. The two other women I would have worked with should I have stayed long term spent their time trying to undermine and sabotage me as a new co-worker for petty issues.  Had I been hired for any other department but that one I think it would have been a great job, unfortunately I did not see being promoted or advancing in that role."
bad,The building was not too old.
bad,"The management was okay. However, human resources had ethical challenges as well as lack of benefits, bad work environment, and no employment empowerment."

good,A typical day of work was repetitive and slow. Its all about keeping busy and staying productive. I learned that theres always something to do. The management was always looking for a way to keep the ball moving. in witch they end up selling the company and giving me a poor excuse for a settlement. The hardest part was being content with the benefits and pay. however the most enjoyable part was being employed with a great boss.
