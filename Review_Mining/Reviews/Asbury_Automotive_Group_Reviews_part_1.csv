rating,review
bad,Employees gossiped about everyone and everything. I never felt at home and eventually I could not ignore the lack of comradery. Overall this place left me with a bad taste.
bad,changing environment impacting pay for employees.  would not recommend as the environment is changing and not a lot of guidance. very stressful lacking a vision
bad,"Worked here for a few weeks and oh boy was it a mess.first I was hired with talk of a $1000 bonus at signing. I was hired by a brand new service manager who had replaced the previous manager of years and years at this dealership. All of his techs and advisors went with him. I was one of a few advisors brought in. My first couple weeks provided with me with paychecks under $250. I worked 6 12hr days two weeks in a row to make less than minimum wage which is illegal. You have no way to check your time clock, or sales numbers for commissioned positions. All of this and I still forgot to mention that it has been 3 weeks since I walked out and I have still not gotten my last $200 paycheck."
bad,"Don’t walk away... RUN. If you value your morals, ethics, your fellow man, your sanity, and your family RUN. More I’d like write but it would cause the review to be blocked."
bad,"With all honesty, the concept and potential of this please is outstanding , however the management and team lead in charge with be the downfall of this business . Constantly promoting like minded individuals chasing their own tails not being able to see the bigger picture or thinking outside of the box will never help to pull the company in the right direction . There is no development among peers and for this it will be stuck at a stand still."
bad,"They tell you theres a relocation bonus and great benefits,  they dont tell you that theres a high turnover rate, cutthroat coworkers,  flat rate pay thats good but doesn't mean anything if theres barely any customers coming in. If you are new they dont care, you get thrown yo the wolves, They are always trying to find way to over work their technicians and underpay them. "
bad,They promote you and then give you no training then demote you because you aren’t doing the job the way they want. Then when you don’t do one thing exactly the way they want they will write you up. I would NEVER EVER recommend working here!!
bad,"They hire based on a BS comp plan that few could ever hit. 30-35 sales people, Need to sell 10+ cars/month to make a decent living. Total dealer new-car sales 110 (+-) per month."
bad,This is the most racist place to work ever. They only take care the person who they like or the same color. Work like a salves and treat like a salves..no human right in this dealership. Good Luck
bad,It’s who you know not what you know. They only cared about their friends and no who can actually promote them . It is a bad company to work for and I wish it was.
bad,"This place get away with firing people without reason. Poorly managed and don't care for the little guy. Won't let you advance up. If the management finds someone else that they can pay less and do the same job, you will lose your job."
bad,"If you are not friends with management or the employees you will get fired. I'm the type of person that I don't speak unless i'm spoken to and the people at lexus of Smyrna take everything personal. Management will talk to you like you're there child and do not respect there employees. Once corporate comes to the store management becomes the biggest butt kissers in the world, its quiet funny. Lexus Of Smyrna SUCKS to work there."
bad,Guarantee is only temporary and there is no work. New location with no advertising. All promises are nothing but lies so dont be surprised. No tuition reimburment like stated in ad. Manager does nothing but watch over you and question everything you do.
bad,I have been in sales all my life and this was my first car dealership they provided absolutely no training they stuck me in a corner and forgot about me. I was told i had to work everyday the first week with no days off but wasnt shown anything. They stress for to get your sales license but do nothing to prepare you for it. This job almost made me hate sales. Oh and you have to chase your paycheck to find out where it is because nobody knows anything. The absolute worst gm i have ever worked with they always talk that typical big money talk its the most annoying thing ever.
bad,"Honestly, probably the worst job i've ever had, literally like a high school. everyone sucks, you can do better. i promise you that. Also, no work/life balance. Weekends are a must, hours are very long."
bad,"They will sell cars with no titles, and there DMV desk is behind because no one notorizes the paper work with the customers so you wait for the F&I manager to come up and notorizes the whole stack before you can send the paper work to the DMV. Alot of waiting around. Just very unorganized."
bad,"I have 28 years experience in this field... I worked at 2 Asbury stores and were equally as bad.. they do not care about anything with their employers and customers.. they are greedy.  Their decisions are solely based on money, not what's good for the customer. General managers at the both Audi store in Roswell and the Infiniti store in Marietta are hopelessly ignorant.  Poor leaders.. poor company .., stay away"
bad,The place is negative and they constantly threaten your job. You only get advancement if you sleep with the boss. Not a professional environment!!!!!!
bad,"The Worst management you can find in the car business. They talk a great game, but deliver nothing. The corporation is the same way they promise a pay plan you can live with but they will change it without notice. STAY AWAY!"
bad,This place will drain you. Doing more than one job because the turn over is so bad due to poor compensation. Management is horrible! They are supposedly unable to do anything for you because they have to go up the ladder which never happens.
bad,Worst place I have every worked. Really slow store. No kind of traffic even on weekends. They try and boost store moral but they know the truth. Get ready for a lot of cold calling and harassing people that don't want to buy.
bad,"Finally I met the worst dealership  after 20 years career in car business. Nobody cares for anything . Sales management all day in front of a pc surrounding of filthy sales people licking their shoes for a deal. All of them when asked for help have the same excuse: We are a big company in stock exchange Do not except that something can be done fast."
bad,"Of all the companies I've worked for in this industry, I've never quite come across one where management and corporate treat their employees this horribly. The amount of dedication you show will go unnoticed and don't ever get the impression that your job is secure."
bad,"Selling cars is easy. A scientifically trained chimpanzee could do it. At this store however, complicates it so much, you just want to send the customer[s] elsewhere."
bad,I would not recommend this company to anyone trying to gain experience in the automotive field. I would not recommend this company at all.
bad,I used to love working for this company but in the last year it became nothing but backstabbing and dirty politics! A lot of unfilled promises and decrease in pay!  The corporate management has really gotten bad and destroying the company!! You really have to watch your back here!!!!
bad,"I have worked for several Auto dealerships in two States. This was the worst. This dealership ha 12 hour shifts , unheard of in the dealerships that I have worked for. Management in preowned was competent but new car sales had no clue .The GSM wanted you to establish payments before the person picks their car . His way of qualifying the buyer. The schedule is horrific, suitable to devote bachelors with no next of kin. They pay hourly ages as a draw against sales which is carried over month to month. The advertising is almost non existent but your expected to get on the phone to cold call people to buy cars. This is as close to rock bottom as your going to get"
bad,"This is by far the worst organization I have ever worked for. They don't care about the employees, all they care about is the bottom line. "
bad,"Overworked under paid; especially for hourly employees."
bad,No work barely make 30 flare rate hour's week if u like to work on all makes and models its a use car repair center only Hyundai work is oil changes so it should be called use car supercenter .poor parts dept will not get off the stool and bring you parts never order parts you r Payed flare rate if not working no pay so go figure.no benefits price is cheper to get your own its not a group rate .management ok may get a issue resolved.I wouldn't recommend a job to no one I knew to work here like I said if it wasn't usecars and bodyshop repairs you would starve.also u will work every Saturday.
bad,"The company has no moral value or professional business, poor management that takes advantage of employees. Just my opinion and experience working for them."
bad,"Harassing environment.  I will never forget how I was on many occasions I was judged, harassed hazed by the team leads management at this call center. I will. Never forget the verbal abuse there, stereotyping, and nonrespect of personal views. I wouldn’t recommend this place for any one who wants a truly positive, non judgmental environment. I hope that people see this  and understand that you don’t have put yourself in a position where you are not respected. No one deserves the treatment I went through. Still trying to work past this to this day. No one should be judge for their physical. Crabs in a bucket vibe."
bad,"Pay is probably the lowest in the industry, 10 an is a draw against commission, you have to sell at min 10 cars to get out of the hole, average sales are around 8, perpetual poverty. There is no base salary.  Leads are not evenly distributed its one manager, who prefers to use the good ole boy distribution system, or what ever young buck comes in to offer to buy lunch. "
bad,"Your just another number to them, expect to work at least 11 hours a day. They make a lot of promises they don't hold up to.  Went through 3 service manages in a year. Dont waste your time with asbury."
bad,"This company is only useful as a job of last resort.  Poor pay, no advancement, a sneaky, overly-suspicious manager who will throw you under the bus at the first opportunity.  Work here at your peril."
bad,"This is the most poorly run organization I've ever seen. Payroll is always wrong, management will write you up for nothing as well as fire you for no reason. Do not work here. Don't waste your time with this place as you will eventually be unemployed. The GM of the Dodge store is the worst manager I've ever seen. Everyone walks around on pins and needles waiting for the ax to fall. Each store is woefully understaffed leading to you work 3 people's jobs, never get a lunch and the payroll department is plain clueless. Stay away."
bad,"Managers are young and do not have the experience as managers. Frequent Profanity from a supervisor is over looked and accepted and is unpleasant to have to deal with on a daily basis. Employees are not treated fairly when it comes to the work load distributed out. Some are expected to do the majority of the work while others sit in huddles discussing personal activities or are outside on very long smoke break every hour on the hour instead of working. When you need to ask your superior a question you are instantly ordered  to go to a different person so therefore the question never gets answered, as no one has any time for you. The turn over at this company is extremely high. I would not recommend this company to anyone."
bad,"You will get cheated out of your commission. "
bad,"No room to advance."
bad,The management is poor and no growth or development.  Benefits are terrible.  No sense of direction or communication from higher ups.
bad,Accounting is Trash. Payplans are Trash. Management is trash. Upper Management is Trash. How is this a publicly traded company it boggles me. They need a complete overhaul of skilled management and it shows with the amount of turnover. They are hurting the little guy. Extremely Disappointed.
bad,N/A not a good company to work for. A lot of negativity there no promotions. Just not a good company at all. From the higher up all the way down. Would never work here again.
bad,"Constant upper management turnover makes building a culture is a moving target. One month we are chasing a number and the next we are chasing money. The customers’ needs are not of any concerns, oh but make sure we have a great public image. "
bad,"The management is horrible, they don’t care about you! They have favorites! What you learn in training will be the total opposite once you get on the floor! They will provide you no help, instead just fire you!"
bad,"I can't speak for the other markets, but Asbury Automotive has ruined the Gray Daniels franchises in MS. What use to be a family oriented, fun place to work at. Is now being destroyed by a bunch of,out of owners who have no clue about the MS market. They haven't advertised in years. They replace managers every 3 months, there is no stability period. The best thing they can do is get the heck out of MS and let somebody else take over, which was once proud franchises."
bad,Automotive industry is not for family oriented and or ethically balanced individuals. Greed drives the employer and they have no empathy as to who suffers as the result.
bad,"A typical day is wanting to do the best job that you can, and fighting at every turn to get paid, what a joke. Being on flat rate is just an excuse for managenent to make you do multi point inspections for free,,,AKA wasting your time. If your a professional and honest technician look some place else. If your a HACK TECH, and you know who you are, go for it, managenent does not care. The hardest part about the job is staying motivated knowing that your more then likly going to get screwed. The best part is seeing the dealerships marquee in my rearview mirror at the end of the day."
bad,"This company is poorly managed. This company does not care about its employees. Employees work long hours with not enough pay. The manager is a dictator. The manager does not communicate well with employees. He is very unprofessional and rude to the employees and customers. The are many problems with low morale which affects the quality of work. The employees don't put much effort into their work due to long hours, no pay plans and no bonuses for customer surveys. The current manager is running the place to the ground and the general manager takes the managers side and does not listen to the employees. The corporate office and human resource department are extremely useless."
bad,"I have never worked for a company that has no drive to move forward to better everyone. All incentives are to be put in the gm pocket.  They don't acknowledge your hard work, they just want more."
bad,Upper Management will lie to get you hired. An entry level sales manager will work as many hours as any other dealership with 1/3rd the pay. No accountability for upper management. You will make more money being a below average salesperson somewhere else. I see no reason for anyone to work there.
bad,"Asbury Auto appears to be the same at all locations. Management lies to staff and expects staff to lie to customers. High pressure sales tactics I saw at the dealership were discussed in training classes as tolerated if it gets a car sold. Overstaffed sales floor with no marketing to bring in customers and a constant turnover in staff in all departments. Clicky management team delighted in running off help and even customers that weren't falling for the pressure tactics. GM told us in sales meeting to insult any customer that was leaving without buying so they would never come back and waste her time again. Data base is so old and outdated most calls you made were to people that get called daily from an Asbury dealer. Most computers did not work. Bathrooms were always overflowing but never fixed. 3 or 4 morons that worked there for over a year got all leads and interfered in newer sales reps deals. Complaints to managers got you ridiculed in the next meeting. As a publicly traded company, the only mission of this company is to sell cars, no matter how. I was at a Honda dealer in Pinellas county and even wrote to Honda about the way this dealership operated and was informed Asbury owns more Honda dealers than any others and does the sales. Employees were expected to there even when there were too many on staff and no customers, right up until closing time for no good reason.GM required all staff to work New Years day, but she never showed up. No cars were sold.I would not do ANY business with this company and never suggest someone lower your standards to work for them. The whole"
bad,"I was hired as ""Social Media Marketing Assistant"". They could not get my payplan approved, so they hired me under a sales payplan (just $10/hr). They never gave me a schedule, tasks, or any work requirements. Any attempt to obtain said information was met with ""we'll talk later"" or ""today is about selling cars"". I was let go after 2 months of making far lass money than promised, doing a job that had absolutely zero direction, simply because they didn't have the money for my position. Well I wish I knew that before I left my previous job. Baffling unprofessionalism. Even after sending a 2 page report disclosing everything I had experienced, nothing happened. It was practically ignored and I wasn't compensated in the form of severance or anything. A true waste of time and money."
bad,"Has the potential to be a good company if they were more organized and consistent. A lot of changes were made which is expected of a fairly new and growing organization. My concern is that they did not create a proper work environment for their expectations. We were told we would get 450 leads per month and expected to close 10%. Follow up is a key component for success. I had to handle over 1000 leads for 2 months back to back, which exceeded the maximum amount promised. In handling thes many leads follow up is IMPOSSIBLE during normal work hours. Everyone, including management, was aware of the excessive amount leads I had to handle and therefore I could not follow up with any. No action was taken on my behalf to help with the lead count, instead I was terminated for not doing follow up which lowered my overall percentage. I never missed a day of work, always on time, never complained, encouraged my coworkers to not quit in an unprofessional manner and to do the job to the best of our ability given the stressful circumstances. In my opinion it was unfair and made me feel unappreciated."
bad,"Asbury group may be ok, not sure. Hare Management is the worst. Like a bunch of old woman. GM and GSM are do nothing and rest of Management staff is not far behind. Don't even think they will take a TO or get out of their chair. The special finance dept is a joke. The only way this place survives is on volume from advertising. If they had to work for a deal they would be closed. Too many sales consultants to make any money and Mgt treats you like garbage constantly. Avoid this place at all costs. There are many other places to work that have a lot better culture, training and atmosphere. Lot of nepotism and house mouses."
bad,"This is not a great place to work. You are underpaid, undervalued, and nit-picked for small mistakes even when excelling at the position you're in. While some of the staff can be great people, overall it's clear the only person in your corner is yourself."
bad,"The workplace culture and support is very low, it is all about who you know to ensure you are cover when concerns come up. The medical benefits are very high, the moral around the office is interesting"
bad,Absolutely horrible experience working at Crown Honda. Kelly the GM was disrespectful and treated me like 10yr old trash. Also treated her customers like they were idiots and they were always wrong. Never had a experience this bad with a job before.
bad,"Was very productive, pleasant work environment until 2 employees tried to make a case of racial discrimination.  Interviews were conducted, proving that was not credible, but new management was brought in along with the installation of cameras. New rules revealing new power made job much harder, all teamwork disappeared, decreased employee morale, productivity was lessened, greatly increased turnover made atmosphere extremely tense."
bad,Diffitnetly wouldn't be a salesman or manager here... z Bunch of week as management staff starting with the head guy... Chevrolet manager need too be cashiers at walmart mediocre at best... wouldn't work here..
bad,Long hours  nobody knows what’s going on no good when your on flat rate they use cdk but nobody knows about it nobody is happy there. They just don’t know any better to pickup and leave
bad,If you're ok with just do your job and don't ask questions mentality then Asbury is the place for you. Pay is good but benefit premiums were doubled and coverage worsened in the last two years. Upper management will lie to you just to satisfy you and management turnover rate is very high.
bad,"They will cheat you on commission all the time. Very dishonest front office staff. Also unprofessional HR dept.  New hires are paid on a lower scale than older sales people. The older sales people get internet leads, take ups, answer phones and expect 1/2 the commission on any past clients that have ever sold a car to even if they haven't talked to them in years. The management Sales and GM turn over  once a year. I have had 4 SM's and 2 GM's in the year I have been here. So the 4-5 salesman that have been there for years run the place and know they can get away with what ever they want. The dealership does no advertising to bring in new customers in a very competitive market place. Everybody that works there says it was better before Asbury bought it. I know that half the employees are always looking for better jobs.  "
bad,"I was recruited to come work at Coggin Ford and promised there was so much work I wouldn’t get less than 50 hours a week.  That was a lie.  Ever since I started I average 29 hours a week because of too many techs and not enough work.  And they keep hiring more techs.  I’m leaving the second I get a chance.  Managers don’t care you can’t make enough to live and than get back flagged hours on something that wasn’t your fault.  If you are thinking about working here talk to the techs first, don’t listen to the smoke the managers blew up your butt."
bad,Company will let you go immediately if you don’t make CSI within the first month of hire. No job security period. Directors reasoning was because of amount of money he loses from CSI. Not concerned with his employees.
bad,"Drama"
bad,"The Midlothian, Va is one of the worst places to work. The morals of these people are horrible they commend outrageous behavior and let the good go by. The pay stinks, benefits are good if you are never sick, have no kids, and don't really use the benefits. The service manager here is one of the worst I have ever seen. The sales manager is never open as he is obsessed with constant communication with the receptionist. After being there for a while I started to see what was not being done that they tell you happens when you go to NC for orientation/training. This is a great job for someone in college or someone who has no morals. You don't get paid well for what you do unless you just sit there and answer the phones. I would not recommend working here at all or even to my worst enemy. This specific BMW has the absolute worst management I have ever seen in my 22 years of working. I do not know about other facilities but this facility is not busy. If you want a dealership job Midlothian BMW is not the one!"
bad,I enjoyed working at Toyota. Service manager is great but he does have to answer to people above him. Some of the technicians who have tenure run the shop and you have know say in who does what. All they car about is survey scores but that has become common place at most dealerships. Don’t recommend working for Asbury as your just a number who they can replace at a minutes notice.
bad,"Very unprofessional, everyone's looking out for themselves. Management is out of touch with employee's, corporate drives them to focus on making money disregarding customer service."
bad,Rotating doors with upper management. Constant change in direction from different managers they come and go. Would not recommend working for this company.
bad,Avoid at all costs. I was terminated over something I was told was not an issue and a day later I was left jobless and in need. I would never trust this company again and advise everyone else to avoid it as well.
bad,"Insuring their employees feel valued is not there highest priority. I worked a total of 28 hours in the past month...when I and my peers asked what was going on...I got no response.  When we were hired, we were told that there wouldn't be a problem working at least 30 hours a week."
bad,"Recent upper management change has brought high turnover, low moral, no management support, and lowered pay with more responsibilities. No two managers can agree on one thing and employees are not seen as equals in any regard."
bad,"There was a very fun atmosphere when I first started. There were very few issues with management, clear guidelines, but there were promises made that were never fulfilled."
bad,"I loved meeting new people. It gives me great pleasure if I can help someone out. I also am a big believer in the Chrysler, Dodge, Jeep brand. Management could communicate better but it was an overall good experience"
bad,"Leaving was not a decision that was hard to make. In fact, the longer that I stayed at Crown Nissan, the easier it became (with company for 1 1/2 years). Since day one at the store, it has been an uphill battle, starting with my guaranteed pay being taken away from me, being through 4 GM's, numerous desk managers, watching experienced sales people leave, watching our finance department turn into a revolving door, and being led to believe that I would move up."
bad,"The most unprofessional company I have ever worked for. I worked there for over 3 years. After call center centralized and management changed, everything went downhill. The turnover rate was so high. 13 people quit within a 5 month period. Management promoted people to team lead positions, who did not know what they were doing (seeing as how they only had a year of experience with the company) only because they kissed butt. These so called ""team leads"" used foul language in the workplace and harbored grudges against people they did not like, in effect treating them unfairly. I would not recommend the position of Customer Care Associate to anyone"
bad,The worst type of management you can imagine. The work culture is constantly changing as they don't know themselves what they want. Very cut-throat and uptight.
bad,"Long hours from morning until close seven days a week. Management not receptive to any suggestions from employee's. Unprofessional environment, management talks down to employee's no room for advancement, poor working conditions."
bad,"Though the job itself wasn't anything difficult the level of professionalism that came from the management was the equivalent of a seven year old's lemonade stand. Between fights with the customers and changing deals with customers and employees alike, the work conditions were very stressful and uncertain. You wouldn't know what you'd walk into there in the morning. It could be a warm welcome but more likely then not it was a problem with a deal that had gone sour due to management or to some a pink slip because of the pettiest of issues."
bad,"Been in business 20 plus years, New management is clueless, worst ran service department ever, unorganized..poorly staffed...great company but this location needs a lot of work.management is arrogant..."
bad,"When I started there, I appreciated that everyone worked toward accomplishing their own goals for the day, each and every day. I didn't feel like there was any dead weight."
bad,High volume of customer service with little room to make a reasonable income. Poor upper management and high turnover of employment for a national company with no loyalty to employees.
bad,We sold all of the cars and they never replenished inventory. The management was shady when dealing with banks that they used as lenders and asked customers with poor or no credit to agree with the info given.
bad,"Different parts of management do not communicate with each other and expect you to complete what they want. No clear leadership. I was not adequately trained for the position as promised.  Also, I was told it was not a sales position, but then found out it was later on."
bad,Asbury has few opportunities in Dallas.  You are just a number. Compensation is high for high performers only.  Politics is more important than performance. Lots of pressure to get high surveys. Mgrs ask you to beg and bribe customers for good surveys instead of providing great service.
bad,Loved what I did there but the management was terrible. Detail manager has no business being in the position he is in and the sales managers treat you poorly. Pay was decent but was a hard place to work at.
bad,"Amount of work hours leaded me, after 20 plus years , to burn out and lack of interest in the job. No quality of life , just work.  Man agent turnover at a wholesale rate. Inconsistent procedures and processes."
bad,I was a sales manager for Greenville Automotive for 13 years we were bought by Asbury Automotive.  They replaced a lot of good people.
bad,They hired two people at the same time for the same job and at the end of the day  they opted to choose the less qualified younger local person for the job. There was no warning no coaching and no interaction to indicate there was a problem with my performance.
bad,compensations that were promised were not delivered. I worked night shift with little work and the company barely paid us on time.
bad,"great chance to learn and accomplish new goals. issues with pay. moderate work, fast pace and slow at times also. they do have a great chance to learn and even great team skills as well."
bad,"Today I came into work and was chastised for not being at work yesterday.... my day off? Does not matter what you do or how much you are doing, you have never done enough. Some managers are enjoyable while others make you really want to go find a new job. It is the car business so of course you are expected to go above and beyond every day of every week. Every day is a new day and every month just leads to a new month. Having goals is great and keeps business going but if you do not reach your goals one month here your job is threatened to be terminated. If you are good it can be fun but if you struggle at all you will be stressed miserably. I find myself working Monday through Sunday at least once a month. Monday through Saturday two to three times a month. Kiss your life goodbye. They do say the greatest rate of divorce is people in the car business. Now I know why."
bad,"Parts manager, slow paced job and bored to say the least. Owner would chew you out for no reason and didnt get along with anyone. no advancement possible, no floor manager at all, but had 2 days off a week"
bad,Key Responsibilities:
bad,I worked here for 2 years and made great money for my age without a degree. However the culture was toxic and there were a lot of inappropriate comments regarding race and socioeconomic status. There was no set schedule and the stress of the environment left little room for work/life balance. I learned a lot about the automotive industry.
bad,Work day consisted of preparing car for resale through used car department. Resolving in customer problems or conflicts regarding the sale of used cars. Most enjoyable part of the job was ensuring customers were satisfied with their purchase.
bad,Its a great place to work for young adults. Unfortunately the inconsistency of the hours is a toll on me and my family.  Its hard closing and then finding the energy to open the next day
bad,Upper management could care less about middle and lower management and the amount of work you put in for the company. Management will file you over a rumor that's not even true.
good,"If you are looking for a fast paced non stop competitive environment, then being an service advisor is for you. I came into this company knowing nothing about the automotive industry. With great team of mechanics, sales, and finance people they were able to help me grow and thrive in the industry quickly."
good,"Asbury was a great company to work for, however they seemed to focus more on the ammount of work orders closed vs actual customer support which was an issue with me."
good,"Asbury was challenging, because I entered into a realm of the automotive industry, more specifically mechanics, which I knew nothing about. However, with the short amount of time I had at this company I can say that I learned a lot about vehicles. I also learned how to better manage my customer base and elicit the highest levels of customer satisfaction."
good,"Multiple jobs are yours to do. Doesnt matter what youre title or responsibilities are you will be asked to do multiple tasks. If you agree they will become regular tasks. Management and sales people are the only ones treated right and given any kind of ""decent"" compensation."
good,"Pros:"
good,"It was fun in the beginning, the management was not always on the same page. Overall it was a good company, the pay was ok if you have real goals in life, get in save your money and get out"
good,"I do enjoy working here, but each time I have applied for better positions they aren't acknowledge and someone is hired from outside. I meet all requirements including education and experience."
good,"Working at Asbury was great. However Management was the worst. No support at all. All management were number driven. When i originally started with Asbury the entire staff and executive board were great. Once the left it went down hill from there, including myself and other employees.As I visit the story gets worst ."
good,"Decent corporate company, a lot of channels to go through to get anything accomplished. Subpar compensation, late store a lot of nights after 10-11 o’clock."
good,Asbury Automotive Group is one of the best automotive dealers in the U.S. Asbury Automotive Group is an equal opportunity employer that cares about the welfare of their employees.
good,"Not much to say. Been here for years, A good company to work for. I do have great customers and fleet customers. The Co-workers are like my second family."
good,It's not bad if you love being at work all the time. A lot of power-happy guys in management. It can be relaxed at times. As you advance in the company you are pressured to be at work more often and therefore you get less and less time off.
good,"Miro managed, and no room to the next management level from internet manager. They show favoritism"
good,"80 hours a week"
good,Comfortable and clean work environment. Just run poorly. Not enough employees to effectively and efficiently run a service department. Lack of support from management for any positive change.
good,"Has become a great place to socialize, not to work. No one comes to work to work anymore. Which has lead to the drop in numbers and retention. There is an element of, just getting by, is acceptable."
good,"My experience was that the Corporate culture was about covering the interest of the top executives, while the sale force was despensible. My pay plan as a sales rep was changed 3 times in 4 months."
good,This used to be a fun place to work until new management took over. I enjoy helping customers and making them happy and some of the coworkers are good to work with
good,"This could be a great company to work for, but hard work is not the main objective here. The corp. world still holds true in not what you know but who you know, or thought you knew!"
good,For the most part i enjoyed working for this company. I worked there a year and a half. This company will write you up for anything and everything related to A CSI report. They will point out everything you do wrong. Even if it's out of your control. A very flew system.  
good,"The company as a whole is a good one. Just like any companies, there are strengths and flaws. In order to understand this companies pro and cons, one must experience being an employee there. Words fall short."
good,Very low moral amongst the Sales force due to an out of touch GM!!! He's a micro Manager who has no clue how to effectively communicate with his employees! Other than his sarcastic words of wisdom he's dragging this Dealership down! In all my years of being in the Car business I've never encountered such a disconnect between a GM and his sales force! Just sad
good,Great group on paper but turn over is very high. Mainly due to the ‘not what you know but who you know culture ‘. I would recommend this company for future employment.
good,"Company isn't how it used to be. Management is shoddy, but also depends on where you work. Again, its what you make of it. The company can do so much better, but its the car business."
good,I worked a ton of hours and it was just not the right fit for me. Car sales is car sales. Some people are made for it and some are not. I was seeking something more.
good,"Long Hours, with very few PTO days given. Very poor work/life balance.  Pay is descent, hard to move up. Upper management only concerned with the bottom line with no real sense of what goes on in the day to day running of the business."
good,Fun company to work for but low pay and not so great benefits.
good,"New company that has good business model in place. Upper management still trying to figure out a set system that works of brand new business. Empty promises of advancing and hiring from within. Good atmosphere and positive environment. Since it's the car business, there are long hours. Fortunate enough in car business that company pays employees salary."
good,"Many have left on their own, I only had a few years until retirement so I chose not to leave and was fired for poor performance after 12 years of consistent success."
good,"If you are looking for employment here, make sure you negotiate your salary and benefits BEFORE you accept your position.  Cost of living raises are sporadic and I've never heard of any merit raises.given here"
good,The people are great. I liked it there when I was an employee. They needed leadership in every department but aside from that I think things ran smoothly.
good,This company has many pros and cons.  Many of the people employed are excellent team players. The downside is the company changes the companies pay commissioned plan too often.
good,"•	Answer incoming and make outgoing calls"
good,Long hours with no real work/ life balance. The MIT program was a great opportunity for me and it really evoked growth. The dealerships should all be closed on Sunday and offer real employee discounts to all employees.
good,Initially it was great. The concept was fantastic but the president kept changing things and it was turning into a typical traditional car dealership. Then decided to cut everyone's pay. Enough already.
good,not a great place to work.  Poor leadership. no structure. its a complete free for all. you will be taken advantage of.
good,Turn and burn environment like any car dealership. Long hours and hard work.
good,Good place to work if you want to stay in the car business. Willing to promote from within.
good,For the most part it was ok working at Plaza Motors wish management didn't force me to have to leave the company.
good,Outside counsel billing
good,"Although the pay and benefits were very attractive, as a prospective college student, it was not the right field of work for me. Typical week consisted of 7-12 hour shifts at the dealership with Sundays off. Constant learning wiht several products and sales techniques."
good,I do not wish to write a review about Asbury Automotive Group. I am not sure why this field is required to be filled. There should be an option to skip this section.
good,"I caught on quickly and it is a commission pay job only. If you are not willing to lie and cheat people ,then this is not the job for you. I was taught by someone who made almost six figures as a service advisor how to talk to customers and explain to them the problems that were wrong with their cars. I always helped people with their cost for repairs and never gouged them. I earned 5k per month helping people and being honest and never worried about missing a meal, but was often criticized for doing so."
good,Nice place to work. Contact with clients was excellent. Management in both buildings was very cooperative and supportive.  Work hours was want I wanted. I enjoyed working with the staff
good,"Corporate and management were sometimes difficult, but the people there are kind and friendly. Very relaxed, and easy to work with. Would recommend..."
good,"In this job i was successful from day first step on the job,even didn't speak enough English.I did know a lot and I did learn a lot there. Was enough motivated,organized with set up high level goals and achieved them fast and successfully.Learned the product to a PROS MASTER Level, Excellent Green Customer Service and high numbers of sales and gross. And the best point of my success was,that I did all this over sometimes Bad Management with unprofessional manners and  favoritism . The most enjoyable part is working with Great People from all sides-customers,co-workers,managers. Working  for great company like-Toyota. Leader on the market."
good,"A hustle-hard atmosphere. I learned how to be viewed as the enemy, but still be able to emerge as a hero with the sale. Management is not loyal to anybody, except the money-maker(s). Not a friendly atmosphere. The most enjoyable part is selling the car."
good,The Management team is great.  Co-workers a great.  The car business is just not for me.  I enjoy working with everyone and the environment is a good one.  The work/life balance is not for me.
good,Great place to work in automotive industry. I came here with no automotive knowledge or experience and now I feel like this place has prepared me to take my skills anywhere.
good,"First learned Cadillac engine repair and replacement as well as diesel engine repair in a very large fast paced work environment.One of the largest Cadillac,GMC,and GM dealerships in southern California"
good,Management was great but the company polocies were not the best. they have a great payplan for sales people and really celebrated their employee. I would work for them again if i could.
good,"I enjoyed working there and learned a lot but I wanted to do more with the knowledge I have and gained from there.  I hope that what I learned there can get me to where I need to go,"
good,"nice place to work, easygoing admistfear.  nice coworker with an adult professional environment.  not much room for advancement nice location and parking"
good,The staff there was very friendly and worked with my school schedule. Lots of great customers. Willing to move you around to try new positions.
good,"I was fortunate to work for two different dealerships. Management styles differed greatly, compensation is calculated differently and amount of work differed greatly."
good,"For the most part, everyone works well together.  All work as a team to meet the need of the customer to have their return business."
good,"boss was great, fast paced environment, great coworkers.  Jobs were organized and always finished on time.  overall great company to work for"
good,"A typical day for me would consist of me coming in and gathering everything i would need for the day such as my key box to open cars, my ipad which was used to show customers the inventory, make follow-up phone calls, and set appointments. I would take walk -in customers. When a customer comes in, I greet them and begin to build rapport to gain their trust. Then, I go into finding out what their needs are. I take them on a test drive and once they find the right vehicle, I start the paperwork and take the vehicle to be detailed. Once the paperwork is complete, I present the vehicle to them and then follow up with them to make sure that everything is going smooth."
good,Great experience learned by handling angry customers and handling issues
good,The management is laid back. The culture is great. The inventory is large. The down side is there are not work teams. The sales team work a lot of hours!!
good,"What you put in you will get out, must be patient and take rejection well. Balancing home and work life can be difficult but the money and benefits can be exceptional."
good,"Must be a people person! You need to engage with customers and give them the best car buying experience they ever had, it does take a lot of time but besides that this is where you make your paycheck!"
good,Aggressive and experienced auto technician with strong grasp in troubleshooting car problems. My goal is to provide quality technical car assistance to all car owners which will help build the company's name towards integrity and credibility.
good,"There are 6 stores in Jacksonville FL with one being in St Augustine.  Everybody at Asbury focuses on helping you succeed. They are all great stores to work at except Coggin Nissan on Atlantic.  The GM is very unprofessional and NOT a team leader and talks down to his employees daily.  He is very Narsassistic.  It wasn't me that thought this way, it was the whole store.  I would of never left the company of it wasn't for one guy. When things aren't right at the top it flows down hill.  Get a new GM and I'm sure it'll change.  Sometimes you wonder how some people make it to the top."
good,"This is a good company to get started with. You learn computer skills that could be very beneficial as you move forward with other opportunities. You learn sales tactics, how to deal with all types of people. All the skills you learn there are very beneficial and great to know for anyone who is just starting their job career or to build on what they already have accomplished."
good,"Job/Personal Life balance is not great but manageable"
good,typical day of work would be taking multiple calls and assisting customer with their needs of servicing their vehicle. making outbbound calls 75+ day.
good,"Incredible managers, great sales support, good advertising ."
good,"A typical day consists of scanning, unloading trucks, pulling orders, checking stock., shipping merchandise, assisting drivers and operating machinery."
good,Asbury Automotive is a nice please to work.  I have been with Asbury for 7 years in different roles.  They have provided training in each role for me and have helped me very successful.
good,"When I started there was only four employees. It was a new department and there was a lot of learning on both the employees and managements part. However, we made it through. I still talk to a few of the people I work with and the team has grown and become quite successful."
good,"a customer would come on the lot or phone in I would ask what their wants and needs are, then I would show them thee car or truck that met their needs, best part of the job was when I could help someone"
good,Do your job and mind your on bussiness and u want have any problems..come to work on time be very concern about your work performance and do the very best u can
good,the location I worked at was extremely relaxed and worked with me to make the best schedule to meet my needs. Overall I would suggest working here because of how good to their employees they are.
good,"A typical day is:"
good,This is a cool place to work.  This job would be great for me because I like to drive. But at time it can be annoying at time. But at other times it's fine.
good,ok to work their. didn't have a problem with anyone per say.  a lot a politics though. one wrong move and that's all they remember. I only want to leave because i don't want to be in the automotive field any more
good,At this time I do not have any comments about the company.  It was an average organization to work for.  I conduct the orientation enjoyed meeting the new employees coming into the company.
good,I like the people i work with they are great. Seems hard to get to school. and flat rate pay takes some getting used to. A typical day at work is 8 and half hours long. If you work on Saturday they provide lunch which is great.
good,"Gray Daniels Brandon Nissan is an excellent place to work if you want the to make a great living with a chance to move up in position. You will learn how to how to work with people on a professional level, rather it be your co-workers or your customers. Management is okay but it definitely will not affect your work ethic as a sales consultant. Be prepared to work long hours and have less time with your family or enough energy to enjoy your leisure time. However, working here can be enjoyable and rewarding if you do not mind offering excellent customer service with honesty and integrity."
good,"I enjoyed learning new stuff , working in Service department , having good customer service .Seeing a lot of different cars and test driving them .Calling customers on their cars"
good,"Learned everything I know about the car business from Asbury. Was part of an era where company culture was strong and ran deep (don't work there anymore so can't speak to that now). The definition of work hard play hard. Trained every single day and every person was expected to WORK. Politics only got you so far and you were promoted based on performance. Every person above you was a mentor and a leader. Relationships were created and kept beyond promotions and skills were always being honed. Long, hard work days with high standards but you felt good about the work you did."
good,"I like the work environment as a whole, no issues with the my job area. .If you work hard can make alot of  $$$.So that is good! !Plus if you are the best at what you do eventually you become the guy. Because they know that the job will get done right the first time around which turn pleases the customers."
good,"I cannot give a full review yet as I was just hired. However, the manager I interviewed with seems like he will be great to work for. The communication has been great throughout each step of the process."
good,"Not hard at all, however I do greatly question ability to move forward in my career there.  The process there is dehumanized however management tries to mask it as humanized."
good,Great place to work. Scheduling fair.  Lots of inequity in sales opportunities. Lots of opportunities to make money with effort.   Hours are fair for all.
good,"Plaza was a great summer job and i wish i could have stayed there longer. however i was just getting into the core of my nursing classes and needed the time to study so i had to give it up unfortunately. The job was easy and fun, because i was able to drive very nice cars and meet many amazing people. My Coworkers were very genuine people and I leanred quickly from them."
good,"Job is very interesting, just as any sales job is. It has its up and down points. Hardest part of this job is the hours and uncertainty, because you are relying on people to buy for you to earn your money. Coworkers are great, and the senior management staff are highly knowledgeable. All around its a safe and secure job as long as you are there giving it your all."
good,"Asbury is a little different than the other companies I haved worked for,"
good,"so far good not any issues nice people nice place good job good benefits should pay more, good commute nice managers nice sales people good good good good good good"
good,"Anxious to start working.  I really can not  tell about my experiences, for I have yet to have any. I  can say that im ready to learn new things as I  progress with this company."
good,My experience with Asbury has been extremely positive. I'm excited about my new career opportunities. They also offer fantastic benefits as well as a nice working environment.
good,They were putting together a BDZ for customer that wanted to buy or lease a car could make 1 cal and speak with an expert on the selected vertical answer any questions and give them a firm price and availability of the specific vehicle they were interested in and also do all the paperwork and have the car delivered to the customers house. No haggle best pricing and availability.. Great for customers who do not like going to the Dealership to purchase a car.
good,The hours are good and I get to meet a lot of people and get to learn new things that I have never learned before. And I get to drive all the nice cars
good,Seems like a great company so far. Room for growth and the team seems very helpful. Excited about working and moving up in the company. They offer good benefits and pay.
good,"I am having a hard time answering this survey because I have not worked there under the management that is there now, so I do not know how it will be. So far the management seems great. The hardest part of my job is trying to put a car back together that I did not take apart."
good,Asbury is a cool place to work. The work is good an the payoff is better. The coworkers are great and it makes the environment layed back but not slacking.
good,I havent started yet so not sure how to answer this . As for the interview the manager that I talked with seem pleasant and was having a good day so far.
good,"When I first began working for Nissan the first thing that I was told was that there are two things that people are always going to make sure they buy, a house and a car. Also the importance of these two items doesn't make the sales easier but you would need to know your product as well as learn how to build relationships with your clients. The more you know of the client the easier the job will sooner get."
good,Very results driven everything was based upon what are you going to do today.  Yesterday was over.  Car business can be a tough career this was the grind...
good,My dealership is very worker friendly. Lots of opportunity to advance and move forward in life. Dealership is a volume dealership very competitive. Best work environment
good,"I loved being able to interact with customers on a daily basis, it made my job fun and rewarding to know I was helping people out with their vehicle needs."
good,Easy going with nice co-workers. Nice and lax policy for asking time off. Good benefits programs. Very understanding for sick days and family emergencies.
good,"Its a great place to work for. There's always work to do. The other employees are always helpful. I have learned so much about body repair and detailing cars. The hardest part is, detailing cars in the heat.The most enjoyable part of the job is seeing all the cars when there finished and getting delivered to the customer."
good,"When it comes to process and procedures, not a better organization out there.  A very enjoyable environment with growth potential, downside was bonus plan"
good,"Good Corporation to work for, take care of their employees and opportunity for growth. Only down is constant change of management as part of the corporation regular rotations of general managers. Corporations owns lots of stores and all the manufactures so there is lots of options to make a long career in the car business."
good,Asbury is a great company to work for.  They have a cross the board culture that is evident in each of its 89 locations through out the country.
good,"If you're getting into the car business, definitely go with Asbury group. Full benefits, compensation and pretty good management. Way better than going with some private mom and pop shop that just wants to do unethical business. They train you well, treat you well (HR is great) and at times even feed you well too between training and employee luncheons. Overall great experience and great company."
good,This company seems to value the employees. They often have food catered to us and most holidays are off with pay. Decent compensation although could be a bit better. And it's a Monday through Friday job with weekends off and weekly pay. As long as you come to work and do your job you're basically fine. My supervisor can sometimes be mean but I mean things can't be perfect I guess. Also some of the co-workers have attitudes for no reason so there's that.. but most people here are polite. Not a bad job at all.
good,The customer is the first priority to all our jobs. Plaza has always taken care of the customers. Working here for 17 years you get to have a customer relationships.
good,I started with Asbury as a MIT and it was a greta way to get in the car business.  Their training schedule is great and starting pay is very competitive.
good,I believe this company is a good stepping stone for anyone who one loves sales but more than anything is a good conversationalist. I love the company and happy to be apart of their team.
good,Great service department. managers and owners very close to employees. benefits are slightly expensive but better than most dealerships in area. pay is somewhat low for starting rate.
good,"I didn't work there for very long but the people were nice, and management was good. The car sales industry just isn't for me. I don't like being forced to write these reviews."
good,Great experince to learn about the luxury car world. Learn a great deal of information and met plenty of great people. And there are plenty of opportunites to expand because of the size of the company
good,My day consisted of cleaning the church and school which taught me organization and perfection
good,Not sure what to say here because I haven’t started at this dealership yet I won’t start until Monday June 25th upon my start I will have more information for this part of the survey.
good,"The company recently made a significant investment to provide a new space for the marketing team, including a ping-pong table, foosball, a collaboration station, and two big-screen TVs. Overall, the culture is relaxed, but management trusts employees to get the job done. As for management, they are very easy to get along with, are encouraging, and always ready to provide praise/affirmation for strong work when they see it."
good,"Asbury , going to work for Asbury was a great experience for me., management was excellent in doing his performance, a great culture of people  to work with."
good,"I learned many things from this job such as cleaning cars, how to drive manual, and different driving techniques. Though the job could get very busy and overwhelming on certain days, the work environment was very professional and encouraged me to keep working."
good,"Clock in"
good,"My experience with Asbury Automotive has been great.  The accounting group I work with are truly a team.  The Management and other areas have not been as pleasant since Corporate has bought the company.  Things that should not be taken out of the store has been and causes quiet confusion with our vendors who have been with us for years.  I have learned and grown in my position as accounting clerk/deposit specialist.  I've learned more about the accounting process.  Journal entries, credit, and debits.  I do enjoy the deposits part of the job more than the payable, but have done payable for years so it comes as second nature."
good,Well is not much to said about this the only thing would be nice is the should promote employees base on there performance not on who they know other then that good place to work for
good,"Easy, straightforward interview process. Great environment to work in. Havent started yet but my first impression on Asbury was great and it seems like a awesome company to work for!"
good,"co-workers are very easy to work with. I like being in a drug free environment, and not having to worry about that.  everyone gets along, and no drama, witch make for a nice place to work, and you enjoy doing your job.  nothing about this place is a draw back, except for when business gets slow."
good,Walk in get ready for a hard working friendly day. Most people were very kind and wanted immediate service and I was there to greet with a smile. The job was not hard at all the most enjoyable thing was meeting new people and personalities.
good,"Never a dull moment being a service advisor. There are always people to help, problems to fix, and customers to satisfy."
good,"Typical day of work included answering all incoming phone calls to the dealership and directing the phone calls to the correct destination, greeting all customers that came into the dealership showroom. Preforming cashier duties in the service department for service, parts, and sales customers. Promoted and preformed Service Advisor job. Wrote repair orders for incoming service customers. Worked hand in hand with customer and technichains to gaurantee customer satisfaction. Promoted to accounting office to title clerk and was responsible for completing the tag and title work for all new and used car purchases."
good,Lots of hours high compensation lota of stress. I woukd recommend to further enhance skills in the auto sales industry. However you have to be able to handl high stress
good,"Work day is 12 hours, its a lively and up beat work place. It is a place that leaves your success in your hands. If you want to succeed they line up the directions for you to get there. Its a fun work environment for a group of hard working individuals."
good,Taking customer cars from place to place. I learned how to talk people. My manager was a good person. I got along with my co-workers so that was cool. delivering cars to the customer houses. driving exotic cars.
good,Still early on with the company but so far it seems like a great place to be and a great company to build a future with. Can’t wait to see what the future holds
good,Nice place to work the coworkers are nice and friendly the work place environment is fast paced but can also turn into being really slow just all depends on the day
good,I have learned a lot at my job.  I want to pursue a career being a Financial Director or General Sales Manager in the near future. I feel like my career is headed in the right direction and I am looking for more opportunities for growth in the company.
good,Plaza Motors was a great work experience for me it helped me with my data entry experience. It was a very laid back work environment managers and co-workers were like a family. The hardest part of my job was leaving for me because everything else was a breeze for me. The most enjoyable part of my job was being in my own work space doing my job listening to my preference of music and learning the car business from some of the salesmen throughout plaza motors.
good,"review all incoming e-leads, internals, check all CIT,  deal meeting, salesperson follow-ups, generate internals, appraisals, inventory control, pencil and close deals. Worked directly for GSM. The hardest part of my day would be finding enough hours. The most enjoyable part of my day was feeling that I accomplished something."
good,"Overall a good company. I would consider going back with the new Sprinter location opening. I learned things about cars that I never new. The hardest part of the job was not being able to stock in cars for sales, and waiting on corporate office to stock manually."
good,I just started today. But I have bought my last car from this dealership and felt that the Sales team is fair and always eager to assist and help. That made me want to work for the dealership. The dealership is clean and the people are amazing.
good,"Busy from 6am to 2:30pm."
good,"Asbury were a company that were very demanding, sometime very long hours, but the rewarding part were finally getting customer approved in their purchases."
good,"Have worked 2 days, i am a new hire. work enviroment seems very nice, good employees to work with, nice dealership. Nice working on high line vehicles."
good,"Great place to work, customer services is key, then product knowledge if you can get that down pack your a sure winner at this job.Friendly staff and customers"
good,"Nalley is one of the best dealerships that i have ever work with.  They seem to listen when an employee has a concern rather than just let them go.  The sales and service staff are caring a great to work with."
good,"it was a great transition from pre-writing to service writing, they set me up for success and everyone is willing to help. Great work environment and it is definitely fast paced"
good,"Not a bad place overall. Great place to start in automotive. As the guy who hired me said, its where you go to learn/not to earn. Good people though, straight forward atmosphere."
good,I just started but from what I can tell it seems like a great place to work with opportunities to advance in the company.  They take the time to train you properly and have a salary base pay with commissions.
good,Fun to work at a dealership that is committed to constantly improving itself. They offer competitive pay for the area and an opportunity for advancement within the company.
good,I really enjoyed my time with the Asbury Automotive Group and regret that I left.  The corporate office gives great support and I really enjoyed our dedicated staff.
good,"Very interesting working in several stores, with different product lines."
good,The hardest part of my day is when I can’t help a customer. My job is making each and every customer satisfied with the best I can give. I set service appointments and help service advisors better assist there customers.
good,I came back to Asbury Automotive less than a year after leaving the year prior. I had already worked for this company for almost 6 years and after working for a couple of other jobs I realized what Asbury offered as a whole was much higher than the average corporation. I would come back a 3rd time if I ever left in the future (which I have no plans of doing)..
good,Good company to work for. Updated equipment to make work easier to get work completed. Manager and other employees always there to assist you when needed to help completely satisfy customer.
good,Good Professional atmosphere.  Opportunity for the ones that work hard!!  If you like helping people it is the best job in the world.  Great customer service translate into great paychecks!!
good,"A typical day at work would start at 8:30 am. I would start by stocking office supplies for the daily sales transactions. I would then call potential customers in order to schedule V.I.P appointments, and arrange the show room with the desired vehicle for the customer. I would then follow up with past and present customers, answering any sales questions. I would occasionally disperse other in-coming calls to the correct departments for quality assurance. I would also assist with customers contract signing, and other various paperwork. The management was excellent, and the environment was pleasant to work in. My work did have some challenging moments however, I never found any of my task difficult to complete or handle. I enjoyed working side by side with my fellow co-workers, and  I enjoy getting to meet all sorts of different people while assisting them with their individual needs. I learned how to efficiently and effectively communicate with others, and how to multi task in a fast pace environment."
good,"The car business is tough, but can be REWARDING! You have to be prepared to work 55-60 hours a week to be successful, but other than that it's EASY WORK! Make your phone calls and follow the sales process that they teach you in your training and you are GOLDEN! Get chummy with the service advisors and they will bring people to you when it may be time for the customer to get a new car. Do everything you can to be apart of the Interned Sales team. Everybody gets a piece of the pie, but you decide how big you want your piece to be."
good,"At Nalley Lexus we are here to make all the customers happy from the front of the service department to the shop. We are like a family and work hand in hand with each other to get customers cars diagnosed and repaired, serviced, or recalls performed."
good,"Asbury Automotive is a great company to work for. The typical work day depends on the position however, work-life balance is essential for all roles. The management style differs per setting however, the style I have seen the most is Collaborative. I truly enjoy helping others and improving the well-being of candidates/co-workers lives in my position."
good,"My team is the best, we help each other! "
good,Very nice people who are understanding. Everyone greets you with smiling faces and will be happy to help you out if you need it. Also the food is very good.
good,"I've only had great experiences so far while at this location, very sweet people, quick paced but relaxed. Looking forward top doing business in the future as well."
good,"I loved this job.  Comfortable.  You could be sick without feeling like you had to come in.  Everyone worked together to get a job done.  We could listen to music in our headphones.  Get system to work with.  Great time off and benefits.  Pay was wonderful.  I did not intend on leaving this job.  I was surprised to see the jobs moved to Atlanta, but understand the business decision."
good,"Honestly I wouldn't recommend selling cars as a first job or for anyone who keeps a close eye on your money and expect to know every little detail about how you get paid.  This is sales.  I cannot express this enough and selling is a competition and being competitive is what makes you a great salesman.  In this environment, sales people are called consultants because we are not supposed to be selling.  To die hard door to door, or face to face sales people this is the hardest job we will ever have.  To a newcomer the process this company uses and how they expect for you to perform actually makes sense and works.  I learned that selling cars means long days and hard work.  I always believe that sales people dont get enough credit for being foot soldiers.  Asbury believes this ideology and force you up or out.  I can't hate on a business doing what a business is supposed to be doing.  HIring and Training people to make a decision.  ""Make money or make moves"""
good,"This company is amazing! from the culture to the work life balance. if you're lucky enough to work here, you will have a great time. lots of training and family feel."
good,"I have not started working yet, but everyone has been very professional with me and I am looking forward to working with Asbury. Management has been very helpful."
good,Outstanding company who really valued the working man. Gave out bonuses to more than deserving employees. Constantly had offsite events to make the employees feel like they were part of a team
good,good place to work. easy to balance work and family.  co-workers and management worked easily together.

good,"My experience has been a good one, for the last 18 months. I am a Master Dent Tech for the dealerships in Greenville, SC. The people I work with and around are professional and hard workers. Those that constantly fail are those that don't have strong work ethics. Its not about how much time you can put on a timecard its about how much work you actually do while at work. If your a hard charger and want to make a solid income this is a great place to work. If you want someone to hand you a paycheck for your timecard then you will hate it, because you won't last."
good,Excellent employee benefits and excellent employee relations. Excellent work pace and family activities.Monthly seminars related to  the auto industry and other employee matters.
good,"My first job in this company was selling cars.  I was new to sales so I worked countless hours selling, training and developing my skills.  The hours were long and I rarely took a day off, not because I was required to, but because I was eager to further my career.  The money was great and my efforts paid off.  I have worked for this company almost 7 years and I have averaged a promotion every 8 months, working my way through the dealership, regional and national ranks.  What I like about Asbury is we have the tools for the motivated individual who wants to grow, and we look from within to promote before looking outside.  For the potential applicant that reads this review:  Yes, car sales is hard, the hours are long, they pay is good and depending on how much drive you have to grow... your potential for advancement in this company is practically limitless."
good,"I began working for the company in sales in 2009. After my first year I made salesperson of the year and kept that status until 2013 when I decided to look for a new challenge and requested a transfer to corporate.  I was hired as a Corporate Recruiter where I am flourishing and enjoying the new challenges.  The dealerships I recruit for in the Courtesy Group have supportive management and are always eager to promote from within.  I'm living proof and am grateful for the opportunity to prove myself again!"
good,"I've worked for Nalley (Asbury) for over 5 yrs and I can truly say it has been remarkable. The company offers many different training programs to enroll in, educate yourself and or prepare for advancement. It's now my 5th year and I've been promoted 7 times! I've had the opportunity to work in every position of a dealership. I worked my way up from a receptionist to top management. The journey was never easy; but what successful journey is easy? I learned best practices of customer service, finance and insurance policies, eCommerce/SEO, how to motivate a staff that has more experience then you and to get results, how to reduce costs and how to create a great culture and a great place to work. A piece of advice for people coming into the company would be to be a team player, treat everyone with respect, research what the job is before applying and note that the hours do pay off! The hardest part about the job is the hours but, all retail positions have long hours but the great thing about the auto industry is that it pays much more then your typical retail stores at the mall. I've had some great bosses and they all taught me something along the way that I now pass down to my team.The most enjoyable part of my job is that I get to help other people be successful and implement new ideas for the company to continue growing. In my other role, the most rewarding part of my job was helping customers find their dream car and getting them financed on it. The auto industry is job security; everyone needs a vehicle. Its just a matter of where they want to buy it. Asbury is going no where;"
good,I would recommend to anyone to Asbury. It is a great company to work for.
good,wonderful opportunity and able to learn so much about the company
