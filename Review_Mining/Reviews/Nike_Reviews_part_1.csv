bad,Hate working here its only temporary hope and its not nike its churchs chicken. I applied for cashier got put as cook/prep. I hate cooking first of all. And dont like working here when i got certificate in medical office administration
bad,"When I started working for Nike I really enjoyed every moment of it. However, it was apparent after a few months that there was a patriarchy within the system. We were expected to take abuse on the daily and often told there was no solution to the customers issues all for a ridiculously low wage. A lot of the issues customer called about were reoccurring issues that Nike clearly wasn't bothered solving. The management was dreadful, none of them had a clue what they were doing half the time and they would pick on you over stupid things, going as far as questioning you over how long you took in the bathroom! There was a lot of favouritism within the company as many people who were constantly messing up orders and lying to customers were getting promotions all because they were friends with the managers whereas people who worked  extremely hard got treated like dirt because they weren't a part of the 'in crowd'. I could go on and on but honestly it's not even worth it don't work for this company all they care about is the money they couldn't care less about their employees or their customers."
bad,Bad will not ever go back because they will lie on you about anything and everything. When I was there it was 2 people with the same name and theyfired ine person for the
bad,"Last resort place to work. If you make one mistake, they fire you. Then, it's not even your own manager that does it, someone you don't even know does. Favoritism abound. Be careful if you work on the Shelby location, they decided to keep an arsonist who could've burned the building down and killed people there."
bad,"Desastre rrhh, sos un número más, cero objetividad a la hora de evaluar tu performance laboral, encargados abusivos y coercitivos."
bad,I will never work here again I hate the company worst experience of my life that's all you need to nothing else to say but go find out for yourself how horrible it is
bad,"Do not recommend they only give you opportunity if they like you. You can do an excellent job and if the don’t like you there’s no way they will ascend you. The management gives you retaliation, which is a Nike policy to not have any sort of retaliation."
bad,Wouldn’t recommend picking needs a better process too many people trying to pick at the same time very overwhelming and people arguing over totes which was ridiculous
bad,started working with Nike and the first three months were ok. The team feels some type of way when new employees are hired. There's no proper training  They just pass you around to the full-timers in every department and the full-timers don't even want to train you. Or if they are training you they don't train you by store standards.
bad,Nike is the worst job I’ve ever had the management is horrible and the company is just straight out the worst company would not recommend this job to anyone only casual contracts and part time contracts are only 10 hours the worst company ever!
bad,"Management is horrible. They say the hire within for positions, but they don’t. They give management positions to people that don’t deserve it. If you work hard and go the extra mile they never appreciate it or acknowledge it, but if you are doing horrible they well not hesitate to point that out."
bad,Fair place to work the management was constantly replaced. Work schedule was not up to par and constant scheduling conflict. Very little opportunity for advancement
bad,Too much walking n pushing heavy carts around.. then the people you gotta deal with ain’t worth the money and the lunch break are so stupid how they got them set up
bad,They don’t pay well at all. They tell you part time but then ask you for 36 hours of open availability. One week you can have 10 hours then the next 30
bad,"The Nike store in Columbus was very unorganized and had a high turnover rate. The lack of proper scheduling and hiring the right people to represent the brand resulted in many call offs and being understaffed constantly. Yet they didnt do anything to correct this. They showed extreme favoritism and this played a hand in the high turnover rate. The managers seemed like they were on different pages with store goals and were really only worried about their vacation time, mainly their focus on having the busy weekends off. It was truly unprofessional. I've worked for the Footlocker brands and Finishline company and they had more control over their daily operations. They weren't aware I was an Assistant Manager at these places and as a basic ""seasonal athlete"" (working full time hours without the proper promotion) on how I was viewed by them they must not have thought their unprofessionalism would he noticed as much. Although it is a new outlet store in Columbus, Store number 217 needs major help and new management immediately. Most managers never worked for Nike and came from places such as Target, Walmart, etc. So they were just learning the brand and the products, while still being ineffective at routine staff management. Good store for discounted products, but terrible service excluding a handful of employees."
bad,Don’t work here!!! It was the worst place I ever worked. The management disrespects you treat you like you’re dirt.     You receive little training no feedback  on your performance  and  they will cut your hours without any notice.   There is no loyalty
bad,Management is one sided. They will not participate in anything unless it benefits them. Double standards everywhere. Management spends more time in the office than they do their job. Department training is extremely minimal.
bad,"the environment is competitive for no reason. regardless of your status or age people will do anything to make themselves appear better than u. short breaks, standing all day greeting customers SO boring. early store meetings for no reason other than to praise yet another manager in the inner circle. lots of lying on the managers end, strict policy on resell yet the managers did it under anyone’s nose. this place is a joke. no room for growth nor is it worth sacrificing your day to slave away for them to take nearly 40% of your paycheck for clothes you’re forced to get. they tell you they only tax out the uniform in which they make you get every 6 weeks for the new season but they took more than what is taxed. some employees don’t even WANT the uniform if it means taking so much of what we worked for when we just want to make money. this place was the worst place to work for ever."
bad,they do not treat their workers right tell them at last minuute they have to work weekends they are not orginized u bring a idea to them and they do not look into it
bad,People who worked there for a minute or are through family getting special treatment. The managers and supervisors will specifically pick on someone for the rest of the day because they don’t like you.
bad,"Management was very poor, ""open door policy"" but the door was never open. They want you to push sales with no commission. Good if you're in school and in need of a part time position with 1-2 shifts a week. I love the brand and everything they stand for and working there was fun but management made it extremely hard."
bad,The managers are not your friends even if that’s how they want it to seem like it they are shisty and don’t care about you or your personal life.. then they lied about me being suspended.. a paid suspension and and waited 3 days to call and say I was terminated for attendance it’s funny because this was right around the time they hired new people... don’t work here don’t get me wrong good place for coworkers but management will make you hate it every single day...
bad,I hated working there they were rude it was hot there were to many people in a small area the work was always late the line was always backed up or broken they sent you home early all the time so the can train new people it was the worst place I ever worked at
bad,"il y avait peu de client, même en période de soldes"
bad,"You work alot of hours with fewer breaks in between."
bad,Seems as if they change things to make employees work harder. If you have to work overtime yu may not get a third break. The pay is good but not worth the stress the work puts on your body.
bad,"Would not recommend due to DM and mgmt."
bad,I was horrified at how Nike created an abusive environment that improperly used desperate youth and took no time to develop their work/life skill set.
bad,"Part time work good for college students looking for consistency, and decent discount, while in school in the triad area. The Job is a good way to develop personal skills"
bad,"it was a bad experience while working with nike. The management staff was not professional at all, some of them would yell at you as well as belittle you."
bad,"As a contract worker at Nike Sports Centers you will experience a lot of discrimination from full-time employees and management. There was a large divide placed between those who have the illusive black badge and the lowly, temp, white badge."
bad,Honestly The Nike Team is disorganized and not productive. Everyday felt like a drag to go to work. Co-workers on the mos part kind of snotty except for a few exceptions and the managerial style was lazy and truly don't give a rats about employee they are their to pick up a pay check and move on with there day. I wouldn't recommend it to any one to be honest the product is good but the company as a whole relies  on a fake Image   and be prepared to deal with drama and lots of it cause Nike Managers are super unprofessional and many are immature don't expect anything more than a discount and   lots of headaches.
bad,"Whose place was a waste of time. Management was horrible. Pay was low, hours are unmanageable. Couldn’t be 5 minutes late, not even once without being written up. Too much work for little reward"
bad,Worst place I have ever worked hands down.forced to work 7 days a week when I was told it would be a 5 day a week job it was hot and there was very little insctruction
bad,"- The jobs need hard work. No need brain."
bad,The managers and supervisors don't care anything about their employees all they care about is getting product out the warehouse. They don't pay their employees enough money to do all the work that they do...
bad,I do not recommended working here! They will work you like dogs and then complain that you wouldn’t stay to help out with closing. I’ve never been so disgusted with how awful the management team treats you.
bad,Worked here for many years but I decided I had enough of the inconsistency of the management staff. Each manager had there own set of rules and only a few rules a known or followed by all managers. The people who do the least amount of work are recognized the most and they’re the ones who get promotions and management positions. The most terrible part is the scheduling. If you are part time under or part time employee expect to work full time and not get the benefits of the full time position. They don’t want to work with college schedules or other job schedules. They want you to make “Nike your number one priority”. This is not a career job this is usually a part time job that high school students and college students like to work at. Until they changed policy to you have to be 18 to work there. So wanting adults to work for this company they’re going to have to be flexible with schedules. Most adults that work in a job setting like this have two jobs in order to pay bills or they’re full time college students. You generally pay for your college so you don’t need to be scheduled 40 hours a week leaving you with no time to study which will lead to you failing and that means you threw thousands down the drain. They’re not considerate and they don’t care about you and you’re growth.
bad,i worked at Nike at Texas city i was one of the best sellers i did everything they asked for they said they were going to give me a promotion but they didn't they give me 2 weeks off when i didn't even ask for them when i asked them why they give me 2 weeks off they said we are slow i try picking up shifts but they didn't let me but when someone asked to pick up a shifts they give it them then they only let me work 1 day week the worst place to work now i don't even buy Nike products because they treated me so wrong this company doesn't care about you whatsoever
bad,unless Alpine gets a new manager who is a decent human being I do not suggest working there . worst job ever. the only reason I stayed as long as I did was for the love of the brand and discount.
bad,"The managers at this Nike store allowed mediocrity. I was approached by several of my coworker's and was asked to stop doing my job well because it made them look bad. I brought this information to the managers, and they did nothing in response. Furthermore, they actually promoted some of the people who discouraged me from working hard on their own behalf."
bad,they tell you you can advance in and the company and that they will give you a discount after your first 30 days. If you have an issue or problem they tell you they will fix the problem but dont. The managers and leads go to meeting to talk about the co-workers problems. They are only helping their family and friends advance in the company.
bad,Nike obscures the truth about welcoming diversity. There is no work-life balance and a ton of abuse of power! Low wages and long work hours for the hourly athlete while the managers stand around doing nothing and abusing everyone. Stay away!
bad,I was just a temp but there never enough hours. Either we worked OT at the last minute or we went home extremely early. Some of the managers were rude and insensitive.
bad,"Don’t work at the palm beach outlets store WORSE PLACE EVER, management is awful and based highly on favoritism. Otherwise you get picked on and bagged at"
bad,Management is horrible! This company is the opposite of what they present. They don't appreciate who is there and they only make accommodations when they want for who they want.
bad,"I really didn't enjoy this job at all. I am not interested in retail jobs. This was a part time job, to make a little extra cash and overall wasn't really work it."
bad,"They made us work 7 days a week and then the staffing agency stiffed us on overtime. The work load was absolute insane. Altho it was never very clear how behind we were exactly, our if that was just a tactic used to force the 7 hour days"
bad,"They work you for 12 hours and only give you a 45 minute lunch break and two 15 minute breaks, and that's if you lucky.  They expect you to remain standing the rest of the shift with no bar stools or anything to sit.  Most of the job positions can be done productively while sitting but they insist that will lower production.  Nike needs to pay employees more if they expect someone to be complacent with standing on hard concrete for +8 hours in a day with minimal rest."
bad,"Not very positive, no real incentive, managers are sarcastic and apathetic. Customers are demanding and rude. The store gets overwhelmingly busy and you end up working until late at night. Have to have 30hrs of availability but you only get scheduled once a week.  The scheduling system is terrible."
bad,"Terrible to work for a store. The company is great, but the Factory Stores are terribly managed. The managers are sexist, racist, rude, and disrespectful. They do not recognize hardworking employees. And give handouts to undeserving employees frequently. Do not apply to work at any Factory Store. Wages are not ""competitive"" either. They're random."
bad,Nike culture is attitude is everything! Maybe the world is craving more Nike.  Maybe the company will find its way or design it. They are great at being great.
bad,"Your performance does not affect your growth. However, your image will. If you fit the look of the Ideal management material (meaning race) you will grow. I've witnessed the most lack in teamwork, positive attitudes, etc. individuals almost automatically grow with this company. Honestly, when you think about how this company actually produces its products, all of its truths are just the real reality of the culture of this brand. Its Modern day slavery, BBB & EOC should severely put an end Corps like this."
bad,Bad management and team work. really bad work place culture. didnt enjoy it. most enjoyable part is getting paid. typical day at work would be managers getting annoyed and barely anyone doing there job.
bad,It was my first wearhouse job so my 3 years working I learned multiple positions so they would better me in life. The hardest part of the job is dealing with employers and managers every job was a piece of cake but the way our manager and production was set up it led to failure.
bad,Would not work there again. They don't pay enough for all the noise in that place the manager's  have no clue what is going one and there is never a lead around.
bad,They do NOT care about you only your time. They expect so much out of you but don't have enough supervisors to chat to so you have to deal with angry customers over the phone wanting to ONLY speak to a supervisor. Needs to be more organized better.
bad,Management allowed the business owner to run the project which lead to a lot of turnovers with resources.  If you work at Nike you need to make sure you are in a group with a good manager that supports their team.
bad,Nike is a place either you love it or have it. I did not really like working here. It was not my cup of tea. I was a contract employee and they did not treat contract employees all that well.
bad,I worked for Nike for a couple months I was fired because of my attendance issues but while I was an employee I wasn’t treated as one I was treated as if I were still in high school the management needs a lot of improvement
bad,"No structure, constantly running around with no purpose, management does not know how to lead, used to be a great place to work once Adidas started gaining ground Nike started spiraling down and did not know how to handle the pressure."
bad,Would not recommend this place ! Bad management no communication between managers and employees . Lied about what shift I could work. Everyone is nice  until you get hired but it's all a front
bad,Not enough time space or energy to be dealing with drama people just want something better and consowithout all the problems I deserve better and I want better.
bad,"Great perks, inconsistent hours / shift patterns. Lazy management only care about hitting targets. Little to no job progression. Pretty much the same as most other sports retail jobs out there. Dont let the NIKE name fool you in to thinking this is any better or different to working at JD or Footlocker etc."
bad,"The workplace culture and the leadership team was poor. Full-time, regular employees were leaving the company in droves. Typical days were challenging."
bad,Don't work here. Period. Hours were awful along with the pay. Too high stress and not enough enjoyment out of the job. The discounts are ok but annoying because you basically end up spending your paycheck on stuff they advertise to you during your shift.
bad,"I wa extreamly screwed over by the Nike company, I was forced to be relocated due to poor management not doing their job, I was promised promotions I was unable to revive due to management. All around poor company policy"
bad,"poor management, no motivation to push people work harder, managers did nothing and reaped all the benefits. The coworkers were the only reason i continued to show up because they all agreed with me."
bad,Promises were made in the beginning and we're all broken towards the end.  All managers were not prepared too many ideas too much confusion with management and leadership seemed like a bad experimental reality show. Managers lied to me anout my future and it seemed they didn't know how to handle any problems and issues. . Nike Redlands not a good work place.  That's just my personal experience.
bad,It was an amazing place to work as I love the brand but they're very demanding in terms of the hours they want you to work. Went against my schedule and I couldn't get my stuff done the way I would've liked to.
bad,"Miserable , stressful and you will not move up at this job . They talk to you with no respect and like you are a child . I am a women and I was throwing 60 pound boxes . Bruising  my arms and pinching nerves . I was treated as though I was a man . You will not be able to be moved to production if you didn't start in production . Shelby side is big but they have rules that have nothing to do with your work . I was always in the office because I didn't want to speak to someone who lied about the different opportunities at Nike ."
bad,"This company is very superficial. They do not care about loyalty. One can put in so much time and effort to help the company and make sure they grow but, will not get recognition for it."
bad,"Don't waste your time. In my couple years working for company. ""(3)"". Their were nothing but lies and broken promises about promotions. No matter how hard your work ethic is. For a company who's number 1 in everything, they give their employees  so little. While the employees slave over the sell floor, the ""MANGERS"" walk around in all black with their underwear up in rear inn. While the others are behind a key board sending emails. The only good thing came for the job was the %30 discount."
bad,"Nike was a hot and sometimes hostile work environment.. In the summer it was so hot in the warehouse and the fans we had just blew hot air. On top of that yo get overworked and under paid, Employees have nasty attitudes when you asked a question pertaining to work."
bad,Nike is the worst job I ever worked. The manners are unreliable on situation around the work place. Team members don't know proper guide lines. overall this place  is a -0
bad,"the managers will tell you to pick school over work."
bad,"No job security the more you move up, basically have to do whatever your told to do at a moments notice! No consistency with everyday operations. The treatment of dales associates is horrible."
bad,"*Incompetent and ignorant management."
bad,"Salario baixo, não fornece uniformes (o funcionario que deve comprar), não tem beneficios, alem da assistencia medica que desconta em salario"
bad,"Sin duda la empresa es buena, pero a la  gente que ponen como gerente no, para variar el favoritismo a su máxima expresión, no hay oportunidad de crecimiento,  en la entrevista te pintan un gran panorama que no existe, el ambiente es muy malo y lo peor es que los mismos gerentes lo provocan, se meten en la vida privada de los empleados, no te capacitan como debe de ser, no es nada ético el estar apostando con tus empleados para comprobar que estas en lo correcto, sin duda un muy mal sabor de boca este lugar."
bad,"If you like fast pace non-stop loading and unloading, this is the place to look into. Remarkable place to grow and move on. This is start up job, depending on where department you work."
bad,I worked for this company for over a year. When I first started to work there I thought it was ok until I seen things from a management side of things. All types of deadlines were do and everything was unorganized an no one took their jobs seriously. Terrible!
bad,"The biggest con would be the upper level management. "
bad,"un dia típico llegar hacer apertura, mantener la tienda en orden limpiar y atender adecuadamente al cliente, aprendí todo lo que es tecnología de cada producto que llegaba a la tienda, pero no por nike si no que lo aprendido fue por cuenta propia, también aprendí hacer caja, apertura, cuadratura, despacho y cierre. Lo que era gerencia siempre hubo problemas con los pagos, aparte de eso el salario era bastante bajo para todo lo que se vendía diario y no tenían la capacidad orden de cada trabajador, lo mas complicado lidiar con las injusticias, discriminaciones, seguimientos. Y para terminar lo mas agradable de haber trabajado en nike es el compañerismo que se forman con algunas personas."
bad,"Wages in this company should be no less than $18.00 dollars per hour for the brains of the company and that is the Packers, then Shipping and Receiving and then Management shouldn't get all of the perks but it should be given across the board"
bad,In  this i don't feel like i am a employee in nike showroon . The owner of nike was very friendy with me . I was new to in this field but he help me in every situation.
bad,i turni erano tanti e lunghi con un contratto da apprendista a tempo determinato.lo stipendio era basso e gli straordinari richiesti n on venivano pagati.le condizioni di lavoro erano molto stressanti.
bad,Packer and processor in processing dept. Picker in the picking dept when you get called to go pick. it goes by senority.
bad,"When I get to work my Supervisor doesn't like to let us know how much work we have. I've learned a lot about logistics and the process of shipping out of a warehouse environment. The hardest part of the job is getting hired permanently, I know people that have worked there five years and still working as a temp. The most enjoyable part of the job are my co-workers."
bad,"A typical day at the North Branch Nike location includes: being called a skid mark, groupie, and dumb my management.  Also, management asks nonwhite coworkers how long they have been able to speak English.  The store is like a high school hallway.  There is chatting everywhere, including management (although they like to think they don't).  Management is extremely rude and admit to creeping the workers on Facebook.  There is harassment and hazing and I do not recommend this job to anyone."
bad,"NIke Factory Store is an awesome, friendly place to work. Everyday is a great day!"
bad,"As a professional there is an expectation for a global company to display poise and tact. The Nike Northridge Memphis TN facility is not in that category. The pay is not what the market dictates and senior management, including corporate headquarters, looks the other way and does not address any issues. The jobs are dead end. Do not consider this a viable option when seeking employment. Your performance is overlooked. This company has a revolving door for employment that is spinning nonstop. If you are serious about a career, this is definitely not the place for you!"
bad,I assisted customers with any questions and/or concerns they had.
bad,"Hay cero crecimiento, así que si estas en algún puesto creeme que te quedaras ahí ya que eso no existe, no toman en cuenta a las tiendas foráneas ya que todos los directores están en cdmx y desde allá no saben lo que realmente pasa, las tiendas de acá son olvidadas completamente y si pasa algo es totalmente culpa tuya ya que ellos nunca asumirán que no te dan a la mano lo que tu  solicitas, en fin al final no te dan ni las gracias, solo te echan y siempre buscarán reprimirte si quieres alzar la voz, eso si, si eres amigo del supervisor considera un puesto gerencial."
bad,"Poor management and training. Given a mentor for a couple days and then thrown into the fire. If you have any questions expect looks from other employees that show they don't care to help one another. 12 hour shift with no talking, everyone walks around with a sour face and look miserable in the manufacturing side of things"
bad,"Management Has very little respect for their employees and the work environment they promote is very toxic, they treat everyone as if they are less than"
bad,"Semplicemente, il marchio da solo non esiste. E prima o poi instagram finirà. Si parla di evoluzione, ma si procede in maniera contraria. Il regime lavorativo è fuori dagli standard qualitativi al 100% e si gioca troppo sul fatto che il consumatore medio è indotto all'acquisto solo attraverso le Brand campaign. La qualità del servizio non è richiesta nemmeno ai minimi termini."
bad,"12-13 hours shifts, less staff, sometimes not paying for the forced overtime. Even going for toilet breaks is big issue."
bad,"The only thing good working for Nike is the free clothes they give at the beginning (you still have to pay for them out of your check). Upon getting interviewed to be hired I was promised up to 40 hours a a week and avg 15 hrs a week there. "
bad,"The Nike culture values identity to the brand far more than what you're able to produce at the company.  They focus on process and activity, not results.  Many people are very happy there but it felt more like high school, not a job."
bad,"Es wird nicht auf die Wünsche der Mitarbeiter eingegangen..."
bad,"They provide no benefits. Keep you part time but give you just below full time hours. I was a top sales preformer 6 months in a row and recieved nothing but a pat on the back. Culture was nice at first until i witnessed first hand how managment disregards the life part of your work life balance, and would schedule me for shifts that were not in my availability. Also i was homeless in the early part of my time spent working here and spoke to my manager in confidentiality about possibly recieving more hours and my manager basically told all of the management that worked there including managers in other departments in which it did not consern.  Also Nike Likes to promote there athletes into roles that include more resposibilty more stress but no increase in compenstaion."
bad,"Very cliquey store. Favoritism in the work place, sexism in in management. They hire +40 temporary employees, then fire them all after the holidays. They dont bother learning your name, or giving you the tools and training to even be able to show skill or interest in staying"
bad,"You do what you're told. You have no room to offer your thoughts or opinions. If you do, they are curbed by management. They were underhanded with me regarding stocks, insensitive to immediate family member with cancer, did not approve remote work request but did for the inner circle employees who wanted to go to college out of state. I will never work there again, even if they paid me a million a year. I'd rather be broke and happy than wealthy and miserable."
bad,Management and workplace culture are awful. Staff are overworked and underpaid. I would never recommend the job to anyone. Management gossip with normal sales staff about colleagues as young as 16 while the managers themselves are in their mid 30's and 40's
bad,"Es increíble cómo una empresa tan grande y reconocida a nivel mundial pague tan mal, metas elevadisimas, tensión en el ambiente, un horrible jefe de tienda, altanero, mirador en menos y déspota"
bad,"Ständig werden neue Mitarbeiter eingestellt merkt man die können nichts fliegen die raus. "
bad,awful place to work. management is unfair and racist. store manager and assistant store manager are awful and disrespectful. treat employee like animals.
bad,I had fun for a while I helped open the store from the beginning.. the staff was all young from the managers to the rest of the crew.. fun job just didn't cover the bills.
bad,manger would yell in front of customers and just disrespectful. didn't get paid a lot for the working there was horrible. Felt like a slave in a factory just like the Kanye west song that nike treats there employees just like slaves
bad,"The management team was awful, they play favorites with employees. Pay close to minimum wage but expect you to complete management responsibilities. Awful scheduling. Managers gossip about their employees."
bad,The management is very poor. I honestly hate it. It was the worse thing I ever encountered. They pick on you until you which over to full-time and/or quit.
bad,"Grace period you are full time, getting a minimum of 32 hours, once your hired, you become part time and only able to get 20-25 hours. But only got 4-16 every 2 weeks. The store goes through managers like crazy. Only worked there a little over a year and had 14 managers. Communication with the managers, and staff are horrible due to the constant changes.  They only gave me a 2 CENT RAISE after a year. I only stayed for the nike pass. The only people that ive seen promoted were people who had family members who worked at headquarters. I worked with very hard working sales associates whom many worked in the same position  for 7-10 years!!!Unless you want to be a Ekin (nike spelled backwards & a cult where you get a nike tattoo and live, breathe and eat nike) then I wouldn't recommend this job. Dont try to work in a store just to work at headquarters. Unless have a family member working there that can pull strings, it wont work out. Your better off starting as a janitor at headquarters (which is paid more than retail at a store)."
bad,I had a really bad experience at this workplace. The Temp agency is really unorganized. Full-Timers are rude and treat you with disrespect. I wouldn't recommend it as a place to work unless you are getting hired on full time and even then. You would get disrespected.
bad,"Good job for a young kid. Not good, if you want to move ahead. Manager turnover rate is unreal. Pay is not great, either are raises."
bad,good benefits - great compensation --- regional management needs serious improvement!!
bad,will tell you they will take discount away which means yo save more of your paycheck. Honestly dont care about employees just their sales and the money they make you can be replaced in days
bad,People there are amazing but 60% of management is a nightmare to be around they don’t give af about you as a human if they come to talk to you it’s about conversion every time absolute nightmare toxic work environment made by management would not recommend seriously it’s a nightmare
bad,"Been employed at the Nike retail store in Lancaster for years now and it went from an enjoyable, fun, positive work environment to low morale, hypocritical, back stabbing work place. Management act nice to your face, pretend to listen and care but they will take your ideas and use them as their own to try and advance. They do not give credit where credit is due. Management only care about themselves and their progression and no one else’s. They will throw you under the bus to get advancement. Instead of worrying about the important aspects of the store they watch camera and will write you up for the dumbest things. If you’re not kissing up to them and snitching out your fellow co- workers they don’t care. It’s a shame how things have changed"
bad,If you love the swoosh this place may be a fit for you. If you're a professional looking for a career stay clear! Terrible management with no concerns for employee engagement!
bad,Horrible  environment to work in managers suck and so do benefits....no hrs and pay is terrible along with everything else.only way to move up is kissing up to the managers!!
bad,"If you don't mind working in a rat farm, you will sure enjoy working at Brimley Nike in Scarborough. It's by far the worst place I have ever worked, even all the free clothes and shoes don't make up for the hellish conditions. Yes, every 3 months they have a bin pick and let the employees pick free Nike apparel, and shoes.  The managers and supervisors are directly responsible for the horrid conditions some employee's have to put up with. If they simply just don't like your face, they will assign you the worst tasks until you quit, or they will just make your picking numbers look low by giving you the worst tasks, and they will simply say you are not working to the standards of Nike, and have you terminated. I am not writing this because I am a disgruntled ex-employee, I just want to let people know what they will be in for if they decide to work here. I fulfilled my contract with Nike, and completed my entire hours as stated on contract. I was not fired from Nike, so don't think I am writing this out of revenge, I was called back after they laid me off on completion of contract. This is done so that Nike does not have to hire to many full timers, and when the work gets slow they send home all the agency workers. This happens very often so if you think they will give you full time hours, it's not going to happen, maybe only on busy season, and it does not last long. One week they will ask you to work over time, the next week they will be sending you home early. My rating is a big fail for Nike, take it or leave it lol!"
bad,"JOB WORK/LIFE BALANCE - 2 STAR"
bad,"There's  no room for growth.  The management  is horrible.  They dont know the job wise. They have picks. An that start from the top of Management  on DOWN. You work like a slave ,an still the employee's  not greatly appreciated. We feel like  Corporate  needs to come out  and here from the Nike Employee's  Voice. I'm  not trying to down this Company but it is what it is. And one more thing  THE PAY AND BONUS IS HORRIBLE!!!!!"
bad,Management is poor they are not fair and they treat Everyone differently because friendships between managers and employees si if your not in there group of friends your traded poor
bad,I am a former 5-year employee of Nike and the company has not benefit anything to my worth. Nike store 160  in Chicago recently in June 2018 planned to lay off 55 workers in order to maintain budget and they eliminated majority of the five plus year veterans.
bad,"Some, not all, of those in management are clueless and some only care about their personal goals and push towards their own career ambitions and will use you to advance themselves. The culture is toxic and extremely far left. If you're a contractor, you're a second class citizen."
bad,This is a poorly ran company that provides almost no carrier opportunities. Numerous employees with great qualities were offered no advancement and they left the company.
bad,"Poor management is what effected the atmosphere, which was a shame, they were not fair with holiday requests, never seeming to be allowed the time owing to you even when had request the times which were avalbile on the Rota. Very good at giving you a new role and responsibility, but not the pay rise. Smiling and laughing with customers was seen as chatting to your friends."
bad,"Worked in the Memphis distribution network. At one point, worked three consecutive months without a day off. Infrastructure has not caught up to processing demand, so senior leadership strictly enforces overtime. Horrible culture."
bad,"Having worked at Nike for almost two years I feel I have wasted those years listening to managers who are a bunch of job worths, while on the topic of managers it was rare to see the headcoach work past five despite all other employees often working until 9 some employees were expected to do this more than others. Managers often felt it was beneath them to serve customers and simply brush them off to a regular sales assistant and then complain about how service needed to be improved even though they displayed the worse service. You are expected to stay on your feet for the whole 8 hours you work while the managers sit in the office. Obviously you are welcome to grab a drink from the staffroom but not without a manager soon coming along to sarcastically ask if you are on your lunch break. All in all I'm glad to be leaving."
bad,"I want to work for this company because they treat better the people more than others jobs people feel good to work in this company, I have a friend that work for this company before"
bad,"Overall I made good friends working  there, but low salary, always changing conditions so that you don't get the bonus, no fun, no motivation from management, fake promises. They don't care about the employees, so there is a big turnover of staff."
bad,"no need the worst"
bad,"I applied at Simos on February 25, 2016. I began working at their Nike location the following day. The hours are ideal. the general labor is very simple. While this isn't my background, i found it to be convenient until recently. The workload overall has declined tremendously. Weekly hours have declined. Management seems to be unorganized, unsure of the future of their employees. Very unstable. Over 100 workers arrived at work to begin our daily shift only to be told to ""go back home"", there was no work available for us. I found that very disheartening. As a company with upper management in-house, i believe that was very unprofessional. We have been sent home more than a few times after only working 3 or 4 hours with no warning."
bad,typical night--drive 90 minutes to arrive at 10:45 work clock at 11:00 one break for 15 min. lunch for 30 min. clock out at ) 07:30---keep conveyors & sorters running to support production goals---learned that Nike management lost their concern for workers with each management change-over---co-workers shared my dismay at worsening work conditions--hardest part of job was watching each new management crew make same mistakes over and over---most enjoyable moments was actually completing overhauls inspite of stringent scheduling constraints
bad,"It seems like all they try to do is avoid being sued. They go out of their way to keep unsatisfactory employees all in the name of not being sued. No support unless you're in the ""in crowd""."
bad,The leaders of this group are only out for themselves!!!!! Ask someone who works there!!!
bad,"Nike in Centralia, Wa is a toxic work environment. They promote those who, do not deserve it but also who bring negativity to the work place. Employees are not acknowledged for their hard work, unless they are a favorite. This job brings such negativity to its employees lives; it’s not Nike, it’s this location with the higher up managers."
bad,"Nike Global Security has the distinction of being the most dysfunctional and toxic department I have ever worked at. The department has a long term deeply embedded obsession over the most unimportant minutiae while real security issues are ignored or not even recognized."
bad,There isn’t any growth in Nike when working Retail. Management isn’t flexible on hours. They make sure you know that you’re replaceable and you won’t be promoted.
bad,"Lange mit viel Spaß gearbeitet, dann Management wechsel und alles komplettes Chaos, keine Rücksicht auf Mitarbeiter, lange Tage wenig Empathie wenn's jemand mal schlecht geht, krank sein geht gar nicht, man wird dann gefragt trotzdem zu arbeiten, angeschrien vom Vorgesetzen, seit 1 Jahr stoppen Angestellte die mehr als 10 Jahre tätig waren, sind alles nur noch junge Leute die zum großen Teil weder niederländischen noch deutsch können, einfach ganz schlechtes Management und Personalabteilung die nicht sehen das Treue langjährige Mitarbeiter alle aufhören"
bad,"un management pas sérieux ,aucune confiance entre eux , beaucoup de coup bas"
bad,"the job was very enjoyable but once management changes everything when down hill and alot of part timers left,  as well while working at nike a fe very inappropriate things were said and even after reporting them to head office nothing was done leading to me quitting the job"
bad,They give terrible pay and terrible hours. Managers are very bad at communicating. You learn everything by teaching yourself. I wouldn't suggest working here
bad,Don't work for them...... there is not a work life balance... sometimes you work every day for 3-6 months before you can get an off day and if you call in they will write you up
bad,"This was a very disappointing job. There is little respect for the daycare workers. Everyone was in a bad mood every day and it was a real uncomfortable place to work as staff members talk about each other and offer little to no support. Management was no help and seemed to lack leadership. "
bad,"The jobs is very easy work to do, but its the people in management that makes the jobs stressful. The job is the stress level depends on the supervisor attitude that he or she brings to work."
bad,"Nike attracts and hires smart, talented people and fails to support them with strong middle management, compensation and appropriate work life balance. On-boarding and training is meager, expectations are not always clear, and much of the employee's success depends on ""fitting in"", which is only possible under the guidance of a dedicated and strong manager who can acclimate new employees to the oddities of the culture, people and systems. Overall, a brutal and fast paced corporate environment where senior management is king and rank and file employees are second class."
bad,I dread going into work everyday for the simple fact that they are very unfair and its a lot of discrimination going on. Managers have their favorites which makes it harder for someone who really tries to achieve getting promoted or even just recognized.
bad,"A hard and very different culture. Management does a poor job in developing their employees. Therefore, moral is low because of the outside employee brought into the company."
bad,"Nike as a company is a good career but do not try to go to work in the Gulfport, MS store as management!!!!!  The store manager always looks for the negative in every case.  It's not the great work that you do that he concentrates on.. He pays attention to how he can push off his failures onto you. He also picks his management staff by race and gender, not qualification.  The only reason there is some diversity is due to force.  It seems good at first but you will realize real quick how bad it can be for you."
bad,"When I worked at Nike, we had half of our staff under the age of 18. That was the most annoying part of the job. Nobody was trained well enough to perform professionally and these kids were immature and incompetent. Customer's are not as high of a priority as they should be. There were issues of over staffing. You get awesome discounts though. And they supply your work uniform that you get new shoes, pants, and shirts, every 6 months."
bad,They fired me without cause and gave me severence they had hired extra staff and created a over load on the payroll then called the firemarshal to say theres to much people under management
bad,"I learnd how to learn how to scan and work on my social skills.It was an okay job but they have too many rules when i only work for 3 days,Nike had its ups and downs but it was a pretty okay job"
bad,HR advisor manager was racist.  She treated certain people differently than others.  Her boss was even worse.  Never experienced racism in the workplace until working here.
bad,The worse experience ever as the Management Team is worst I have ever seen. Nike WHQ doesn't get it as they just count money as Folks do what they want to do and when they want to do it. I excelled in my role as I am a professional beyond my years.
bad,"The managers sucks. They picky on who they don't like and try to get rid of that person for any chance they get. You apply for one job and you end up doing 3 different jobs as an expectations. You would pack, induct and do housekeeping with only $11.50. And ypu got keep up your productions otherwise they will fire you."
bad,Nike pays people 10.45 an hour for 20 an hour work. And the temp agencies are revolving doors. You can get fired for fighting and be back at work in two months.
bad,Great place to work.  Everyone that has a winning attitude.  Work/life balance was pretty good.  Lots of perks and discounts.  The management level was a little top heavy.
bad,"We were over staffed from day one. The management uses favoritism to decide how they will treat you that day. The customers and workers are cool but it can be very slow at times. The shifts aren't evenly distributed and sometimes you'll be closing several times a week. If your in school, I beg you to look for another job because they will treat you differently and make it clear that this job should be your #1 priority. You must clean all the bathrooms and sweep when closing which is unsanitary and not apart of your job description but your still required to do it. Some of the team leaders are bossy and try to belittle you like a child. HR is good at communicating and fixing issues but my advice is try to look for a more fair job opportunity that will work for whatever your demanding schedule may be."
bad,Horrible upper Management. Management promoted their friends instead of promoting on performance. I would not suggest Adecco to anyone until upper management understands the severity of their lower management team
bad,When you first start working at Nike you'd love it but as time goes on everything and everyone gets super negative! If your new to the sales floor everything will get blamed on you if something goes wrong. People will lie on you and management is terrible overall it's an okay place to work it would be better if they fixed the management they were very bipolar and rude and don't know how to schedule
bad,"I used to work for the Nike 173 in elizabeth nj and its not what i expected and what they make it seem to be.. Management play favorites, there pay rate is really horrible for a company that make a quarter million a week, no benefits unless your full time, and always full of drama, probally the worst place i ever worked for. But if u want to do hard labor and get paid nothing for it be my guest. That discount isnt worth the drama."
bad,temporary assignment and it wasn't feesible for career job. Nike is slavwe labor with horrible representation. its just not the place for me.
bad,I loved my job until I was told that Nike didn’t care about my children being sick all they cared about was production. All three of my children were sick and I was told to find help with my kids until I could roll some of the absences off  but I’m a single mother doing it all on my own
bad,"I was hired for a specific project and within one week of working at NIKE my project was de-scoped. I later found out, that 2 of the 4 people that I interviewed with knew I was likely going to be out of a job when they interviewed me! "
bad,"Nike is a fine company however the air bag manufacturing is being ran by kids with no experience. Lots of political bs."
bad,Almost every manager except one would be in the office sitting on their phones & gossiping & laughing like hyenas . The people were really cool to work with. Managers would treat some employees better than others. New hires would barely get training unless trained by a full - timer .
bad,"Contract workers often become scapegoats for errors and are discarded at will. The overall culture is ""make the other guy look bad so you can look good and keep your job"".  Some of the perks are good, but aren't worth the back-biting and stress."
bad,"The managers are push overs!! At the Frayser location anyway, if they don’t like you you don’t have a chance. You have to know someone to get ahead. If you are a temp I feel sorry for you because they have absolutely no respect for the temps. All I can say is good luck with that."
bad,they would take me off the schedule all the time and never let me know and when I showed up sent me home. The management liked to play favorites. Never worked more than 19 hrs a week cause theyre over staffed and theres no room for advancement unless youre full time and its imposslble to get full time unless youre like 40
bad,"The management at the location I was at, sucked and didn't know how to manage. They had their favorites and took other people's opinions to heart. Even though they were bitter and didn't know what hard work was. I was the footwear department and kept people from stealing. I was very much so discriminated against."
bad,This company likes to put people into jobs they are not suited for or qualified to have. They base their decisions on social relationships rather than job skills. There is a higher than proportionate level of young attractive female admins who climb up the ranks remarkably fast into director or senior director roles with no measureable experience. They treat their contractors horribly and have ways of keeping contractors without converting them for years.
bad,"the new management team is horrendous and they were from JD and the old manager left so they hired two new ones that where from jd. furthermore  they have changed the nike culture background of management and how it is in other stores and try to make it like JD when its a different company, so early days was fun to work there with old management team, but they made coming into work not even enjoyable anymore and they also had incidents about making comments about employees in there own group chat ad everyone at work feels like there been taking the mick out of. and it was awkward for so long."
bad,Ultra competitive - very little mentoring - promotion is all on the employee. Communication is minimal - although there are too many meetings nothing of any value seems to be generated.
bad,one day it can be a busy week next week no work no hours. crazy part they will tell u in 6months u can get rolled over a lie.very strict on rules no managment
bad,"Management not strict enough"
bad,"Part-time workers beware. Hours are very random some weeks you can work 30 hours then not be put on the schedule for two weeks. Part-time employees arnt treated as the team and have limited responsibility. Basically working the dressing room, folding clothes, and inventory if you are lucky.  Too many managers and very disorganized. For me I had many problems getting paid, after the second time I had enough and quit."
bad,"Good company to work for, not enough hrs."
bad,Payroll is the most dysfunctional dept EVER!!   It's like NOT working at Nike. 
bad,Working there was great with the discounts and the atmosphere with coworkers were fun and always looking forward to going into work. But management sucked and pay was not so great. I enjoyed my time there but I would not recommend nor would I ever go back to work there.
bad,"People hardly come to work,hr is not of any help.Managers harsh and verbally abusive.You can come to work at anytime,no one cares if you learn or not."
bad,"Management treats employees poorly."
bad,"Leadership is not supported and the HR team lacks courage.  Too many times fake and made up allegations, which were so blatantly made up, were used to hold over a leaders head.  The culture in Nike Memphis is toxic."
bad,This was a very fun job I enjoyed going to work everyday but I never got over 35 hours so I couldn't get any benefits to take care of my family only the managers got 40 hours.
bad,Nike is overall a great company to work for. The salary and benefits are great however the management doesn't help with growth and development
bad,"i don't care for it! it's not a job i would stay at ,you have management sleeping with the workers....they can do anything and everything but you are the good worker..."
bad,"I thought this was one of the worse companies to work for. They let people treat other bad, didn't care about family issues. Just heartless"
bad,STEER CLEAR from working for the ROUND ROCK location.  Management has a constant disregard for common courtesy and LACK respect as well as professional management practices.
bad,il lavoro buono nel complesso ma sono stata vittima di mobbing da parte dello store manager senza alcun motivo
bad,It was a fun job but it wasn’t the best. I felt out of place with coworkers and I felt like I had to fake my personality with management. However it was a nice experience
bad,"Poor mid-level management, cut throat culture, and lack of career growth make Nike a poor place to work. People were frequently promoted to jobs they couldn't do."
bad,Zevkli ve teşvik eden bir çalışma ortamı prim üzerine oluşu işi heyecanlı kılıyor
bad,"When you first star working at Air MI they make it sound like upward mobility is easy and is a given. What they don't tell you is that you can't apply internally until you've been in your current role for a year, and even then it's very very difficult to move from the factory floor to campus, where everybody wants to work."
bad,I would not recommend working for this company. There is no room for advancement. Management is nothing short of tyranny at best. There are no benefits.
bad,"Working at Nike is a very fun work place. The job is easy The food is good and the breaks is timeless "
bad,A typical day was very busy. a lot of customers. It was a very diverse work environment. The hardest part was stopping theft and management. The most enjoyable part was meeting new people
bad,"Management team was a bunch of white men who did not understand different cultures. I complained to managment about the treatment of people of color. Management admitted they had a problems but didn't want to face it head on. Racial jokes,one sided racial conversation making me feel uncomfortable. Lack of diversity caused employee to talk to the one manager of color. I still have friends with the company and its a great place to work just be wise in the location and document everything with HR /personal records. Don't try to handle everything internally with good intentions because it turned against me."
bad,"Great atmosphere, bad upper management. A lot of people were choosing to leave as I joined the team. I worked overtime but was not paid accordingly. I did not stay long."
bad,+when the is a work load and your kno that you must send a report
bad,"Around peak season instead of working the hires we applied for we add to work overtime for three whole months straight. During the work required us to stand on our feet for 10 hours, and they only gave us two fifteen minute breaks. They also hastlily fire anyone who come from their break late."
bad,personnes travaillant la bas trop leche bottes les collegues ne pensent et ne respecte aucune hierarchie et aucune des regles de vie
bad,"typical day at nike is going through security, scanning badge and heading to my area for team meeting. everyone is being checked for dress code, then we get assigned to what were doing that day."
bad,Nike is a very fun place to work at. My co-workers were very nice. Nike helped me improve myself to become a very fast pace worker and dynamic.
bad,The managers don't care about you. Its strictly about work. There is no leadership just a bunch of gossip and mess. They talk to you like you are a child and you cannot do anything about it
bad,Nous avons aucune reconnaissance professionnelle du travail fournit tout les jours . On a beaucoup de problèmes en interne qui sont jamais réglé et surtout on progresse pas car les postes sont fermés.
bad,Did not get paid enough. Management had no clue how to run the place. Worked with some fun people. Some days I worked 4 hour shifts and other days I worked 6 or more hours.
bad,si tratta di una società che non tiene conto della persona e che ha poco rispetto del lavoro altrui.
bad,Management is not approachable and are cut thoart thirst long work n everyone is telling to move faster and faster n sometimes work two machine at a time
bad,Very political. Favoritism. Do not expect consistent application of policies and procedures. HR difficult. Opportunity has more to do with who likes you rather than performance.
bad,this company never saved my medical records and messed up my attendance. never gave the hours I asked for they just put co workers anywhere
bad,"proactively acknowledged,greeted and assisted customers in store also offered customers with exemplary and timely service"
bad,"a job for some kids, the managers abuse there powers and you usually end up doing there job for them. But the benefits are great."
bad,"Hard working enviornment. The people were not easy to get along with, but I worked hard and was very productive. I went to NIKE through a temp agency which paid low hourly wages. It was very hard work."
bad,"During my time at Nike I had more positive experiences than negative. The managers ran the store with an iron fist and managed as if they were above the the rules and traditions of the company. My co-workers were all intimidated by the way the managers treated everyone, eve customers. This is a job for high schoolers, anyone else should beware!"
bad,"My job here was cool at first I started off as a part timer and then worked my way up to be a key holder. I was a key holder as a senior in high school and I thought that was pretty cool. I learned a ton about electronics with more of a hands on aspect rather than training. My management team was not the best, they didn't care about the appearance of their employees or the store. Appearance is one of the biggest things that I look at in a business. there was absolutely no organization and the only reason I kept the jib for 2 years is because it was conveniently located about 5 minutes from my house. The hardest part of my job was leaving work with the store clean and then coming in the next day with it messy, that drove me crazy. The most enjoyable part was getting to go on house calls and helping other people out with their electronic issues."
bad,was only assigned jobs to keep me busy and to benefit other employees.
bad,"goeie werksfeer fijne collega's. "
bad,"Great company in tempe. I loved it, wonderful works. I am happy happy happy with everything, thank you so much for asking for my opinion. The break room is great. I love the vending machine"
bad,It was okay just didn't like the people and it was hot in there they wasn't paying enough and sometime we didn't have any work so we had short weeks small checks
bad,The company Nike itself is set up with good intentions and history. The specific store which i was employed at didn't however liv up to those standards.
bad,"Very University of Oregon centric - must love running.  Cult like, drink the kool-aid, trash talking of competitors. Relentless pursuit for perfection,"
bad,"Nike Isn't a bad paying job for the hours that are being worked but sometimes working that many hours mandatory, will take its toll on you. Especially when the managers aren't treating every one fairly and taking off work isn't easy. But hey this job might be for you! Wasn't for me, I wouldn't recommend to people with younger children."
bad,I thought working at nike would be different but it was the same as any other store that sells things. They force you to push memberships on people who are from out of country and might not even be shopping at nike again. Your work is reviewed not by how hard you work but by how many sign ups you got or online sales. No way to move up at my store people who had been there for more then 3 years were never offered higher postions instead they pulled mangers from other nike stores. Also was told they would not let me transfer after working at the store in south beach i felt a bit more enticed to leave and work for the south beach store and my store manger told me she would not let me switch stores and that id have to quit and reapply for them. when i put my 2 weeks in they treated me worse then before and were doing certain things to make me want to quit
bad,The hours were terrible and inconsistent. The managers were rude and ordered the employees at the warehouse to do all their work as they stood their talking about sports amongst their peers.
bad,Very Boring. No high employee moral. No upper movement. Racist managers. Not enough hours. only hires a certain race. Hated the meetings to early in the morning.
bad,Long hours. Not flexible. Very little advancement. Chaotic. Doesn't pay well unless you're full time. No benefits. Managers belittle people and have favorites.
bad,it was and ok job considering it was a slow paced job id prefer to work at a fast pace.
bad,My day at work consist of being on my feet.  Counting products that are in or need to be shipped.  I've learned to do a lot of math while working in inventory control.  Also my co- workers are very nice people. They are easy to get along with.  Their isn't a hard part while being on the job.  The enjoyable part of the job is of course break and lunch.
bad,clean up unjam the lines all day learn how to use sum machines hardest part climbing real high but wasnt that hard bad caught on fast
bad,"A typical work day basically was me going into work for morning stock then getting asked to stay after to work on the floor and help sell products because someone did not show up. Working there was pretty hectic because not everyone did thier job, it seemed like half the people only worked there for the check and discounts."
bad,"I signed a disclosure on my first day. Pay was lousy as were the benefits. My first real cultural experience with territory being the main concern. A lot of visa's there, that's why the wages suck!"
bad,"Does not care about you or your family. Memphis experiences a trying time in October 2019, a tornado hit the city causing severe damage and long power outages, I had to leave work to get my children from school, one of only two times I’ve left early, the other time I was sick and vomiting on the floor and was sent home. Both these days were counted against me and listed on my separation letter"
bad,"Day 1 - I was told the company was ""passive aggressive"" and to watch out for landmines.  Was also told I would be supporting different execs than I interviewed with. I had to seek this info out."
bad,Management really don't care about anything. The work culture is in the ground and the morale is as well. Very little appreciation for the temporary workers who push all of the orders out. The permanent employees recieve all the perks for temps hard work.
bad,"Image help making a few million dollars and than someone making a few hundreds not hundred thousands hundred they wont be able to feed they family because ""we aren't making enough money as a store"". Sounds crazy but it happens everyday coming from one making $100,000 to someone making $15 dollars a hour."
bad,"Overall good company to work for. Fast-pace work environment, lots of change in management, and needs improvement on training of new hires. Lastly training of managers needs improvement."
bad,It's an easy job the atmosphere can be stressful do to the immature staff that works there. I don't believe the supervisors know how to separate work from home mindset.
bad,"It's a well known brand and must have the caters for everybody ,for sports men to women and kids .even for those who like looking good and having comfortable shoes and apparel.mostly they cater for runners footwear and cloths .basically it's a sport shop ."
bad,"A work day would consist of customers, most unable to speak english working with feet , maintaining a clean environment. Walking around and maintaining store cleanliness."
bad,"Managers pick a favorite and disregard my complaints toward not getting hours, also you have to have a strong patience to work here as you will be waiting up to 20 minutes on your lunch for a checkout"
bad,"scanning reviewing orders making sure they are correct. Management needs improvement , coworkers are friendly , standing is the worst part of job. most enjoyable part of my 12 hour shift is going home, honestly."
bad,I learned how to scan and process items and I learned to work in a timely manner. Had many lazy workers and very short breaks for long working periods.
bad,Assorting samples and spending countless hours using hand trucks and dolly's to move fixtures and mannequins to set up model stores for product presentation managers. There were times were we would set up a store and be called back to move a fixture slightly left 2 inches.
bad,A normal day at work would include detailed oriented tasks. The day may typically be long due to our field of work which is correcting all wrong orders. Poor management is a minor reason the days were as long. The hardest part of the job is getting the job done in the time frame given. The most enjoyable part of the job is to do the best to my ability and to still be be little and fussed at to improve. i learned to keep my ethic strong and provide insight for better production and quality.
bad,It was an ok place to work if you didnt want to be challenged.  Allot of great bennefts called the give away.  If you like Nike Clothing this is the place for you.
bad,"Cette entreprise nous vend du rêve "
bad,"As I am currently writing this I am a Nike employee. My review will be more of a list of pros and cons"
bad,"there's no communication , poor salary ,no commission only 30% on everything, if you work in canada you have no promotions online and no employee website, we have no growing opportunity and there's a lot of favoritism and poor management & they ask for availabilities but they dont give shifts / like long shifts. They also obligates you to wear an uniform , which is always late to be  given they say every 3 months you get( shirts) stafff dress and every 6 months you get a complete staff dress plus one pair of shoe and they always skip pants or shoes they're so cheap  and hire kids there's a big problem in the management they hire incompetent staff and managers  PLUS they pay you minimum wage, and they always push you to make sales  , there's no bonus"
bad,"Working at Nike is an average experience. Management is subpar does not put maximum effort in ensuring the employees requests (security, more events, and overall growth within the company) Too much emphasis on Nike Plus memberships and not enough on the actual employees focusing on giving them the proper tools to succeed"
bad,"The Pay for officers is inconsistent. It can range from  ($16-$18/hr plus). They don’t like you discussing your salary amongst each other due to this inconsistency in pay. "
bad,"Working 12 hour shifts 3-4 days a week, on your feet for most of them. 3 paid 15 minute breaks and unpaid 30 minute lunch breaks. Employees are horrible. Working on the floor is very competitive just making sure enough people like you. And if they don’t itll make your work experience awful. Poor management and poor working conditions."
bad,Unable to use your role to its full maximum always having to 2nd guess store does not run smoothly at all and there is no backing for us small people that make Nike what it is
bad,if you work hard you will not be rewarded as greatly as you would kiss you brown nos. they don't care about the employee as a person. they want everything from you but give you very little
bad,"don't work at nike in the Woodbury commons. Management was awful, and there is no room for advancement. people there play favorites and it isn't worth the money."
bad,"there is a bg hype over this job "
bad,"This company is only good for those getting out or still in high school. This is not a career for adults, it's only a job to work and retail is retail. They don't care about their employees like they say they do. Nike makes it seem like they are EEO. This place is a joke! They give you complimentary uniforms from head to toe (they say you are only paying for the taxes, but they rob you for more than that). They have meetings quarterly and pay you 2 hours for coming. In the process, they want you to get out of your bed at the crack of dawn, to go and sit for a meeting, where you don't even talk about your concerns of the workplace, but want you to watch their boring videos and play games. PLEASE DON'T WASTE ANY TIME IN APPLYING."
bad,It was just not a good environment for someone who is consistently seeking self-improvement and who is goal driven. The management was just very poorly organized.
bad,grato ambiente pero muy explotado y bajo salario y el horario muy agotador
bad,"I could ask one question and get 10 different answers. It was very unorganized and frustrating. They micromanaged and cared about the wrong things such as if your phone is in your pocket or if your using an iPad to ""track"" your productivity. Everything was real buddy buddy and a lot of decisions that were made were fro a personal standpoint and affected how the team was ran. Extremely passive aggressive and condescending, they want you to care and be passionate for a brand that doesn't feel nor treat their employees the same way. And to be quite honest, the only way you could work there successfully is if you have another job or you get hired as a lead or a full timer. Anything under full time gets the short end of the stick with everything from hours to holiday pay which you only get if your part time over and you don;t even get benefits."
bad,"The management and head coach's do not care about the athletes. All they care about is beating numbers from last year so they receive their bonuses, While we receive...a donut party and a leadership group ""thank you"".  This place is pathetic as far as taking care of their employees, respecting their employees, and valuing their employees. They mass hire 18 year old  kids with absolutely no vetting process and expect to have a positive turnaround. This place is becoming a joke, STAY AWAY!"
bad,"My experience working for Nike started out great but slowly turned to a nightmare. The managers at my store had huge egos because we were the top ranked store in the region and would not let me change my availability from some ridiculous shifts. I had no ability to balance my personal life with work due to the awful managers not caring about anything but me working. When I asked them if it were possible for me to change my availability, I was told by one of the managers that ""I shouldn't have signed up for [outside activities] if I knew it would mean I would have to work less"" Due to the thick-headed, selfish and rude managers, This resulted in me having to leave the company."
bad,Some days we were busy others we were slow. Management would tell you one thing and do the opposite. the management was lazy and discriminated against the employees all the time. They never followed up on their word.
bad,This is a good place to work but you will do a lot of walking and encounter a lot of crazy co workers. You have a long break and 2 fifteen minute breaks.
bad,"My 2+ years working at Nike Henderson was very up and down. As you start they tell you its very easy to move up in the company but if you aren't a favorite in the management, you'll be an after thought. The most enjoyable part is working with the other employees. We all come together and it feels like an family environment. Other than that it was very unenjoyable time there."
bad,"You never know what is going on because they expect you to work the ""informal"" network.  Additionally they do no onboarding to speak of so you will be lost.  Most people aren't happy to work there unless they are hourly."
bad,"Daily duties were providing quality consumer service and maintaining merchandise production and organization. I learned how to merchandise up to the needs that business wanted to focus on, also provide training to any incoming new hires. The management staff although are great people they were unstable, I've had 6 different head store managers in my 7 years of employment. So its hard to try and progress as a store when every year someone has a different vision. The co-workers were excellent at times it was the only reason i would come to work, we knew the store was in bad shape but we came to support each other. The hardest part of the job is the shifting of managers and having to show a new person who you are and what you can do every fiscal year that is mentally and physically exhausting. The most enjoyable part of the job is the friendship and bond the co-workers have towards each other."
bad,Job has poor quality structure. BRD Area. Would not recommend this employer to no one.
bad,"i worked with a great group of people, but did not enjoy managements and their direction."
bad,"This review is for the Employee Store NOT the campus. Very political, horrible wage compensation, horrible hours once you pass temp. status, will not work with you and your other job, immature co-workers (which include managers). This was a very tedious and boring job at times...I always said that a monkey could do this job. "
bad,A typical day is talking to customers via phone about the product and to either exchange or return the product of chose.
bad,You are stuck in your position until someone leaves or gets fired. Seems like to move up in the company you have to kiss up to management to even have a chance.
bad,"Truly awful management. It was my first job and I got bullied by one of the ""head coaches"" which is what they call their management. I was routinely punished for things that were not an issue. Such as wearing black socks instead of white. Multiple people having affairs with co-workers which management knew about but did nothing too. Avoid the hassle and just go work for Adidas"
bad,"Interesting place to work. Solving problems in automation, designing and installing equipment, working with "
bad,"Constant re-orgs.  As soon as you get to know your boss, you get a new boss and get to start over again.  Lots and lots of people.  Lots of meetings.  Very little actual forward movement.  Leaders do not provide direction.  There is no coaching.  There is no inspiration.  There is no limit to the number of high paid VPs and Senior Directors and middle management and they always hire from the outside.  Little or no investment in the (so called) top talent that they already have.  As a result of my time here, I have only learned that I'm a fool for ever thinking that any of the above could be different."
bad,"Nike is a dynamic company that is often times successful in spite of itself. Its odd matrix style management system is outdated and not the most effective at keeping its reporting structure and leadership responsibilities clear and on task. It is a wonderful place to work for self-disciplined professionals that require little supervision. There is no consistent path for growth and development, it is simply the luck of the draw in who you report to and whether or not they are interested in playing a positive role in your development."
bad,"There was not a lot of unity around the time I started, but maybe things have changed. It was an excellent work experience so therefore I am grateful."
bad,"Bullied on the job by managers, you have to have a minimum of 30 hrs a week even if you’re “part time”, the scheduling does not revolve around your own time but rather what the managers say. If you request off it is unlikely you will be giving your request."
bad,"No hours, terrible management, no development. Good discount. Tries to trick you into thinking nike is a great company, when in actuality it is awful. They could care less."
bad,"Bad culture. Bad management. Passive aggressive environment. Everyone is just serving one person.  They burn through there money and produce nothing - they should really think deeper about how to run the tech side... "
bad,"Tout beau tout rose au début mais malheureusement boîte américaine qui se préoccupe en aucun cas de ses employés..nous sommes des pions ! Un responsable qui ne connais pas le code du travail, aucune responsabilité.. la mise en rayon et conseil clientèle uniquement.."
bad,"For a company such as Nike that brings in so much money, they do not pay their employees enough to live without having a second job. It was very hard attempting to make end meet while working for Nike even with a 2nd job. If you get injured on the job, you can kiss that job good bye! Nike looks at it's employees as replaceable!"
bad,"Over the years, the management team got worse and it made me not want to go in. For a retail job, the policies and protocols were strict on the employees. High expectations from everyone. Learned how to be patient to those who may be giving me a hard time."
bad,"völlige Abhängigkeit von USA "
bad,"Empresa com uma gestão ultrapassada, líderes com deficiência,  sistemas operacionais e gerenciais pouco confiáveis...Uma história rica e inspiradora,  contudo pouco utilizada pelos gerentes de loja e distritais...Nao tem abordagem humana em suas lideranças.. .Esses líderes protegem-se entre si, desrespeitando máximas e verdades da Empresa, com decisões arbitrárias e obtusas...O tempo apresentará o resultado para Nike Brasil, pois já vem sendo ultrapassada por seus concorrentes,  entretanto preferem o corporativismo gestacional, disseminando uma cultura de protecionismo a aqueles com concordam com o trabalho proposto..."
bad,White males dominate any position above the sales associate. The chances of you moving up are slim. You get to be a part of the NIKE brand which is cool.
bad,"At Nike if you are under contract then you are what they call a black badge. They highly discriminate from white (employees) and black (contractors) badge employees. The level of training for new contractors is very poor and not well set up for success. When ever asked of my experience I just say ""the wrapper was nice""."
bad,"The pay was not high enough for the work that was expected. We were treated as if we were making $15 an hour for less than $10. With a position making just over minimum wage hours should be easily negotiated, but a simple change in schedule could cause you your job. Seen as a number rather than a person."
bad,"Besides passion for the brand, the structure and management style of the company limits the ability to have a clear career ladder, or expanding into different job roles."
bad,The Gustoppo !!!!!   dont develop friends because they will think your  doing something inappropriate if you have a repor with someone that they dont want you to have it with !!!
bad,They talk about building relationships and how they are a family and care about you when truly it's all lies.  Started off a pretty decent company but quickly turned for the worse.
bad,"over worked. long days and nights, including long overnight shifts. call-in shifts are the worst. failure to call equals to a no call/no show. little pay for the work they want you to do."
bad,The only good thing about Nike is the money...you can make as much or as little money as you want..they are never out of work but they are so unprofessional and unorganized its ridiculous
bad,"Was not at all what was described during the application process."
bad,This co. is a ok co to work for if you can stand gossip and constant reviews. I wasnt satisfied with mgmt or pay. This is overral an ok co.
bad,"Very long hours and management had their favorites."
bad,"I have worked for Nike for a year and a month. As part-time under. And could you believe that when I started with them I clearly asked them I was interested in job advancement . And it was said that there is a lot of growth with- in the company. Lies ,because they only advance those who they want. I'm a 30 something year old ,single mom who works her butt off. I ask for more hours they say why are u complaining about your hours. I only get 12 or 15 hours a week . Who can survive on a 8.80 per hr with those hours now a days. But then they hired 10 to 15 people at time and give them a lot of hours. Every month they are hiring. It's ridiculous. No advancement,cause they don't want to give benefits. They feel having part -timers is better, giving them 4 hr shifts. Seriously , there's only a handful of full timers in a 150 employee in the store.They fire people for no reason( who have been with the company for a longtime for stupid reasons.) To hire more and pay less money. Everytime I apply to transfer to another location or part time-over or another dept its rejected. That's is not okay. Over worked under paid. And not a good work environment if u looking for advancement. Sadly Nike co.doesn't know about this abuse that management has among there stores. It's not Nike its management who is bad in this store.. Oh did I say that many of the Rockies that came after I did got better paid and got more hours than that ones who been there for a year ,doesn't sound right."
bad,the hype of working for Nike was cool. they provided decent benefits. other than that its a constant battle to advance and management isn't very supportive or helpful to the individual. more care for the company's standing than the people who make the product that keeps the company alive and I feel that is wrong.
bad,"A typical day working at Nike would involve the restocking of shelves, servicing consumers and retrieving products, and processing shipments of new apparel/footwear. "
bad,This job could be so much but Nike is so large and bloated and they have become almost too big.  They hire a ton of contracted job with decent pay but once you factor how much you have to pay for benefits you probably are losing money.  Management is invisible so I am not sure if they even know what work we do.  If you get a full time position (not contracted) the benefits sound amazing.
bad,"Don't expect proper standards and procedures or life cycles..."
bad,theres alot of favoritism. they make things hard on the workers. i learn about alot of things though like how to work as a team. the hardest part is 12 hours shift
bad,learned for to use a rf gun the hours was 12 with low pay. the management was rude and unprofessional.the hardest part of the job was standing up all day with only two 15 mins break for a 12 hour shift.
bad,I literally tried to kill myself at my store because I was so overwhelmed with the stress the bullying and the incompetence of upper management. My coworkers and the discount was nice upper management made me slit my wrists due to the amount of stress placed upon me. Also theres no moving up. I literally wanted to die. I was placed in a mental asylum for 72 hours.
bad,It is vert hard to grow in this company. Not good for the long run. Management is very inconsistent and rules just seem to differ now and then. Everybody has their own way of doing things and it just messes up the culture.
bad,"Nike is a great company, however working in the warehouse is not fair for anyone under a management status. They don't pay nearly enough & don't give bonuses anymore. The managers could care less about the employees or their well being. I was injured on the job, did everything required to come back to work & after about 8 months of trying to get back I finally gave up when I realized they would not allow me to come back."
bad,"Lots of fun. Great people to always work with, except the managers. Unmotivated is the key word for them. They don’t care about anything except themselves and will throw anyone under the bus for it."
bad,Management was not willing to complete job tasks usually do to laziness.  The advancedments not giving to people for work performance usually given to people with relatives that work there and people whose laziness was in line with the Managers.  Any worker who too pride in there work wasn't rewarded also any issues  brought to the attention of the Managers wasn't acknowledged causing other workers to get credit for any process improvements.  The only workers that were forced to adhere to the companies policies were the hard workers.  All the lazy workers were praised due to management not evaluating there work performances.  Managers would ignore maintenance issues all in order to keep production up which caused lots of safety violations and machines experiencing catastrophic failures.
bad,Nike has been a very good experience. I enjoyed every single day of working for the company. The only issue is the salary. You work more than you get paid.
bad,"It was a sweatshop in america. Terrible pay. We had to us outdated unsafe machinery at times. Managers were always telling you ""we are behind schedule"". There was lots of false promises about advancement, but NO ONE ever got promoted out of the factory unless they quit."
bad,"Initially, the job was cool. Getting to know the ropes of how everything was supposed to be. Then, things just started to trickle down. Not only did I barely see my checks, the hours were terrible with only 2 breaks. They didn't want us talking, yet we hit our numbers and then some EVERYNIGHT! The supervisors don't really care about you or anything outside of Nike."
bad,"They ask many of their part time workers to devout full time hours to them, while paying 9.25 per hour. Also, was lied to by management about transfers and thus directly cut into my pay. Finally, new hires coming in make $1.00+ more per hour than many workers who have been here 1+ years, due to “inflation”."
bad,regular day like any retail job. this is a job not corporate job. the culture was diverse. no hard part at all. i did my job not. it was same as any other job i worked.
bad,"They hype up the job as much as they can during training camp (where you don’t learn anything about the job) just to make you forget that you’re nothing more than an underpaid, overworked employee."
bad,"The only reason worth working for Nike is the employee discount. Before I left I had applied for full time and denied, then later asked to go full time for the same reasons they denied me before. When asked for vacation time for personal reason was given a pink slip."
bad,if you about your money and getting paid right don't work at Nike they only care about the people who working there for years and who kiss as and be r
bad,"Nike was a good place to work, there is no room for advancement."
bad,Poor communication with managers. Underpaid for the time and amount of work I put in. Not recognized for any physical labor.  There is a lot of favoritism.
bad,The Senior leadership team sucks at Memphis. Senior leadership team do not support their front-line managers.  It’s very political and fake.  They micro-manage their leaders and do not treat all there leaders the same & If you speak out they will black ball you out.
bad,"A gerencia não atua de forma coerente. O trabalho é exaustivo e sem oportunidades de descanso, ergonomicamente falando, não há qualidade na atuação do trabalho. Colegas de trabalho pouco profissionais."
bad,its a very nice place to work. the only problem is the salary. for i have so many responsibilities back home thats why i came here to earn good money to support my family.
bad,"El trabajo no es bien remunerado para la carga laboral que se tiene. No había posibilidad de descansar salvo por 15 minutos y la hora del almuerzo, mientras que el resto del día tocaba estar de pie."
bad,The Nike Factory Outlet in Smithfield isn't worth working for. The management is terrible and treat the employees like dogs. Staff members steal and curse at customers. Your hours are based off your sales.
bad,"I didn't enjoy going to work, co-workers we rude and management didn't help me through learning. Pretty much just threw me out with the sharks. I learned to be independent and learn things my own way."
bad,"While one of the premier Nike stores in the globe, this location is poorly managed and therefore lacks any room for advancement or developmental coaching. Staff is unprofessional and there is a complete lack of accountability. Free product and decent wages are offered as a counterbalance, but overall falls short of a stimulating learning environment."
bad,"Nike es una empresa muy grande, el problema es que le falta organización, hay muy poco personal, lo que hace que el ambiente de trabajo no sea tan amigable como mucha gente pensaría. Normalmente toman decisiones o organizar y crean planes de trabajo de los cuales jamás te enteras, hasta seis meses después. Jamás te capacitan, normalmente hay que buscar la información por otros medios. De ahí en fuera no recomiendo laborar en tal empresa, desgraciadamente por lo malos manejos que se tienen en ella."
bad,Walking around making sure the lines are moving. Help others when their shoots gets jammed. i didn't like it because of the pay rate.
bad,"Horrible Place to work"
bad,"There was no hard part time at this job,and the most enjoyable part was the co-workers who was open-minded,I learned about the history and production of nike shoes"
bad,Management there sucked at the cypress location. Shirt handed all the time.
bad,A typical day at work would be running back and forth to make sure coustomers where well taken care of.
bad,"There is no room for advancement. They tell you that they promote from within, but in reality they don't. The only way that you can get a promotion is if you relocate. Once you get hired into a posistion, you're basically stuck in that position. Nike only care about the business and not their employees!!!!"
bad,"work long hours, management operates poorly, they don't tell you if you're fired they just walk you out the door. They show favoritism between the associates that are cool and not cool enough to them"
bad,"Apesar de muitos problemas como todas as empresas possuem, está foi uma empresa em que aprendi a lidar bastante com o publico em geral. A empresa em si é boa para trabalhar, entretanto os gestores (outlet Contagem especificamente), mancham a imagem da marca o que acarreta no descontentamento do funcionário."
bad,Management is sneaky and favors some over others. They will lie to employees about job openings and deny an interview to one person and give the interview to one of their favorites. Morale is horrendous.
bad,"The company overall isn’t terrible. The department where I work ( air mi ) is horrible. Bad management, favoritism, and bad pay. But dint let the higher ups discourage you. They are pretty unhappy in themselves and take it out on who th dt can ."
bad,"Great exposure to the retail industry with a cool company. Included benefits + PTO so long as you were over a certain amount of hours a week. There is some unfairness to pay but if you are willing to lean in, go for it. Nike is a very busy store with diverse clients so you were able to learn a lot."
bad,"In my experience at multiple Nike stores I never felt wanted and all athletes are treated poorly and unfairly. The management is a cult, they all cover each others backs and it is despicable."
bad,"They don't respect or care about student schedule. It's 12 hours long shift. Some of leaders for each group are too controlling. Not enough pay for such a work. Even if you work hard, you are still under appreciated."
bad,"I love the brand so much I put blood sweat and tears into it, I feel like a lot of employees have. Nike fails to take advantage of the talent and educated employees they have. They’re more than just a shoe clerk. There are so many creative and intelligent people there that could branch off and do other things for the company to get in touch with the communities and the youth. Nike employees  are so in touc with the culture they could learn so much from them"
bad,Favoritism over all in regard to promoting within. Poor management with bad pay. Not much opportunity for growth. Short term job with little hours. Long time spent on feet.
bad,"Nike, NALC has a high turnover of staff...'WHY'...The majority of the staff is employed through a Temporary Agency. I don't and can't comprehend why Nike will not take the Morally High Ground and employ Memphian's in it's logistics company as direct FT employees,  which may eliminate their high turnover, while possibly contributing to the overall betterment of Free Market Capitalism. Manuf. should be returned to our country as well."
bad,"Nike has a poor culture, for both fte and contract employees. There seems to be a sense of complacency across the board. While it's great we get half day Fridays in the summer, people take this to the extreme. They constantly ""+1"" or ""Adding So and So"" to emails instead of just answering the questions at hand. They like to pass the blame onto others instead of taking responsibility. Everyone is extremely entitled as if the world owes them. No one knows how to grind"
bad,"Unorganized because of short-staffing following poor management of responsibilities. You are being overworked with the same pay due to them cutting hours to be more productive.Closers don't get out when scheduled to leave, if messy you are expected to leave when you finish."
bad,"Working at this location in Atlanta I will be straight to the point, it was a bad experience of what I expected from Nike. The leadership could be better and more kids friendly. It should be like a coaching environment to there team and customers. Nike is still my favorite but the experience at this particular location was heartbreaking."
bad,Managers treated their employees like they were better than them. Always talking down and bossing other employees around. Didn't like the management and room to move up was 3+ years in any section.
bad,I would not recommend getting your hopes up concerning a long term career within the Memphis based plants. Your skills and job performs  will not matter if you are unable to socially win over one of the clicks  currently established within.
bad,"Long days, weekends."
bad,mauvaise experience ces une entreprise pour des robots et non des humain
bad,"It was a friendly environment among workers, also very fast pase and organized. The place was organized but filthy and you could wear mask. They searched  us before leaving."
bad,"Toxic culture of stepping on someone else to get ahead. Was literally given a laptop and a deadline and was told ""good luck"" on my first day. Team refused to share information and was given little chance to succeed. Mandatory 80 hr work weeks and weekends. "
bad,nothing really to tell about the company. I worked there after graduating college and I needed to make some money and I applied and started working until I was offered a position else where
bad,"If you don’t mind minimum wages for a full work load, long hours on your feet, management doesn’t care about their employees at all. You’re just a number."
bad,Recent org changes shifted the culture.  Hiring from outside with overqualified candidates is becoming more common than hiring from inside. Work is competitive within teams. It makes it less likely for a long career with advancement.
bad,"As a contractor, a rather heartbreaking and soul crushing engagement.  Extreme amounts of work and sometimes with little or no support provided to complete give tasks"
bad,"I Like The Experience, But The management is Terrible.the food is great ,The people they hire can be Uptight as in managers .but Everything is acceptable if u have thin skin not the place to be."
bad,Culture has changed to profit model rather than customer model. This was not something i was willing to sacrifice personally just to hold a position that so many people dreamed of
bad,"The job itself is not hard, it’s dealing with the people and the poor management that makes this job not so worth it.  The job has great benefits and that’s ONLY reason I stayed as long as I did."
bad,buen ambiente de trabajo. trato normal del empleador con los empleados
bad,Nothing to much to say.  Its a really fun job but they have so many workers that the hours are limited.  plus the system is weird that you have to call to know when you have to work but they do not answer.
bad,They Expect You To Give Up Your Life To Be In A Warehouse With No Heat No Air For Little To Nothing Pay. They Don`t Offer Insurance So If something Happens To You On the Job Its Not Their Problem
bad,"Good company some days just  plain bad, the customers  tried to  take advantage of the system, some times you  had a hard time  helping people knowing they had some weird  returns ,"
bad,"Extremely competitive and cutthroat environment if you're looking to advance within the company. Think of it as a pipeline thats so clogged with ""fanboys"" of the brand that it is just one big popularity contest to advance. I also saw multiple instances of nepotism. Also, unfair wages of new hires vs people who have been there for years. This is at the retail level. People who are overqualified at the retail level i.e. (college degrees), often end up leaving the company to seek experience because advancement is so slow. Hard work isn't valued as much as how like-able you are, so if you are going in there thinking you are going to outwork everyone and get noticed think again. They just will keep you where you are because you are a good worker and don't want to lose you.  If you want to develop skills to advance you have to pretty much bother a superior in order to get that training and be noticed. Nike says they like to hire within but theres really no structure within nike to help you grow."
bad,"The most important thing in nike is to look important to the rest of the company and decisions are made as such. Management doesn't care about the technology or the project all they care about is looking good to their superiors."
bad,"I was working at Nike, but subcontracted by Simos Solutions. This temp agency picks their managers according to who knows who. It could have been a good job but I could not accept their managers standards."
bad,I didnt  really  enjoy working there  but over all was a clean fun environment . The  other employees  made it  very nice  to be there . They offered  allot of  advancement however I was much  younger  and  really   didnt  want to remain  in  this company
bad,"Management is racist, at this location. plays favorites all the time. management sleeping with team members so they can get promoted. District manager buries his head in the sand......."
bad,Some weeks you will have less than 20 hours due to no work. Simos are Always the first to get sent home. Your Breaks are very short what ever work is left from nike and Adecco will be given to simos which is more than likely very little.
bad,The management when I was first hired was great. After a while new managers came to the store and basically did everything they could to have the store manager terminated then those department managers ended up leaving.
bad,Did not have a solid employee improvement plan in place. The management team on my shift worked well together but across shifts needed some attention. Great health benefits.
bad,You'd think Nike would be a fun place to work NOT! at least the location I was at South Side of Chicago. There were fun days and your work is what you make it. Just not the place to be if you want to progress. I wouldn't recommend full time weekends only or just summer time.
bad,"Working process itself was quite good, except for the management part and higher managers attitude. The CEO of the company does not hesitate to speak in absolutely unacceptable manner with his employees, which I personally find extremely unprofessional."
bad,"There were a lot of positives working for Nike, but the appearance of a good Job Work/Life Balance and the actual balance in reality were two different things.  I had a bad experience with management, felt very dismissed though I was very capable and had valuable input.  If management changed in the department I worked in I would consider working there again."
bad,"The place kept you engaged, but there was not room for advancement and I felt it was a bias environment . The company itself was a great company , but the people in charge need additional training"
bad,"You have to request off 3 weeks in advance, they constantly screw up your schedule and then you have to suffer. they do not treat all employees fairly and will not work with you to succeed. Promotions rarely happen and when they do its usually when its too late. SAVE YOURSELF. DO NOT WORK HERE."
bad,"I ensure the truck was loaded and unloaded, stock replenished, and work area was safe and free of debri. The most enjoyable part of my day was interacting with my peers."
bad,"horrible management, not much room for growth or development within the company. benefits were good as well as paid holidays off for full time employees."
bad,The store was new and far away from other stores for support. Management was difficult and unable to handle certain situations. The company is probably great at other locations.
bad,"My experience at like is like all the other warehouse(s) I been to unorganized, strict, and just overall overbearing. It puts to much pressure on people for a small amount of pay at he end of the week."
bad,"Uma empresa boa  aonde trabalhei, "
bad,They only seem to care about the numbers they produce then the employees who produce their numbers. They do promote within but only if they like not if you're qualified
bad,"good could be better. working at night and for four hours. long shift. boring. hard. you do get discounts on shoes, and you get paid weekly"
bad,They don't care about their employees. As well as firing people to get rid of deeper problems. The employees themselves make it a fun environment. Management & corporate is what is shady.
bad,"good place to work when you're a temp. not a lot of permanent job offers though so that kind of ruins it. and if you're working as a temp, don't expect a lot of benefits unless you work with adecco"
bad,"I think you really have to enjoy working retail to work in the industry. I was the warehouse manager and had 162 employees between the ages of 16 & 20. Very stressful. I was sent to sensitivity training to try to be easier on the kids working. I was used to managing an oil company. At Nike I was responsible for getting my employees to process $24 million of merchandise a year. There was no room for a warehouse manager to grow. However, the benefit package and pay rate was more than I had expected. When layoffs were on the horizon, I volunteered to take a layoff."
bad,The culture of Nike was unbelievably bad at that facility. They mistreated temporary employees and had unfair work schedules.
bad,"no team work"
bad,managers play favorites if they dont like you personally they cut your hours no matter how good an employee you are never out sell a manager in monthly sales itll get you fired instead of rewarded
bad,Nike is an okay place to work but they will work you.  it is a nice part time or short term job.
bad,great place to work part time. will give you more hours if need.
bad,"Work was normal, typical work for production."
bad,"Within TA there is a lot that needs to improve. Not many recruiters enjoyed the work. Some leaders lead, others played the political game. Great org, just needs actual leaders."
bad,Save your time and apply for somewhere else. Youre welcome. The managers are terrible and dont want you move up. You will get lied to and they hide opportunities and overwork you for little pay.
bad,The employees at the specific location I worked at were not very friendly among other employees. They often made new employees feel alienated from the rest of the group.
bad,"It is an awesome company, but I am too involved on weekends to work their. They have a good culture and their management knows what they're doing but it is almost cult like"
bad,"It claims to be a socially integrative, progressive company, and in fairness, it's Bennetton ad style staffing looks that way. The culture is, however, as bro-y and fratboy as ever. "
bad,"Great if you are a fan and like to represent the brand, not the place to advance, should offer room for growth and improvement, glorified retail job.."
bad,"Arrive 10 minutes before shift begins, have a small meeting held by a manager with people coming in to work the same shift (about total sales and how the day is going), get headset and go to the section of the store you are scheduled to work"
bad,More work for less pay... hard to afford living in the area for that pay rate.  Super busy but the company benefits are pretty decent.  Hard to get promoted because of how many employees there are in the company.  You would really need to stand out to be a candidate..
bad,I wouldn't do it but do what you want.   now im just adding characters because it wants me to and will not let me review unless i add these characters to my review.
bad,Advance was nonexistent and upper management didn’t want to see you excel. They were afraid of losing their own jobs. Also the product was limited on what you could buy which made no sense.
bad,"Because of the time I worked at Nike (winter holidays), management was haphazard and it did not feel like we were a cohesive team. I did not feel comfortable asking the managers for time off or pay raises. It did feel like nepotism ran the schedule."
bad,"Office space is open and well most groups are loud and annoying so make sure you have a good pair of headphones.  Day starts with stand up which is good gives you a bit of autonomy but some changes of certain things become political and most internal code should be opened but  recently it seems its more dictated by core groups. Also no AWS sandbox for checking some of the dev-ops development and only certain people have admin privileges to test accounts, keep in mind test accounts, so when your stuck cause of some role that is missing just makes you have to switch to other work until some one with IAM privileges has time to meet.  No leading edge on anything except store app, the company is broken into two sectors one is NDE and then there is nike yet CIO reports to COO not CEO, this occurs in the 21st century very odd.  You can clearly see a distinction between WHQ and NDE. If your married and will not rock the boat, and do as your told perfect job. If you do decide to work at nike digital not expect any advancement there are people with 10 years in the same position they started, this is normal through out nike digital. Also you have quite a few number of people that are very arrogant mainly in phone development they get free food all the time just for a few buttons and for keeping state shows you that the people making the decisions really do not understand the stack."
bad,"The company is overwhelmingly political.  ""Doers"" are badly outnumbered and overwhelmed by people trying to co-opt and take credit for the work.  A severe lack of rigor and discipline in basic management principles such as objective performance ratings and career development ensure that the company will continually punch below its weight in terms of ROI."
bad,"it's really been difficult to adjust to the political culture at Nike. They really don't care about diversity or equality, they just print that on T-shirts instead of really fixing the problem in the campus. They are more about who's your favorite, the middle management is a mess."
bad,Uma empresa que no estrangeiro dá bastantes oportunidades de crescimento profissional
bad,"El compañerismo es bueno, excepto por el gerente que es muy pesado, si le caes bien te trata bien, de lo contrario hace que el trabajo sea arduo y pesado"
bad,"Typical days are filled cleaning up after and assisting demanding customers with no sense of respect for others and even themselves with a few good people sprinkled in every now and then. I've learned you can't always put your faith in your management, whom do not care for their employees development anymore and lack the proper work ethic and people skills to actually manage properly. There are activities outside of work however they are usually poorly communicated by management. The hardest part of the job is the extremely negative environment on the weekends and holidays. The best part is the the other employees who do their best to stay positive throughout all the adversity."
bad,"This place is just horrid as far as management. There is no room for advancement in this store. You are just an overworked, underpaid, unappreciated number."
bad,Young employees
bad,Could definitely better if scheduling wasn't awful and management was better. At the warehouse the management is awful and there is absolutely no work life balance.
bad,Mostly eight hour shifts. Fast paced environment. Horrible management. Unprofessional store drama between coworkers or management. Good pay. Works around school very well.
bad,Go in and get checked in by manager sometimes were not on the floor so you did not know what promotions were going on. They make you do every task while they sit there and do nothing.
bad,Nike isn't considerate when it comes to ETW people. Do not come here unless you are willing to work like a slave. They also have rude management. That's about it.
bad,Managers always telling you that what you did was not good enough.  No end in site to 7 days a week 12 hours day.  Made you feel terrible if you had to take a day off
bad,The place is chaotic.  Hard to believe they've managed to grow to the size they have.  Very much who you know vs. what you do that gets you ahead.  Senior management is like a deer in the headlights with current business challenges.
bad,"management is horrible"
bad,"This company is a great place to work if you are in need of employment.  You cannot establish job security within this company.  This position consists of manual labor without great compensation.  This job do not pay their employees for the work performed.  This is only for people who need income until they can secure reliable, secured income within their employment."
bad,"This was contracted through Convergys, so it wasn't very lucrative.They paid us much less than they paid their own workers to do the same job, and often times they couldn't uphold their contractual agreements."
bad,The company will promote you quickly but they fail to properly train and promote professional management cultures. I believe they also fail to compensate employees for the daily task required to complete the job.
bad,"As a temp, you learn very little, very few positions open compared to the amount of temps working. Very strict with every break and what you are doing at each station."
bad,the warehouse environment is not for me.  Those 10hour days were hard on the body. Nike is not the dream job just to get in the Nike store. They have some dumb rules
bad,"A typical day at work consisted of 6-8 athletes on the sales floor waiting on a consumer to come in a purchase something. I learned how to ship/receive products, however all of my skills I had already attained working at previous jobs. Management was very poor and involved a lot of micro managing which seemed to be very insufficient and all of the managers weren't all on the same page when it came to policies and procedures. The workplace culture had a positive upbeat vibe that enjoyed working in. Hardest part of the job would have to be the unwelcomeness I felt from the employees that had been working there prior to me. I felt like I had to keep to myself when working with majority of my coworkers which was hard because I'm a very outgoing, bubbly person. Most enjoyable part of the job was being able to provide premium customer service and working around shoes."
bad,"very young management , unorganised  , childish environment."
bad,"Had to keep 30 weekly hours minimum availably for part time. "
bad,"Nike is an international, mutibillion dollar company that is still trying to act like a startup. In the end all it does is irritate the professionals that try to work with them, their retail employees and customers."
bad,"No on-boarding, no learning curve adjustment, just run and gun, fight-or-flight environment, which was fine because I have nearly ten years an that industry and I was comfortable with it. They didn't like that I worked past 5pm, and usually was there until 7-8pm. Everyone started around 9am, but I showed up at 8am sometimes 7am. Just the way I work and the motivation I have. Always been a hard worker and believe that that's a key to success. Without working equipment it was difficult to do my job correctly and efficiently. Understanding email processes or even having a company email, understanding department flow, leadership, authorized applications and access, having access to specific programs like Sharepoint or cloud based applications required for the position, nothing was set up. Support was suppose to set up my computer and accounts, but I ended up doing most of the work myself. Was given a computer with a defective Ethernet port that I later determined the issue when support was unable to figure it out. The computer dock had that I was given didn't have a power cord. Computer dock power port was missing the center prong for the power plug and didn't work. I had to get cords from other free desks, computer dock from an open desk, computer screens, my chair was for a sitting desk and not for the standing desk I was assigned, no big deal, I just stood. Just little things that you shouldn't have to worry about hindered my ability to do my job. Didn't have any organization and I was used to a very matrix based environment. Nothing was set up. My leadership team was all contracted"
bad,"Monday through Thursday I worked 5 p.m. to 5 a.m. a 12 hour shift I learned a vast number of things from nike, I've worked my way around the department because I didn't want to just do one thing for 12 hours. I wanted gain knowledge to help out different parts of the departments if I was needed."
bad,"Don't want to post an online review as the experience is different for many people.  I'll just say that management is dirty and if you shine brighter than them, you won't be there for much longer.  Stay under the radar, do your job and nothing more."
bad,"- You come in find out what department (cashier, footwear, apparel, back of house) you will be working that day. You stay in that section tending to customer needs and returning merchandise."
bad,To work at Nike is fun but the management is horrible and if you plan on advancing in your career you have to be really phony and kiss a lot of butt otherwise you will remain in your current status. The discount is nice.
bad,Simpel werksfeer grote ruimtes niet al te leuke collega's.
bad,"A fast paced work place, management is fair. Long days, but compensates good."
bad,"Not the best, not the worst. Pay is fair. Benefits are great. For a company with so much opportunity, it is unfortunate that they aren't focused on developing internal talent."
bad,"The managers dont care for the employees. The corporate ladder doesnt care for employees "
bad,"Managers dont know what's going on with their leads telling other workers what the can and cant do, (Slacking, long breaks, unfair workload.) Ridiculous policies with cellphones (Zero tolerance for cellphones, instant termination)"
bad,Management is very poor they are not understanding when it comes to personal matters dealing with family and kids they want to write you up for any personal matter that may occur when it clearly states in the handbook excuse for personal emergency matters
bad,no never never no i should not have to type this carp as a condition of me using this site. make nike write reviews!! this is so aggravating im so done im done.
bad,"Work Hard Play Hard, Competitive, Good access to training, Silos, Different cultures at each dept, low Work life balance , Good compensation, weak leadership with no focus,"
bad,If were a man I would have been promoted to any job I wanted. Since I was an outspoken women who was into sports and have a fashion for sneakers I was considered over my head.
bad,"My biggest take away from working for Nike in  deer park for the last several years is how bad the management has gotten.  it starts at the top, and the new head manager who has been with the store for a little over a year, is very unprofessional in my opinion.  From not knowing many of the basic responsibilities of a head coach at nike to, having a poor attitude towards co-workers causing mass amounts of long time workers to leave, and having assistant managers under her to transfer or leave the company themselves."
bad,I was loader who loads trucks. I made sure the correct label was on the boxes. I made sure the boxes went to the correct location. I also made sure the boxes was not stuck on the belt.
bad,"Worked at Nike for over a year. Started off very promising, but then management seemed to turn into nothing but a power struggle, my fellow employees were nice, but the managers were professionally unprofessional."
bad,come to work clock in go to your work area to have your daily department meeting go to your area to get your rf device go to the line to see what products you were goind to work with.
bad,"Travailler pour un distributeur d'articles de sport est toujours très agréable pour un passionné comme moi."
bad,This is a great company to work for if you are fresh out of high school and love shoes. They offer unlimited discounts and giveaways. Nike offers limited advancement.
bad,"Kundenberatung, Verkauf, kassieren, Warendisposition nach Ordersatz und Warenverräumung war meine Aufgaben."
bad,The company barely gave me hours and never had work. We were sent home almost daily. The pay wasn't enough so I'll prefer a better job that pays more and give me more hours.
bad,"working at this establishment was not a good experience. The manager would often yell and make workers feel uncomftorable. I enjoy working in a competitive enviornment but no matter how hard workers tried, management was never happy. I would not recomend working at this spicific store."
bad,"Im a part time member but regularly do overtime, the hours are long and the breaks are short. "
bad,"My work days there was stressful and environment clickish.  My experience is if you don't know the right people then ""Oh Well"" to get promoted.  Lunch events occurred on monthly basis and for most part was enjoyable."
bad,"Nike is a good company to work for overall. If you work on campus, I'm sure it's great, but, unfortunately, I was not one of those lucky ones. I was in an office building way off of campus so it was a whole different type of work environment.  Nike has a lot of outdoor activities during the summer that are pretty cool and free for employees, but sometimes you're not allowed to bring anyone else...including spouse and kids. That part I did NOT like. They're good about having a work life balance, I'll give them that. They also expect you to drink the kool-aid, and a lot of it. It reminded me a lot of the movie ""The Circle"". "
bad,I was a temporary worker and it was a very fun environment but the management seems like they were very clueless and took advantage of their positions.
bad,"Long hours, small pay. Short breaks. staff can be very mean at times. hiring all of the time. Make sure you are always busy. Good location, but very tiring"
bad,demande d'emploi pour les opportunités de développement le management - et l'aspect le plus agréable de mon poste .
bad,Management is not great . They do not allow people to move up. When it comes to harrasment issues it is over looked by management. Some of the managagers disregard people. I thought it would be a great place to work and try to move up but it is not. They also should work on customer service and not have so many of the workers stand around. There is plenty to do at nike but no one chooses to do anything and a lot of that has to do with management.
bad,"They Over work you cause you a temp, and let the perm nike workers basic do less work.. Work you hard boost your head up telling you to do this amount of work we will get you full time within no less then 3 months but it never happen"
bad,Benefits ok.Pay ok. Job easy. Climate controlled. Overall its one of the better places in memphis to work for aslong as your not a temp because they are often mistreated or claim to be
bad,"A typical day at work starts out with going to the daily morning huddle before the store opens to go through sales numbers of the previous day, company news and sports news."
bad,Empresa com forte cultura organizacional mas com poucos processos estruturados. Relações interpessoais consolidadas extremamente importantes.
bad,"The work is very repetitive and the expectant outcome is a bit ridiculous for what they are asking for. The people who have worked there the longest don't really know what they are talking about, basically, no one really knows what they are talking about at this company. Everything is unorganized. One day you will hear this, then the next day you will hear that. They LIED to me. They promised many things upon working and did not fall through with it. They get you pumped up for something that is not even worth to get hyped up about. "
bad,"If you want to be paid in status for working at the company, accept a sporty and entertaining campus instead of advancing, and never speak critically about internal issues, then this is an ideal place for you."
bad,The job itself is fairly easy and it is a fun place to be but moving up is difficult unless you are in good with the people who are opening positions. You have to be willing to go to foreign environments to advance quickly. For the most part the co-workers are fairly decent folks but you do have some whom you really do not want to have contact with. The company is fairly cutthroat and at the end of the day they will not hesitate to fire you even for doing noting really wrong. I saw a handful of management members be terminated but never really any of the athletes. The more you move up the easier it is to fire you.
bad,"Typische bandwerk."
bad,Productive but boring enviorment to work in. The breaks are too short the pay is too low and the people are theives. Its a good temp job but I wouldnt consider staying there.
bad,Management seemed uncaring for the most part. Workplace culture was somewhat unorganized and unprofessional. Employees were not allowed to sit down and were only given a 30 minute lunch break and a 15 minute break 3 hours into a 10.5 hour shift.
bad,"Started out as a great, collaborative place to work, until management was shifted."
bad,"* very strict on attendance "
bad,Contractors are second class and so they have very little stability or protections. There are some really great folks there that care about what they do and would like to improve.
bad,"Plenty of interesting software to work on. Just beware that if you get hired on as a contractor, it's very unlikely they will hire you on full time. I've done 3 contracts with them. and the last two they wanted to bring me on full time. but that process took so long that my contract ended both times before they could actually get me on full time. Months, not weeks."
bad,"Poor management. Hard to move up in the company, as they liked hiring from the outside rather than internally. Company only cared about margins and not about employees."
bad,"I have been with Nike now for more than 3 years and I have recently completed my college degree and am looking to move up. However, unless you fit a certain archetype you not looked at seriously for any role of advancement. Currently I am looking to leave Nike so I can grow in my profession."
bad,"I did mandatory overtime for a whole two months straight before I quite and they still did it after I left. I worked 6-6 Monday - Sunday when I was supposed to only work Mon- Wed. You cant sit down, you always have to be standing doing something, if you dony have to do work they make you do house keeping, and the leads have no leadership skills. If i lived alone I would be living check to check, The hours are terrible and the pay sucks."
bad,"Nike should be a fun and exciting place to work for, but the Nike Factory in Oklahoma isn't the best place to work at."
bad,"There's no room for advancement unless you've been there a long time.  They start you as a ""part-time under"" which is less than 25hrs a week.  Then the only way to get more hours is reapply for the job you already have.  It's called a ""part-time over"" which is 25-30hrs a week.  The thing is there is only one or two of these positions every few months so everyone wants it.  So not only do you have to reapply for the job you already have, you have to compete with you co-workers and outside applicants as well.  Then the same goes to jump to full-time, manager, etc."
bad,"Its alright, wouldnt say its the best, wouldnt say its the wors. Long island new york is where the nike i worked at was. Managers play the favoring game, and will work you to the bone, just to deny an extra two hours on your shift. but the discount was cool."
bad,"Fun place to work. Managers tended to be overbearing and make it difficult to work autonomously. While the discount and company culture was great, overbearing management made it difficult to thrive."
bad,Acredito que a valorização do funcionário deveria ser de acordo com o trabalho dentro da empresa.
bad,"New strategy with CDO."
bad,"Es una gran empresa, con una historia muy digna de aprender, lo cual hace que cada integrante de ella conozca el como se forjo y la importancia que tiene en el mundo.."
bad,"Nike is een goed bedrijf en heeft een goede bedrijfscultuur."
bad,i learn different kind of skill like picking and packing. how to load n unload truck at a fast pace. Drove the forklift for a few months. bad management and really hot to deal with.
bad,"A typical day with Nike inc is alright, other than the constant rotation of management. Everything else is fine. just try not to be late and not voice your opinion to often, and youll be fine."
bad,"I was very happy to work at Nike Running store in Antwerp."
bad,"Pay is lousy and they refuse to hire full time, allowed verbal assault to continue even after multiple complaints. Safety protocol was not followed allowing for multiple near misses"
bad,"management never knew when people were going on break, constantly stood around and talked while we did all the work , short patience, the pay was 9.50 so very good for retail , and the discounts were on point. did not get hired back after seasonal because of my ""shy personality"" should've been a lawsuit. the staff that was already working there were childish adults , constantly talking in cliques . rude"
bad,The company is so productive . They have best setup for their people. Best training program for new joinings& product knowledge seasons are quite remarkable .
bad,learned retail logistics. bad management. coworkers gossip but work. break room has direct tv and apple computers. great discount
bad,Very unorganized warehouse to work for and very low pay.Management is unorganized and very heartless.Honestly would'nt recommend any one to work there.
bad,no tiene objetividad la gerencia en cuanto a los planes del mes
bad,"The pay was too low to care about the job in general. And there are only two schedules to choose both 12 hours long. Depends what you’re looking for - it’s chill but no where to go due to lack of management , there’s no advances"
bad,Fun place to work but management is infested with politics unfortunately. I loved the day to day work responsibilities but management is not trustworthy or transparent with contractors
bad,Ils exploitent au maximum pour augmenter leurs profits et comme ils vous le disent si bien ils ont tous les jours des CV de personnes qui souhaiteraient travailler pour eux
bad,"The Nike campus has a super appealing campus and physical work environment that the company has spent a lot of money investing in and is constantly under construction, which is also a negative, but they are forward thinking for their employees. Nike has several cafeterias and lots of options for meeting rooms and really allow you to explore around the campus when you need some time from your desk or you need to impress a client."
bad,"The work was fast paced and simple. They showed u how to do it all."
bad,"They promote a condensed work schedule, employee discounts, and their exhaustive benefits package(s) as well as their NIKE brand as selling point on why working at Nike is so great."
bad,"The people are awesome, part time requires 30 hours which sucks for students. Managment doesnt care about outside commitments. shifts can run till midnight, no room for growth and they choose favorites. Managers always yell and talk down to you. Even when you call the hotline they dont bother helping you out."
bad,Over all Nike has to many employees not enough hours some employees were favored not many opportunities working for Nike management was ran poorly job had to many unprofessional staff and workers if you needed personal time some management didn’t approve of it
bad,You start off making good money then your hours get cut. Sksndksnekckcifisjsxjcjjdjsjsjsjsjwndjccj jcdjsjsjsjskdkdjdjjdjdjejjwjdndnenwnendjejwjdjndndndn
bad,"Working for such a large company is great, but the managers are very wishy-washy. There is a lot of favoritism and double standards. The rules don't always seem to apply to everyone."
bad,i used to love coming to work here but the way management is running things at that store is pretty bad. They will allow certain managers to get away with certain things. high expectations with  very small staff.
bad,Probably the worst retail store I've ever worked for.  Management is malicious towards each other.  Someone always has something negative to say about another Assistant or Head coach.
bad,I came in for the shift meeting and went right to work. My manager kept the people motivated to finish the job. The job was fairly easy and not a problem. I learned how to do a job in a certain amount of time. My job was threatened everyday with temporary companies coming in and taking my job.
bad,"your co-workers"
bad,"The managment was unreliable and unorganized. The service was short and overly controlled for specific clientele, ignoring other guests of equal validation."
bad,"12 Hour Shifts"
bad,"It’s a Okay job, I didn’t like the management there! Like most jobs you will run into bad management! It got to a point where the discount didn’t matter! Great discount tho, you can get a lot of Nike gear for the low"
bad,"een zuiver bedrijf waar men met eigenkledij naar toe kan"
bad,It was a good experience wouldn’t mind being full time good benefits good discount ..I would love to be a full time black badge at Nike ware house ...
bad,Right management in the right location with the right product is a set up for success.  Management team is not going anywhere which leaves no room for growth.
bad,If you are going to work at the Nike in Grapevine make sure to not let anything get to you. The managers are either in the office or yelling at you to do things they dont do and the head managers you never see them
bad,"Just like any other company that sells shoes and apparel. Not much different than Puma, Reebok, and Adidas. Could have done a lot better to make workers feel wanted."
bad,"Needs better pay and advancement in job , staff was fun to work with, would recommend job for teenager ..............................................."
bad,Keep working until u get more hours and never stop untol they tell u to stop and i liked the job just not giving more hours to the workers that we work hard for.
bad,I had approached the head supervisor of the incident with the lead and the supervisor and he said that he would speak with them. The next day I was called by the employment agency and told that the assignment was terminated.
bad,They don't blow the horns that a safety hazard the folk lift diver drive fast it just a mess the people is in  every body business there the supervisor dating the girls work there it just a mess there and I want me something better with benefits and that pay more and some thing permanent
bad,The pay is different depending on when you started. Rookies can come in getting paid more even if you worked there for years. Friendly environment management is always too pushy about goals and such. Foreign customers are difficult to handle.
bad,"Super bonne ambiance , expérience intéressante avec une histoire de la marque qui et très agréable à connaitre"
bad,"Store felt like high school, lots of judgmental people and lots of managers picking favorites. Probably worked in my favor a few times but overall its unprofessional."
bad,"Management is not good at all. They hired a couple of new manager and they were good but one of the good ones quit. There is a lot of picking favorites. Hours are not given. I have like 1 shift a week with full availability. Overall not a great place,"
bad,Competitive marketplace with a real innovative spirit. Embraces diversity and inclusion as well as respect for the employees. Challenges itself to be a leader despite it's large size which can slow things down in terms of GTM and innovation
bad,The hours are very long and the job can be stressful at times. Make sure you buy yourself some comfortable shoes. It can definitely take a toll on your feet.
bad,"Hard to move up."
bad,"Goed betaald, geen doorgroeimogelijkheden of reeele kans op vast contract"
bad,"a typical day at work was tiring "
bad,"This job is not hard, but people are waiting for their food so chaos is bond to happen. All preparations must be completed in a timely fashion. Customers may be rude and get mad for waiting on their food"
bad,A typical day at work was answering phones and filing. There was a lot of short days due to company lack of work.
bad,employees are very messy. alot of older people worked there and they seemed to have no other life outside of nike.
bad,"I think NIKE is one of the best companies out there to work for. They have many opportunities to grow, they have internships they offer across the country."
bad,"    rkers"
bad,Staff are not very customer oriented and aren't too friendly. Company will do better if they work on more positive customer interaction.
bad,"I worked for Nike for many years and it was a fun place to work for a long time. Then they started with Matter of Respect Policy and then I started to get dinged. I am a straight forward person and people do not like that. I had coworkers who were all about talking instead of helping me. When I ask them to help me they would go to the office and tell the manager, that they did not like the way I told them. I would get called in and talked to. The managers would say it was not my place to tell them anything. I noticed other employees would be in similar situations and the managers would not tell them anything. This made me resentful and I eventually left."
bad,"Honestly, I do love working for Nike but it is not a place to work at if you’re a full time student. They’re unwilling to compromise when it comes to scheduling and your availability. They want Nike to have 100% of your focus. If you’re available 5 out of 7 days a week, you’ll be working those five days on top of a full time school work load. If school wasn’t a part of the equation it’d be perfect."
bad,"It wasn’t a good job for me. The money wasn’t good, you can work overtime and you still wouldn’t be satisfied with the money. But you get discounts on every shoe that releases. That’s the only good thing."
bad,"Nike has a lot of history and been very successful over the years. A recent cultural shift in the company has led to a lack of direction and leaders not providing a clear strategy. This created pandemonium which has led to poorer results, focus on short term results, layoffs and promotions to the wrong individuals. "
bad,"They are the top athletic company but do not treat their athletes equally. The contracts are extremely strict. As an athlete, I did not feel valued. The gear is great but company doesn't have integrity."
bad,A typical day at works consists of folding clothes and putting up shoeboxes for stock at least depending on what department you are working in. The benefits are great because of the neat discount. all in all its an alright part time job.
bad,"Uma boa empresa, onde os funcionários tem a possibilidade de crescimento e voz ativa, mais a falta de Gerência capacitada atrapalha a todos."
bad,Not Enough hours. you can only get hours during holidays other than that good luck. it can be hard earning enough here to barely make enough to support yourself
bad,Make sure to be extra competitive to keep your job. Have to always be on task or else you get completely lost because you can easily get lost with what you’re doing.
bad,"I""ll never ever work there again.There wasn't going to be any advancement for me and I began to look other places."
bad,"Nike as a company is great, there a so many perks. I enjoyed helping the customers and making sure they left with the right product. However their policy is wrong, group of boys coke in daily to steal products. I myself have been threatened by these young boys as I have made eye contact with them whilst they were in the processes of putting boxes in their bags. Nike would have been the perfect company to work for however it's not too great when you're scared and put in challenging situations."
bad,"My Job Title was  Sales representative and it was new store the experience was awesome, i even meet few Nike athlete Castor semenya. The store was base in Pretoria cbd.  i enjoy every aspect of my work unfortunately i had to pursue  my career somewhere else."
bad,"Very unorganized "
bad,Yeah enjoy working there so much. Only wish i could have stayed on longer.  The staff and people i met there were awesome.
bad,Buen ambiente: trato al cliente : y tolerantes buena empresa
bad,Great place to work! Lots of fun and nice people. Long hours but it pays off if you can do 12s. The 4 days on and 3 days off then switch are quite nice. On work days be ready to do nothing but sleep and work but thats why you have 4 days off later!
bad,"The work I did for Nike I'm was boring and tedious, We had to work with machines that create soles. we had 12hr shifts doing the same exact work everyday"
bad,L'équipe n'est pas forcément très accueillante avec les nouveaux et il y a beaucoup de rivalités entre collègues.
bad,"It’s was nice and good working at Nike but most people are racist.” They have a lot of break and the food is cheap, the building is is so nice they are a lot for friendly and good people."
bad,"I started with NIKE IHM as a temporary employee,  then was hired on, upon the understanding that I would be making $15.65  an hour,  and was only at $13.91.i worked 3 days on, week, 4 off."
bad,No comment everyone experience is different. I cant say everyone's experience will be the same as mine. Everyone wasnt the same the work is easy and benefits are worth it
bad,it was good place to work at the management was good learned about packing cliothes
bad,I am 58 years old and after 12 years it is time for me to use my education and skills to further my career.  I enjoyed working at Nike and have learned a lot.  Management was fair also the workplace culture.  The hardest part was working 12 hours and the people I met was the most enjoyable.
good,"Elizabeth jersey garden is by far the worst due to management. Lack of career advancement, alot of favoritism, immaturity, drama, and unfair treatmment."
good,"The management has preferences for employees. "
good,"start off inventory trucks ,"
good,"no review worth giving, only positive is the discount. managers are condescending, disrespectful. I just like shoes so i put up with it. do not recommend for first job for younger job seekers, they will use you. They make up rules on the fly."
good,"Cool job, if you like stand up for the entire shift. The temperature on the inside is based of the weather on the outside. No benefits what so ever. Not the job to start a career."
good,It’s not a hard job to do but the pay is something that they could definitely work on. Love my coworkers but the managers do not know how to mange at all.
good,"Nike doesn't have a proactive approach with good employees."
good,"no organization"
good,"Nike runs in the way where the store is a team, the employees are the athletes and the managers are coaches. They tell you right at the beginning if you don't do well (get mentioned by customers on excellent service, etc.) then just as in a sport, you won't get as much playing time (hours). I believe this is sort of unfair as not everyone fills out the online surveys at home and even if you did a great job, they have no other way of seeing you're a good employee. They recently changed their policies where you can only pick up a shift if the shift is in your availability which also doesn't make sense to me because maybe someone doesn't have school a day they normally would and wanted to make some extra money. Nike is also very clique-y and has a high-school feel."
good,i didnt learn anything and the management was horrible
good,"The pay is decent and the work is easy, but the culture isn't the greatest. So, if you are skilled in disorganization and laziness, go ahead and apply."
good,"I really did not enjoy it due to unorganized work ethics. Everything would shut down, people were not doing the job required. For the most part it was very unprofessional in all aspects"
good,"Lack of communication , no opportunities to get promoted  they hire outside applicants before their own internal applicants that have experience and knowledge"
good,"My experience at Nike was definitely interesting. I knew I was in for a rough ride when after I accepted the position, they made me wait to start due to budget. And I’m not talking one or 2 weeks. Culture was absolutely non existent. Leadership at all levels was non existent. Everyone was aware of all the HR issues, but nobody seemed to care nor do anything about it. Leadership dating each other made it impossible to speak because it immediately turned into retaliation. Hourly athletes were also forced to comply with strict part time hours but had to be available for ridiculous hours, which would ultimately keep them from having other jobs while being paid minimum wage. If you want to work there, only good that comes from it is the discount. Other than that, pay, benefits, and management was pretty terrible. My location closed due to poor performance."
good,Nike is a great place to work they just have crazy hours . Leves no time for the employee. The shifts are 10 to 12 hour days in which some days you might work 12 maybe 10 at little to no warning
good,"Nike was nothing short of a disappointment. "
good,Difficult moving up in the company. Expect a lot out of you for little pay.  It’s all about who you know when it comes to moving up. Hard work often goes inn
good,A typical work day is parking which was a hassle. Next you would walk to security. Then once you were checked at security you would either pick up your equipment from the cage or you would go sit in the break room until it was time for the meeting. The meeting would include the production for the day and safety guidelines. After the meeting you would then pick up your equipment and get started working until lunch.
good,"The culture is not good there. Managers have favorites. If you do not try to make friends with managers, you will not move ahead. Some people get promoted because store manager liked them."
good,"If you're not in managements ""group"" you will be ignored. Easy job but you will get over scheduled. Discount is really good but be ready to spend your whole pay check before you get it."
good,Wasn't paid nearly enough at Nike to be forced to work a minimum of 21 hours/week and forgo an actual social life. Would not recommend Nike as an employer.
good,"Working here for six months I may not have the best review possible, however in my time here I have learned a lot. The people here are wonderful, and they have quickly become my good friends. The pay is not that good for what you will be doing on the job, however the discount is rather nice. The management is terrible, the head manager has a philosophy of if she ignores the problem it will disappear, and also had a hard time talking to her employees."
good,People are promoted based on if they are friends with the managers rather than if they actually work. Someone could step up and do all of the work while someone else just sits in the back and talks all day and they could be promoted before the one who works.
good,Although they enforced a lot of rules as far as dress code it was fine once you get pass the fact that it is a climate control warehouse. Another thing would be the long walks to actually get to your desired area of work.
good,"a day at this place was a disoppointment for me, everyday i get there i couldnt wait to go home , it was just a job for me poor managemnet, poor benifits,"
good,The job its self is easy and its nice to talk to people and help them with whatever they need from order status's to missing orders or items from their orders.
good,"Didn't enjoy, 12 hour days. short breaks. loud busy environment. 3-4 days a week. no personal days off. 30 days until any sort of benefit. got paid >$1 less that originally promised during interview."
good,"In order to become full-time, you have to move to a certain shift which makes it inconvenient for workers who have younger kids. Can't be placed back in your same position."
good,"Il lavoro di gruppo era tutto, le informazioni erano collegate le une con le altre e cosi anche i vari compiti dei vari reparti. "
good,It was ran by young adults i just did my job and came home. I liked the fast pace when it came to picking online orders.And i loved the discounts we were given.
good,"Was not expecting all the helpful creatives. Fun environment, some versatility within designing. Recommend trying one of the studio workshops employee or not"
good,"- Cleaning, helping customer's choose their items and serving them excellent customer service"
good,At this location the managers do not care about your life outside of your time on the clock. You are expected to be there even when you have requested off months in advance and somehow it gets lost in the system. The turnover rate is very high and it is mostly from scheduling and management.
good,"At first the place is OK, but culture not for everyone.  Company tries to woo employees with shoe discounts and other activities, but for professional growth, they are lacking."
good,"Nike had its fair share of good and bad days.  If you enjoy working with athletes and other aspiring athletes, this is the place for you.  A typical day at work can get pretty boring and repetitive because this specific store was fairly slow.  Management was not very fair as our paychecks seemed to be off every check, even if it was by a little.  Only time they praised their employees was if the store as a whole did something good.  The hardest part of the job was standing on your feet for long hours trying to find work to do especially on slow days.  The easiest part of the job was being able to interact with customers since majority of them already knew what they were looking for."
good,"Fun company to work for but not a lot a room for advancement unless you are a favorite. Even if you work hard, and show yourself as a leader, they still won't promote."
good,"Some members of managment treated certain employees unfairly, but other than that it was fine. The break-room was really cool and they give good hours."
good,"it wasn't a bad job.  they were being unfair with the hours and i've work really hard and for them to do that, it was hurtful. this was the first job i ever had and i worked so hard in"
good,the job itself isn't really hard the environment is okay as well only downfalls to nike is the fact the hours doesn't really work for people with a family between trying to work and sleep there's nothing else really left for you to do.
good,"disorganized    and really not a well thought out game plan when it came to running the store. The pay was not right, and they were not really fair with the scheduling."
good,"Nike has been very unfair and not a good work area, management team is always picking sides , very stingy environment, they dont help with issues that occur at store"
good,Company going in the wrong direction with current leaders.  Making decisions not understanding the impact to the business.  You can't innovate inside a berm in beaverton Oregon.
good,"Great place to work for more than 25 years ..."
good,"You get paid nothing, the culture is fake in the store. If you are not a part of every event and kissing the leads asssss then you are not moving up......."
good,"Hard to advance with the company. It is a fun environment with a high energy. You get a lot of nice staff dress for free, but not much room for advancement."
good,"Co-workers all young and vibrant."
good,long hours no respect huge disappointment from such a well known company
good,An amazing experience a great group of people to work around and an amazing facility to experience every day as well as being apart of the leading shoe manufacturer in the world
good,It can be a fun atmosphere depending on who management is. Towards the end of my experience with Nike I saw a lot of shady things i wish i didn't see.
good,"I made a lot of friends and had a lot of fun, but that was about it. I only got paid $11/hour which seems like a lot but was nothing for the amount of work I had to do every day. There is absolutely no flexibility when it comes to hours, and management is terrible. I only worked there for a few months and I honestly don't understand how people can work there full time. It's pure chaos and most of the managers are on a constant power trip. Overall, Nike has MANY areas to improve on, but I can't lie, it was a pretty fun work environment."
good,Most days we have busy hours. Be ready for continually  being short staffed. Customers are great. Work long hours for little pay. I experienced favoritism and lack of communication form the leaders.
good,"You will deal with managers watching you in office to see if you are working, cutting your hours unexpectedly, little pay checks, no room for advancement they really only hire part-time under 20 hour employees and seasonal employees. Get ready for no weekends they give all full shifts during the weekend. Only way to move up is to kiss butt and even then you may get promoted. They do a lot of potlucks but company never pays for holiday party or anything. They do bonus checks but its only 100 and usually strategically around those times your hours are cut although the bonuses are for sales and meeting our quota. You get free uniform(two pants, two shirts, one jacket, one pair of shoes) but you pay taxes and they take it out your check."
good,"I learned that it is a good job to get you on your feet."
good,"Good job while going to school, kept under under 40 hours but had me as part time workers so I couldn’t receive more benefits. Only good for student in college"
good,"It was a stressful environment we would work more than 12 hours a day."
good,"I know the summary is very unassuming, but the part time role there was just that. A Part Time Job. No real expectations. Its an okay place to work if you are in need of extra money."
good,Learned very quickly. Got along with others. Management was very understanding. If a person needed help there was always someone there to help. Hr answered every question i asked.
good,"A typical day at Nike consisted of moving from zone to zone (for me) where help was needed at that particular time. that included covering the fitting room area. Helping costumers find their desired piece of clothing in the women's, men's and kid's are, as well as for shoes. Helped floor directors with floor set up, and figuring out how the day should play out. Lastly, worked cash rep."
good,"It was a 12 hour shift working as a production line worker. I learned it's a fast paced job, and they only give you up to a week of training but it's broke up by 3-4 days off."
good,This job is for a fast multi-tasked person it can become stressful at times so keeping personal problems and emotions away from this job is very important.
good,"The work atmosphere was very interesting. As an RTA I had to look after the schedules and management of the whole floor. It kept me busy throughout my shift."
good,The workers are like middle school students. The management show favoritism. Everyone is in everyone's business. The hours are brutal and if you're not willing to do more work than you are getting paid for then this is not the job for you.
good,"Overall was an unfair job. They don't care about personal issues .The leads were very messy due to the fact that most of the leads were young, and all they wanted was for you to come to work. I was sexually harrassed by an employee through simos and to this moment I still cant work for any other nike"
good,Nike has been a great opportunity for me and I am grateful for the experience they gave me but management is very poor and displeasing. There is a lot of unprofessionalism that goes on at this job and overall wasn't my best work experience. I was very pleased after leaving.
good,"My job was very fast past, quick breaks , and  a different way of doing your job assignment (job assignments changed very frequently). I enjoyed NIKE."
good,"I'm sure Nike would be great if they would hire people directly. Instead you must almost always come on as a contractor and get paid less than half of what the permanent employees in your department make. Instead of spending money on getting good employees, they would rather layoff 5% of their staff so they can finish a multi million dollar parking garage that includes a human sized chess board and hop scotch...great business moves being made here. The culture is not at all what it used to be 20+ years ago and is very corporate now. Do not believe it if someone tries to tell you differently. It's all about dollars and cents."
good,"I worked for Nike for 27 years, while I enjoyed my job I didn't love the uncertainty and insecurity it brings.  You are always watching over your shoulder and feel guarded about what can share.  Lots of people with hidden agendas that will stab you in the back to get what they want.  It is a shark tank, DON""T BLEED."
good,"hours are long and poor management, not well set up task for everyone. everyone just goes to every department to find something to do. i learned alot about the products ."
good,it was retail industry but growth was slow & no future commision was gud but it was limited if we cross our targets over then also we were getting commision for fixes target only hence was not happy
good,"We all know retail isn't the best due to customers, but when customers go off on you and your mangers never back you up it's ridiculous. We don't have the managers support, they never have our back, and we basically don't matter to them."
good,"My first job and I loved it as far as what 17 year old did u know working for Nike and makes close to 1,000 a month . It was just the bad environment and negative energy"
good,Poorly managed facility because management is not properly eduacated on job functions. Employees not properly trained to perform daily duties. SRS Dept
good,Poor to work for wouldn't recommend getting a job there bad working hours work mainly weekends and short paid most months
good,"Nike was my first job , it was a great place to learn about how to customer service . Another thing I liked about Nike was their ability to learn to work as a team . I would recommend this job to teenagers . Nike really give hard time with advancement within the company , really have to kiss up to move up . Hard work is not recognized."
good,I really didn't learn anything from this job. I been picking since I started working. I believe that this company still have things to learn on how to treat their temps and how to reward their workers for how hard they work because to be honest the temps work harder then the full timers.....
good,"Working in Nike Town, NY started off as a fun place, especially early morning meeting we all huddle up, go over numbers and sports and make a good time of the start of the day whether if it was starting competitions, acknowledging others success or up brings and what was soon to come. we tried to make it as fun as possible with the inclusion of management. Co-workers made the day go faster especially when teaming up to help consumers. The hardest part was when changes in management came and the fun and enjoyment of going to work was taken away due to stricter rules in place or just to certain people. I learned many facts and unknown parts of Nike product that I still withhold with me today even after parting with the company."
good,It was a constantly busy workplace and you could ask to switch departments. The pace of the job was the best and the environment. The hardest part was trying to stay neutral with all co-workers. Learned a lot about the different technologies in the shoes and apparel.
good,Make sure visual displays and inventory needs were met. Co-workers were great but management was not conducive to creativity or individualism.
good,"no chance for advancement"
good,"Many managers arrive a few minutes before their start of shift and leave as soon as they can leaving the next shift in a no win situation to reach objectives. GM never visits my shift! OM does not work OT or help during peak! Overall, there is a lack a support at a high level and alot of unprofessional noise such as ""f"" bombs, door slamming, and threats of being fired behind closed doors by OM's. Nike Memphis does not support improvements and many enjoy getting in the way of those that drive improvement and it works to sustain staus quo. OM's VERY much out of touch with what manages are doing and how hard they work to keep things flowing smoothly. Poor support services but IT is getting better! Reviews do not capture the true performers. OM's that create a bias work culture because of internal relationships off site and even some married and working in the same building. Many benefits that sound so great on the career web page are in fact NOT real! You pay for your own time off after five years and you DO NOT get paid for all classes as suggested, just ask those working there!"
good,"Extremely disheartening, but we need a job to survive. I wish they'd do things differently so people would enjoy coming to work or actually being @ work."
good,"The company is a very amazing company with great opportunities; However, working at the fifth ave location is very hectic and unorganized at times. Management is poor."
good,"the people sitting on buckets for 12 hours, doing nothing and if anything screwing up lines is insane.  Out of 12 poeople 4 will do the entire ty of work while the 8 sit around and check their phones all night.  HR has neutered floor management- and middle management is useless.  They tried to solve every management problem with yet another layer of managers who don't know the job, production processes and who just get in the way   decision miming. They can't get rid of the ""workers"" who do nothing and yet they won't promote the good workers there- they hire people off the street with no experience at a higher rate of pay than the productive people who have been there for years if decades. "
good,"Nike is a good job for those looking for a part-time and temporary job.  However, in the store I worked for, the management had poor communication, did not care for their employees and there was a lot of gossiping within management itself.  If you work for Nike, make sure you are able to work their schedule which means it is not a consistent 9-5 schedule and you will have to work morning/nights at different times throughout the week as well as overnight shifts.  This is a job I would recommend to a newly graduated high school student who is trying to gain experience and some cash flow however, it will be difficult for a person living on their own to live off of their pay checks just starting off in Nike. Overall, as far as retail, it is a good company to experience."
good,"Being that I already knew a lot about shoes, I just had to learn the culture and product of what Nike was supposed to be. Training was very short and brief. None of the management were on the same page. The associates were very disrespectful and basically were allowed to do as they please with out any consequences. The culture of this location was out of control."
good,a typical day at Nike would be to monitor areas of carton flow and assist team members with problem areas. I learned and gained extensive knowledge on how the facility operates by working with and assisting fellow technicians that allowed me to gain the skills that i have aquired.
good,Other employees are amazing to work with but the management is difficult to work with if you are not one of their top performers. The turnover rate has increased and there is a significant amount of people who don't show up or call out.
good,"Nike, with the right people it works well. in most nike stores it is the best place to work whilst in others i wouldn't recommend it"
good,I enjoyed working at Nike because I had great coworkers who were very collaborative and helpful. Management was rigid. There was lots of favouritism and segregation within the organization. I did not feel like I belonged.
good,The job itself is ok. The staff is terrible which makes it an uncomfortable place to work. The pay is not worth the long hours and dedication put into the job
good,It ok with perks but is hard to get from one 0lace to another mangers arent all friendly and the work is hard working with temps but can be very challenging
good,Retail involved helping lots of customers and tidying the store throughout the hours. The most challenging is dealing with angry customers and the easiest is inventory.
good,Nice people but the leaders where all over the place but they did what that could so I guess I had a good experience over all I wouldn’t take back the time I spent there
good,"The overall job started off fun, and informational, it helped build my skill set as an employee, I wanted to work to move higher however the management was not helpful, they were not uplifting, they made promises that were not kept, and in the end i did not feel valued. They hire and fire monthly, it is not secure unless they favourite you."
good,None to add except give people an opportunity to continue working after doing work within a temp hire position. Should give people a chance to work lo
good,"I worked with the company for a while and I can't say I hated it the discount was great and I met a lot of amazing people. The work was so easy. It was a lot of work but it was nothing to complain about. I don't believe that my experience in anyway is a representation of their brand as a whole. I went back and forth working at the stores and the warehouse. I loved the store but the warehouse however was just full of gossip and politics. You would've thought you were back in highschool. If management didn't like you and knew you were trying to get out of the warehouse they would deny you applying for any other position. They would sit around and watch the cameras for most of their shifts just waiting to see you do anything slightly wrong so they could write you up( I was never written up this was an observation I made) most of the managers were lazy they would see how heavy the workload would be and they would just stand at the computers gossiping. Not all of them were like this. Some were really amazing and there to do their jobs. The pay raises were a BIG JOKE. I got a .10 raise because the cost of living went up. TEN WHOLE CENTS. Even after my promotion I didn't receive a raise. They stated my ""benefits package"" was my raise(trust me when I tell you my work was always up to PAR I was a dedicated employee). Meanwhile many of the other people who also received a promotion also received a raise and their benefit. I felt very under appreciated in my role as I found myself doing a lot for the company. I did however enjoy my time there. Besides the childish atmosphere I was able"
good,"Process clothing for sale. Unload trucks, perform daily audits. Management was all about themselves. Low level managers thought they were Gods at times. Work there if you to make new friends and receive clothing discounts. Don't work there for the pay."
good,"Hours are slim. Overstaffed. Fun at times but mostly boring atmosphere.  Store is only busy during peak times like summer and Holiday season,other than that is almost a ghost town. Pay is better than most retail stores and does offer benefits. Not unbearable."
good,Sueldo acorde a metas pero la convivencia con los demás trabajadores es difícil y  afecta emocionalmente.
good,It's a running cult of friends looking to advance friends who will more than likely stay in the same location for life. If you cannot impress one person and do deeds for them it probably won't be for you.
good,"Let's get the great stuff about working at Nike (or at least the Nike Factory Store I worked at) out of the way. The dress code is casual/athletic fit, the atmosphere with employees is fun, certain managers were really good at their job, and the discounts were great."
good,Long hours. Not enough hours a week. No free lunch. Short breaks. Long hours. Unprofessional managers and supervisors. Coworkers are upset most of the time.
good,If you are a contractor it is not a good deal. Severely underpaid. No access to any employee amenities. Not treated very well at all. The work can be demanding.
good,Nike is not the best company to work for in sales they don’t treat you well the management is awful but the discount is nice. They don’t like you taking vacation so they will schedule you on the days that you scheduled off.
good,On a typical day I worked stockroom we brought the product in the building getting it ready for the product team to place it on the sales floor. Management in the locatin I was at was unfair.
good,ho imparato un nuovo lavoro da zero e mi sono trovata in un ambiente di mobbing nonostante gli sforzi
good,All management needed a bit of an upgrade but overall a good company to work for. Coworkers were all friendly and knowledgeable on products and customer service
good,"good colleagues poor management. "
good,The managers were okay and too caught up with drama but discounts were good and it was a fun environment to work in. The people were either hit or miss.
good,"Would not recommend this company until it improves on new hire treatment as well as the way they treat people coming in as temporary workers. "
good,doordat je onder een interimcontract werkt ben je meer thuis dan aan het werk. in de zomervakantie mag je helemaal niet werken zodat ze goedkope jobstudenten kunnen laten werken.
good,Same work daily. Very routine though very demanding physically. Did not receive my last pay cheque as they claimed i did not work. Some time they let you off work early so you would not receive full time pay.
good,"They ask you to keep your head down and plow through work without providing you the things you need to do your job well. The management is mostly unhelpful, and then takes credit for game-changing innovations that you work hard to produce. Meanwhile they won't hire you full-time and give you benefits, despite providing an essential service to the company. Twice I got passed over for much less qualified, less experienced people for FT roles with job descriptions matching the one I was in at the time."
good,"while it was fun to work there, there was no way to advance in the company unless you kissed up to a manager no matter if you were good at your job or not, but then again management was not any better than us so that could be why."
good,"The North Bend store is understaffed and I was not taught enough to take the next step in my career. The first manager did not come from Nike and he had no experience leading a store that big, now there is a new manager.  At least she has Nike experience, so that is already a better start."
good,It's okay if you have this as a second job or just needing it for extra money. Management is okay and the pay is okay but it's extremely stressful on weekends and holidays.
good,"Working at Nike was not always bad. When I first started working there in 2014, the managers were cool and strict at the same time. They made you feel comfortable about going to them about anything, good or bad. Now if something goes wrong wheather it’s your fault or not you get a corrective action and managers never take responsibility."
good,"If you want to advance, you have to suck up a lot! If you just come to your job and do your work, you really won’t get noticed, only if you’re buddy buddy with your bosses."
good,"Most do not work any longer than eight months to three years. I would suggest working here when you are in high school and you want a little extra cash or when you are on summer vacation from college. Some managers are nice and respectable as well as some of the employees, but you will often find a stinking barrel of the bunch. However, they do have their moments of being lenient and a fun work environment."
good,"goal driven company where you learn new things everyday most important is going the extra mile for the clients, management structure very professional and disciplined. working environment it has to be one of the best things to help one wake up in the morning and look forward to joining a very enthusiastic team."
good,"La empresa ofrece mucho cómo marca, pero no cuida al empleado, trabajan en una tienda al rededor de 24 personas y pagan muy poco para ser la empresa que es."
good,"Process clothing for sale. Unload trucks, perform daily audits. Management was all about themselves. Low level managers thought they were Gods at times. Work there if you to make new friends and receive clothing discounts. Don't work there for the pay."
good,It is a fun work environment but the connection between the managers and workers is not at the level it should be. I like the way that people have opportunities to succeed but not many opportunities to move up in the company.
good,"•	Consulted with patrons and answered any questions they had concerning products, merchandise or company promotions"
good,"A typical day at work required intense customer service and knowledge of the company and product. I learned a lot about footwear and apparel, also many times the work culture was very fun and relaxed as well as productive depending upon the management."
good,"Overworked and underpaid. Managers focus is more on the money coming in and not proper training or insight to the strengths and weaknesses of employees. A lot of learning was done on the fly and you just have to go with the flow. Hours are scarce and you are expected to work all hours even if you have limited availability. Not a horrible experience, a perfect first job for many students and younger adults."
good,"I have worked at Nike as both a black badge (FTE) and a white badge (ETW).  In both cases I had the worst managers of my career.  No coaching, no leadership qualities at all.  The burden is on you to survive.  Meetings from 7-6, and catered lunch meetings which are unproductive, as everyone has phones and laptops out trying to eke out some degree of productivity in their day.  Working here is also like a soap opera - everything moves so slowly, you can leave and come back 3 years later and the same issues and projects are happening.  Not a good place for someone that wants to be an individual contributor.   Consensus for everything.  Also very clicky.  Good luck with any work-life balance, as you are expected to be in all those wonderful meetings.  Also the constant reorgs promote a feeling of uncertainty."
good,Empresa com ótimos salários e descontos em produtos mas não dá a oportunidade de promoção
good,"not a long term career choice for me personally. Managers are easy to work with. a lot of overtime is offered. good work environment , the co workers are easy to work with"
good,"Very poor management. Even POORER salary. You are seriously working in a sweat shop. Ever since the newer managers, everything went downhill. It used to be a  great place to work."
good,"this is a great workplace environment. passionate workers and employees. Great benefits, fun and family orentated. more than enough hours to spend with your family."
good,This company taught me to be the person I am today.  Without Nike I would not have been able to grow and change and be able to move to Columbia Sportswear.
good,It's a decent environment with the right team and management. But the managers there are basically incompetent so it's kinda chaotic sometimes. Otherwise is a cool place.
good,"pros: great co-workers, positive environment, team oriented, chill weekends, discounts on products."
good,"Muy positiva respecto a la empresa, el comercio es algo que me gusta pero se me hizo duro el tema de horarios."
good,"Hard work, understaffed, my coworkers were awesome and team players, management never there only for taking care of issues. The hardest part of the job was no recognition. A typical day at work was total confusion little communication amongst shifts and no organization.,"
good,"A typical day at Nike would be a morning huddle, started by one of our Nike cheers. Talk about the stores goal for the day, review on rules, and expectations. Working on keeping the sales floor clean and presentable for easy shopping access to our customers. Changing the displays to promote our outfit of the week. Management on a daily basis is walking around calling athletes to help customers when we're short staffed, theyre constantly making up new rules, they're unprofessional and rude. The hardest part of the day is especially when the store has a sale, not enough athletes on the schedule and everyone is trying to help everyone at once. The most enjoyable part of the day are our morning huddles, we all get together and just have fun with the cheer."
good,Typical work day includes helping consumers and finding product and taking phone calls and Online orders. Cleaning Bathrooms taking out trash.
good,"Nike is a great company to work for, the are innovative in regards to product and research. They're great with community outreach programs, I love how they help children in need and allow the employees to participate in these programs and initiatives. I just wish they'd show more respect to those with seniority and allow them opportunities to progress. I know that favoritism is everywhere but there is running rampant. What i do love most about my time being at Nike is meeting all the different groups of customers who travel from all over the world and how they are wowed and amazed but the store itself, it brings pride and joy to know and say yeah I work here I'm part of this."
good,"I got hired through Adecco so I can only give a review based on my experience through Adecco. The leadership is horrible. No one seems to know what their job is but they have significant job titles. They are not compassionate about people's personal lives or difficulties. They tend to run out work frequently but have employees stand around for four hours waiting for work. They work you 7-days a week and gives employees one weekend off at the end of each month. Management is inconsistent, unorganized, lazy and unfair."
good,"Nike Taxi is owned by NorthWest Navigators,  who contracts a private driving service for the Nike World Headquarters in Beaverton, OR.  the pay rate they will tell you is 13.00 with no over time, as a fair warning th epay rate is actually 9.25 an hour plus a bonus that is averaged out with the hours you worked to get 13.00 if you work at the side of campus for nike golf you will be lucky to get more than 1 break a day and that one break is lunch which is a half hour."
good,Nike is a growing brand and the company employees thousands of people in the Memphis and surrounding areas. At this location I was the forklift operator for shipping. The position was a good position and I was required to load the trucks with finished freight but the majority of the time the supervisors had me hand loading the trucks with the rest of the staff while they operated the equipment. That was a major part in why I seeked other employment.
good,"Great place to work dont get me wrong, but my store the managers are poorly trained and micro manage almost every employee."
good,"The Nike place is like a high school. Management doesn't listen to the needs of the staff. Overall, if Nike had good listeners, a lot of product will be sent out and a lot of things would be organized."
good,"Its a great place for some people - careers are mapped and growth is swift.  Unfortunately if you are not on that list, upward movement is very limited."
good,"Create a win-win resolutions for the online consumer concerns over various product lines. I learned to lead by example, ensuring every customer receives a positive brand experience. Management would would work with their individuals teams to help teach them new product launches and Nike polices. Co-workers are great people to work with. Great team environment. The best thing about working for nike was the helping the customers."
good,We had to pick orders with head sets and scan guns which was fun cause it was like taking costumers orders foreal but i liked it because it was something else i learned to work with and advance with.
good,Learned to work as a team player. Got along with all my co-workers.
good,A lot of the jobs were rush jobs but there was always someone to help you out to get the job done
good,"This company is hard to work for if you have a family. Management is unforgiving, even though the co-workers are great."
good,Pay is rather minimal and they work you as close as they can to 40 hrs without saying you're a full time employee and paying you like one. They value numbers (performance metrics) over work ethic
good,I have no comment about my employment at Nike.  Nike is one of the biggest athletic apparel companies in the world.  It was interesting to experience their practices/procedures.
good,The discount was 30% which isn't bad.Tthe job was not extremely challenging. Managers always seemed overworked and annoyed. Got a raise and it was for fifteen cents after working for three months. Most don't get a raise until after a year.
good,"Ottima esperienza dal punto di vista formativo, ottimo team, pessimo manager e direttive aziendali."
good,The management was inconsistent and needs some professional help. It was a fun environment to work as far as the other employees and very fast paced. I would suggest working there only as a part-time.
good,Fun place to work  Casual and laid back  Nothing else to say about the company.  I was working as a contractor and did not receive any additional benefits
good,Didn't like the hours or the time I had to be at work didn't care for the supervisor he would tell you that you would be doing one job and he would have you doing another job all together.
good,Working here was fine while I in college because customer service skills can help you in any job. I really enjoy using the employee discount toward the products that I like.
good,Its a college job nice working hours busy during later seasons light in the summer. Management cold use some work there is a lack of communication depending on location. Its not a work a full time position unless your trying to be a manager or above.
good,"Very fun work environment. The company has various ways of keeping employees engaged such as a team cheer at the start of each shift and a ""coach in"" to keep employees informed about what is going on that day."
good,When I applied for the picker position  I was only schedule to work 5 days a week but was mandatory overtime.  And was only off one day month . I really felt like I was overworked .
good,"typical retail job, nothing to expect other than a discount .  retail jobs consists of interacting with customers al day and very rapid and energetic enviroments"
good,"Working at Nike was a good starting point. Very minimal room for growth internally and very mediocre pay. However, the atmosphere provided for good teamwork and positivity."
good,Not a great work life balance for a part-time job. I would not look to get a job at a Nike store again. Do not agree with the ways they do things at the store I worked at.
good,Management does't know what they are doing. Extremely picky with which policies they like to enforce and who they like to enforce them with. Scheduling is a complete mess so if you are fine with driving 15+ km and wasting gas out to this mall in the middle of no where for a 4 hour shift then this is the place for you.
good,"Great company, great product. A typical day was split into half working the floor and half working on office stuff considering I made the schedule. Much of the day was spent driving business results through conversion and customer service."
good,"The management are very bias to their favorites and if your face doesn't fit then you wont get very far."
good,Nike is a good job. Has great benefits and great discounts also good work schedule just wish would pay better. 12 hour shifts is hard but worth it because you get 4 and 3 days off
good,"Nike is huge. So you better like huge."
good,"i dont really have a review for the company, they could treat you alot better then they do but choose not too , they have you doing multiple job functions but are only paying you for one"
good,Management is okay but can be a little petty. Hours are flexible they work really well with school schedules. The people and environment are fun and a good place.
good,Nike is understaffed and sometimes schedules outside of your availability. The company has gone through a lot of manager changes within the past year. They're a good company just minor setbacks. They have some good managers and them some who are just not effective. They also have some employees who are a waste to the company.
good,"I prefer a more fast paced and productive environment. I pretty much did what I did in the military. I handled packages, delivered mail, and did product placement for high management."
good,Its not a long term job and supervisors where unproffesional.It too laid back and I need a 40 hours a week.Im still bere because Im a student and its around the corner from my house
good,"Just Do It.  Nike follows that slogan fairly closely.  You have to learn how to do it the ""Nike way"".  They don't really appreciate new ideas from prior experience."
good,In NIKE i have learned how t do best customer service. I had a very good experience working with NIKE. Now I want make a growth in my future that is why I am looking for another JOB.
good,I was younger when I work at Nike through temp service. So I wasn't seeking full-time employment. Over all it was good for me at the time. The hours..
good,"1) The managers only care about themselves and their bonuses."
good,"the customers were horrible i've never seen such terrible people. management was good."
good,very unorganized and was not good at communicating the managment only spoke among each other and never included the employees in what was the goals for the day
good,"The most enjoyable part of the job are the athletes. They make this brand what it is and they bring so much to the table.  "
good,"Nike is a great place to work if you aren't looking to make it into a career. The people you work with are great, but poor managing staff. Also potentially difficult to get off unless you stay on top of it."
good,I am a sales man in a nike store in a mall i sell shoes apparels nike products. i also making reports and doing monthly and yearly inventory. we have just 1 goal to hit our qoutas and get a big sales in the company
good,veel richtlijnen waar in praktijk niet veel van terecht komt
good,"Overall the job was good, but the management and nike as a whole are very very strict and everything must be done EXACTLY how its said to be done and must be done as fast as possible. Corporate also likes to hand down unrealistic goals every week that never get met and then all the blame falls on the employees and never management. Also because its nike and i live in a bad area there was loads of stealing that went on everyday"
good,Loved working with my teammates and had a great experience with them. The management is terrible. Never on the same page and always made an excuse rather than apologizing when they were wrong.
good,"Nike, was actually a good environment to work. Some management are very fair some are very unfair, they take advantage of there authority. Enjoyable part of this job is where they collaborate with others, events like run for cancer or events like helping kids."
good,"Bad work environment!"
good,I was excited at first and enjoyed my job. Then we had new management and it made the moral go down.I just did not like the favortism and not being paid accordingly.
good,"Adecco leads and supervisors are rude and always have attitudes. Poor pay, good lunch. Roaches in the break rooms. Mayhem in the parking lot going and leaving work."
good,"The management team at Nike Factory stores is atrocious and very out of touch with the people they employ. There are a few managers that are not this way, but the majority of them are. "
good,"My first year and a half at the Nike Company Store was awesome. Lots of growth and challenging opportunities were given to me. Recently, we've had new senior management which lowered the quality of life at work pretty substantially. With their new vision of retail, it is now uncommon or non existent in terms of promoting within. It has been difficult to do the work of multiple people/management without the rewards, compensation, or opportunity for promotion."
good,I left because I was overworked. Required to be available during hoidays and PTO. Managers kept track of the time I was there and the time I was online.
good,con los compañeros buena relacion.bonito de desempeñar el trabajo.
good,Management needs to change for the better of the store. Work is amazing but the management need to stop showing favorites with different athletes and treat all equally.
good,"Good management"
good,typical days was mostly just walking around greeting guests trying to help their needs. lots of down time led to goofing off. no real sense of  communication and recognition of employees doing good effort. kept trying to have employees use there paychecks on new products in the store
good,"Non ottimale gestione dei negozi da parte dell'azienda."
good,typical day at work was clocking into work not knowing when your shift would end. some days were slow and would result in employees being sent home early and other days were long. management however I never really had a problem with. hardest part of job was walking and the hours. enjoyable was my coworkers at the time.
good,"Não tenho nenhuma reclamação a fazer sobre a Empresa Nike, mas ficaria feliz se houvesse mais benefícios para jovens aprendizes."
good,"Nike is een gigantisch bedrijf en dat merk je zowel aan de personeel leden als aan de werkgevers en coachen."
good,"1.Target done on month end position."
good,"I liked working a nike there was never a down time, so much to do team cheers it was a fun place to work. I got to learn more about the company. Why items where made the way they were. There was never a hard moment I would say. The management there were a lot of managers that were cool and some not  as cool."
good,"its a ok job to be at, if your young and starting out. Doesnt fill like you can be comfortable in placement there. Other then that it could pay more"
good,"Its really Nice to work with Nike but I want to switch the job for my future growth. I learned so many thing , I am doing every thing in my my store ."
good,It was okay. Nothing to do but Greet customers my co-workers made it all the more fun.
good,"This job pays very little and the management was terrible. However, the job taught me to be independent and my co-workers were very helpful."
good,Nike was a nice place to work. The hours of were great the people were nice. However it was through a temp service with Ranstad. Work for 6 months and laid off for 6 months.
good,Number hungry but fun atmosphere. Bad management. Runs on Temp agencies. Awesome co workers.
good,"Nike has a strong culture which attracts true lovers of the brand, but their management could use some training and development."
good,"empresa nao se preocupa com os funcionários,só desanima cada vez mais todos,por causa de algumas atitudes"
good,"* Unloading trucks and doing back stock."
good,"Fun place to work, but it wasn't a placeI wantedto be at for too long"
good,A day at Nike was very interesting. I learned how to work almost every department there. The management could have been more organized. The co-workers sometimes don't get treated fairly because of no chance to grow with the company after your 90 day probation period. The hardest part about the job was having to be able to keep you production at an 85% even on slow days without hardly no work to do. The most enjoyable part of the job was that we had a 45 minute lunch.
good,Easy job. Lots of young people that work for Nike. Between 21-25. Dress code is nice and comfortable. Pay is horrible for such an established company. Hours are low & really not worth the commuteif you live far. Management are nice and easy going.
good,Didn't learn too much from the site.  Accidents happpened frequently. Low Salary for contract emplyee. Possibly being fired for no resaon due to the unsteady customer demands. Employee leave whenever they find a better place to work.
good,"Fun environment,inclusive of all employees, and team overall team oriented.  Little to no flexibility with scheduling and hours.  Nearly no room for advancement."
good,Good luck getting promoted for merit. Nike promotes based on longevity and who you know. 100%. Gotta be crowned internally to make any advancement. You are whatever your job title says you are.
good,While at Nike you would learn multiple people skills due to being involved with customers aging from Grandparents to toddlers. The co-workers that you'd work with were also super friendly and nice
good,Having worked there for a year I cannot tell you what I have done as days just merge together with zero variety. Work is extremely mundane which isn't helped by the joys being sucked away by the management. Managers are poorly organised and I'm sure logic isn't within their ability or vocabulary. Favouritism is apparent from the start which is extremely unprofessional. They have many rules for us staff members but cannot follow them themselves.
good,"Good place to work starting out. "
good,The most enjoyable part of this job was to help the customers find what they where looking for and something they will love to wear. I loved to see the smile on there face once i find that item for them.
good,"I had fun working at Nike, but felt they were not using my full potential .  Also, they were not giving me enough hours for what I was looking for.  I wanted more than what I was given."
good,"Des de fuera todo parece muy bonito, la casa, la marca, el estilo... pero a la hora de la verdad, e cuanto a humanidad se refiere, són una multinacional mas a la que les da igual el trato humano  personal, solo miran la persona y el dinero."
good,"I loved my co-workers there, but the managers were terrible and didn't promote in house advancement. Even though during the hiring process they say that they do."
good,"While there are some really fantastic people who work at Nike, there are many more who are not qualified to be in management.  Bad decisions or indecision has created an undesirable culture shift."
good,"Full of young adults, you have to like approaching and engaging with people all day long or this won’t be for you. Management isn’t the best with communicating but good place to work."
good,"I cant think of a solid review right now but even if you move up to a lead (which takes time) maybe even a year or more, you remain on the same pay scale as those who have been working there a week. If I am even thinking about Nike as a career I need more incentives to stay other than the discount."
good,"Didn't get a full 40 hrs per week, was sent home early, managers sloppy  unorganized, food good, not enough pay.hot humid or freezing There were some fun days not enough rewards and bonuses."
good,"Nike overall is a great company, however the location I worked at was very unorganized and the management team was not the nicest (not only to the employees but as well as the customers). Personally, I enjoy a work space where I don’t need to feel responsible for other people’s responsibilities especially when It comes to a high position."
good,"It's an okay job if you're going to school and must be good with interacting with different cultural people. I would recommend to students who are beginning to work, little hours and pay."
good,Management was not willing to make adjustments for shifts I couldn't work for family reasons. That's ultimately why I was forced to quit. They also showed favoritism in some aspects.
good,"Enjoyed the position, liked the free clothes and that was about it. I really don't have too much more to say, but the job was fine, I worked there while going to school"
good,"I lived in state when Nike called me about a new position.  I told them that I was not accepting contact positions.  The promised that this was a three month contract to hire and then they will convert to perm.  I paid for the move myself.  They said that I would get reimbursed.  It is now one year later and I am still a contract employee, I have been asked to do more than my position, I was asked by my manager to create a presentation to justify continuing to budget the team, etc... I have had enough!"
good,"Unlike some of my coworkers this was my first experience working for NIke. I joined when 24-7 intouch first received the contract with Nike after their nightmarish contract with Concentrix(I worked for Amazon there so I know how much of a mess that place can be) "
good,"Overall, a good experience, but pretty intense work environment. Company is so big it is challenging to navigate a career path. The sport culture is amazing, but it is a demanding work environment."
good,"Management for the most part was terrible, but pretty sure majority of them have been fired by now. You meet cool people and the job can be fun sometimes, but don't expect any career advancement."
good,Management lacked in areas that would improve moral and efficiency of store. But the coworkers were nice and created a good environment. Retail is retail so the upside of working there is 1. its Nike 2. you can have a good time working there. Downside the management needs a little help to get things up to par. But they were very friendly and were nice overall to work with.
good,"Not sure about their corporate culture, but their facilities are not as forward thinking as the company's brand would have you think. Advanced professional skills are not as valued."
good,Things were well at first but new management came in and things got unorganized and people in shipping and receiving recieved no credit or reward for most of the hard work we did.
good,es una gran marca con mucha variedad y calidad en su mercancia
good,"Great place to work if you are passionate about the brand or industry in any way. Many perks if you are a full time hire. Not so much if you are a contractor. Work culture tests your patience constantly. Politics are always getting in the way of productivity. I experienced minimal investment in employee development. More meetings than time given to produce on average. That being said this is not a reflection of the company as a whole , rather a summarization of limited experience within a small team."
good,"A typical work day at Nike Sawgrass involves nearly a hundred or more customers interactions, usually in a variety of languages. Most interactions will require product as well as stock knowledge with the occasional interaction for a complaint or custommer grievance. Working at Nike Sawgrass is a great opportunity for learning how to deal with high stress, face paced situations with a light emphasis on multi-tasking.  While management, leave much to be desired, workplace culture among employees is typically high on morale and comradery. The hardest part of this job would be the coupling of the great amount of work required and the inkling that job security could be at risk for unwillingness to stay beyond scheduled work hours. While the best part of this job would easily be the aforementioned comradery among employees, the great discounts and flexible scheduling."
good,The days were stressful and poorly managed. Trying to scramble together packaged onto a pallet and get it on one of several trucks leaving that day with millions of dollars worth of merchandise is not an easy job. Especially for 6 people.
good,"Management promote the better talker in interviews, understandably but even when in the company and working up your work ethic means slim to none. Favoritism left and right. Bad management. Good lunch time (an hour) underappreciated. Scolded when buying shoes. KISSIMMEE CLEARENCE STORE. Good company, bad store."
good,"The leads for Adecco at Nike treat you like children. They tell you when you can go to the bathroom, when you can clock out and when it's time to go to lunch. When it's time to come back from break they haunt you down."
good,"Had bad management , low pay , very little to no advancement opportunities, flexible schedules! Good job for high school or college kids! didn’t like the fact they had assigned zones because some employees arent knowledgeable in other areas"
good,"Managers dont want to focus on customers, would rather focus on signing people up than personal conversations and getting to know consumers. They want better numbers rather than a good experience"
good,"i would reccomend you actually work for nike, not for their temp agency. theres no benefit for working for them, theres no pto or black badge real benefits"
good,"Société Américaine"
good,"A empresa tem um ambiente muito bom, apesar do alto colume de trabalho devido a constantes reduções de seus quadros."
good,"Whenever I first started at Nike it was a fun place to work at, but then things started to change and our hours began to get cut and my checks were horrible because of this. Eventually the temps were laid off and only a few of us remained and had to work extra hard. We were told after 3-6 months we could become full-time, but that option was taken away from us."
good,"Learned the technology of nike products, poor management structure."
good,I worked here in high school so it was a great job for a high school student. I quit once I graduated to get a more professional and higher paying job while going through college.
good,"I spent most of my shifts working on the floor or in the stockroom. I learned a great deal about customer service, management, merchandising, and sales. I like the majority of my coworkers who were of all ages and backgrounds. It was a fairly relaxed environment but when there were tasks to be completed or heavy traffic, the environment quickly became stressful and fast-paced.  I was not pleased with the head manager at the store I was working at. I do not think he had the necessary leadership skills to be a successful manager."
good,"I applied to the Nike Clearance Store in Williamsburg, IA as a secondary part-time job. They didn't really respect the availability I gave them, as they would schedule me on says I said I was unavailable because of my other job or had personal plans such as family events or vacations. There were 7 managers there during my time, 3 of them were great! However, there was always communication issues amongst the professional staff affecting communications with the part-time staffers; they were hardly on the same page about things and some would take it out on the part-time staff because we were doing things incorrectly (even though that is what/how one of the other managers wanted it done). I enjoyed the employee discount I received, but having a college degree I felt I should have been given more responsibilities, such as maybe a more important job and pay increase, than the other workers who were in high school or still attending college. I expressed this concern to professional staff and never received any kind of follow up about it. Overall, not a bad part-time job but could've been run better."
good,"I enjoy working at NIKE because I enjoy retail. I do NOT think it is a career position for growing individuals. I currently work here part time and the discounts are great."
good,Nike I worked for brief period and it was a mix experience. It was good and it was bad but overall it gives me opportunity to gain experience that  helped me a lot in future.
good,It is extremely hard to advance in this company. management  was okay but not that great. awesome discounts an fast paced environment. Needs more opportunities to advance and also easier ways to speak with customers because majority of customers in Vegas don't speak English
good,"I have nothing to say, it was a job, what more could I expect. Management needs to be reevaluated, it wasn't a bad experience, I took a lot from is, as I do with any job."
good,"Learned a lot at Nike and I loved the environment which was fun, team based. Nike Specialist were very helpful and felt I could rely most on them. Learned about MAD usage however disappointed Athletes didnt get commission or compensation for NIKE sign-ups. Easiest thing is talking to people, saying hello and helping others and filling the floor, hardest task is to stay aware of moves that need to be made when there is no stock for a shoe or apparel according to its suggested Mapping Chart or Knowing what to pull when there are no more hash shoes available for the wall. Overall, easy and fun job. Just desired more Pay Compensation."
good,"The company promotes some people based on their friendships and not on their qualifications.  Some training is offered while on the job, new systems processes, PLC training, and others."
good,"the environment was great as far as teams working together, the facility is beautiful however they tell you that they love to promote from within, but after you have mastered your role and try to apply for something else they will hold you back and not approve your transfer for their own selfish reasons. They know that if you leave their team, they don't want to have to fill your position. The Office positions are so laid back, that most people that are from the warehouse operations side, they are content and look at new people as a threat to them and try to make it hard for them to stay or leave. The company itself is great, however, the people make the job unbearable."
good,"The standout of this company is they make sure they do their quaterly meetings for their employees, anything from going to a nice pub to bowling, golf, it all depends on the time of year."
good,Nike Detroit suffers from poor management which creates a sometimes chaotic environment for employees.  There is also little flexibility for employees who are not favorites of management.
good,"This position is the easiest job function in the building which requires correcting packages that reject before handing to shipping. If package label are correct then nothing rejects and on good days only 1 will reject for about every 100 packages. I'm in a good spot in the company as work assignment , however many around me are working physically hard."
good,"My experience with interviewing and employment at Nike is neutral. They are a constantly evolving company. As such, there is constant change. I was laid off after 3 years."
good,"Started working here almost 3 years ago and took 2 years to get offered a full time position, the discount is awesome. Management can be a pain to deal with sometimes, a lot of pressure to perform well and definitely dont get paid good enough for all the hard work we have to do."
good,If you like to stay super busy this is he job for you! The management was not very good and it tended to be very cliquei and filled with drama. The discount was good and there was an occasional nice experience.
good,"Une expérience qui avait l’air très prometteuse au début avec de petite possibilité d’evolution, mais le management souvent confié à des personnes puériles et condescendantes plus l’ambiance sectaire ont eu raison de l’efficacité commercial de cette boutique."
good,A good job. The facility was excellent and the management and staff were very professional. Had not the opportunity for advancement been so low I would probably still be there.
good,It was always nice with the discount and work wasn't terrible. But there is such double standard between managers and ther regular workers.  Its like highschool again but it was a fun place
good,It was not the best work experience for me. the pay was descent but the work environment and managers were horrible. I worked at the Nike-Shelby . You have to be willing to work hours that do not necessarily create good health .
good,My time working here was DRAMA! There was a lot of he said she said. Managers would act like they would do something about the situations but no action was ever really taken. Managers played favoritisim. You didn’t advance in the company unless you were one of the favorites of one of the managers. The best thing about working here is the discount and you can use your discount on top of promotions. Also you get an hour lunch.
good,"Fast paced."
good,"Decent place to work for, yet difficult people to work with in higher management. through different agencies contracted to them, multiple injuires had occured through failure of  negligence. Management had no people skills when talking amongst employees that were in violation of safety."
good,Its Nike. You are constantly surrounded by athletics and fashion. But everyone there thinks they should be running the place. They make you work for years without an opportunity to advance your career.
good,"Nike doesn't pay employees what they are worth. Their salary does not match the market. Nike pays 3-7 dollars less than other retailers (adidas, under armor, footlocker, etc) and asks for 15x more work."
good,"Nike étant une entreprise americaine, son fonctionnement est basée sur un esprit jeune et dynamique. Nike est comme une montre, en mouvement perpetuelle et ce mécanisme ne s'arrêtera pas pour vous."
good,I learned that this job just isn't for me. It is too far from where I stay. The management is decent it changes every month or so. I have seen the whole entire store change employee wise in the last year. There isn't too much culture at the job.
good,"lavoro di team, analisi e pianificazione attività giornaliere, incontri con clienti e condivisione informazioni con manager. continuo atteggiamento proattivo volto al raggiungimento di obiettivi e migliori risultati per crescita personale e dell'azienda."
good,Retail Store Worked many hours for little pay. I had to travel about 45 minutes to and from work sometimes more with traffic. Worked a lot of hours and felt I did not get a good balance between work and personal life.
good,Working at the retail level is very fun and a great way to learn/practice some new skills. Management is not the most efficient and often makes poor decisions. The employees are quite enjoyable and easy to get a long with for the most part.
good,I like working here but the money is bad and you cant live off off 12.20 an hour. I like that its like a team working there. I get along with everyone there for the most part.
good,"Com a cultura americana, empresa extremamente focada em resultados e com inúmeros processos e treinamentos. Aprendi que você precisa se virar para obter o conhecimento e dar conta dos resultados."
good,It is a great company but the management of the store make it so you feel extremely stressed for problems that shouldn't concern a part time employee.
good,Nike pakistan is not a company outlet. But very good management. 12 hours duty and I learned there a lot. How to talk with customers. This is my first professional step.
good,"This place over all is ok to work at. Fast paced, high volume call center. Management is not so great, but other staff is pretty cool. Recommended for short term."
good,its a okay job with decent benefits but I would not stay to long. its a fast pace environment and if you like that you will do well in this environment. a small chance to be promoted and easily get fired
good,"I learned so much at Nike I loved the managers mostly everyone was nice An willing to help you learn An become more within the weaehouse ."
good,"It is challenging fun environment. Meet new people work well with others "
good,"I mean its Nike so the perks are great.  If this is somewhere you want to build your life than Nike isnt for you.  They dont stand by grow and development.  There is NO diversity in management, Customer Service is the heart of the company but Sales is treated like the God leaving Customer Service who makes it happen behind"
good,"The store is usually productive, you can find something to do. If your teammates are energetic that always helps. During the week when the store is slow, one must find something random to do."
good,Great company but not much room for growth. They expect you to hold a position for a specific time in which they decide when you are ready to move forward with career.
good,"At the Boston location culture is very relaxed. Management in 2016-17 is very ambiguous and ""clicky"". The best positions are as a Director or Manager in Operations/Finance. I say this from experience and generally folks here are nice. IT is built of DTC group and Network-Infrastructure groups. The Europe side of business is very difficult, so if you have to deal with them in your day-to-day, strap on your seat belt. Internal processes are current ""all over the place"" with a lot of employees recently leaving and taking great responsibility with them. Nike runs the show and Converse begs for compromise. Contingent (ETW) workers out number the permanent (FTE) employees - so political games are prevalent in most departments. I worked between a Manager and Director level and buy-in from Sr. level Analyst was very challenging. The commute stinks whether your from North/South shores or West of Boston. Converse does offer discount parking ($18 per day covered) across the street......get there at least 1hr early....Best of Luck and enjoy the free Barista!"
good,"You get good benefits at the expense of over-dramatic managers who mostly don't listen to the needs of the employee. There is a lot of favoritism in management which leads to the wrong people being sacked."
good,"Great medical benefits, and other benefits. Management is used to doing things under the table, and often not in accordance with legality. Poorly organized as a company."
good,"Great for it's benefits, come on now it's Nike. Also if you're young this is the place for you. But the management is all about favoritism, ALOT. Just go to work and do what you gotta do that's it, don't gossip with people and don't get into things you know you're not suppose to. The Nike I worked at is well known for that! The interview was pretty cool and friendly, usually the people you group interview with are the people you're gonna stick along with. If you're at a Nike town, the pay isn't really worth it. I use to tell myself that i didn't care cuz I loved and collect sneakers so much, but after awhile, you're like wow."
good,"co-workers were nice "
good,"Good experience."
good,Your coworkers are what keep you going. Plus the 40% discount on merchandise is pretty nice. Hard to move up in the company at this location.
good,"Fortissima espansione fatturato e utile, grandi progetti ottenuti con la massima velocità, poca attenzione per la risorsa umana, continue riorganizzazioni con licenziamenti ed alto turnover"
good,I enjoyed working for Nike. i enjoyed learning about the new products and more about how to live a healthier lifestyle. The management at Nike was something that needed improvement but overall the company was exciting to work for.
good,"El ambiente de trabajo no es muy bueno por que exiten prioridades por algunas personas que por otras osea que no hay igualdad hay preferencias dentro de ella, es por ello que el ambiente se siente muy tenso. por mi parte nunca tube problemas con mis jefes."
good,"- début de la journée de travail à 9h45 qui débute par une mini réunion"
good,"I don't have all bad things to say about Nike but they do not care about the wearhouse workers that they have in place below management. Not only do they hire mangers who do not know the business but they rely solely on the team leads/ coordinators and recon team to do all the work including their responsibilites. If a subordinate was out for the day the manager would not know how to run that position.They DO NOT promote from within on a regular basis. I was fortunate enough to advance within the third year that I was there but as far as advancing to the management team they would rather hire someone out of town/off the street to manage. Meanwhile the manager's subordinates carry them because they did not come up in the ranks therefor they do not know how the operation works. The PAY SUUUUUUUUCKS they barely start you off with a standard rate of living above the poverty rate ($10.45 per hour). Lets put it this way if you started working there in 1980 you still will only be making about 13-14 bucks an hour by the time you reach your 30 year mark. If you don't have a second income coming in you WILL NOT SURVIVE. The bonuses you get are what you should have been getting in the first first place and you are still only making under 30,000 a year in a just past entry level (v-band) position. Replacement of missing co-workers needed hardly ever happens. If someone quits or leaves in your area they will not be replaced and you are stuck with taking up their responsibilites!! When you get down to two or more people leaving and you keep getting more responsibilites but your pay remains"
good,"Cashier/Training Support Staff"
good,"Everyday I deal with nike tennis shoes rather it's cleaning, repacking, inspection, Shipping, etc."
good,"Typical day at work for me constitutes coming in at my scheduled time, generally working in shipping and receiving, pulling a product refill, unloading a freight truck, processing freight, and back stocking freight.  Other days I'm on the sales floor.  I've learned the shipping and receiving process, I've learned how to look at goals for not only myself, but our team and work together to achieve them."
good,"a typical day at work would be to always greet customers. Help on the floor where needed. Stay attentive on the cash registers, nike never like to have long lines, we always want our customer to have a quick and easy checkout. Everytime you went to work you learned something new about nike."
good,"Great place to work before new management changes. If you're looking for a job while attending school it is a great opportunity, otherwise, look somewhere else!"
good,"Nike was a very busy warehouse. We had a great time working hard, meeting new people and cross training in different departments."
good,I learned that you must always treat people with respect and the management did not do that at all but overall it was an ok experience for me.
good,We serviced all corporate employees along with guest that came in town. I learned a great deal of the rich history Nike Inc. has. Best part of my job was being able to train and teach along with planning and executing new promotions.
good,"This job is a very basic entry level retail job, focusing mainly on cleanliness of the store. Employees that have worked there a while tend to be mostly at the register while everyone else cleans the store and make sure it is neat for the next customer that comes in. Pay and advancement are very minimal."
good,"Workplace culture was fun but fast paced, everything working there is themed as if you are an athlete with a lot of product knowledge updates, presentations, promotional commercials shown, and sales reps coming in to teach us more about new product and events going on at Nike to ensure sales associates were well informed and comfortable with the product. There is definitely pressure to make sales and interact with customers to get sales from them."
good,"La journée est rythmée de la manière suivante:"
good,"Nike used to be fun to work at. Not anymore, everyday is worse than the last and nobody even talks about Nike! I used to love working there until they made changes and changes for the worse. I get paid to waste my time."
good,"Nice fun atmosphere, however very demanding work was involved. There were too many bosses and they did not communicate with eachother which caused conflicts."
good,Retail is a whole different type of career. The turnover is extremely high. Nike at the Tanger Outlets is not a best place to work. Management has terrible communication between associates. It is also a very political environment.
good,A typical work day is very fast paced and busy. I work in the tourist area so it can be overwhelming packed most times. Work place culture is amazing there is something for everyone to feel included.
good,"Do you enjoy chaos?  A typical day is feeling stressed out and under appreciated.  "
good,"Depends on your character and personality. Honestly the culture is great in some aspects, it definitely attracts uppety fake people. Such is life but just wasn’t my kind of environment. Management doesn’t care if you die because you aren’t valued in any way."
good,"I didn’t like the fact the company has a lot of favoritism. If you’re not friends with the right group, they will make the easiest job hard for you. I actually love working in warehouses because there’s always work to be done. And you can get good OT, in some cases. Overall I would work there again because I am mature."
good,"During the week work would be fun and laid back as long as you were doing the things you were asked of. I did footwear moves , gave consumers sizes they needed and asked if people were Nike plus members. Management wasn't the greatest there. Rather than teaching you how to grow with the company, they just treated you like a number. There was only one manger that I actually got along with while at work, and he said he hated working there but he couldn't leave. The hardest part of the job is closing at night. People are messy and we stay 2 hours after close just to make sure everything is spotless. The most enjoyable part was my co-workers, we all grew strong friendships."
good,Constantly changing with high turnover. Employees care more than the managers do. It’s cool for discounts on shoes and clothes but how long until the glitz of that fades.
good,I would tell others about the job and recommend that they work there. Nike has great benefits. I enjoy my time there and I'm grateful for the experience they gave me.
good,"Fun place to work. Nike gives employee giveaways twice a year. This is a big plus for employees with kids, as this will help with clothing expenses. There is quite a bit of turnover in management as they put a lot on the management team.."
good,I worked thru Nike for a temp services adecco like was a good job but had poor management .i worked for Nike for 4years   .i loved Nike but the management is poor.
good,"when i started, the training was alright. they did not seem to help out if you felt uncomfortable when starting. almost like they just threw you into the job, expecting you to not need help. the management was also very irresponsible, unprofessional and rude. they would make rude comments about not only the customers but also the employees. never gave clear instructions or reasoning. very unprofessional environment"
good,"There were great co-workers at Nike, though the compensation and willingness to work with individuals on a personal level was an area i thought could be worked on."
good,"working with the perfect team,understanding and we were having great team work together  "
good,I enjoyed my time at Nike but I believe retail overall is a job that requires you to do the utmost for the least amount of benefits and pay. That and the minimal hours you are given per week is not the best work environment.
good,It was a fast paced environment that was constantly changing. I was able to grow at that place of employment and enjoyed my time there. It was very busy most of the time but that allowed us to become accustomed to it.
good,Reminds you of being in Highschool. A lot of drama from the management team on down to the regular employees but you get great discounts in the employee store.
good,Jog job to work  at good people good pay good hours you get benefits And discounts It’s a lot of work and a lot of Walking and picking up totes and pushing carts scanning boxes
good,"£6.95 for a below 18 but is National minimum wage for 18+. Fun and full of young people so good for students etc, very good discount. a little hard to book holidays and have any flexibility in terms of shift rotation or some time off, as mandatory for all staff to work all bank hols etc. Pretty good just got bored after a while."
good,when we first got there we had to get our equipment and go up stairs and clock in and get ready to do our scratches. that helped with the muscles. it was different people who had to leed off with the workouts everyday.
good,"Cultura de trabajo divertida. Management dinámico y profesional"
good,"I enjoyed the beginning of my work experience at Nike, but management were starting to pick favorites as time went on. Management set the rules to follow, but wouldn't follow them for themselves, so I spoke up about it.It was fun interacting with everyone that came into the building. My day to day job consisted of costumer service, remodeling the floor, communicating with the team to provide the best experience for our costumers walking through the doors."
good,"Its alright shame about the managers and rota "
good,Fun work environment . Management wasn't good. Opportunities to move up are extremely slim. Pay raises rarely occur. Great discounts on Nike products.
good,"The work environment at one Nike's leading retail store was a bit stressful because it was busy every day. It was like any retail position where there are inconsistency of schedules and it was required to leave your availability open on weekends. The managers did their best to make work enjoyable but with the amount of foot traffic that was in and out of the store, it was difficult to really do planning, merchandising, forecasting, and supervising the growth of employees all at the same time."
good,"The environment created by management was extremely displeasing. There was a lot of confusion. However, the coworkers I had were great. I learned a lot about myself and how to properly serve customers."
good,"This is a decent company to work for, but for part time workers they dont really help you advance, or strive for success in the company. Their work schedules are not the best."
good,great environment  and employees really have and get knowledge of the product all employees really give that one on one experience with all the customers and also others who do not know
good,"I really enjoyed working at Nike when I did, my reason for leaving was because I was traveling after I finished school.  The coworkers and staff are easy going and there is a lot of room to grow in the company."
good,You work extremely hard at Nike.  It can at times be a fun place to work.  The culture right now is not the Nike I originally began working for and hope for a change.
good,"Poor management, negative work enviornment. Money and benefits is good but the job culture is terrible. This is more of a in and out type of job get your and if you find a better job oppurtunity then take it."
good,In grote lijnen verschilt het per afdeling hoe je werk(dag) eruit ziet. Bij de ene heb je iets meer vrijheid dan de andere. Directe- en je sport collega's zijn vriendelijk. Ik heb de nodige ervaring opgebouwd over de processen in de supply chain en digital marketing. Dat was interessant. Je merkt toch wel dat ze erg afhankelijk zijn van de beslissingen op het hoofdkantoor en tertiaire (externe) partijen. Wat betreft het management is dramatisch. De focus ligt vooral bij hunzelf en je moet net het geluk hebben dat je zelf een manager hebt die je op de sleeptouw kan nemen en beschermt. Daarnaast wordt veel gebruik gemaakt van politieke spelletjes en de gunfactor. Dit was geen beste ervaring. Er wordt meer op dat vlak gekeken dan naar de kwaliteit van de medewerkers.
good,"Nike was a fun workplace because of the employees. Unfortunately, the management at this particular location was not strong. I called out once in my year of working where I was unable to get a shift covered due to a sickness that left me in medical care during my shift, and I was threatened to be terminated. I understand you are at work to do a job, but if we spoke to another employee during downtime while doing our tasks, we would get yelled at. The hours were flexible at first, staying within the range which was on you application, then they were completely disregarded after a couple of months. It was a great place at first, but quickly went downhill."
good,"mucha preferencia, imposible ascender dentro de la misma limitadas oportunidades de mejora y sueldo demasiado bajo"
good,"Although the salary was decent, there were times where you will stand on concrete in one spot performing tedious actions . Ankle braces or other foot support will help. When I was there Nike shoes were not allowed to be worn, but the rules may have changed."
good,a well manged company where a individual will learn a lot. good management team with lots of cooperation and support for a person who is stratrng his or her carrer level
good,"During my time at Nike Inc., meetings were a common thing to have everyday."
good,"for the company to be so successful, you would think that they'd pay employees better. also, a lot of shady things happened with management which left a lot of workers feelings complacent. great company, poor execution on a storefront level."
good,It was a fun place to work most of the time but after a while the new managers came in and didn't know what they were doing. More work was put on my shoulders but I wasn't being compensated for it or advanced in the company. I was given a lot of false promises and after a year or so I got tired of it and looked for employment elsewhere.
good,The role is easy and interesting but management make or breaks a place and the current management at this location is lacking in transparency with the staff.
good,they do not keep people working the often . they always want to make space for others . they cut hours very often . longest person worked for a couple of months
good,Never got any hours or a raise even though they said they were gonna give me one. the hours they do give you or mostly weekends. and they pay is just not worth it at all.
good,"I worked here a few years back, it was a great environment of people working with each other to get the sale to each customer. I would suggest someone work here."
good,This is a place you can really become stuck. If you do not move up within your first year of work here you might as well start applying for new work.This job is a doozie.
good,"Nike is a great brand, that can market like nobody else but that doesn't carry over to the day-to-day for most on the Beaverton campus.  There's currently a culture of yes-men because of the recent layoffs scaring anybody who might have a different opinion from speaking up. "
good,"Nike is a Great Job with tons of upside for Experience and Networking. Also Nike is great with integrating teamwork into its Culture. Nike main issue is the appreciation shown to workers because of the lack of Chemistry between Management and Employees, and the steadily revolving door of managers that comes and goes that change every few months."
good,"Fun, relaxed, collaborative culture. "
good,"Buen Clima laboral, flexibilidad en los horarios y días libres."
good,"Management needs some work. The discounts are great of course. Since Nike is such a big company their workers are disposable, always new people in and out. It's a fun seasonal job with chances to move up."
good,For the last 2 years Nike has been going through a reorg and hard times in the marketplace.  With competition in the market Nike to needs to lead the market not follow.
good,"Kittery Nike wasn't terrible but wasn't great. Discounts were nice but were really the only thing keeping me at the job. Pay was $10.50 but really closer to $9 after taxes from ME. Management didn't help. Maybe a couple of decent managers who led by example, but all the others sat in the back office only to come out and act as though they knew what was happening on the sales floor. Very bossy and don't try and relate with co-workers. The other employees weren't bad to work with. Some were still in highschool which led to immature atttitudes but for the most part co-workers were laid back and on the same page. "
good,This this is one of the easiest jobs I have every had. The shift times are terrible and weird. Management changes very often. The most enjoyable part of the job is meeting new people everyday.
good,"The workplace is very strict. The management was very sub-par. The jobs were easy, but the coordination lacked in several areas. The benefits were the most enjoyable part of the job"
good,Love working at NIKE. There are a few managers that pick favorites and nit pick you over the smallest things. It works best here if you are buddy-buddy with everyone.
good,"Overall,"
good,This place was alright nothing special. Spent a lot of time here. Cool people and stuff like that but no opportunities to advance in the workplace. I like.
good,"Nike is inspired by sports and encourages its employees to imbibe the sporting culture .Its an informal organisation which encourages people to go being their functions ."
good,"Most of the people that work in my store are college students with the oldest no more than age 25. The environment of the people is pretty cool, with some exceptions. Get to wear Nike gear as staff dress, and very generous discounts."
good,"I loved working here, i loved all my coworkers, i called them my Nike fam. The customers are a bit much, it gets really busy and stressful. The management is good, nothing too bad to complain about. The pay is the worst thing about this job, its hard work for such little pay."
good,"On a typical work day you restock hundreds of boxes to the correct shelves, it's quite simple. The management was ""ok"", changes could have been made. Many workers hide or wonder off during the work day while clocked in and its hardly ever addressed. The hardest part of the job was working in sometimes severely hot conditions. The most enjoyable part of the job was learning how factories work and seeing how business get your packages to you correctly."
good,Focus on the company and your individual experience while employed there. always be on time fun and loving co-workers and great team workers. a good place to work
good,"Existe compañerismo en el grupo de ventas , coordinacion por turnos de atencion."
good,"A typical day at work was fun and was always able to meet customers from various backgrounds and was also able to build relationships with customers. my co-workers made it a very comfortable working environment the work culture was very youthful and aimed to embrace everyone with no judgment and the drive was to love everyone no matter the shape, size, race or religion."
good,"Managers are very rude and unprofessional. Managers harass workers, have obvious favorites on shifts, and lie on employees. The whole factory is ran like a jail!"
good,Upper mangagement needs more training to deal with employees and public relations.  The human resources department is not efficient or equited to handle day to day situations.
good,"The hardest part of my job was overcoming the stereotype, working with leaders who should not have been leading in this organization."
good,"The pay at Nike wasn't that good but I enjoyed being able to receive a 50% discount at the Nike store, They had poor management as well. It was very unorganized and all over the place."
good,Great people to work with job is not hard at all but management is not the best. My job is not hard at all i like what i do personally but overall sometimes it become frustrating when others do not care about there job so i am then responsible for what they do not get done at the end of the day. I but my foot into what i do everyday and i enjoy my job most of the time. meeting all different people everyday is great part of the job.
good,"A typical day at work consisted of me overseeing the store layout and Merchandising the store according to the season. I led a team and we worked cohesively to get the job done. I learned great merchandising skills and great time management skills. Workplace culture was very fast paced but rewarding when the job was finished. The hardest part of the job was meeting deadlines, and the most enjoyable part of the job was being able to use my creativity to execute different displays."
good,I really don't care about this place. Working as a temp is pretty bad when you have to work around the actual nike employees. And there is lots of favoritism.
good,"Doing changes of some lay outs and making myself productive only and useful at the end of the day. Refilling, folding, assisting customers, making sure that we hit the our individual target and store target at the end of the month. Following the standards and sop of the store and reporting to the manager or store in charge."
good,"My experience at Nike was quite interesting, I enjoyed it but felt as if co-workers would be too into your personal life. But overall it was a fun place to work, but management was unprofessional at times."
good,When I was working for Nike everything was ok. My job was to restock make sure all boxes was put in the system and was also stored away properly in the right location.
good,"A typical day as a part of the back of house team at Nike Boston begins with a fed-ex shipment of product. From there I worked to correctly process all product and ensure it was presented on the floor in the proper manner. I would also run desired product needed for consumers from the third floor stock room to the sales floor when called for. Working at Nike has taught me a lot about customer service and consumer journeys. The management team is a bit unorganized, and moving up in the company is a frustrating and long process. Apart from that, the atmosphere and work environment are both very enjoyable."
good,"At start of shift climb 3 flights of stairs,long walks to ererywhere,got alone well with co-workers had to train just about everyday,high turn over of temp employees,Management changed often.It was really hard standing 12 hour shifts.Enjoyed trainning people."
good,"A typical day involved generating  daily lesson plans for the children, working with a team of four other co teachers in a classroom setting  with a predictable schedule. The morning consisted of dropping the children off to the classroom where three tables were setup to enhance cognitive, fine motor, and mathematical thinking skills, the classroom was also available for quieter activities like reading or drawing and a climber for gross motor exploration. Followed by morning snack and recess. After recess the children would come in for whole group circle time where academic curriculum was discussed, songs were song and group readings and discussions occurred. Then small group activities were available for exploration and learning goals. Children were then given the opportunity to explore the campus on a walk, do a art activity or work in small reading and writing group which was designated by learning needs. Then lunch and nap would occur, during nap the teaching met to generate daily power point notes about the day, team meetings, lesson plan development, time schedules and classroom needs were attended to. After wake up quite activities and sensory activities were offered followed by afternoon snack, recess and pick ups. "
good,"I was recruited to work at Nike by an employee who was visiting my college. I was encouraged to apply for an admin position and was convinced I could work part-time and still attend school. During the interview process, management made it clear that you had to close and you had to make sure that you hit a specific amount of working hours each week with several of these hours being peak business hours. This was difficult for me since I was not driving at the time and was depending on other people to get me to and from work. "
good,"Work is good,Management also cooperative and nice.coworkers also nice and supportive .The hardest part of the job is when company is slow down,and same way when Nike is busy we enjoying a lot with our work."
good,Stocking and replenishing merchandise. Customer service and product knowledge and training. Daily shift goals and areas of work.
good,"	Helped shoppers locate items and provided product knowledge and suggestions"
good,Work was fun and productive but downsides were too many immature individuals workers and managers who mad job harder than it was supposed to be.
good,"I think the best thing about working here were the benefits. The environment was fun and there was a lot of teamwork. The management could improve, but that's with a a lot of companies."
good,"Entreprise conviviale, environnement de travail agréable."
good,the job itself is amazing. the management and veteran workers run the store into the ground. the product is worth everything paid for it. the opportunities to meet people in this store is all the time.
good,"Got to stay on your toes. super fast paced, especially dealing with different types of consumers daily. I've gained customer service skills. The management was cool; you get to choose your own schedule. The hardest part about this job was handling one department by yourself."
good,"*Muito alegre"
good,I really enjoyed working with the employees at nike. The pay is just really bad. It was good for me to learn about this type of job though.
good,"Receiving shipments of new products where than we must organize, and divide the product by style and what is in need for the customers. "
good,"Learned inventory, ordering, management, customer service, stocking, the mod enjoyable part is interacting with people everyday"
good,I travelled to other stores to learn more about the company and product and it was a fun adventure
good,Fresh and culturally diverse work environment with advancement opportunites.
good,"Management was very unorganized. Some of my co-workers was very messy, to keep the eye off them they start mess with other co-workers."
good,"My manager is great about insuring things get done in a timely manner, not so much about advancing her team.  You need to take the oppurtunity to teach yourself how to do most of your job."
good,"Nike is an extremely competive company to work for. The company focusses a lot on growth and is extremely lean, in order to show good numbers. "
good,"I truly enjoyed the people and the latitude I was given to exude excitement, positiveness and a team pride with the shift I was responsible for. The negative was that the management was unskilled and out of touch with the site goals with absolutely no people skills or speaking in public skills whatsoever. Their feeling was if we can scare them by bullying them, it will be done...I was one of 4 managers who ultimately left Nike due to this environment."
good,"I was a contractor working at Nike."
good,"Nike NFL is a nice job, but I have a family to support now; so I will need something a little more stable. I am a temp for Nike and the job is a little bit rocky at times, plus we get no benefits whatsoever."
good,"management rarely listened"
good,"The typical day at Nike would be for me to come in, check all emails and cameras, & get my reports started. I learned how to write reports, record & monitor high tech security equipment. Also I learned patience. As far as management goes, the supervisors who I worked with were respectful yet did there job. But the manager that was above the supervisors had no people skills at all. She is rude, disrespectful & does not know how to talk to people. There is no hard part about the job, due to the fact that I work the graveyard shift. The most enjoyable part about the job was everything else."
good,"Overall Nike is a okay company to work for. There really big on time and attendance. Employees get free apparel, footwear and products as staff dress. The discounts are great. "
good,"From the time you clock in you will always be working."
good,"Overall, Nike wasn't a bad company to work for.  The employees were all friendly and helpful.  The only downfall to the company was that there was always scheduling conflicts which is a direct reflection on the management there."
good,My position working as a Nike Brand Representative included creating advertising and promotional materials to increase the sales of our product line. Provide presentation and product demonstration support during the introduction of new products and services to store staff and customers. It was a great opportunity to incorporate creativity into displaying a product that would appeal to consumers.
good,Would recommend working here to anyone. Great environment among employees. Great first job to learn from. 
good,"come in grabs production sheet, box cutter, and labels. "
good,"Ho lavorato in quest'azienda ed in questa sede per diversi anni, chi meglio di me la può descrivere? Prima di entrare a far parte di questa ditta non avevo mai avuto l'esperienza lavorativa in un negozio sportivo. Come prima esperienza direi ch'é stata  positiva, perché da una persona ignorante che ero riguardante gli articoli sportivi, sono riuscito a diventare competente nella materia, tutto ciò grazie alla formazione che ho avuto nell'azienda ed all'impegno che ci ho messo. Sono una persona che cerca sempre di amare ciò che fa, in effetti ho amato veramente questo lavoro e rimarrà sempre nei miei ricordi nonostante tutte le difficoltà che ho dovuto affrontare lì dentro... Passavo la maggior parte del mio tempo nel lavoro, l'orario era molto flessibile, cambiava circa ogni giorno, ho avuto diversi colleghi perché non era semplice lavorare lì dentro di conseguenza non tutti resistevano. Questa ditta come si può notare é una multinazionale americana, la sua sede europea principale si trova nei Paesi Bassi(Olanda), poi in Italia la gestione é divisa in due aree: il nord e sud. A capo di ogni area c'é un responsabile che gestisce tutto il territorio che gli é stato affidato(il supervisore), un area può comprendere ad esempio dieci negozi e ogni negozio ha il proprio menager con il proprio organigramma, non era facile vivere in quel ambiente perché se non eri apprezzato da uno dei gestori locali, non potevi avanzare nella carriera perché le porte per te sarebbero state chiuse. Il bello di quest'azienda era che lavoravamo per il gruppo, tra di noi colleghi ci aiutavamo a vicenda."
good,"This is a good place to work but i would not call it a career opportunity, however i enjoyed my 5 plus years with the company."
good,A typical day was constant work in different environments. I learned how to adapt to any environment and be successful. Management was very laid back. Sometimes to laid back. My coworkers were great. Really good team players. The hardest par of the job was working long hours.The most enjoyable part was making customers happy and working along some great people
good,Loading and unloading inventory from the conveyor line to picker and packer in there location.
good,Great co-workers but managers and supervisor dont know how to talk to people and dont recognize good workers.
good,"the job was decent. chill co workers but when it came to management some are the same age as the employees. managers picked their favorites and did not care when employees who worked there longer would talk bad about the new ones. they hired very poorly when it came to seasonal, they hire the athletes who were in beginning groups during the seasonal 120 days. instead of waiting until the season is over, leaving everyone who came in later without a chance of being hired for long term."
good,"There, I learned how to work with customers during my working time. salesmanship skill has emerged. We had a day off each week, we worked the rest of the day. Most of the time, because we sold sportswear, famous athletes would come and the business process would be more fun"
good,"Retail is not for everyone, however, it is a good job for getting familiar with the product and business at that level. The management is friendly but could do a better job at training new employees."
good,excellent work place. Keeps you motivated and engaged about the job. relaxed work space but your team will encourage you to meet productivity for the week.
good,Not willing to disclose due to confidentiality restrictions and agreements. Canadian exclusive dealer position that suffered from stock availability issues constantly making it very challenging to grow professionally.
good,"Travailler au stock de Nike n’a rien de compliquer. Il faut savoir être très organiser, rapide et un peu de logique. Cela dit l’évolution au sein de l’entreprise est une autre histoire, il faut se démarquer des autres mais le management ne suit pas du tout et ferme les yeux sur de vrai potentiel, ce qui ne donne pas l’opportunité de se développer correctement. Nike est une bonne école pour apprendre tout ce qui est en liaison avec les stoxk donc cela reste un bon point positif."
good,"Ambiguity is great, but too much of it creates uncertainties.  Nike TA takes on more than they can chew.  They roll out new initiatives across various teams and are not standardized throughout the org."
good,"Working for Nike was bitter sweet, their products and storied product campaigns have captivated many. Unfortunately working on the retail side of the company isn’t anything more than a basic minimum wage job. Most of the people whom you will be working with are in college or fresh out of high school. This makes the work environment fun at times but can also cause issues as well. If you are looking for a few extra bucks a week this is this place."
good,"Nike (factory store Portsmouth) is an ideal role for young people working alongside university studies as it is an upbeat and lively environment, the discount is really good also"
good,"Creativity, productivity, innovation, hard work with dedication to achieve goals and objectives. Friendly relationship with colleagues and work environment."
good,"Discounts is the best part of working for Nike. The events are cool, you meet a lot of locals who are also into their health. The pay sucks and there is a huge pay gap between management and athletes."
good,Overall my experience with the company has been great. I have been given opportunities to move up within the company and been taught valuable skills that i can use in other aspects of my life. My leadership team has been welcoming towards me and supportive in my endeavors in and outside of work. It has also allowed me to connect with wide assortment of people from all over and network and build relationships. I know every job has its ups and downs but I have tried to make the best out of my experience and use the mentors available to me to grow as an individual and employee.
good,"Developed positive relationships with consumers and teammates"
good,"I worked at the outlet store while finishing up my degree. So to be honest i wasn't necessarily looking to move up in the company. I did enjoy my time there, and i left due to graduating and leaving the area."
good,"If you're young and fit, you will have opportunities to learn through a lot of job hopping.  If you're an older employee, you're likely staying put where you get hired unless you are in management."
good,can do better as a companythats involved with many things that involve family and worklife balance. They talk about balance of life and work howeverthelocation a came from never acknowledge
good,"I worked for Nike for about a year and a half. At first, it seems fun to be around some great and interactive co-workers. It became problematic after they wanted people to sell product and want you to get emails from people and always pushing for it. The management just seems to care about the business but not the employees. The amount of work required from you was worth more than what they were paying you."
good,"Very competitive Environment, nice colleauges , weak management"
good,"Company doesn’t support older employees "
good,Sometimes it can be slow but very demanding. The weekends require the most work and work hours. The culture of nike is good but management needs work.
good,It's a really fun place to work. But if you want to advance to a higher position to get more hours you must be favored by the managers. No matter how much effort and hard work you put in if they don't favor you at all good luck advancing. I went from seasonal to part time and tried multiple time to advance but favoritism and politics will hold you back.
good,I believe that there should be more involvement within the way that athletes are portrayed. There's a large drive for fit and i felt a bit uncomfortable.
good,Its pretty straightforward. You come in organize shoes and apparel. Service anyone who would need it and clock out at the end of your shift. Side duties are janitorial to say the least. Picking up trash and wiping the floors. Its pretty much a job for people just starting out.
good,"Depending on which Nike you work at, there could be a lot of drama. It's a bunch of young (or old, but young-minded) people who act like Nike is a high school. The discount is great though, don't spend all your paycheck on it! The brand obviously has a ""cool"" factor to it. It is what you make it. Management is often not very good though, and they have very strict rules. Plus the guys that work there are always creepy, and your managers will probably hit on you."
good,It pays. Long as your able to work its a job that always hiring. Great company keep to yourself to avoid the drama and attitudes. Do your job and go home and you'll have a lovely day.
good,The hours feel long on some days when the work is not flowing how it should. The people are easy to get along with. And the pay is good as long as you are hired through Nike and not a temp service.
good,"Hours were ok but worked 12 hour shifts all weekend.   Also, had to lift heavy boxes and move pallets with a hand cart. Shift are 5-5, either am of pm."
good,"I worked at Nike for a year. When I was working at Nike, hours were very difficult. Some weeks I would work a significant amount of hours and then have no hours the following. Basically when requested more hours, nothing changed. Other than hours, some managers were very understand and approachable."
good,"Worked at The Flagship London Location so here is the stuff you want to know:"
good,"It was an okay job that requires a lot of walking with short breaks. Lunch break was 45 minutes but it took atleast 10 minutes to get to the cafeteria, 10 minutes to order food, and 10 minutes to walk back to your station after lunch break only leaving you 15 minutes to finally rest and enjoy your meal before doing several more hours of walking and working."
good,It is a ok job but there is no room for advancement. The work schedules are ok. There is a lot of dust in the warehouse and the building is hard to figure out but overall its a ok place to work and save money. If you do not have a black badge then you will just be passing by.
good,"Aspiring to be in leadership? Keep looking...Don't not stop here.. A waste of time your time and knowledge. Leadership will attempt to take your thoughts, concepts, and process to make their own."
good,"A typical day was a 12hr night shift very fast pace production line. It was my first time working a night shift i learn to adjust very quickly working with a very diverse group of people. Helping out other to keep the productive on target, time management. The most enjoyable part of this job was the meetings knowing how are department was doing and what is going to be the next target."
good,"Maintain knowledge of various store departments and be available to operate cash register for regular transactions, perform shipping and receiving duties, stock the floor, perform cleaning duties and build visual displays when necessary • Serve as a product knowledge resource for consumers and entry level associates. Seek educational opportunities to develop advanced level or specialized knowledge about selling, Nike products and culture, sales and service techniques • Assist Leads, Senior Associates, and Managers in training entry level associates • Assist with loss prevention efforts by providing proactive customer service"
good,It was a job I needed at the time that grew into a job i enjoyed I still like nike and would work there again if I had the opportunity it was a good experience
good,Nike has a great atmosphere with friendly staff that make it fun to come to work. The upper management could use some work for employee incentive. They often try to get the most out of an employee for the least amount of benefits.
good,it is a great place to work but it is a strict place to work have to have orders done with in the time period they tell you .stay on your toes when ur going to work
good,I'm just a temporary employee working for a billion dollar company where it's nothing but a fast paced environment to make sure the product is being shipped out to different states on time
good,"Retail is retail. Weekends, holidays and some evenings must be worked. Management pushes certain aspects, making employees robots. Discount was good though."
good,"During my time at Nike in a retail setting, I have not been shown the proper appreciation or monetary value. While this is my dream company, I do not suggest working in a retail setting."
good,"Al bajar de categoría por petición personal,realizaba las mismas tareas con un sueldo menor"
good,"If ever I'm in need of a job, Nike is always there as a reliable source of work. I recommend any of my good friends and/ or associates to seek employment from this company."
good,"Working for NIKE was a great experience. It taught me how to work in the heat. It taught me how package, pick, & process in a warehouse. Then the perks of being a NIKE employee was great discounts for days."
good,La cultura de ambiente laboral aun no es muy buena pero puede mejorar claramente.
good,retail is hard work at the best of times but Nike has a few other thing that go along with it such as bulk buying and a large amount of young members of the team.
good,"La giornata è strutturata  in questo modo :dalle 7 alle 10 apertura negozio e compilazione pratiche,allestimento del prodotto, scarico e lavorazione merci. Dalle 10 alle 20 vendita prodotto."
good,While working for Nike I learned that team work was most important .The hardest part was walking for hours up and down aisle . The most enjoyable part was meeting new people .
good,Many meetings with the leadership team making all the decisions.  Very slow to react to new ideas as they work many years in advance.  The freedom to create has been lost with the new leadership teams.
good,"Nike is an amazing company and can bring the best out of many people with the positive atmosphere eminated throughout the company.  However, the lack of job security, excess of favoritism, and high stress hours of operation cause for tensions to flare and feelings to become distraught."
good,"Overall the company has a lot of extremely positive activities for employees to participate in. The strong desire to be an employee of Nike has other employees fighting VERY hard to be there, this can lead to a less than desirable work environment."
good,"Working for this company i have gained a lot of experience and how to be a team player,and i have learned a lot about they products,how important is customer service to the company"
good,Decent job for the most part. Hardest part about job is being on feet all day but you do get breaks in between shifts. I’d advise you to wear comfortable shoes.
good,"A typical day involves walking stocking shoes and helping customers place orders or find the right size that fits them. For closing it involved reorganizing shoes, mopping sweeping, dusting, and wiping the glass off because of finger prints and smudges."
good,Working at this company was very disappointing during my time there. At the location i worked at they hired A LOT of high school kids so there was constantly drama and a lot of some internal conflicts between manager and sales associate.... not a pleasant experience at all
good,"career advancement it tough in the restaurants, and pay is below what is necessary if you have a family to provide for. great for business hours and weekends off!"
good,"the people are fun and chill but management is horrible. unfair and bias , messy workplace but other than that the money was good and hours kind of wear you down after awhile."
good,This was a seasonal job I did before I went to basic training for the army. I would recommend it. I would try to get a full time position though. Good discounts and good clothing to take advantage of. I asked to see if they were hiring for a position when the seasonal job got done and they said that since I was going to basic training it would be hard to hire me for future employment.
good,"I was very frustrated with the lack of immediate management, as a manager in my other full time job, I would have been fired for lack of attention to detail, and involved leadership. Unfortunately I quit due to this lack in leadership."
good,"Nike is a place of family and a good time. On a typical day I would come in and immediately get to work, which included helping customers on a daily. But i mainly closed so my job was to make the store as it did when we first opened up for the next day."
good,Nike is een bedrijf dat over de hele wereld bekend is. Het was altijd een droom van mij om voor dit bedrijf te werken. Ik heb veel geleerd over het merk zelf en hoe het bedrijf te werk gaat. En dan heb ik het over de productie van de artikelen tot aan de verkoop aan de klant. Het leukste van de baan was dat je altijd wat kan leren over de innovatie van de producten en het moeilijkste was er waren geen doorgroeimogelijkheden omdat het een franchise is.
good,"Working for a really popular brand is something to talk about, but there's a lack of advancement in retail and the pay is unfair for the amount you do. The people you work with are great but it doesn't make up for the bad job and pay."
good,"I came in at a Senior level, great culture, a bit cut throat at times, and very top heavy; but a great brand and organization to work for, and such a great place to learn and manage a large team."
good,No opportunity for growth.  Hire contract workers rather than promote from within.  Only way to advance is to leave company for 6 months and then become a contract worker.
good,I only worked seasonal for Nike but the management at the time was sometimes more cruel than constructive. The pay was $8 an hour which was low for me and not worth the sometimes too slow paced job. Not for me.
good,"Nike is a big corporation and it certainly comes with all the downfalls that follow. However it is pretty upbeat and provides all kinds of services, benefits, and perks hard to find anywhere else. My recommendation to work there however has its caveats. The fact is they are moving to eliminate FTE positions for a technical software developer in favor of contractors. This of course is their perogative, but if you are a developer hoping to become a FTE at Nike I'm afraid this is just not a good time and probably won't be for a long time. I also have to mention the layoffs are not only a bit unpredictable as for frequency but also whom they will effect. Most of the time your manager and his/her manager will not know. There has also been a trend the last few years to add layers of management which seems to have resulted in a competition between managers and not a benefit of the teams."
good,I love my job at nike its faced past you can learn several different positions within the company the manager on our shift is great and fun but pushes the work out as well the culture is ok as long as you stay away from gossip the hardest part of the job are the slackers the enjoyable part is the shoe discounts
good,"managers at nike(centralia) treat some people worse than others. when i asked to move to the back because of some anxiety issues, they told me to find someone to go talk to someone and forced me to go outside of my personal limits, causing anxiety attacks. i worked there for 2 years and they didn't care how i felt."
good,"Working at Nike was a mind growing and fitness"
good,"Unfortunately I don't have the most glowing review of my time at the Nike Company Store. I worked at that store for 3 1/2 years, went above an beyond in my day to day work, always was trying to improve my performance and got little to recognition for it. The process to get part time over( under 40 hours per week) or full time, you have to go through a formal interview with leaders you work with. It was very strange that you have to interview when you are only looking for more hours, and not a management position. I applied and interviewed 4 separate times and was denied every one; the most recent being 2 months before I quit. The only reason they ever gave as to why I never got the positions is that my interview wasn't as strong as everyone else. Its demoralizing to the workers who have been there for so long, who are looking to increase their time there and are willing to work hard everyday only to be shut down in such a way. The NCS is a great place to work if you are in school or have other career paths in mind rather than advancing in that store or getting to Nike Campus."
good,"L'aspect le plus agréable de mon poste : vendre du reve au client , vendre avec passion et mettre en avant les valeurs de l'enseigne . Donnez le sourire aux gens . Appliquer la fidélisation de Part Un bon comportement et un grand professionnalisme"
good,"Great place to work however some of the management team does not treat the employees correctly. Expect you to do a lot of work but do not recognize or care about the work and effort put in to completing a task. Pay is horrible as well, workers who stand around are often paid more than the ones who take on responsibility."
good,"Besides what many would tell me is low pay working at Nike was fun and the culture is great. Everyone was always willing to help and learn. ""Be a sponge"" I will say that moving up is extremely hard especially if you aren't in that Nike clique. Rewarded positions to people who weren't deserving but got it because of ""friendship"" outside of the job. They tend to clear house of employees and restart with a fresh new crew."
good,"Nike è un'azienda che punta sul cambiamento e sull'innovazione, per questo è un ambiente lavorativo stimolante dal quale si impara il lavoro in team e come gestirsi non solo nella vendita ma in tutte le fasi della vita di negozio."
good,Nike is a great Brand and has always been strong in Marketing and designing footwear and apparel for their athletes.  Fun place to work with many advantages.
good,"Nike sales associates, commonly referred to as Athletes, provide customer service and product knowledge at company retail stores worldwide. Job duties include answering customer inquiries regarding Nike goods and services, helping shoppers locate items, recommending suitable products, organizing merchandise on the sales floor, and assembling in-store displays. Sales associates also clean work areas and perform cashier duties as needed. Nike sales associate jobs offer ideal employment opportunities for students, as the entry-level position requires a high school diploma or current student status. Previous customer service or retail experience, while not necessary, often strengthens the candidacy of prospective sales associates. Additional hiring requirements include the abilities to stand for extended periods of time, perform a wide range of physical motions, and successfully complete an extensive background check. Strong communication and multitasking skills, outgoing personalities, and advanced levels of interest in athletics also help applicants obtain sales associate positions."
good,"-low pay"
good,I was a contractor hired for a specific task.  I didn't get too involved in corporate life.  They will try and get w whole lot of work for little compensation because they are Nike!  They really push lifestyle over a paycheck.  So if you like lifestyle and care little for money you are good to go.
good,"Nike is a great place to work if you love their products. Overall, management is a mixture of relaxed and rigid. Workplace culture is very diverse. It is very hard to advance in this company due to the very high volume of workers. Often scheduled many more hours than anticipated...or very few hours."
good,The management was absolutely terrible in trying to help an individual move up in the company. Certain managers played favorites and it was pretty annoying. other managers would get certain individuals in trouble while letting other slide through while doing the same thing. All in all the company is a great company just certain managers at this location can not be trusted
good,"Overall all average work, but the work day is long  you have to work 12 hour shifts.Miight not be a good company for people with young children because of the point system"
good,A place where you ca really grow and develop. Growth is highly determined based on the management team you have. Fun place to work always sport/fitness oriented. Good for anyone is into sports/fitness. Always have to stay optimistic hard work can easily get looked over if compared to how relationship oriented a person is.
good,"There were big changes since my last visit to Nike, I feel there was an undercurrent which affected the staff culture. The staff discounts were generous. The opportunties for training were limited. Lovely, modern surroundings, good and reasonably priced restaurant facilities"
good,Tienen que motivar al personal estar pediente del mismo actuar de manera eficiente ya que tiene fallas en el salario quincenal entre otras cosas.
good,"I love my time and growth, but ended up frustrated with management  who played favorites and were not always that nice. I stayed for so long because I love the product and helping people."
good,"The was typically a large amount of people in  the store at all times, so it could be difficult to keep up with the fast paced environment. The pay did not subsidize for the work that was required on a daily basis."
good,"Tof bedrijf leuke collegas, heb eerst een tijdje benede gestaan en dat was super leuk. Daarna ben ik naar boven verplaatst en daar is alles de mist in gegaan als intrimer heb je er niks maar dan ook niks te zegge, coaches staan boven de arbeiders , benede staan ze tusse jou (persoonlijke mening) het duurt soms een jaar of 2 voor je eindelijk je eerste contract binne hebt. Leuk bedrijf op deze moment geen werkzekerheid."
good,"Working security for Nike, you receive many of the same benefits any other employee would, including good discounts on merchandise and comparable benefits packages.  You're rotated around to varying posts day by day, so you get a variety of settings in which to work on the campus.  However, much is expected of you in terms of building checks, monitoring of cameras and alarms, making sure no one gets in who shouldn't be."
good,I learn how to drive a forklift and pick and package. i also loaded the truck up and help with some maintain work. A typical day at work was pretty good until two of my boss came in and try to over work us .
good,This was my first job and for the most part it was okay. You are on your feet the entire time and inside of a warehouse. It gets boring because you're either in one spot the entire time or constantly walking back and forth. They don't want you to talk and you cant have your phone.
good,"Good employee benefits and great fitness center for employees."
good,"Bom ambiente de trabalho, com chances de promoções efetivas, ótimos colegas e boa gerência!"
good,"orderpicken"
good,"I was pretty much a one man shop there. The general manager had my job before me, so there was guidance from him on many things, but after a while he was more concerned about running the print shop, which is what JC Manufacturing did. We had about a dozen computers in the place, and maintaining them was rather easy. I did programming in Visual Foxpro, VBScript, Clipper (That's over 20 years old...). I also was network administrator and DPA for an on-line SQL Server database. Most of the co-workers were nice - and the general manager was a good guy."
good,Grato ambiente laboral. Buen trato a los trabajadores ...el trabajo lo desarrolló con gusto..Me encanta interactuar con las personas. Muy buen trato
good,The warehouse was a safe and productive environment. Management could have been better. The employees worked together to ship and distribute Nike products.
good,"First job,I learned that customer service is very important. Enjoyable at first then I grew older and decided that I wanted something more for myself."
good,goed leuke sfeer leuke mensen altijd gezellig om voor grote bedrijven te werken goed betaald maar de bazen misleiden hun macht
good,"Typically at Nike I felt alone, but that didn't stop me from having a good attitude. I always strived to help others, even when they were rude or disrespectful to me."
good,"If you can appreciate change and a very fast pace then you will appreciate working at Nike digital.  "
good,"A typical day at work consisted of greeting and interacting with consumers, and meeting their basic shopping needs.  I picked up customer service skills and enhanced my social skills.  Management was not very understanding, and did not work with employees availabilities.  My coworkers were all very friendly and easy to get along with.  The hardest part of the job was not receiving the hours that were promised upon hire.  The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting people from all around the world and getting to know a little bit about them."
good,The management team was not helpful in training employees fully.  I would have liked more opportunity to be of service but was not given enough hours.  After the holidays they only used me for a fill in to cover shifts when others wanted days off.  Some of the managers were nice and helpful.
good,"I've learned a tremendous amount about Project Management since coming on board at Nike.  Most of the knowledge gained has been from fellow co-workers, who are encouraging and supportive.  Teamwork is highly recommended."
good,It is fun workplace a good environment where being a friendly person and verbally skillful is an assent to reach the the monthly target allocated in our shop as i was working in a retail industry. Being an acting team leader is not as hard as it is considered just as long i give the proper information about the product and trust to the staff everything will be as smooth as possible. i enjoyed so much everytime we reached the target as we have a team building outing which makes us more passionate and interested.
good,"Uma empresa jovem, que busca sempre ser a primeira no seu seguimento com muita força física e estratégica de marketing.Os dias de trabalho sempre muito produtivo e alegre, aprendendo lidar com pessoas de todos os tipos sociais, gerentes sempre com muita energia e motivação."
good,"A typical day at work is very repetitive. Shipments come in and we process them and put them on the floor and sell, sell, sell. I learned a lot about the company itself and its products. The management was good but I felt like it wasn't always fair. My co-workers were awesome! Always uplifting and very outgoing. The hardest part about my job was being competitive. I don't like trying to pressure people to buy things they weren't sure about. The best part of my job was seeing the new products and learning about what they were made to do and why."
good,"I very much enjoyed working for Nike. I first got the job right after graduating high school, and I would actually look forward to coming into work. However, after being at the company for three years, I still made under $10 an hour, even after being promoted to full time. The company is very difficult to advance in."
good,"Typical day at nike is easy except around holidays.I learned the Nike shoe culture is deep in american culture. Management was okay, new managers every 3-4 months.My co-workers were awesome to work with.Hardest part of the job was the meeting high demand with little to no product.The most enjoyable part of the job was the Nike discount and staff dress."
good,"Good experience"
good,"Lessons I have learnt while at work with NIke."
good,"I liked working thier because of my co-workers, but the supervisors from Kelly where very rude and never understanding of others problems or situations. It was either there way or no way at all."
good,"Typical day of work involved a lot of alone time working in the back. This job was the job that taught me you won't always love where you work, or who you work with, but you still have to go until you find something else. I did not like the management because they were so inconsistent on expectations. My co-workers were usually friendly however some of them did not posses common knowledge and often times would create more work later by taking a shortcut and not doing things properly. The hardest part of the job was having minimal interaction with people as part of being a back of house worker. No cell phones allowed and only the music they play on repeat everyday gets old pretty fast. The most enjoyable part of the job was that I enjoyed quite a bit of free time with the scheduling."
good,"a typical day at work is basically putting boxes on a conveyor belt line all day, I learned how to multitask more and I learned great communication skills my job is not hard at all I enjoy it all the time but the hours are interfering with school I get off at 1 am I need a job were I can get off before 10pm"
good,"service consumers, stay updated on knowledge of current products"
good,"The best department to work for in Nike is the Shipping and Receiving department; where all processing goes down and a UPH sheet is necessary to track what has been processed. This job isn't hard at all unless you have a manager on your back to make sure product flow is efficient. The people are good people to work with and you pretty much just receive product and put them in perspective bin locations. As long as there is shipment coming, that means more hours for employees."
good,It's a good job but it took to much time from my kids. It was a very easy job and I enjoyed doing it.
good,"Retail just is not a good fit for me personally. Love Nike products and company, not a fan of working with them in that setting."
good,"Het werk was makkelijk maar niet bevredigend."
good,"A day at work will vary depending on the account you manage schedule. Most work is done at the computer, answering emails and working closely with the sales reps to ensure all orders are scheduling and issues are resolved. Co workers for the most part are upbeat and we work well as a team. I have learned how to prioritize tasks even when all seem to be at the top of the list. I have built my foundation, learning about the system, excel, & outlook. The hardest part of my job he knowing when to push back on an issue. Being in this position we wear many hats and try to help best answer any problem, but if we research and deliver information, others should be utilizing this as well. The most enjoyable part of my job is working around great people and the culture."
good,Not enough opportunity to advance and micro managing by different managers in different shifts
good,"Processing was a great place to start within this company, fun fast paced!"
good,"We started with cleaning the floor and fixing the clothes I.e. aligning them properly, getting more stock floor, depositing money for the company. the hardest part was that we had to stand up for long hours. the most enjoyable part was that we could also make a lot of sales which reflected a good payslip."
good,"Distribution it is what you make it.  Go to work, do your job, do not steal the product, be respectful and you will have a job"
good,Good foundation with some good values. A company striving to create a balance between work and life
good,it is a good culture overall but like everywhere it has it's ironies... a sports company that doesn't support an athletic work/life balance when working on the digital space
good,"Nike is a great company but it has a ""good old boy"" network and is all about politics."
good,Knowing that you gave it your best and looking forward for tomorrow at work.What you learn is the most exciting part of any job it`s skills that you will have for life. Staying on top making sure your employees and everything are up to date.All my co-worker were up beat fun and hard workers.Hardest part was advancement there was no room for advancment.Greeting and helping customers was the most enjoyable part of the job.
good,great experience to work here but very stressful at the outlets organized shoes in the stock area did inventory and organized womens and mens apparell
good,"I enjoyed working at the NIKE factory in Nashville. There was always an exciting day ahead especially working with customers on a day to day basis. A typical day at work would be just selling shoes, cleaning up, and maintaing great customer service. I learned alot about shoes and athletic clothes and how our bodies work. The management was okay but after our Head GM resigned from her position, the people under her took advantage of employees. The hardest part of the job is making sure you stay on top of customer service because it is most important. The enjoyable part would have to be when we had dance contests in the store and kids would dance and gain a crowd. It was awesome!"
good,"It will be almost impossible to describe my experiences at Nike because although being under contract for almost half a year i rarely got the opportunity to work a shift."
good,"um dia típico de trabalho ........dinâmico"
good,"Empresa me deu oportunidades de aprender novas áreas como o caixa e vitrine,a visão fica macro pois fazia mais de duas funções ao mesmo tempo."
good,"i am working very good. Also i learned most of about civil. i learned as a drafting, estimation, billing, planing and site engineer for residential building."
good,"Nike Factory Store is a fun place to work, yet there is not much room for real growth inside of this workplace. The opportunity for more compensation or promotion never presented itself while I worked there. The coworkers were very fun and pleasurable to be around yet I felt like I was treated like a teenager while working in this store."
good,Nike is a great company but pay was low. great employees and great management
good,helping customers find Nike products.
good,"Good job but it was only seasonal. And after i was laid off, they went out of business."
good,"The work is very easy, pay is good, but the job security is very very poor. I wished I could have stayed longer but that is how things go."
good,"Fun, energetic pace to work. Management is polite and understanding. Workers love the product they are selling. Customers are interesting and diverse."
good,"Although you can ask time off, it was generally unlikely you would receive it. The management didn't seem to care much about the workers and were very focused on simply having power. The tasks were repetitive, but my coworkers made the hours worth it."
good,"over all it's good"
good,"Je suis resté un an et demi chez Nike."
good,"Working for Nike had many ups and downs. I’m grateful for the experience I gained and it was the best retail job I ever had. You really get the opportunity to meet great people and you also get an understanding of business politics. Unfortunately towards my resignation with Nike, I saw a lot of favoritism, dealt with discrimination and just overall a terrible representation of what Nike is all about."
good,het was goed om bij nike tewerken alleen de afdeling waar ik stond was het zwaar werken
good,Empresa con bajos sueldos con respecto q actividades y falta de oportunidad de crecimiento
good,"I enjoyed the job at Nike, along with the discounts. The main thing I didn’t like was the pay. It was roughly $10 an hour which was crazy for the amount of work we had to do with required weekend availability."
good,"Je ne retiens absolument rien contre Nike qui essaie d'instaurer les bienfaits de la culture amériacaine concernant son personnel. Si tu es bon et que tu as faim il y a des objectifs palpables et atteignables. Tu n'attendras pas 5ans pour avoir un semblant d'évolution. Le quotidien étant plutot stimulant."
good,Nothing special just another retail job. The discount is nice but only on specific days. Only get paid twice a month this schedule of pay can get annoying.
good,Depending on how big your store is will ultimately depend on how smoothly everything will transition for you. It can be rough of clear cut. I was hired during the holidays and work at the register and helping customers. After holidays I was sent the the back to move boxes and process.
good,"Great place, friendly workers, flexible but Low salary. Maybe increase salary slightly and more recognition towards staff developments and promotions."
good,I like the way they promote the employers that are already working there instead of bringing more outside people. The job makes me feel that we are important to the company.
good,Great opportunity to make a career.  Ignore the drama.  Great benefits and a lot of travel.  You get to experience sporting events and many other things.  Networking is everything.  Many people don't do their job and strictly network and land the top jobs.  Rule of thumb at Nike is do your job 10% and Network 90% and you will do great.
good,Better company early on. Swoosh has lost performance edge. Swoosh ubiquity. Too PC. Not leader in running specialty shops. Should spend less on national marketing and more on grass roots. Great training and benefits. Take what learned at Nike to make better pay elsewhere
good,"The workplace culture at Nike is very limited to those who are knowledgeable about Nike products including footwear, apparel, and  accessories. One must also desire the passion to be a team leader and to set examples for others with the hopes of becoming promoted. If one wants to become full-time, they must get promoted."
good,"I was just a sales associate, but the work itself was way too much for a teen making less than $10/hr. Overall, the discount was the best part and the other employees were very nice."
good,"Leuke werkomgeving, fijne ervaring opgedaan."
good,"Calm, sometimes busy during certain times of the day but overall it was an easy job to do. Sometimes had days when wrong items were in the boxes, so you'd have to take the box and find the right items."
good,Gutes Unternehmen. Alle sind freundlich und behandeln einen gut!
good,Had a great experience working here sorting and organizing making sure everything is how it supposed to be before shipping out working with great people in a respectable environment
good,"If it's the same as when I worked there, I was hired through a temp agency and they took parts of my paycheck. I'm not interested in that type of thing anymore."
good,It was a nice job for a young kid at the time. Worked in the footwear department learning about the products and procedures. Management was good and the culture.
good,Working for this company had it’s ups and downs. I was young and wasn’t very focus. Lots of mangers never cared for the little people or starters. Mangers were for the mangers
good,"Was very fun at first, but as leadership changed, so did the culture within the store. Things that made it fun to try and help each and every customer turned into work that was never noticed. A lot of drama came along with the new hierarchy of management."
good,Nike has a different culture. It does has the money to invest in different things so opportunities are always changing. Good company to work for if u enjoy fast paced environment.
good,"Nike is very busy during peak seasons and fast paced. The perks of the job are the best part, however management at certain locations can really make you dislike the company."
good,"A typical day here was okay except if you worked a long shift. Nike policy is anything over 5 hours of work you must take an unpaid hour lunch which is terrible. I did learn a lot about the different shoes and clothing styles they had and they were organized while working on the floor. There were more than 10 managers which was very confusing at times. Most of the managers were awesome and very helpful. The workplace culture was the worst part for me. There were a LOT of cliques and drama at this location, I ultimately quit because of it. I was just coming there to do my job and got sucked into other people's drama. The hardest part of the job was the coworkers. The most enjoyable part of this job for me was getting to work out on the floor and learn about the different styles of shoes and clothing which  I still use that knowledge every day. I also loved helping customers get exactly what they were looking for or at least being able to point them in the right direction. Overall it was an okay experience but i most likely would not work for this company again based on my personal experience."
good,Clean and positive work atmosphere. Nice place for young students or retired men and or women. Nike has a very good idea idea of what people are looking to purshase for the young and elderly men and women.
good,"It's a good job to start for high school students.   "
good,It's a fine place to work on stupid stuff like selling shoes that no one really wants. Hope you like JVM. Management is pretty bonkers. Lot's of smart people though.
good,"Overall it was a stable job that pays the bills , but the management could have been better. We could have got treated like adults instead of children."
good,Product Owner for the last year - hard to convert. Work is interesting but there is little support to convert. Currently a hiring freeze. You have to be willing to wait it out.
good,Limited options for permanent employment. Management team needs to be more influential in observing high quality employees and the process in assisting in permanent employment.
good,"It's a fast job to get into and over worked the have low pay  management sucks breaks  are short , but it's an easy paycheck turnover rate is high ,but there are discounts"
good,"It's a pretty cool and chill place to work at if management take a liking to you. In order to step up to certain positions you have to be pretty close to the managers. There is favoritism even though they tell you there isn't. Luckily for me, I was pretty much in that inner circle, but I've seen certain employees apply for higher positions but weren't given that position due to favoritism. Pay is good but when it comes to annual raises they're pretty stingy(i got a 1 cent raise once)."
good,"My time with Nike was very eye opening to the outside world coming from a military background. I was afforded the opportunity to grow with the available time I could make between projects. Majority of the learning was up to the employee. If you like the ability to do that...you will love Nike. They don't spoon feed you, you have to want it."
good,Good leader great teamwork love to work together dependable person always get the job or task done lead by example as well and helping others exemplary
good,Very competitive work environment. You have to stay on top of your duties and work efficiently with those around you. Everyone is very open and caring.
good,Nike is a good company to work for however the pay could be more balanced and equal to each and every employee. Overall the company has excellent benifits and programs when its comes to the employees.
good,"Good job, it gives sales experience to everyone who works there and also great customer service. doesn't pay well enough to live on one form of income."
good,It was a fun workplace that helped improve many of my skills. It was a very team based job with working together to complete tasks and keep a happy work environment.
good,Do the work no complaints stay to yourself  it's a job work it I like the experience  plus I was. A lead so I did what was need to be done at the time
good,I had some good experiences at Nike. Unfortunately my contract came to an end and was not renewed. In my opinion they require some better managers to make things better there.
good,"Working at Nike you meet plenty of new people that overtime, could be some of your closest friends. Management was hit or miss. The job itself was fun but the worst part about it was when it got really busy, the store would be in horrible shape"
good,"I was a good worker, always on time, did the work they ask me to do. Working at Nike ,I just did not see a future in this job, they were not ateam see"
good,La mayoria de las ganancias y bonos depende totalmente que tan buen vendedor eres.
good,Good place to work at and get discount but poor management  and poor lack of understanding a employer needs and also a good job if your trying make the days go by fast can be tiring working 12 hours but it goes by fast
good,Too focused on numbers when Nike sells itself. Hours can be inconsistent. Overall I enjoyed interacting with customers and other employees. Went through a slight change of management during my time there.
good,"Whiling working at my pack station staying focused and motivated to score high on my productions . Every other day I work hard and harder to reach a high score and to keep it above level , while increasing it ."
good,Little job stability. A lot of redundancy related to different team working on similar initiative - not particularly collaborative across different capacities or have ability to leverage capabilities within the organization.
good,The seasoned employees weren’t friendly but sociable. It was too slow paced and easy. This job is for high school or people wanting something part time
good,"Great way of practicing social skills and practicing salesmanship, but as an athlete I felt we should be paid more for the amount of detail and effort we must apply on an hourly basis. The discount is nice but when you have living expenses you forget all about it."
good,Fair place to work. Fair temperatures. The work is always flowing. The other associates are pretty cool. The managers can be bullies. Overall Nike is just another warehouse
good,This is a great job for young adults who are not in school. Loved the associates and the managers from a personal perspective however from a professional perspective management micromanages. You have to put in a lot of work before being promoted.
good,"Nike as a whole is a great place to work, the work environment is friendly and co workers are like family. It offers a lot of learning opportunities and the opportunity to meet and interact with a wide range of consumers on a daily basis."
good,"Must like being around lots of people, all the time. Long hours & working every weekend. Discounts are one of the main perks although with the low wage & no commission most employees spend majority of their check right back into Nike products."
good,"Great place to work maybe as a first job, but to use this job to pay bills and base a payment schedule off of income from this job is impossible due to the extreme inconsistency of scheduling."
good,"Great place for sports lovers or brand enthusiasts, a lot of opportunities in term of participating to Brand events or little perks."
good,Pay is not good. Want their employees to be available over 30 hours but only schedule 10/15 hours a week. Learned a decent amount being on the operations team.
good,"The people I worked with were great but the management didn't seem to care about advancing their employees, which is why there were a lot of in and out co-workers.  The name helps with moving on."
good,"Management could be more organized, when it comes to important documents and or employees. Also effective communication, when it comes to management and employees."
good,"A typical day at work was typical."
good,"This job provided a fun, upbeat work environment. Continuous smiles and high energy each and every day. I knew the team was happy to see me when I came to work."
good,Its a good place to work it's fun they treat you well you'll get alone with people good get to see alot of new shoe its a big factory has good thing to do
good,Overall... I did not hate my job.  This is perfect for someone who plans on staying long-term. Nike is sales driven and competitive. Must be a team-player. There is always opportunities to learn new skills and work in different departments. The benefits are great. I do not recommend for college students with a busy schedule. They aren’t as  flexible with hours due to limited staff. Good luck on your endeavors!
good,"Ambiente deportivo, flexible. Es una buena marca con potencial de crecimiento en el pais."
good,le groupe de management est plutôt agréable sauf certain d’entre eux
good,I loved the job just lacked on my hours Very energetic managers and leads just need to work on the hours with new hires instead of sending them home early almost every shift
good,"puedo decir que en NIKE, aprendí a buscar otro sentido al vestuario, de manera que puedes ayudar a quien requiera orientación de vestuario según el deporte que realice o quiera comenzar a ejecutar por primera vez, aprendes a desarrollarte mucho mas debido al contacto directo que mantienes con el publico y con el resto de los compañeros, donde se trabaja muchísimo, pero te mantiene en constante ocupación y así estar mucho mas conectado con el objetivo del trabajo."
good,"The people you work along side are cool, that's about it."
good,"On en demande toujours plus. Pause du midi 1h théorique, en réalité 30 min, pour finalement faire 30 à 45 min de plus au soir, pour zero reconnaissance. Encouragement par le fouet, à prendre ou à laisser... résultat 43h semaine minimum pour 1500€ net... on rigole pas et on es pas payé cher. à bon entendeur"
good,It was a delightful place to work in. The managers were positive and friendly. The store culture was uplifting and engaging; as well as promoting my personal growth.
good,Fun enviorment for knowledgeable people on the product that loves to help others. Also with flexiable schedules make it easy for parents to obtain parenthood and Nike as a company also will work with you with time paid off or rehire opportunities.
good,"Original intent was for this job to be temporary, but due to my circumstances, I stayed for almost 6 years."
good,"It's extremely fast paced, if you dont like that than this definitely isnt for you. The great benefit to working at the store in boston i that you will definitely meet alot of cool people from around the world"
good,"I was a temp through Simos. Working for Simos was terrible! Nike workers treated Simos workers terrible as well. Overall the job was alright, but since I was a temp I didn’t reap the benefits that full time Nike employees received; therefore, I couldn’t go into detail about everything Nike received because I wouldn’t know."
good,"sales was not my strong field. very boring to me, did not like the hectic style of work, it is a job for younger kids then a person looking to make a career."
good,"Ambiente stimolantissimo, ma con poco possibilità di una reale crescita"
good,"It didn't have an appealing salary but as a high school student, it was a good 'first' job unless it's the holiday season. The managers  were good at one point, but they all left; being another reason why I left."
good,"I have a huge passion for the Nike brand and getting that job was one of the highlights of my year. Working at Nike was a very good experience and I learned a lot but there were some problems I faced when working there. I was supposed to have a review after every month in order to track my progress. These reviews were never done and as a result i was not made aware of the things I needed to do in order to improve and how to do these things. At the end of my 3 month probation I was let go  because ""It would take too much work for me to improve"" because I didn't get any online feedback from customers which is a bit unfair because most customers disregard the reviews because they either don't remember or cant be bothered writing the online feedback . Many customers complimented me, said i was very helpful and that they would give me a review but never did Nike hired me knowing I was young and it was my first job. It disappointed me that a huge company like Nike did not think it was important to invest in their staff and help them improve instead of just letting people go and looking for something better. As I stated before my managers never sat down and did the monthly reviews with me so i was completely unaware of things I needed to improve on and what i was doing well. If these reviews were done I believe I would have been able to learn new ways to persuade customers to give me online feedback. Apart from this every one of my co workers were very welcoming and very helpful when i needed help with things."
good,"Outside looking in, it looks great but it’s not really like that. Just beware. They will take full advantage of you if you let them and trust me you don’t wanna be that person."
good,"I hate working places that don't hide their bias against women from management and on the retail level, that is exactly what you'll get in this district. Unless you are willing to forgo your backbone, as a woman you will not receive the same understanding or treatment and your managers will demean you, whether they are men or women."
good,You start off as a temp an unless you know ur kiss butt you'll be lucky to get hired the hours are long the work is challenging which is nice but ur constantly put down if ur not doing good enough an they dont yall you cause ur a temp they tell ur on site manager
good,Nike was an overall good experience working as a holiday season employee. Most shifts were fun and laid back. I think that the culture for the most part was good but some aspects of the store were a bit strict and unnecessary.
good,"The co-workers were very outgoing and very fun to work with, the managers were always there to help when you needed. everyday in the mornings we would do a huddle talk about our goals that we needed to make for that day, everyone would gather together and we will make a cheer."
good,"I met some of the nicest people I've ever been able to meet at Nike. Along with having a friendly staff, the company prepared me well to deal with customers and people. Unfortunately the management at Nike showed me very shady energy as I came closer to the end of my senior year of high school. I wanted to take time off to focus on graduation and sports and unfortunately I wasn't offered a position back, even though I was recommended to re apply."
good,"To locate, scan, and pack merchandise for elite customers"
good,They company wasn’t half bad. The only issue I had was being a temp and not being able to reap all the benefits. Temp or Perm we should be able to qualify.
good,"Fun work place "
good,Werken bij Nike heeft zijn voordelen en nadelen zoals elke job denk ik. Er word veel tijd en moeite gestoken in het opleiden van mensen en het doorgroeien naar verdere functies. Maar vind dat de communicatie naar zijn werknemers er soms wel minder.
good,"Not the best not the worst. It's retail so what do you really expect. Under paid over worked, so pretty much like every company in the world. If you like retail try it"
good,A typical day at work consisted of helping the customers in finding what they needed. I learned how to engage with customers and not to be shy. The management was good. I liked my managers and they were very understanding. It was a very fun work environment but not for a long term career.
good,"It takes forever to get hired permanent. I applied 3 times in the 2 years that I worked there through the temp service. I know people who have been there for years who continue to apply, but have not gotten hired permanently."
good,"One thing I remember about Nike was the Towers incident, 9-11. They didn't care that this happened that day. They wanted me at work. I was like the walking dead. No compassion at all."
good,"I worked for this company right out of high school. It was very fun and there were many like minded individuals around me. Unfortunately I was working very hard to run the store and upkeep it as a regular part-time sales associate without the help of management. I was doing the work of a manager without the pay or appreciation. It's in my nature to work hard and always keep busy and it got to the point to where they relied on me for many things even though I was not getting any compensation for my hard work. "
good,"low hours and many employees on schedule at the same time "
good,great place to work however glad new management took over. employees always had great energy and the product is what keeps you coming everyday to work its the best.
good,"I enjoyed working at Nike, it was a fun relaxed atmosphere. I think  it is a great part time and temporary sales job :)"
good,Great benefits but not worth the pay. Flexible hours with good discounts but with every 2 weeks pay it’s hard to save anything working there. They do provide a great opportunity to move up within the company.
good,Pretty simple and straightforward job I held there the people were great everyone was respectful of everyone else and appreciated each other and worked well to solve problems and get things done for our customers.
good,Its a great start to put your foot into the adult world however i don't recommend working there past 2 years.  The culture is toxic managers are constantly stressed and treat employees like their replaceable. No type of respect toward's students who work at all scheduling is an issue.
good,It was a really good to have through collage with the flexible schedules. I’d imagine it’s alot more fun to work on campus then the company store/ES or the BOS( warehouse)
good,"groot bedrijf , weinig uitdagende taken . weinig uitdaging"
good,Low pay great part time job simoas was a great company nice to work with fastpace enviroment didnt like the drss code learn about different style of shoe nike community service
good,"A typical day was very boring. "
good,"I do not have a review for this company to share, it was a great place to work with a few disappointments in management. I really enjoy helping people and thrived in this customer service role."
good,i put labels on ball boxes that were to be shipped out. you pack and blow up balls and other related things they may come up for you to do. lots of young people
good,This company focuses heavy on their employees and helps them understand and excel in every way they can. With this they made sure we knew the best products and what each one benefits over the other.
good,"Acredito que assim como as pessoas, as empresas tb possuem pontos positivos e oportunidades de melhoria, que variam de acordo com a evolução natural dos tempos e do próprio amadurecimento. Foi uma grande ex mulher, mas que não voltaria mais."
good,"It was nothing special, was basically your typical workday. Go in work listen to people talk crazy to you, It was just work...................................................."
good,"Buen trabajo, mala gestión de la gerencia, poca posibilidad de ascender, espero que algún día cambie el echo de que un conocido este ""mejor calificado"" que alguien entrenado. Después la gente muy copada. Destaco que los superiores de los mas altos rangos tienen mas empatia que los encargados y son muy buena onda, son los mas copados que conocí después de estar en 6 empresas distintas. Muy humildes."
good,"Hard to get the required work hours per week. Cannot get transferred to another shift, unless it is a higher position than the current position I am in. Management have their picks in employees. Management does not carry themselves on a professional level. Miscommunication often. Hard to make production being an honest employee. Hard to get a better position in workplace. Never know if the workplace is scheduled for mandatory overtime."
good,working in the stock room is a good way to understand a company you can learn alot and progress up the company ladder which would give a high wages and have the weekend off
good,Good part time job with a good discount. They keep their employees well informed of new technologies that they are to be using in store during the sales process.
good,Working At This Job Is Really Easy And Good.The Hours And Pay Is Great Overnight Is What I Worked. This Job Teaches You A Lot A lot About Work And Life.
good,the great place to work at if you've never had a job and is come straight out of high school and is looking for working. help me on my feet and gain a little more  cash
good,"I enjoy working for the company. They have a great management team and group of employees. The only thing is, the staffing agency employees are not credited enough for their hard work and dedication. I myself work as temp. I hold one of the top 3 percentages throughout my shift. There hasnt been anything said to me about it. I think they should value the little guys more sort of speak."
good,"Millones de pesos que se ganan al mes para dar una comisión tan baja."
good,The job was fun however the working conditions are not for people who have issues with being too hot or too cold. There were perks such as discounts which is a plus.
good,"Run reports, oversee the units are getting picked for the order and ensure the quantity is correct and quality is good.  Look up the wave to ensure the cartons got on the truck to get to the customer on time."
good,It was fun to help others find what they were looking for in the store or online. Over-all the management was good but there were a few that I didn't think knew the Nike way.
good,insecure & immature management. Why is it a requirement to review a company we no longer work for? They are not a company I would work for again & this is a waste of time
good,"salary is too low for the amount of work you do"
good,Nike is a fun place to work if your fresh out of high school. Good growth opportunities if your extremely determined and accepting to all negative and positive feedback.
good,"productive and full of multitasking activities. I had many different job titles at nike and never got paid for my extra hard work, however, at the time I really needed the money. I was an auditor, processor, I did data entry, and also trained incoming employees."
good,"The internal performance review process gives too much power to an immediate supervisor; there is no recourse if your assignments, deliverables, or reviews are opaque, unfair, or non-existent. He can drive your career into the concrete based on his own deficiencies."
good,"Everything depends on your manager and the local culture. My manager was great - treated FTEs and contractors the same. Others really looked down on contractors."
good,"Working at Nike is like going back to high school.  It is a company of clicks - heavy preference given to jocks.  "
good,as a seasonal employee i was thrilled to be outfitted in nike apparel. the work environment was great however i was working at nike part time along with another full-time job and could not continue my employment at nike for too long after black friday
good,"You cannot get promoted. They over work you and under pay you"
good,Okay place to work for the first time but the only downside was that you the employee would have to stand for hours on end with very few breaks and short lunch break.
good,"-pay is okay for a part time gig"
good,was a pretty decent place to work for a part time job between college. the bit of money earned helped out to be able to pay for things at college. wouldnt recommend as a full time place
good,"Meetings, learned more about supply chain, new systems, culture was strict due to being hourly. Company not focused on work life balance back then. Most enjoyable part of the job was the people I worked with."
good,Not much to do during the week - any tasks delegated and performed are not recognised. Extremely sales based for performance - no regard to any other work or effort put into the business.
good,Great place to meet new people help customers and have fun! A typical day was to make sure stock and inventory was full and to care for the needs of customers.
good,"Depending on the time of year, a typical day may include 2 or more meetings ranging from project status reporting with team to release management status with all functional IT teams. If you are motivated, you can learn and grow and see advancement. Overall, management is satisfactory, allowing employees to work in a number of settings that is most conducive to them. I was extremely happy working at Nike. I had a great team, knew many people, and we got along fairly well. Nike celebrations were fun and allowed the teams to unwind after a major release. As Nike grew and shed its unique culture, it became very clear that no one's job is really secure, especially if you had more than 15 years of service and/or were over 40. That is the reality today in the corporate world - that is the hardest reality to come to grips with."
good,This was the ideal place to work if someone is interested in working in daycare. This was an excellent starting point for me in the rest of my career.
good,"I worked at Nike Rosemont, IL for a year and not once did they try to give me hours that wouldn't have me traveling back into Chicago on public transportantion after 11pm while giving earlier hours to people that were hired the same time I was that lived very much in the area."
good,Job is boring. I will never want to work there again. Poor hours and i rarely made a $100 a paycheck working there. I do not recommending working there to make money.
good,Discount was great but the hours were not flexible. It was an honor to work at Nike but they should also appreciate hard working employees as well. Overall NIKE was cool.
good,"Working at Nike taught me so much about the brand and the technology that went into every product that was produced, but there was significant favoritism throughout the work place."
good,"Not enough discipline implemented, mostly young adults with weak/no work ethic and poor attendance, environment resembles that of grade school in that leadership generally treats employees like kids and focus more on tyranny than production results for the company, more fraternizing and drama than actual working"
good,Nike is a firm that gives everyone the opportunity to learn and improve their skill. I am honored to work for Nike. I would love to see how Nike can create more awareness to give everybody a chance to participate.
good,It was my first job out of college. It was retail not rocket science. It was a cool company to work for. I worked with a great group of ambitious individuals.
good,its a nice place fun to shop work and be at everyday.The remodel is a nice touch. The team is good funny friendly......................................
good,This place is like a revolving door no one stays at this job for very long the work you do does not match the pay rate they expect a lot for a very little pay if your going to work here you better get there very early very limited parking and security is another story.
good,"When I worked at Nike, it was only part time on school days and full time on the weekends. There were opportunities for ""overtime"" but you had to be careful. A typical day at work is very fast paced, and interactive with the customers. Although I was getting 1$ over minimum wage at the time, at the beginner stages of being just a sales agent you cannot possibly make much over minimum wage & it cannot suffice to help you sustain a living.  The discounts were great, and we had store meetings every month that I hated getting up for at 5 am, but they were very fun. We received complimentary lunch often, especially on holidays. The culture is very welcoming, and my co workers made the job very fun. But it wasn't something I'd invest in long term."
good,"good company and good coworkers, company could have been more detailed with the descriptions of what each worker was expected to produce. Management was good"
good,I loved the energy that came with working at nike. the managers were tough but only because their was always room for improvements and growth in the company.
good,"I am responsible for back stocking, processing and receiving inventory in the backroom. I also fill the sales floor with shoes and apparel whenever needed."
good,"Made sure line was clear daily, pick and pulled order according to order ticket, made sure HIPPA laws were met an that there we no violation nor damage to merchandise."
good,"La experiencia fue magnifica. Aprendí muchísimo de la historia de esta gran Empresa, pero no había muchas opciones de ascenso a puestos de mayor relevancia."
good,"A typical day for me at Nike began with reading emails and checking my to do list from the day before.   There were specific things on specific days that were dictated by upper management and the corporate office that were routine to the management of our designated accounts that were to be completed weekly.  I learned how to be timely and focused in order to add my piece of the team to the puzzle.   Although I may have worked independently, what I did also effected the team so I had a personal goal that also worked with the team goal.  I felt like developed great teammate relationships.  Certain aspects of the job's duties were stressful.  Demands to be diverse & flexible both morally and professionally.  At times, it felt like good customer service was compromised both internally, to the employees, and externally, to the company's customers.  However, I felt it was a great opportunity to work for Nike.  Every job has its good and bad, its ups and its downs, its rights and its wrongs.  It all depends on what you want to concentrate on the most that determines how successful you can be.   All and all, i feel that the most enjoyable part of my job was work with good/great people and for good/great people."
good,"The workplace was really fast paced. Management was very inconsistent, employees were inconsistent. The scheduling was very inconsistent. I did not receive the amount of hours I would have liked."
good,"Not a bad place for someone just starting out, but understand that there will be managers you will likely not get along with, much nepotism and brown nosing, and difficulty keeping a schedule."
good,"They use innovation as an excuse to lay off employees whenever the market takes a turn. There truly is no job security and they even call employees ""assets"" and they consider them disposable in order to meet financial targets. They have shifted strategies to target older, longer tenured employees and outsource whenever possible to save $. At one point this was a wonderful place to work and there are still many positives such as pay, the campus is beautiful, lots of fun activities and athletes on campus, however if you work there just know that you can be layed off at any time. I've seen them lay off hard-working single mothers, great people, with no real reason other than they have to cut a certain number of heads. Very sad. There is a true disconnect between the company values and what is actually happening behind the scenes."
good,"Nike was a great company to work for at one time.  The current trend is to lay-off long time employees only to hiring temporary workers, hire managers who have little experience in what they are managing, and overworking employees while hiring more and more managers.  It can become a great company to work for again if they return to what made them successful, treat employees like an asset and with respect, and value the experience of the employees on the ""front-line""."
good,"Nike is a great place to work if you have time and patience. They try to work with your schedule but can be difficult at times. everyone is extremely friendly and all the managers are super outgoing and easy to talk to. The consumers are always coming and going and some even remember who you are based on your service. the culture of Nike is amazing, it is more than just a brand. once you work for Nike, you are family."
good,"Schedules are from 530 to 530, 2 12 hours shifts."
good,"Nike was a good experience, it was actually my first warehouse ever . It was very fast paste, you have nice co-workers people that's willing to help. It was a good opertunity working with Nike"
good,Cool during peak season not really good if you want to further your career they treat temps like aliens. Only work there to get a holiday check other than that I wouldnt
good,It was very busy the managers were pretty Street I learn self-control the hardest part of the job was maybe standing on your feet long periods of time it was a pretty laid-back environment quiet for the most part but it was a learning experience
good,"Very busy , lots of young people. Great discounts. Its a good first job , theres room for opportunity. You learn a lot about team work everyone is friendly."
good,"I love the company as a whole, its a great company with a lot to offer. But the managers at my store were horrible. They always treated the employees unfairly, they would bad-mouth the employees in the office, they would sit around and do nothing while bossing others around, and the pay was way too low for the tasks that I did for them."
good,Good facilities (Dining and fitness).  Opportunity to travel.
good,"Fun Company great co-workers. Management team lacks communication skills."
good,Okay job nothing serious. More of a teenage job has very little hours but for the most part is a very steady job. Very strict and will fire if you don't follow guidelines.
good,Working For Nike You'll gain everyday skills that allow you to have a more productive day also you meet new people everydsy whom take pride in there position's hardest part about the job was doing more than 2 or more task with only you an your skills most enjoyable part is being able to put smiles on customers faces
good,"The typical day at work is usually easy, loud, and fast paced for a manufacturing job. I learned countless things which helped my work ethic. Management is decent and everyone is nice and willing to help out. The culture is almost like school where everyone has a clique but I usually kept to myself. The hardest part of the job is getting there at 5:30 AM and standing for 10-12 hours of the day. Another one is that there is a lot of false promises and most employees are not in the know so it does not help without much direction. Management does seem to play favorites as well and it is hard to move up and when new ideas are brought up, most are shot down by the supervisor. The only enjoyable part of the job is the breaks and how they divide it."
good,"I was supposed to be a forklift operator  but I was always walking around with a cart picking orders. "
good,very great place to work at. It definitely increase your social skills and your ability to interact with the outside world. it often lacks organization but can also be very challenging.
good,"While there was certainly lots of activity and very helpful and intelligent people, many seemed very stressed and dissatisfied with their roles. It might have been somewhat related to anticipated layoffs."
good,"The pay should be a bit higher due to the long hours and work. The work isn't that hard and the food is good and cheap. Pay is especially good when taking on overtime shifts. Because I am only a contract worker, I don't get the same benefits as permanent Nike employees."
good,The workplace is straight forward and and the work isn't complex. You are able to take all breaks without worrying that you haven't done your job properly.
good,This store is one of the largest stores in the Woodbury Common Premium Outlets.  It gets very busy and your entire shift will be you trying to keep up with the mess.  It does not help that there is tons of employees that do not really pull their own weight.
good,Mooie verloning en je hebt er mogelijkheden om te sporten voor en na je werk. Ideaal voor actieve mensen.
good,"My favorite aspect of working at Nike was the people.  My co-workers and teammates out in the sales field made it worthwhile."
good,"The people and culture are a great reason to work at this company. Internal movement is tough unless you make those networking connections. You can learn a lot about the company however, they are not very keen on external training."
good,"If management doesn't personally like you even if you're a top performer at your store, they will hold you from advancing and try every step to fire you."
good,I really enjoy working at Nike I was the only women there it was a great experience to be working in a warehouse with something I love it was a great fast past job
good,"learned a lot, very flexible with hours, and my position was all over the place - really good place to work if you're into training and other such things"
good,It’s nice just pay rate need to go up. And more hours. Because these 40-50 Hours a week not going to do it & then we be on our feet for hours with 2 breaks. But other then that pay need to go up
good,Very fun and fast-paced place to work. Unfortunately the size of the company and the matrix organization made it extremely difficult to complete work and projects in a timely manner.
good,Typical day at work we would jave to wait on a desk to befin keying information in SAP once we inventoried tje isles we were assigned to.  Management didn't know how to talk to you.  Tje position as a clerk was fine O loked my position.
good,"job is ok not great pay is low but discount is good, younger staff then most retailers avg age of coworkers is 20 something don't have many sunday morning meetings"
good,"The work place is secured and accessible cafeteria including utilities as well as it is well-managed and supervised. Also, lockers are provided for each employees."
good,Working 8 hours a day. Learn to deal for  different people. Enhancing my Product knowledge. Hardest part is when you deal sarcastic costumers. The most enjoyable part of the job is when you convince the costumer to buy a product.
good,It was an ok job nothing to hard or nothing to slow. I just didnt like that it wasnt a set time for me to leave. Which means you leave when the work done and most of the time the work barely lasted 7 hours
good,"Nike provided me with an opportunity to showcase my skills in a fast paced environment. The job that Nike requires you to do is simple and easy but it really has to do with consistency. I stayed consistent in the environment and will often get embraced for it but as far as management goes, well to put it lightly, most were mediocre, with an exception for the head manager, who was the district manager at the time and another few that kept a friendly balanced relationship with the employees. Other than that, the other managers would complain, have mood swings, be rude with customers and employees, and not consistently display managerial skills. The discounts and the people are great and I would recommend the job with a good friendly, understanding, management team."
good,"typical day at work would be, organizing the store making it look presentable and then helping out our consumers wit their needs. getting them the size or style they need."
good,its a typical warehouse job. long hours decent money. i wouldn't work there again.2nd shift get over worked but get paid extra so its up to you how you feel about it.
good,"Nike has many great things about it's work culture and is a fun place to work. "
good,It seems as though all corporate areas have this cut-throat mindset. When in reality it is about valuing the employees you have. This does not seem to be the case.
good,it was a fun job but the pay was very low. they really didnt give alot of hours even tho i was there or a year. the best part was getting free nike gear
good,"Typical day at work involved a lot of maintenance of the sales floor, and slick comments from managers. The most enjoyable part of the job was the culture that Nike is made of."
good,"Nike offers a good pay rate & has several perks for its employee's. The only problems with this company in my opinion is the weekend 12 hour shift. It could be and advantage for some people depending on what you are looking for in a work scheduled, but for me it was a disadvantage & caused some life style problems, but overall I think Nike is and amazing company & is a great place to work."
good,The management and leads were nice people. The environment was not messy and everyone was minding their business working.  I liked working there. just wish they paid more
good,"I love working for the company in general."
good,Had fun working here and the labor was easy. Staff was great but management could not prioritize communication. Great place to work for high school kids and younger adults.
good,"En esta empresa (Convergys) conseguí mayor experiencia en Atención al cliente y a resolver incidencias. "
good,"Nike is a very generous company to work for, they offer great benefits, awesome pay, but the managers in their stores lack communication, and show favoritism. The environment has it ups but mostly its downs, and if you're willing to work hard and not get recognition this is the place to be."
good,I have worked there for a year and if you want to work and not feel appreciated it's a good place to work. When I get there it was alright at first .I at two Nikes The first one I worked there for a year.
good,"Nike is all in all an amazing company to work for. The store i was located in was't the best. The management team lacked basic leadership skills, poor communication styles, lazy. It was just a mess. I use to aspire to move up in the company. I will say the old management team was 10x better than the new guys they brought in. When they brought in new faces, things went downhill veryyy fast."
good,I think they could be better with operation but it is safe and easy to maintain all you have to do is come to work everyday and being a hard worker no matter what task you get
good,A typical day at work will start with allocation of work and working on it.Apart from work we have learned many new things.The thing i didn't like is the workplace culture.
good,When I first started at Tech it was great they had a start up mentality and we got stuff done. Somewhere along the lines when the CTO left to join another company things changed and it was never the same. It was chaotic even for Nike standards and us employees had to deal with it. Eventually I was laid off today along with a large group of people as they re-org again. That said I love Nike I have always wanted to work there and it was a dream job for a while. I would currently avoid tech until they have their re-org straightened out. Their current re-org has been hanging around for the last two years.
good,"Nike is a productive, face pace job. Nike is mostly a seasonal job.I don't like the long 12 hour shifts with no benefits and rarely get breaks and always get laid off."
good,Its retail so it is also alright would not call it a career. People that shop are jerks sometime and will destroy the store but there is nothing you can do other than smile
good,"My experience with Nike was that I was dramatically underpaid for my work. They also require that you wear new, specific Nike outfits about six times a year, yet they take the cost of these uniforms out of your paychecks. These outfits are mandatory and expensive so they really make an impact on the amount of the check. The hours were also unpredictable and very inconvenient. For part tine athletes hours were often scheduled so that it made it almost impossible to have another job and support oneself."
good,"They are a great company if you work full time, but as a repeating seasonal employee there were contractual issues that caused me to leave the company."
good,"The management was friendly and conducive for a good learning experience. The people employed there are overall very friendly However, the flexibility with scheduling is minimal at best."
good,Nike had a pretty great environment with great communication. However boring work and unacceptable pay for someone with bills. Training was quite informational but easy
good,I was not a full-time permanent Nike employee but I was aspiring to be one. I felt it was a good enough company that I wanted to be part of beyond working as a contractor.
good,"-fun busy place to work at never will be bored ."
good,"I started working here after i graduated and i hated it. all the managers acted like they were still in high schoo. Drama, dating their employees, i was so happy when i quit. i didnt recieve enough hours to justify continuing employment there."
good,"Working in Woodbury Commons is a struggle itself, but working at Nike was exhausting. Very unorganized, and had poor management. The athletes would do more work and were interacting with the consumers more than the management, and certain athletes were treated better than others."
good,Work as a cashier is sometimes busy and sometimes slow. I learn how to communicate with co-workers and customers. Management did not show consistency when making everyone's work schedule.
good,Its a good temp services and they don't mess up you pay but they're benefits are bad. I was a picker and what I did was pick what the consumer brought and push it off to processing so it could be ship and into our consumers hands in 72 hours or less.
good,"A lot of fun at times, a lot of work at others. Work can be repetitive and there is no finish line. A young attitude, with a great deal of networking needed to get ahead"
good,Ths job has many perks the benefits are great and you get awesome interactions with customers. hardest part of the job is the holidays it gets really crazy.
good,"Nike una de las empresas numero uno en deporte aqui en lima, como linea de carrera es muy buena seguir, una de las empresas recomendadas."
good,"Travaillez chez Nike est un vrai challenge, être vendeur à Nike c'est savoir être polyvalent que ça soit en magasin en tant que vendeur chaussure et vendeur vestimentaire ainsi qu'en caisse et en réserve."
good,Equipa Jovem e dinâmica. Foco no desporto e atendimento de excelência ao cliente.
good,I enjoyed my time at Nike. I was happy to learn new methods and techniques in my career at Nike. A stable company with a diverse workforce. I recommend it to anyone.
good,"A typical day at work was long hours but fun to work at a store because it was a small store that sales Nike only, learned customer service, house keeping,stock count ,sales , merchandising, pricing of items. Management was very understanding to every employee and pushed us to to better in everything and the cultural at the workplace was teamwork in every we do we finish fast once we work as team and the hardest part at work was selling expensive clothes and shoes to people who can't afford it, I enjoyed the environment of the workplace it was alive and a peaceful place to work at."
good,"Typically I am called upon to help customers with existing problems or design new solutions including the plan to migration from old to new networks."
good,Job requires a lot of walking. Good starter job. If you like to work overtime there are tons of opportunity to do so. You are able to come in on your off days.You can be assigned a part time position and earn full time hours.
good,I learned how to do so much within my time of working for nike. It was a great experience the workers were very helpful when it came to things I may not have known
good,The work environment at the NIKE factory was overly stressful and the management skills of my superiors were sub-par. I learned that any factory style work environment would be unbearable if the management was lacking.
good,Busy athletic work experience with a lot of hands on tasks. Very fast paced work. No time for errors or mistakes. Also fun to work around other athletes and athletic apparel/shoes.
good,I worked here part time in a seasonal position. The management generally has a positive attitude towards work and the employees are easy to get along with. The main objections that people have towards NIKE are the scheduling practices and the lack of work life balance.
good,"A typical day at work was very long and boring. The 12 hour shifts wasn't bad, the managers and team leaders was. The most enjoyable part of my job was leaving that place."
good,It was great opportunity able to connect with different people and able to help them make there lives better by just having a simple conversation
good,Fun and easy going environment. Supports an active lifestyle and helps build leadership. Daily tasks are repetitive and can get mundane with time. Team spirit overshadows individual effort which can be hard for advancement.
good,"Required more extensive product knowledge, dealing with multiple tasks at once and different types of people, required a lot of consumer interaction and loss prevention."
good,it was a little tiring but I was able to work through it. I learned how to box and unbox products to get them where they needed to be. management was ok but some managers I felt where a little rude sometimes. the culture was good I sometimes liked coming to work. there wasn't really a hard part about my job and the most enjoyable part about work was being able to work without managers always watching and letting me work
good,"16-20 hours per week"
good,The office had a small arcade and the people who have worked there for over 15 years are wonderful and full of wisdom.  I learned a lot about soft goods accessories and really expanded my product design knowledge.
good,I learned that my job was hard if you made it hard for yourself and the most part of it all that i enjoyed every bit of the assignment.
good,enjoyed my working at nike. my time was cutt short due to me working through temp service in which whom lost their contract with nike and they released a large amount of employees and i was in that wave.
good,What I enjoyed most about the job is I was able to experience different levels of the job. There was not a certain job I had to maintain.
good,You have to be willing to stand for long hours and meet production quotas. Management varies from department to department. Some of their management stresses productions due to their job title; while other department managers stress quality.
good,"Nike is a nice Company to work for, but it is quite demanding; high workload and a lot of stress, but if you are young, well educated and love sports, this is the place for you."
good,"cible un certain public par rapport aux prix des produits qui sont de qualité, toujours aller vers le client"
good,tijdens de rustige periodes sta je vaak uren niks te doen en dat verveelt
good,"Empresa do ramo esportivo, de médio porte, que ao meu ponto de vista, não possibilita uma carreira duradoura na empresa."
good,"My first month of working there, it was some excitement. But the fun had to stop and more work needed to be done the more work got done the fun we got to see in the work house."
good,"the job role was quite demanding, products had to be presented well and in a certain way, co workers where very nice an helpful but wasn't enough on shop floor if there was a problem or a busy day, management was good as always a manager on shift, i feel that there were days when it was all hard and others when it wasn't hard and the day and job was enjoyable."
good,"It's a good job, but I just want something better. I would like to utilize my skills more in office work. I don't want to be in a warehouse forever, this is just not me."
good,This company is through a temporary service. I do not have any issues with the company at all. I was waiting to see if they were going to make the temp employees permanent.
good,I'm day was started like first I have to brief on how my day was going to be like by my manager then they split us up in groups give us all listed items that we had to find. I learned how to pick and pack management was pretty easy going the co workers was alright the hardest part of the job was having to stand up on your feet so long and never knew what time you was getting off enjoyment of the job was the benefits
good,"Buen ambiente de trabajo con compañeros,"
good,"Very fun work environment but limited room for growth and promotions.  Seniority mean absolutely nothing in the company. They have a ping pong table though and basketball tournaments. Also, store meetings are better and worth going to."
good,its okay it could be better.... its more of the people instead of the job. break room was great and the food also.. they didn't do nice things by sides the give away for us but someone out of house would love it
good,"A typical day would include us folding shirts, greetings customers, interacting with others on a daily basis. Also filling in product on the floor, making sure everything is neat and organized."
good,"Four or three day work schedules, Twelve hrs per day.  Good place to get into at a young age. Hours are 5am to 5pm.  Night shift is 5pm to 5am, 24/7 operation."
good,loved working here just wish i could've gotten on full time. Enjoyable work environment and friendly co-workers. great hours.
good,Connecting with customers and letting them in on your knowledge of all the product and helping them find what they need.
good,"a typical day at work you would need to evolve to situations at hand, management is cool and fun. coworkers are friendly, hardest part of the job would be physical labor depending on the person. most enjoyed part about working at nike is the experience, and my coworkers. they make it feel less like a job."
good,"A nice working atmosphere, the people you work with make it a lot of fun. You get to meet customers that come from all over the world."
good,Its not that interesting when they want you to learn so much in so little time. They don't even pay enough. The temps are told to train temps during the shift. It's a very easy job if someone would take the time to actually train you properly.
good,"Nike is a good company to work for because it provides you with discounts on top quality products. The work environment was good, but is was never room to grow within the company."
good,Sometimes enjoyable but most of the time too busy to enjoy. I learned the basic skills to be an sales associate and learned how to operate register. The management was okay. of the 10 managers only 5 of them knew my name and i worked there for 9 months. Co-workers were mostly friendly and fun to be around. Hardest part of the job was to keep the store under clean conditions when store was busy. Enjoyable part of the job was the discount.
good,Production oriented team oriented really a great place to gain work experience. Alot of in and out as far as temps go but other than that it's an enjoyable job.
good,"Geen specifieke mening ; werken in ploegverband is leuk, had goede collega's ; de job lag me iets minder ; doe je dit werk graag, dan is het een prima werkgever"
good,"A typical working here was answering telephones and taking inbound calls from upset customers. "
good,Shadowing nieuw personeel was niet optimaal. Kritiek geven is first priority maar iets opbouwend vertellen krijgen ze precies niet over de lippen. Stressy company.
good,my best was my first day at work when i got to discover i was to be one of the very first staff to open the biggest Nike store in the whole of GCC. My challenging moment over was the number of deliveries we received for the first day 500 boxes of apparel and shoes to be scan and put in the shells for opening the next day.
good,Employees receive a great pay and benefits. Team oriented . Sports driven. Can move up very quickly if your performance if overall good. Involved in a lot of different activities outside of work.
good,A huge team who are great to work with and good employee benefits. If you like being on your feet and love meeting new people this company is ideal.
good,"A typical day at work consists on overseeing the Shipping and Receiving department at my location. We receive shipments daily from UPS, Fedex and other shipping companies, mostly in quantities of 500 or more. Because we are a clearance store, product is key and pushing new product to the consumer is a must, so a daily challenge is processing the amount of units needed to keep the store refilled, as well as organizing and upkeep of the work area. The most enjoyable part of my day is at the end when set tasks are completed, and my team leaves with the satisfaction of knowing our store is set up for success. The hardest part of my day is finding space for the daily shipments. every day there is a challenge in keeping the work area organized and making sure that my teams moral is high, so that we can keep the flow of productivity on a constant high. Ive learned from this job that taking initiative is key to any sort of success, and leadership and communication with others are one of my strong suits."
good,"The company itself is a good place to work lot of accidents due to management pushing, but the people try hard and care about their jobs."
good,Ok place to work at but the managers are really uptight and very nosey. The coworkers are really cool and fun to work with.
good,"long hard work all the way untill its time to get off"
good,It was a great company but the problem is that they won't hire full time and only do contracts which is inconvenient with anyone that has to run a family.
good,As a client very supportive and  provides a productive environment where one can learn and grow. The management is all ears and encourages an employee to speak out their mind. The job poses new challenges and a employee is forced to think differently and find out new ways to overcome the challenges.
good,"One Team, One Dream is an often heard chant at NikeTown. The team is a very big one and it often times feels like you can get lost in the all for one mentality."
good,"Nike is a good company sometimes bad service but most of the time good, managers were easy to work with and very friendly basically just an easy job."
good,"receber notas programadas e não programadas"
good,This is a great place to work great atmosphere can be very dangerous at times. Hours need to be extended more. it is very face pace you have to be a person who is very energetic in order to work here.
good,"This is a good company to work for. Growing company and promotes within the company. Can be very intense at times, but overall pretty good job."
good,"As and athlete at Nike, all work must be accounted for and logged onto a sheet of paper or into the computer. All apparel and footwear must be processed in the minimum amount of time appointed by management. All request and p.o.s must be filled in an orderly and timely manner. All items must be back stocked in the bins required. This job has taught me organization, time management, neatness, and multi-tasking,"
good,"very boring and was not challenged enough. the people were rather snobbish, as well. My immediate boss was nice, understanding, and I enjoyed my coworkers quite a bit."
good,a typical day at work involves arriving to being informed of the days sales goal and up to date sales performance reviews. upon hitting the sales floor we interact with the customers to grant them the best possible shopping experience. Over my time spent there I have learned many personalized approaches to suiting the customers needs with the appropriate product along with a vast knowledge of all ours products. The best and hardest part of the job is accommodating all of the customers from wide varieties of backgrounds with an outstanding personalized quality of service that has the customer leaving satisfied.
good,The opportunities presented for an intern are wide and allow for time management as well as unique activities to gain real world job experience.
good,"Having this position helped me improve my communication skills, learnt how to manage complaints and confidently handled cash. It also gave me good awareness about the importance of health and safety issues in a hospitality environment."
good,"Llegar al trabajo ubicarme en mi sector y empazar a pagar zaatillas,buena relacion con mis compañeros ,cuando te venian muchas zapatillas te costaba pegar todas juntas alguna me salteaba"
good,"I am currently still here. When I started working at Nike, it was kind of rough due to the opening of a new building and 12-14 hours a day, 7 days a week shifts. Once the building operated smoothly, we were working our normal hours Monday-Friday, off Saturday and Sunday."
good,"The only thing different is that you'll get a surplus of Canadian shoppers throughout various holidays, so peak times are really busy.  The environment is of course sporty and very loose, but not at all relaxing. Super easy job with not very much satisfaction. If you prefer folding clothes and framing shoe boxes then by all means go ahead. This is prefect for anyone in or coming out of high school, and maybe early years of college. You'll have tons of Nike gear and will be the first to see what's on sale."
good,"Working at Nike was my first experience with retail and I've never quite had another experience like it. It was hectic, you had to ask permission to leave even if your shift had ended, customers were okay, the discount was alright, but I dreaded coming to work. Assigned areas made for monotonous workdays. I left after two months and was never more ecstatic to leave a job. The managers were overall okay and I really liked my fellow employees."
good,This job is an good job if you just need something to do while in school. the job isnt all that fun but your coworkers are really what make the job. good discount.
good,Working at Nike WHQ was an experience. It was exciting and fun but it was also a high-stress work environment with little communication and direction.
good,Worked Long hours four days a week. They will train to do almost every job if you want to move around. During peak season work load does increase and overtime does become available.
good,Always work to be done there was never a dull moment. Customers always in and out of the store making good conversation. Good store location to be engaged in.
good,This job was extremely fun. A typical day was fast paced. This job went downhill for me because a lot of consumers began stealing product from the company.
good,"Dia-a-dia no varejo focando em resultados e construção de uma equipe solida."
good,"It was a typical long day but I had fun working with the people. I learned a lot about working in a warehouse. The management was great. The hardest thing about this job was the short breaks, long driving distance and low compensation for the work."
good,"it's not that bad for being retail, but not really the best. management in that store is not the best. I do appreciate everything I have learned there. If they fix certain things I think it would be a better work environment for everyone and for future employees."
good,"Sun & Sand Sports is the largest retailer and wholesaler of sporting goods across the Middle East and offers a wide range of the best sporting brands.As an employee, i had a great experience working on a daily basis with my same nationalities colleagues feels like your on your home country.They also provide training about the Product knowledge, Selling Skills, and Provide good customer service which helps me to improve my working skills. As i was working with them for 5 yrs, they gave me chance to grow and be an Administrative Assistant for the back office work. Filling and organizing our daily basis paperwork. Answering and follow up customer queries. Dealing with the Head of department for the staff and store concerns. it improves my administrative experience. Low salary compensation needs to improved."
good,"Go to work clock in have our morning meeting. do stretch and flex . grab our guns and a cart and go pick items until our cart was finished. i learned that i could not chain pick. which is to not scan one item more than once. my co-workers i really did not talk to many people but my leads and about three other people. the hardest part of the job was to not chain pick if i had over hundred some pieces. the most enjoyable part was to get the job done with my three friends next to me, to make the time go by."
good,Its a factory job that requires a lot of concentration and dedication when it comes to time management and team work. Management is willing to work with you at all cost.
good,My time at Nike was great and I really enjoyed the environment and the staff. The managers was ok..you had some that were jerks but the other managers were excellent.
good,"Received and stocked shipments"
good,"sit, take calls, take breaks, sit, have management review the call stats compared to the entire shift sometimes singled out but usually when the stats are completely low. have a quality review have a call review hopefully get a good survey there is no more to tell as a level 1 or 2"
good,In order to advance in the company you must work to extremes. It is hard to move up in a position without stepping on any one person's toes while doing so.
good,"Its a good place to get your feet in the door if you are trying to move up within the store, or, maybe get to campus in Beaverton, OR.  "
good,"A typical day at work wold be stocking and placing orders. I learned how to work different programs on computers and working with scanners. My co workers sometimes did not do what they were suppose to be doing but they were friendly. There really wasn't any hard part of the job, however, the most enjoyable part of the job was being around my co workers and working as a team."
good,A typical day at work is like any other day pick and some days I get lucky and pack. I learned some new everyday ...communicating with other people and the more I did my work it became very easy and simply to me. You have co-workers like typically people you run into everyday they either don't want to be bother or there very kind-hearted. The hardest part of my job is not knowing if I'am meeting my manager standards as of and employer. But the most enjoyable part of my job is meeting new people.
good,"The Typical Day"
good,"Great company, background and culture.  High energy, fun processes!  Product is amazing, discounts are great.  Sadly, just a few wrong people in higher end positions can ruin a good thing, especially if intimidated or threatened when someone else can come in and lead change.  Nike retail world respects tenure over talent, and can really dampen morale when they allow poor decisions to take over."
good,"This review is based on working on the 3rd floor (women's/kids).  "
good,"A great global company to work for, challenging at times. Product knowledge grew greatly when working for them and interaction with customers was key. "
good,interacting with customers and helping people decide on items.
good,"Fedex was fun because of the people i worked around, my manager was very flexible but it was the rude customers i could not handle."
good,"Working for Kelly Services at Nike, shows the internal operation of all  Nike products. As a supervisor, I trained employees to pack and ship different products and apparel on a timed production scale. Management and co-workers from every department were very helpful in aiding one another for a common goal. The hardest part of the job was training employees that did not want to work. I enjoyed interacting with other managers and learning different aspects of the business."
good,"A typical day at work consists of folding clothes, placing them on counter tops, greeting customers and assisting them with footwear/apparel. "
good,"Worked long 10 hour shifts that consisted of using computerized voice headsets that told me what products to pick out for specific orders. Co-workers were fun to be around while at the same time being productive. Hardest part about the job was working with the headsets in that the voice was hard to understand. We had to configure the headsets to our own voices and sometimes the headset  would not be able to understand our voices as well, making for an annoying day at times."
good,"A typical day was dealing with customer concerns and needs, handle all returns and exchanges, process special orders."
good,It was busy and enjoyable made the day go by fast. People were very polite and got along with each other
good,Solely in charge of the leading the Sales Team to achieve a set target.Focused on maximizing the customers shopping experience.
good,"Um dia de trabalho teria no minimo 10h."
good,"Nike was my first job and at the beginning I enjoyed it very much. A typical day is difficult to say because there is a lot going on always and it's often difficult to stay on top of things. "
good,The brand is very known that is why its so easy to sell. That's one of the reason why we reach our store target. We learn to follow the company standard in merchandising as they will send the guidelines.The problem we are facing only are the availability of the stocks and the management are not increasing our salary for how many years and there's no bonus at all. But still we are try hard to reach our target to collect some of the stock to the other store and highlights the sale items as much as we could to catch the customer.
good,"Working for Nike SA was fun, i enjoyed bieng part of a team that  is so pationately about soprts in gernerally."
good,"Belangrijk om het opgegeven target te behalen. Alle klanten aanspreken die de winkel binnenkomen, en liefst verder helpen. In Nike heb ik geleerd hoe je moet omgaan met klanten en wat de verkooptechnieken zijn. Ons manager was zeer aardig , en ik kon wel opschieten met al mijn collega's. Nike is een wereldbekend merk , zondagen en feestdagen was het voor ons heel druk , dan moesten we altijd goed door werken anders was het niet bij te houden. Het leuke was dat onze uniform een trainingsbroek met een t-shirt erop en comfortabele schoenen was."
good,"No support from management.  Preached on success, but let employees have free-reign of their day leaving only self motivated individuals to do the work."
good,Ideaal werkplaats voor mensen die denken om ergens tijdelijk tewerkte gaan.
good,Very busy traffic in top-notch retail store. Diverse international traffic. Get to sale some of the hottest and trendiest athletic apparel in the industry.
good,My First job out of college it's nice that I can say I even work for Nike. Not much to the job itself its pretty simple. Wish retail employees were able to expand into working more corporate positions.
good,Fun atmosphere to work in however I was only there for a very short period of time so I am not able to give a full detailed opinion. What I did see was that the staff all seemed have freedom with their creativity and everyone seemed to enjoy themselves
good,It was a great place to work. All staff worked together as a team and took extra time to help others when they needed it.
good,I started out as a temporary employee working through a staffing agency and was offered a permanent position with the company.
good,"NIKE has a good work environment with plenty of energy and enthusiasm. I was able to get a promotion during my tenure and was pleased with the pay, benefits, and work schedule."
good,i loved working for nike outlet the energy was always great. and they were really flexable with my hours.
good,"Cool retail job with a good pay and great discount. Definitely a place for sneaker lovers. The managers were ok, some of them, most of them were not really supportive and were easy to write a report on someone for anything. The hardest part of the job was understanding some of the tourists, since most sales were from visitors and tourists of NYC."
good,"Buen ambiente de trabajo"
good,"Dias de trabalhos agitados. Aprende-se de tudo um pouco. Os 4 primeiros anos excelentes, os dois últimos péssimos em relação à direção e aos colegas de trabalhos. Difícil foi trabalhar com gerente incompetente e a mais agradável trabalhar com uma boa equipe no início."
good,"Nike is a place where everyone works collectively towards a common goal. They have a rich history and heritage that permeates every aspect of the daily work life. They have gyms and flexible hours that allow for its employees to take breaks throughout the day as needed and they also have accredited childcare centers for those who need them. The difficult part of the job is the management. If you are in an environment where you are micro-managed, it can be hard to enjoy some of the benefits the company has to offer or to truly establish a healthy work-life balance when you're always watching your back. This isn't the case for all people and all managers, but Nike is a company full of type-As that are always trying to win, improve and figure out the next big thing. If you can't handle the high-pressure environment or do not have a manager that understands the meaning of balance, then this isn't the place for you."
good,"négatifs: "
good,"•	Utilize customer service skills, basic sales techniques, and product knowledge to connect customers with the right product and drive sales."
good,I Was a pick pack selector using a vocollect sytem to pick orders. We also had to pack them for shipping.
good,Energetic and fun environment to be and work in. Learned extensive customer service. Co workers were very nice and energetic. Very busy in workplace. Hardest part of the job may be the general labor which wasn't much. Most enjoyable part may be the foot work and the cool stuff in the store.
good,"normally 9 working hours per day and 1 hour break, "
good,Very professional atmosphere. I never really had a bad day at work.
good,"Enjoyed the job and my co-workers, but did not like how unorganized work assignments were."
good,I enjoyed working in a sports equipment environment. I had great manager.
good,"Visual Merchandising in-store, Visual Merchandising Showroom, Formacion Visual Merchandising equipo de venta."
good,social and friendly.... how to deal with people and respecting and the hardest part was counting money at night and if it was less... 
good,"Fun "
good,It was an okay job. Pay never went up much and the way other employees were towards one another could have been better. The company itself if great.
good,I had a lot of working experience from working with nike for 10 years
good,"A typical work day is fairly easy. If you work on the sales floor, your job is to customer service and complete any tasks asked of managers. Co-workers are very friendly and the environment allows us to build friendships quickly. Management is not very good. I can only speak for the store that I work at, but there is an obvious lack of communication between the management team which causes conflict. The most enjoyable part of the job is the attire. We wear sweats and shorts as staff dress."
good,made sure the sku numbers matched picked correct item packed in right place and scanned
good,"Working at Nike definitely added to my overall communication with the consumer, because you have to be able to fit their needs in terms of what they want. There are some management qualities that could change but overall very fun place to work and managers made it professional but welcoming. The hardest part of the job was probably trying to satisfy everyones needs but at the same time not having the product to do so. The most enjoyable part of the job was some of the nights where you could laugh at crazy consumers that demanded some of the most ridiculous things. Or having training/all employee meetings where we had informational but entertainment and team building exercises."
good,"Selling product, stocking the store, back room organization. I learned how to be part of a team. Management is awesome they care about the employees. ALmost everyone that works there are upbeat people. The hardest part of the job would be waiting for customers when you finished everything else. The most enjoyable part is making the sale."
good,"Nike is a great company to work for, i would definitely work there again, although pay was kind of low."
good,"Decent work area. Kind of difficult environment at times. Although it was hard labor, it was very easy to learn."
good,"assisted other team members in setting up display, cash handling, inventory"
good,"When I was working at nike, all the people were nice and different raise. All the people I work with was satisfied the way I work with no complains. I am fast, hardworker, and never let anybody down. I like helping other people and they need help. I never complain on any job they give me except getting it done on time."
good,I enjoy everyday I go to work I have learned to do things in retail i never thught i could do. I really dont have anything at my job that is hard for me to deal with or do!
good,"Typical day would involve moving inventory to and from the sales floor, receiving and sending shipments. I learned how to make inventory control smooth and painless, the benefits of proper footwear for certain occasions and how to work with people disabilities (mental/physical). Management was easy to work with and positive about the job. Co-workers were dedicated and easy-going. Hardest part of the job was getting all of my department's assignments completed while being understaffed. The most enjoyable part of the job was getting exclusive shoes into the store and showing collectors everything we had in stock."
good,One of my favorite jobs. The pay isn't great but the values and work ethic are high.
good,In the two major outlet their is a lot of traffic. you get to help a lot of people from diffrent places of the world...... most brazilians. You do learn a lot of great work ethics if you are open to learn them. the bigger stores have over 100 employees and it's a lot of competion to grow in the company since a lot of people want to work at nike. with that being said a lot of people don't last and end up just working seasonal.
good,"Good company, busy with a fast pace environment. Management is interactive and co-workers are respectful. Most enjoyable part of this current position is interacting with all the potential candidates."
good,"Trabalhava de segunda a segunda, dificil de descansar prometiam muitas coisas e ficavamos em falsas esperanças. Salário muito baixo para quem trabalha de segunda a segunda."
good,"Would come in pick a cubicle to sit at, put on headset and start taking phone calls. I learned how to better communicate with clients and my computer skilled sharpened signifigantly. It was a very compettitve environment. Bonuses were based on how much you collected per hour. Managers were given teams and thier bonuses and reviews were based on teams success monetarily."
good,busy on your feet active
good,It was a laid back place to work and they seem to care about their employess.
good,Nike has a good culture to take care of their employees. They also provide employees with great opporunities to meet their sports idols.
good,"Over all the work experience was enlightened and I appreciate my time there.They have some good incentives for there employee,  like profit sharing they also hsve insurance benefits.  Znd employees get a discount on Nike products."
good,"First off, the training was very poor and I constantly found myself being asked if I knew certain things because you learn almost nothing when you are trained. This can be hard because when people see that you don't know something while on the job, it is looked down upon. When you clock in you get huddled, usually about stuff that isn't necessarily helpful.  You are told your zone for the day, I was usually in footwear. A lot of the time it is a relatively enjoyable, laid back job where you are helping customers find the products that they need. You can always refer to your co-workers or managers for help if you don't know the answer to a question is. We were also told to always be straightening shelves while helping customers. We were required to try and push Nike+ which, in my opinion is not a useful app. The managers would encourage us to always try and sell it to people even if they clearly weren't interested.  The biggest issue with the job was the huge inconsistencies within management. Some managers would always be watching you and waiting for you to do something wrong. While others you might not see all day."
good,"busy and fastpaced, workplace culture is togetherness and teamwork."
good,Very good place to work at with a very good discount. Weekends were always the worst and having to close. Most enjoyable part is being able to make new friends around your age.
good,"Although I had above adequate previous work experience and gave a seemingly good enough impression during the opening hiring events, I was not quite outstanding in the beginning months...here were coworkers who applied for and were delegated to other jobs that required more diligence and responsibility. However, I was able to quickly turn it around when I got focused and became so intune with the line-ups and routine that I began to really enjoy my job. I did well enough internally with attendance and basic retention of ethos and practices but I would constantly be sidetracked or teased into picking up after other employees. In the end I got 2 little achievements for signing up to 250 people for their app, without a raise or a promotion (or a relocation which I asked about and applied for several times)."
good,The employees were fun to work with but management and the scheduling need's major improvement. They require around 36 hrs of open availability for part-time positions and that is hard to work with when one is a full-time student. Management is a joke because they have a lot of so-called “leaders” who are not fit for the position. Managers will say they will meet with you for a touch basis but fail to fall through.
good,"For a retail company it was great, the pay was above average and you got to meet a good amount of new people all the time. To advance however you had to be friends with the managers. It was very political"
good,"Era rutina de todos los días revisar toda la ropa buscando si les faltaba la alarma, para después estar atento a la gente que entra, revisando siempre los probadores después de ser ocupados, y parando a la gente cuando sonaba la alarma al salir de la tienda."
good,"hours feel long, work life balance feels un healthy but days off are enough to recoup for the next week. benefits and discounts are great. management can be less than understanding about your personal life."
good,"If you work in the plant where they make air soles. Then you will be working with a lot of diverse cultures . As an African American Woman I felt like I was a minority. The pay is low and be prepared to work  4 12 hours days at a fast pace. The reward is that you get 3 to 4 days off straight and shop at Employee Store. If you work on campus lots of perks , and beautiful atmosphere."
good,"They eat their own dog food for sure!   There's a gym in the center of the building with the offices all around it.   Fun place to work, and as challenging as you need it to be!"
good,Great opportunity good customer service   Atmosphere staff and management was great busy days is what keeps the days going I love to be busy. Good discount
good,"Great workplace culture, if you want a fun environment to be a part of then Nike is a cool place to be. If you work retail, work life balance is not the best."
good,Nike is a great place to work but some parts of the building can be hotter than others and some times you might have to over work yourself do to lack of staff
good,"I would not like to comment on this at this time but mostly management.  Job issues with compensation at the lower level of folks working.  they are outsourcing reception, custodial, and maintenance."
good,fun if you are young and are working while attending school. It is typical retail. The workplace culture is laidback for the most part. The hardest part about the job is that he managers give you a hard time if you have any issue with scheduling and availability. It makes it hard to enjoy coming to work at that point.
good,I love the business for what it stands for but the opportunity of moving in the company is difficult unless you bend backwards for them. The discount is great. At times they promise things but never follow through with it. They say the hours are flexible but you must have your hours open throughout the week just in case they want to schedule you
good,"Started working at Nike as a Senior in High School, and it was awesome because of the discounts and literally everyone at the time had a job in the outlets so it was a breeze. But after graduation, and realizing that retail pay is not something you can really live off of in my area, the thrills of working there you start to realize really aren’t worth it."
good,"o Proficiency in Mac OSX, InDesign, Sketch, Illustrator, Photoshop, Microsoft Office, Keynote & Acrobat"
good,"Overall it was good, but not somewhere you can build a career however if you start as an associate unless you wanna travel to different places to move up to management positions. Good employee discount and benefits I believe. Pays minimum wage, no commission or reliable way to make any extra, fairly demanding as far as availability but that's to be expected for retail. Didn't feel like there was much of an incentive to work hard to really improve and better the company cause you get paid basically the same no matter one, raises were totally insignificant. Got a 33 cent raise after my first year which kicked in that September I think, then state minimum wage jumped up 50 cents to give me another raise by default about 4 months later. Difficult to feel valued when that happens twice (happened again the next year). I mainly stayed there because I liked the job a lot and it was a very good work environment, had to quit unfortunately because I wouldn't have been able to afford school. Learned a lot of good stuff there, very glad to grow there overall."
good,L'azienda fornisce di per sè tante possibilità di crescita e di partecipazione; purtroppo in qualsiasi circostanza lavorativa si vengono a creare delle tensioni (forse dovute ad antipatie) chee non permettono la continuazione del rapporto.
good,"Stressful work life and although I miss aspects of it, I would not go back to my specific role. Typical day, especially Mondays are pretty hectic/crazy. You never knew what was going to happen, lots of one offs on top of what you had to get done daily and weekly. Workplace culture on my team was not great, everyone was drained and management didn't really reward/show appreciation. Best thing was summer hours and being able to manager our own time and schedule."
good,You work long and hard and the breaks seem not enough. I've been hurt on the job and you don't get any vacation hours until you work a few months. The pay is pretty low too for the work you do. It's hard to move up too because there are limited roles for leads and supervisors.
good,"The job is relatively easy if you've worked at a busy retail store. The availability for part time workers is a bit much, and they require open availability on weekends. Managers aren't too considerate about your problems unless you're really cool with them. They definitely like to play favorites. Pay raises are minimal, and I feel like turnovers has been high as of late."
good,"Nike has a great goal and mission as a company but the leadership that is hired to operate their DCs are mediocre at best. SOPs are not enforced, cross training is limited, management severely needs improvement, advancement opportunities are rare and based on facilities needs with no chance of transferring. Nike is an excellent company to work for based on the area and leadership you will be working under. They offer full benefits, competitive pay (as of 2016), ESPP at a decent discounted rate based on job level, tuition reimbursement, EAP, employee discounts, and host of other perks."
good,"My department was the stock room. I was over worked and under paid. They expect a lot from you without any questions. They really live by the motto ""Just Do It""."
good,"Ok co-workers medium pace environment ok pay-rate part time job clean NIKE facility, good production management leads and the money is always good also."
good,"wouldnt say long term unless higher position is available "
good,"Position:				Customer services "
good,The company was organized and the people working for the company were pleasant. it was a difficult place to be in because i would spend so many hours there and they always found a way to tell me I didnt qualify for the bonus. I did not get paid fairly.
good,"go in deal with customer. change face out four ways, restock, accomplish management beliefs of opportunity for you. overall fun place to work because of your peers but management made it horrible working there."
good,"Je werkt er te lang als interim (als je geen ""geluk"" hebt). Erna veel tijdelijke contracten, afgewisseld met interimcontracten. Geen logica in het toekennen van vaste contracten (hoe lang je er al werkt enzovoort)."
good,"A typical day at Nike was I went around helping customers find what they needed. I continued to learn how to communicate. The management was good, respectful, and kind. The culture was a casual athletic culture. My favorite part of the job was meeting new people."
good,"On a busy day it is constant movement and multi-tasking and on a slow day it is the same just more is expected of you."
good,8 hour workday. management is also nice. workplace culture is great. most enjoyable part of the job is the light work and hardest part is dealing with the empty boxes.
good,"I genuinely enjoyed working for Nike in Tuscaloosa, AL. Working in a college town allowed for a weekly influx of guests looking to purchase gear every weekend. The store itself was up to date including wireless POSI devices that allowed for mobile checkout across the floor. I myself worked mainly in footwear, occasionally in the Men's section, and seldom on the front registers. I had great managers that were flexible when it came to hours and scheduling."
good,"Although I was young when I was employed by Nike I spent a few years there focused on growth and mobility within the company, I believe if you are persistent with your goals professionally you may be able to achieve them. you may have to transfer. things have gotten much better within the company I had a pleasure working for them, but its always the people that make the job miserable."
good,"Working for Nike was pretty standard retail work. Clock in, move out on the floor, replenish any merchandise that needed to be replenished, and attend to customers needs at all times. While there, I improved my customer relation skills and learned a lot about the company itself, and the various sports in which Nike takes part of. There was no hard parts of the job. The most enjoyable part of working there, were the welcoming feel that every coworker had."
good,"Depending on the team it may have its moment but it was challenging many times from the store I worked in."
good,Management is usually young and easy to get along with. Very strong culture. days become short when you make friends. The hardest part is usually unpacking and shipping trucks.
good,"A typical day is standing around and making sure your section is neat and full until a customer needs help"
good,"Buen ambiente laboral, aunque se debe de entender que la mayoría de los que estamos trabajando en la empresa somos estudiantes con visión de una vida profesional."
good,"Nike is a easy work environment overall, you just need to have patience with customers and management team. it's not an easy job to move up with unless you kiss butt which sucks. anyways the job is fun and the pay is alright for a first job or a temporary job."
good,"I have work at Nike for over a year now as a part timer, and it is a good place to start working. The coworkers are nice and so are most of the Leaders. On the other hand, you work long hours and most of the time you end up with no energy as you have to walk 99% of the time depending of your position. The place ends up being a mess by the end of the day and you have to clean up your section before you leave. aside from getting a raise every year and the daily stress that you get is what makes this job sometimes hard to deal with."
good,"Nada autentico, la mayoría solo lucían, en verdad no aportaban nada a el proyecto."
good,The workplace was hot and can become tiring after being on your feet all day. My co-workers were social and helped the time go by at work. We got paid 10.00 an hour.
good,"Working at Nike was a great experience.  The culture there was amazing and the relationships you build will last a lifetime.  For any college student, I would recommend applying to work at Nike."
good,great  employees. management varies. great place to use as a second source of income. discount is amazing. Benefits are great. great place to networking.
good,It is a fun working environment until you have to close. Consumers destroy the store and you're in there until after your shift must have ended. management could be better.
good,"Mi sono trovata molto bene in Nike, fino a quando non è stata cambiata l gestione interna dello Store. Ho iniziato a ricevere insulti e maltrattamenti da parte dello stesso Store Manager. Quindi purtroppo la situazione lavorativa è peggiorata ed sono stata costretta ad abbandonare il lavoro."
good,"leuke omgeving om in te werken, met veel vernieuwingen en alles is op sport gericht. Gezelligheid is top. Je leert veel nieuwe innovaties van het beste sportmerk wat er bestaat."
good,"Some kids in school are unable to work a lot of hours and at NIKE you are require to have availability to work more than 20 hours, not sure the exact  time but with school, sports and club sometimes its hard to work that many hours. But during break they force you to have availability on Saturdays at least at my store. Also sometimes they would have you work when you already told them you cant work. The people were great but the managers did play favorites. "
good,"Laid back environment cool people to work with 4 days off 3 days on best schedule you can ask for,great benefits packet only real downside about Nike is the compensation."
good,A busy company with several managers and employees. Some may be overly petty while others value hard work. Most employees find it difficult to keep morale up after about one year.
good,"Amazing critical experiences available daily. Projects that most companies shy away from trying are the daily norm to deliver. Everyone I worked with is really intelligent and talented in the work that they do. The Matrix Org-chart and culture is an acquired taste, but the secret sauce of how Nike works. "
good,"fun job, but the management is horrible. they cooperate with your hours, are very relaxed. the management is bad at communicating with you though about checks."
good,Day shift position did stitching on shoes. Piece work lots of heavy lifting  lots of stretching to make leather pieces fit developed  tendonitis had to leave on rye commendation of my doctor.
good,"Its a hard working environment, but as soon as you get use to the day routine is more enjoyable. "
good,"Fun place, personally I found life work balance difficult. Overall good, if you are into retail. I worked in a Factory store and some of the policies and regulations I found a bit odd."
good,Nice place to work if your young and love to be around people. You get good discounts on clothes and shoes. The people are nice which makes time go by fast. Good place.
good,"Managament at certain stores be careful you could care with your heart about the company but they are quick to stab you in the back for something simple that shouldn't require much but a discussion.  They act like they have your back but they do not be careful, you can move up in the company but everybody is cut throat once you get into management."
good,"it is always pleasing to work in a friendly environment, multicultural work area. and working with motivated people. "
good,"The Indian operations have been there for long"
good,Your run of the mill retail experience. Nothing great but its a good first job. You show up work your shift and leave. But the people there are generally fun to work with and if you have a passion for the product the discount was great.
good,The company and culture are enough to draw in the best talent from all over the globe. Everything moves fast and everyone is hungry and competitive to move up. I've met some of the most amazing people at this company but the process and bureaucratic nonsense make the environment unpleasant at times.
good,güzel bir çalışma ortamı olan mağaza yönetim iyi maaşlar düzenli
good,FUN JOB. as a college student  aren't too many better retail jobs out there. discount was amazing and just a fun young culture.  not easy to advance UNLESS you are committed to making nike your career and network.
good,When I first started the people I worked with where great. Over time people left for one reason or another. Within a year there where only a handful of people still there that I started with. The new people that came in change the whole work culture and made it more difficult to work together as a team.
good,"Good place with good work life balance. Good and understanding people, but management can be better. Worked as a contractor and would recommend to others"
good,"great place, first time factory job. easy work, long hours, great days. lots of breaks, over-nights worked great for me. management was nice, but very strict, the people were the best and worst part of the job."
good,"Policies constantly changing so much so that employees cannot keep up with it. Managers often don't have their employees backs, and are not on the same page as others, here you will just be another number but they will give you a good discount so some people think that it is worth it. After two years you start to understand the management and logistics and you realize how much of a struggle it is to work here."
good,"I usually worked cashier, but also helped with apparel and shoes as well as fitting room. The employee were nice but management didn't communicate well or work with their employees very efficiently. The hardest part of the job was having no holidays off to visit family, the most enjoyable part would be the employees."
good,"easy going environment, fast paced, little work life balance. pay is good benefits are great, they sell you on dreams of movement, nothing happens. Typical retail"
good,It's fun for leaning more about team building and a fast pace environment. Awesome products and decent pay. Management could use work and development thus develop team more efficiently. Workplace culture is gossipy from top to bottom; a lot of personal issues at work. Loved working with customers and getting them fresh gears.
good,"Nike is a great brand.  There is much promise for anyone who can put their head down and come to work with a sense of urgency and purpose.  The tasks are very easy at entry level (athlete) and become more complicated as you promote through the ranks.  The pay is comparible to other retailers, so don't expect too much because it is NIKE.  Yearly pay increases are based on performance and are substantially small.  They range from 0% to 3%.  My recommendation is to focus on getting more hours instead of making more next year.  Promotion gives an opportunity to make more money, so work with that in mind. The most enjoyable part of the job was working beside people who were realistic about where we were, what we were doing, and setting realistic goals.    Luck would favor that you work for someone who can help promote your career at the same time that they are promoting their own.  The employee discount is 30% plus any promotions.  This will bring some products down to cost levels, but for the most part, Nike is still making money on your purchases.  The best part of the job was the pride of the brand and the base level team."
good,The hardest part can be staying on your feet for 12 hours. They are very strict about breaks. Lunch is only 30 minutes. I would not recommend starting as a temp unless you're willing to wait 9 months to apply to Nike.
good,"Process shipment, cashier, customer service, review schedules and punches, train employees. Just wasn't getting paid enough."
good,team environment fun easy a lot of room to grow large staff constantly changing product leaning understanding the brand and the market around nike
good,Working here was enjoyable with long hours dedicated to maintaining a clean work environment. I learned how to greet and talk to customers. I worked well with management and assisted them in many areas.
good,friendly place room for advancement if you work hard  free clothing is a big plus as well as coupons and discounts  of clothing  good job for young people as well as older ppl looking to make extra cash
good,Promotions are extremely hard in this company it's a matter of who you know and who likes you. Great equality and diversity within the company.
good,Overall job itself is a piece of cake but in order to work here you honestly have to have a high tolerance for BS and nosy people. Sometimes you may go in to work and things would be so unorganized. Some co workers are generally good people. Some only have one thing on they agenda and that is to get you out and make they self look good. The most enjoyable part of the job was working with others and the 4 breaks
good,"I came to work with high energy helping out customers,enjoying my job. My co-workers and managers didnt do the same which caused other customers to leave the store. Its almost impossible for only one employee to help everyone with no assistants"
good,"good teamwork."
good,over all good company to work for in the sort experience that i had within Nike. good coworkers in the maintenance department very knowledgeable. 12 hour days were good for my schedule.
good,Long hours. Standing for long period of time in one spot strained the back and legs. The work was average flow. They change rules and guidelines on short notice. Atmosphere clean for the most part. It was a typical warehouse job.
good,"My typical day starts with pulling of fresh report, allocating work to "
good,A typical day was like coming to work learning things and get it done and go on home. The most enjoyable parts was lunch time.
good,Working for Nike is a lot of fun. The environment is great and the products you sell are second to none. For the amount of money they make they should better compensate employees.
good,"I learn customer service skills, learned so much about sneakers. I never had the knowledge of sneakers. I can tell you what sneakers are meant for what purpose"
good,Nike is a good place to work if youre looking for a part time position or if youre in high school. The management is okay and the job is not hard at all once you get into the routine of things. They have a strong team-like work ethic and you will always feel welcome.
good,"Good Place to Work & Grow, Lots of responsibilities & deadlines"
good,A typical day at work involved exemplary customer service followed by store maintenance and record keeping. The management was very stern on meeting sales goals and sometimes overwhelmed associates due to goals.
good,Nike as a company is considerate about their workers health and wellness. But they do not look into their stores personal issues as long as the store is making the money the company wants.
good,"Trabajar en Nike fue una experiencia muy enriquecedora "
good,"Набрался опыта работы с клиентами;"
good,Underpaying job coming in. Nice people and workers though. Job can be flexible at times. Management is great and understanding.
good,A Fun and fast pace active environment. Sports heavy and the people are great to work with. Have to show great customer service skills always be on your toes to make a sale. Everyone offers a helping hand and shows a great amount of team work. As far as growth goes you can become very stagnant waiting for opportunities to open up and as soon as they do they are very choosey on who they will move up or they will bring someone from outside the company to fill a position which would be a little upsetting to the ones who have been in certain positions for years looking for that room of improvement to greater yourselves within the company.
good,"work environment at the company is a friendly laid back atmosphere. "
good,A typical day at work was customer service most of the day and stocking by the end of the night. I learned how to properly customer service and also learned a lot of technology of the product. The management is not the best I've seen they did pick favorites and were a tad bit disrespectful. It was always fun and positive with all the co-workers. The hardest part of the job was communicating with the foreign customers we have come in every day. The most enjoyable part of the job was being to see the smile on peoples faces after making them happy with anything they needed.
good,"Overall, I think most employees at Nike enjoy their jobs and what they are doing, however, the management can be hit or miss.  The hardest thing I experienced was frequently changing project scopes and the inability of management to make a decision.  The culture is very relaxed and it's not uncommon to have a stocked ""beer fridge"" in each group.  Most of the people there are nice."
good,The people and culture at Nike is fantastic. I have wonderful coworkers who I look forward to seeing every day. We have a tight knit group that feels more like a family then spending the day with a bunch of strangers.
good,"Working at Nike Canada Ltd. I was the main Data Entry clerk for the Receiving department. On a daily basis I was to manually enter all confirmed authorization numbers within the system and prepare them for processing. Any product system discrepancies would be addressed to me where I would have to find a solution in order for that particular product to be processed. Front desk reception relief would be covered on a daily basis, and when main receptionist was absent I would cover front desk fully. I would also do coverage within the Consumer Affairs department and authorize any defective product returns. I learned how to multitask within this company as there were many departments to be covered. Prioritizing my work was essential, but mainly the communication skills between my coworkers and myself is what maintained constant flow.. The most difficult scenarios would be when very large returns needed to be processed within a specific dead line, this is where team work was crucial. I highly enjoyed working for this company as all the computer skills, customer service - both inbound and outbound was gained at Nike. This is what persuaded me to continue my education within the administrative field."
good,"Fast paced & Fun Environment"
good,"My review of nike is fair, All though its a great company to be a part of, but I feel if you are not an athlete or big name of some sort you can't really ask for the necessities needed to accomplish the task at hand."
good,"Over all great place , too many bosses in one building in my opion but it was very fun team orianted i just think the mangers should get it together"
good,"l'ambiente lavorativo era davvero stimolante, in quanto , avendo quasi tutti l'eta' medesima, potevamo scambiarci idee ed opinioni in ambito professionale, con piu' disinvoltura."
good,"Utilize customer service skills, basic sales techniques, and product knowledge to connect customers with the right product and drive sales. Build the bond between consumer and brand by providing superior service and adapting brand stories to the retail setting. Maintain knowledge of various store departments and be available to operate cash register for regular transactions, perform shipping and receiving duties, stock the floor, perform cleaning duties, and build visual displays when necessary."
good,Very energetic place to work at. Management is very friendly. Customers can be a bit picky (but that's retail). Wish the store wasn't so overstaffed
good,The most enjoyable part about my job is my co-workers. They make me laugh and I feel like I have a wonderful support system. The hardest part about my job is dealing with difficult customers. I always try to be patient and if I need help I call on a manager.
good,"Busy Days for the most part,simple work but it keeps you busy, management is excellent they really care about the employees. My co workers are nice and work really hard. The hardest part is when we have to have product put up in a certain amount of time. I enjoy the people."
good,smart people
good,The warehouse had good climate for most waether conditions and the staff and employees were kind and considerate when asked to assist each other in meeting poduction goals.
good,era muy bueno entretenido motivante con todas sus horas al dia
good,"I've learned how to keep work stations neat and tidy for employees but mostly customers, and how to interact with costumers when it comes to being on the sales floor and/or in any part of the workplace. I work with friendly people, who enjoy coming to work everyday and serving customers. I enjoy interacting with costumers, making sure when they come in they are able to receive help and are able to feel comfortable in the store."
good,"Customers that shop at Nike are in much more need of assistance than many other retailers because much of Nike's products have special features that set them apart from other products that look very similar. So progressing through this company, it's crucial to learn the ins and outs about all of the Nike product because it's guaranteed that you will be asked about them from customers regularly. Co-workers are great in the sense that they really do act as a ""team"" and help one another out. It's fairly easy to keep the sales floor and fitting rooms maintained since the store is small in size, so it's much easier to monitor and keep up with the volume."
good,It was a fun eviroment to work in. I enjoyed working with my co-workers and the customers where great.
good,No work life balance. Schedule changes every week. No clear distinction of management and junior mangemt roles. Constant reorganization.
good,Best part is work life balance and quality of life.
good,"There is so much that you can learn about shoes and their technolegy, its very interesting at times. My co-workers were great for the most part, although management could be alot better in means of bumping heads and egos. Hardest part was keeping up with constant technolegy changes within the shoes."
good,"Nike is a typical retail job that offers minimum wage. Willing to work with weekly school schedule, but difficult if you have another weekend job. They provide seasonal work uniforms for you which I thought was very professional."
good,Binnen nike heb je de mogelijkheid om door te groeien maar daar komt redelijk wat bij te kijken. Je moet een doorzetter zijn om door te kunnen groeien.
good,Nike revolves around a team atmosphere and wants people to be the best that they can be. it was a fun job and i learned a lot about the technology that went into the material and the shoes.
good,"Ambiente lavorativo giovane, con colleghi  disponibili."
good,Great place to work and I thought it offered me an experience where I saw having a job in the mall in a more positive view. Also the job helps with having better communication skills.
good,"Goede sfeer onder collega's; plezant dat je daar ook kon sporten samen en dat er regelmatig personeelsfeesten waren."
good,Depending on where you are zoned the job is different but the goal are equal. Nike is not like any other retail job in a good way and you are able to tell from the beginning. They strongly believe in being a Nike family and working as a team.
good,Supervisor never knew what we were gonna do kinda winged it everyday walking around looking for work. Not enough hours went home early alot. Places you in departments you didn't sign up for when it's a lack of work.
good,Loved working for Nike although it was brief! I worked in the apparel department and it was fun to engage with customers as well as keeping items stocked on the floor.
good,"It was actually a great place to work. Too much cattiness with sales associates though. They were very unwelcoming and not helpful to new workers. Some were great, but others were horrible. Some would speak nasty about you in group texts you were in, like teenagers. Would love to go back, but i rather not work with children. Rather work with a team."
good,"Hire individuals that are truly right for their position.  I knew more than my Asst Head Coach having no retail or visual background what so ever. Definitely wasn't a leader in the position, more like a follower that had no idea on how to lead, coach, drive or inspire."
good,"At the beginning of my employment with Nike was great but Management got moved around and state falling apart.  Employees are barely getting appreciated for their hard work for the company.  If I had a choice to go back, I wouldn’t because it’s always about the company and never the employees.  Nike should appreciate all of them, they are who help send out products to customers."
good,"I had an ok experience while working there, some days were better than others but in all honesty it’s just another retail job and that’s how you should treat it. They throw fancy titles to the positions to help make you feel special, and that’s all good the the first couple of weeks but then reality sinks in fast."
good,"It’s easy to fall captive to being a consumer as a Nike employee. I would advise one to only buy shoes that are on sale, as that way you will be able to have money as you normally would, working a part time job."
good,"After clocking in, I would walk down onto the floor to women's footwear and make sure the isles are fully stocked. If they aren't, go up to the shipping and receiving warehouse to pull out whatever product is needed. After making sure the isles are filled and the team meeting is over the doors are opened. As customers enter, I'm constantly greeting and answering questions for them on whatever product they desire. I took on the challenge to also learn how to work the register so I could help out in busy hours and to fully complete the customers buying experience."
good,Great benefits except the pay is not great.  Managers believe they are above everyone else and have double standards when it comes to punctuality and other things.  Hard to progress and not always catering to you especially if you’re a student or need full time hours. Nearly impossible when you move from the sales floor
good,"Revisión del inmueble, supervisar asistencia de cuerpo de limpieza y seguridad, supervisor de funcionamiento de sistema, ara de cajas."
good,"lo que mas me gusto del trabajo era atender a muchas personas, a la tienda por ser muy conocida atendia a personas de distintos paises, lo que me permitio desenvolverme bastante, como estaba de apoyo en la empresa aprendi el orden en la bodega, trabajar en caja, reposicion y orden de los productos etc"
good,Its a great company but advancement is difficult and management is not consistent. Also the management is all over the place. Great benefits and they can be good with balance.
good,Empresa seria y con prestigio en el mercado laboral
good,Fun place to work. If you aren't a manager it's difficult to live off of $13 an hour. Managers are easy to get along with however they tend to carry an attitude with them for whatever reason.
good,Wages are poor but the total compensation package makes up for a lot to be desired in wages. I worked in manufacturing at the AMI plant in Beaverton and morale was very poor.
good,It’s a good place to work when your younger but for a long term job I wouldn’t advise it. Nike has some good benefits but not enough to live on your own.
good,"Good company , awesome benefits I just wish they provided different hours and the pay was more , we get so little for working long hours . We have our own cafe area which is also good"
good,Starts out as an early day with preparing the store to open up daily. Always lots of work per day and always a task to keep you busy. Fun work environment though and have always enjoyed working for the company.
good,"Working at Nike was definitely new for me. A typical day would include folding 200+ shirts constantly, being in departments that I should not have been in, going back/forth to the back of the store, constant cleaning, working past the scheduled time, working with 80+ people a day, etc. Management was a hit or miss. They were great for students in school, but within 2 months we were hit with only 15 hour weeks. What I did enjoy was the bond with customers that kept coming in and the knowing of new releases before the public did."
good,"Good place to begin working, however not the best retail experience, could be better. Management was very contradicting and did not always appreciate ones hard work"
good,"Nike is a very special company, there are two ways. either you like it or either you don't. If you the culture suits you than you have an amazing place."
good,"Regular sales job. A day at work consist of checking in with a Lead , going over what the goals are for the day , and then beginning your task which include any and everything to help consumers coming into NIKE get what they need. NIKE goes above and beyond for their consumers."
good,"I didnt like the way they showed favoritism between temporary employee and permanent employee,but the food was good .the hardest part was the long standing."
good,"Caisse "
good,"NA"
good,It was a great work place with a great staff. Clean and organized stock room as well as the sales floor. Offered flexible work schedules and fair wages
good,"Great work Culture to work with Elevated Smart Players. Very process driven. complex matrix , strong learning curve. Nicest group of players to partner with"
good,it was a pretty decent place to work at other than having to wear the same red Nike shirt everyday and going through security wasting bout 5-10 minutes of our time. then we couldn't check our phones for emergencies not unless a supervisor was with us
good,I didn't mind working there but they should allow temp service people to listen to music and talk as long as they are doing there work. They should be able to move around more. and more comfortable mats to stand on
good,"I really enjoyed the people that I worked with at NIKE. I felt that the job prepared me for a professional job in the future, as we were unable to simply text managers or do last minute shift changes. We had to adhere to the schedule and plan accordingly if needing time off."
good,"I like working at Nike. I like what i do, and i have a desire to do what i do which allows me to put my heart into my work more than others. I love the discount but that is not why i like the job. I’m big on organization and neat. Providing an easy way for the team to work and better service the consumers."
good,"I worked at Nike as an Athlete (same thing as a sales rep) as a seasonal employee during the summer. You work 8 hour shifts, getting 2 15 minute breaks, and one hour long lunch/dinner break. The managers were nice and fun, but push you to keep up with demand in store. The best part of working at the Nike Factory Store was the discounts you receive. I got 30% in store, and 40% online."
good,"The company do not care about their employees, only about sale and revenue. Although it is a good environment to work, the managers made it quite unpleasant to do so."
good,Everyone is extremely friendly and helpful. You can always count on a team mate for a helping hand. Management is very understanding. Workplace culture is laidback. Most enjoyable paid is learning about new product and engaging with consumers and being able to find exactly what they need.
good,"Provided great first impressions and customer service"
good,"Busy, fast paced and high energy environment.  Nike has always worked hard to create a good work-life balance and they still seem to follow that to some extent."
good,"your selling shoes and demonstrating customer service. management isn't the best but not the worst, mostly chill environment. black friday is a crazy experience."
good,"Overall a great company with good energy. Often trips over itself. I found the cross functional projects often had low participation, little accountability and too high turnover. A young workforce that leans a little heavy on the life side of work/life balance."
good,I love NIKE as a brand but the recent management change has been horrible. The new store manager (head coach) hardly even shows her face in the store. The culture is horrible since the new management took over which is a shame because it used to be a great place to work in. Many of the workers no longer care about the basic things due to the dysfunction of management.
good,Cada dia aprendes algo nuevo. los compañeros siempre te ayudan con una sonrisa. La principal función es atender a clientes y saber los productos que hay en tienda para poder ofrecerlos con la mayor soltura
good,Good temp job. It had a lot of room to grow and you can become permanent if you work hard. They train you in multiple positions so there’s always something to do
good,"Very fast pace and extremely long hours. But to get through the day it is very important to keep busy. Enjoy your work environment. Also, to stay focus on the task at hand."
good,Management was not great but it helped me grow and understand what I had to do to become a better professional which I am thankful for and I believe its very important.
good,"nike is a company with long hours, tedious work, physical work, no career advancement, low pay for long  hours but has great benefits, discounts.and  fund raisers that i do enjoy  getting enveloped in"
good,It was a great job. Very fun they treat there employees greatly. All the employees are very friendly. They do a good job of actually working as a team.
good,"on a holiday weekend working in the outlets is horrible, but you learn who are the regula bulk buyer and who is there ti get a good deal. bulk buyers where always the nicest ones"
good,"A fun and engaging atmosphere to be a part of, team driven and management is very hands on with the associates. compensations is definitely lacking, at least when i was there. Disclaimer it has been almost 5 years since I work there."
good,"Nike is a typical service driven retail setting. Nike changes the culture slightly to give it more of an athletic or team oriented environment. "
good,"Workplace culture is often centered around sport and energy and as such is generally enjoyable."
good,Enjoyed the traveling to different countries and working with staff to assure top quality in product. I was able to learn a lot and build confidence in me with travel.
good,Too many responsibilities/high priorities/too many and unreasonable multi-tasking/high expectations with no or small recognition/managers lack understanding of their job role.
good,"Jobs are and should be a motivating place to work.  I loved working for Nike.  They loved to win as a brand.  The hired amazing people.  The do not always manage adversity well.  When things are great it is an amazing place, when it is not you are the one who feels like it is your fault.  Way to many leaders for what you do.  I like a company that runs lean and not fat.  Right now they are trying to lose weight so they can be lean and everyone feels it.  I have been through this a few other times with Nike.  "
good,"Brand team works harder than most groups on campus. It can be a grind with a lot of politics. "
good,"Not a bad place to work, the only thing that I dislike is the amount of work hours given.one week you can work 40 hrs the next week you can work 10. also there's really no room for growth and the raises are mediocre."
good,"I love working in the store especially for the reason that it is family oriented environment. Being miles away from home has never been easier. There were disputes with the previous management, nevertheless all sorts of disputes were handled professionally. The job however gets too easy. Other than being able to build rapport both with my colleagues and customers, there has been a vast improvement on my interpersonal communication skills."
good,I learn how to find the row and go on the row and pick items from the boxes and name the cart. The hardest part about the job is you have to walk around alday.
good,I enjoyed working for Nike warehouse but some of the supervisors and leads had their picks but when I switched overnight I enjoyed my job plus I became a trainer and was training new hires and that was a great experience for me.
good,Managers can instantly ruin the job for you if not liked. Besides that if working full time or being a manager its a good job with great discounts that kinda make up for the stress.
good,"Just assisting customers with whatever concerns they had, as well as stocked and socialized with people. "
good,"great culture and product. the company is great. "
good,The jobs is usually pretty fun even though there are no thank yous and barely any acknowledgement of hard work. The most enjoyable part of the job is the discount/
good,"This was a long time ago.  There is no distribution center now so I can’t recommend working there…  At the time, they had contracts with a temp. service that lasted for one year.  After that time, you could get hired on.  I opted to get another job closer to where I was living."
good,Its a cool place to work and just interacting with the customers from all walks of life can be pretty cool. Seeing a person smile when you help them out and give them knowledge about a product leaves a smile on your face.
good,Un ambiente joven con ganas de tener una actividad de trabajo saludable y responsable.
good,Work hours were short and unsorted.You will have to work on multiple task a day cashiering  also replenish the sales floor. Fast pace work environment.
good,Nike was a good cool job but they work based off production and fired people who wasnt working fast enough but the work wasnt that hard at all and the pay wasnt bad
good,"A typical workday is me taking a shipment of merchandise in on the truck, processing it and getting it out to the sales floor."
good,A typical day at work for me goes by well. My coworkers and I work together at a fast pace to get the store nice and neat. I've learned to work as a team and many patience with people from around the world. The hardest part of the job is dealing with the different types of people. They come from all sorts of places speaking different languages and we have to try our best to assist them. But they also make it an enjoyable experience just because we get to meet so many people from a variety of places. The customers are so wonderful and they make working something to look forward to.
good,"Nike is one of the biggest brands in the footwear game, and there great at translating emotin through footwear........................................"
good,"During my short work experience, I have learned that employment need to be valued.  Work is not measured on the hours worked, but on the accomplishments made during those hours.  Due to my age I sometime lose opportunities and wish I was given more recognition and opportunities.  Working at Nike I enjoyed every minute of it.  Management was like family and coworkers became brothers and sisters.  Unfortunate due to my mode of transpiration breaking down and the lack of funds to repair it I had to resign."
good,There is never a typical day at work. There is always something that will spark up your day. I have learned a lot from this place and will use it from here on out. Co workers are very nice. The most enjoyable part of the job is interacting with the community.
good,"Customer Service"
good,"the job was very stressful and i ended up barley having free time due to mandatory shifts on weekends. The management is terrible, in the job description it says work monday to friday but when i got the job the started giving monday to saturday or you would risk losing the job."
good,The starting pay for the hourly employees could be better. And there leads or (A) bands should make more with the responsibility the management gives them. Sometimes the a typical day could be 10 or 12 hrs. The hardest part of the job is the people you are working with. Nike does give great benefits and good discounts.
good,"I would take a seat at my desk, begin to take calls about customers problems. The hardest part would just be dealing with angry customers but the challenge was nice to take on. I enjoyed speaking to many different people throughout the day."
good,The management was out of order but the work space and people are amazing. The schedules are great if you do well you get first picks. Just like any job this one has its perks and cons.
good,"I would clock in and give the ideal customer service experience. (Bra fittings, shoe fittings, pant hemming, trial run, etc.)"
good,"educational, challenging and fun lots of thing to learn and study."
good,"Fun Work Experience ,Can be stressful at times. I think they should pay more based on all the work you do. Adidas pay more then nike does."
good,"Gostei muito de trabalhar nessa empresa tinha bons benefícios e eu adquiri boas experiencias começei como operadora de caixa e fui promovida a vendedora, a equipe de trabalho era muito legal, a unica coisa contra era a carga horaria não sobrava tempo para vida pessoal"
good,"In order for you to have any advancement with this company, you have to have your entire life dedicated to it. Which means your attendance must be consistent as consistent can get. You have to be cool with all the managers in order to have some sort of manager support in that aspect. The co-workers are fun and its almost like having a family away from home. Of course there are cliques but its pretty much diverse. Co-workers can be lazy at times which makes for a lot more work. They are always hiring. Especially teenagers. This is not a job for people who have real responsibilities unless you are willing to dedicate your life to them in order to get to a managerial position in which they do nothing except stand in front of a computer or stand around and talk to one another."
good,"Fun place to work, advancement can be competitive but overall great place to work. Competitive work environment.  Great managers.  Good culture.  Encouraging work motivators."
good,Love the people I had to manage. My day consisted of insuring the product we received made it out on to the sales floor. all policies and procedures were followed.
good,"Nike retail is very fast paced.  It offers high level experience in operations, inventory management, and financial planning.  It is an extremely competitive environment which cycles through many employees.  Very different dynamics among management and not always a consistent approach.  Most enjoyable part of the job is the product, energy, and community involvement."
good,"An average work day is typically long and busy. Production is a must. I'd usually walk in and attend mandatory morning meeting prior to starting my shift. Then i set up/program walkman or scanner, i locate the product it directs me to, and either pick or pack products. As a restocker you wait to receive products off of conveyor assigned to your specific area. Scan the products, record inventory and stock the shelves. As a processor you mainly interact with customers via phone and process orders into the systems data base to be filled. Its a well organized work environment but you'll be busy from the time you clock in to the time you clock out. Co-workers are very helpful and they all believe in communication and team work."
good,always i enjoy to personalise the official football jersey with customer names and the numbers.its a most chellenging part of my job.becouse the name or number which im printing should be perfect and accurate.mostly i got the customers appreciation on that.
good,"I work for a contracting company, not Nike directly. Most of the work i do isn't complicated, realistic expectations of the contract and client are sometimes an issue. For the most part, i would say pay is 'ok' for the workload, however advancement is nearly non-existent unless you spend a lot of time getting your name known to management. The idea of an internal promotion is a dream, how well you do your job is meaningless as long AS you do your job"
good,it is okay but I worked at better places with an better environment. The management that I was under was a little rude. They don't make you feel welcome at all.
good,"A typical work day at Nike was very high paced.  Nike is one of the busiest stores in the mall and you always have to have high energy while on the job.  This is the type of environment that I like to be in.  There was a very diverse group of customers which kept the job interesting.  I would always get wrapped into some very interesting conversations.  The biggest thing I've learned while working here is how to handle a fast-paced environment.  After mastering this, I started to set the pace for the store, and other employees would work with the same intensity.  I learned how to be aware of my surroundings while focusing on a specific customer.  I have learned many leadership skills as well as customer service skills."
good,I love the Nike brand and what the culture stands for. Live energy in the work place.
good,"todos os dias chego vou para minha area quando estao todos no caixa saio vou pras vendas ou estoque por que aqui a gente tem liberdade para explorar novas areas, aprendo todos os dias na minha area todos os dias novas experiencias, todos da liderança sao prestativos com a gente conversamos como amigos nao temos diferenças, converso com todos na loja fico feliz por ser assim por que nao é em todo lugar que isso acontece, a parte mais facil é lidar com todos deis dos funcionarios aos clientes o mais dificil é que eu pego 3 conduçao mais isso nao mi impede de vir todos os dias."
good,Fun place to work but General Manager needs to own the store.
good,"Mi valoración a grandes rasgos es buena."
good,"its a good company to work for, just some management isn't good"
good,"-The Nike Factory was in the mall which was fun and exciting"
good,"a typical day at work pick and picking orders. You would like how to make sure you are picking the right items. Co- workers are great people to work with, but the management team has to come together to make it a better work invironment. the hardest part of the job is not knowing were to put a missing item at. The most enjoyable part of the job when you learn some new."
good,I connected incredibly with the staff but sometimes I felt left out of certain things and a bit ridiculed if I didn't know what was going on. I also feel as sometimes I tried very hard to make something perfect and it went completely unnoticed.
good,"Fast Pace, Busy, Great people to work with , Great with hours but when slow season comes barley any hours"
good,"High paced enviorment, very strict security, fun work place"
good,"nike is a more diverse atmosphere. nike also has a good way of showing thier appreciation,likie bonuses and raises. in conclusion, is the best company i have ever worked for"
good,A casual day was going in and having a group meeting always talking about products and what the goals are for the day and week and we’re we we standing. Having communication with all staff at all times was fun when slow we would talk a have great communication.
good,They definitely stress and work/life balance. AWS is a definite required skill if you want to be available for multiple projects as it is a highly used environment.
good,Overall a motivating environment to work in. The hierarchy or leadership is pretty brutal and things move very slowly. The style guide is very strict so it doesn't allow for a ton of flexibility.
good,My experience working for Nike was a bit fast paced. I was a mixed sorter and the work environment is good. I started January of 2017 and ended at March 2017
good,"Working at Nike is amazing only because of the people you work with. "
good,They are basically about getting the work in and shipping it out because your on a time frame and as a certain time for the orders to be in and out with no errors
good,It was a fun place to work. Low amounts of stress but with that came with low pay and some uninterested workers. They offer a nice discount and great quality brand.
good,The people make it super fun to work here but the bad part is you don't get any weekends off unless you ask 3 weeks in advance. The team leads and coaches all get one weekend off once a month built in so it's unfair that they can't do that for us. The pay isn't the worst but at the same time for being NIKE they could pay a little more. Also I feel that sometimes they just care about sign up rather than connection with the consumers.
good,"a typical day at work was stressful and crazy"
good,Bueno y agradable.                                       Ha
good,Nike has been the best place i’ve worked at so far in my life. It has the nicest people and coworkers also payed very good. i had a lot of fun there and will never forget it.
good,"Work was easy, I worked in the stock room, management was ehh but they gave you free Nike gear for working with them. Busy seasons made it fast paced."
good,Is a good starter job. Busy focus on customer service and balancing keeping the work place organized. Allotment is nice plus the 30% off. 2 free shots per year.
good,"Nike peut etre performant a bien des niveaux technologiques sur les produits, mais manque cruellement de basiques coté management. Le temps manque cruellement a tous les niveaux manageriaux et bien plus que dans d'autres entreprises de commerce.A aucun de mes différents postes, je n'ai pu travailler sereinementr avec le temps nécessaire."
good,"I learn to do differents jobs all days, is a good experience. I recomend to everyone have the opportunity to learn different kind of work and earn money."
good,Its a great place to work just doesn't offer any opportunity for growth unless you've been employed for more than 5 years. Education doesn't really seem like a big deal there.
good,"Buen ambiente y buen trabajo pero podría estar algo mejor , buen trabajo en equipo"
good,"Management blend in to assist in leadership skills only when required, however, most of the time they allow innovation of team members."
good,"really good fellow team members, lots off fun events and great experience. lots of people always friendy faces and surprise visits. build great relationships with coworkers and great opportunities for advancement for some."
good,"Walking and standing for such a long period of time. Not always Enuf work to go around sometimes. Pay goes back an forth,constantly being sent home because of the lack of work but on some days your being over worked and it's not appreciated"
good,Nike is a fun place to work mostly because of the people you get to meet and work with but the pay is bad for a part-time position downtown and also taking into consideration that it is a multi-BILLION dollar company. The management is alright. Like every other job managers have their favorites.  Would recommend to anyone needing a part-time job as a college student. And dont get your hopes up that youll move up fast within the company if you get the job. There have been and still are employees that have been with the company for years and have gotten very minimal promotions with low pay.
good,Love this experience different climate employees made the life of each store love my store because it was most selling in sales.... We took care of everyone
good,"I enjoyed my time at nike but the managers are not good at their jobs. They pretend to care about you and your life but talk about you behind your back. They make it hard for you to enjoy your shift, it became too stressful for me and was interfering with my life outside of nike. During my time at nike, I can definitely say that they have pushed several employees away. I thoroughly enjoyed the discount and other employees. I will say that i learned a lot working for nike and can use those tools elsewhere."
good,work long hours. how to work independently as as work with a team. management could be a bit more hands on. culture is like high school all over again. hardest part is working in heat from equipment. spending time learning.
good,"it's a great company as far as what they do for the culture, but management at some locations don't really push to get to know their employees goals.."
good,"The Nike culture is very cool. It is retail so it has its ups and downs, people have different reasons to be there. The system is annoying, the scheduling system is not the best."
good,"the jobs salary and benefits were excellent however, im glad it was only a temperary job due to it not being a fun place to work. i applied for 8 hours, however was basically working full time on late shifts."
good,"A typical work day was were very quick paced and fun. when you clock in everyone is very welcoming for your day. I learned how to operate a cash register, aid customers and their needs, I also learned how to communicate effectively in frustrating situations.  Work place culture were very diverse ethnicity of workers and the music was appealing to everyone. The hardest part of the job was learning the new information everyday however it was possible. The most enjoyable part of the job was the flexibility of work."
good,"i learned a lot from this, from being 0 to 10. lots of customers take a shot to buy their own pairs. specially on holidays.this company is recommended"
good,"The culture of working at Nike was a nice characteristic, but not all employees would follow this culture and lack the work ethic, and some times management was not as organized"
good,If you do your job nobody will really bother you. The only thing manager really push on the sales floor is online sales. This company encourages everyone to stay connected digitally which is a cool thing.
good,The hours were crazy but I enjoyed working at Nike. The management was good. There was a delay in communication sometimes. I would recommend working here.
good,"This was my first job I ever held. It was fast-paced and a lot was expected of you, whether you were in footwear or apparel. We had to push mobile sales and nike.com sales. Towards the end of my term, we started getting new management that was subpar. Overall, it's a good place to start working, but I wouldn't recommend being there for longer than a year."
good,"Aqui se trata de demostrar lo que tienes, la capacidad para vender el articulo, tienes que ser muy abierto, con el fin de llegar a  vender."
good,"Nike is a fun workplace but managers tend to put a lot of pressure on you. There are many policies and rules to abide by, but the salary and holidays are excellent."
good,Era una empresa donde se tenia buen ambiente con los demas empleados y los superiores.
good,"Cool company and great discount, but very low pay in stores for the amount of work you do. Hours are not the best when it comes to VM (retail hours and overnights)."
good,"Es un muy buen trabajo, hay medios tiempos y fines de semana excelentes para estudiantes. Aprendes mucho, sí te adentras lo suficiente, seguro entrarás en el mundo del deporte, pacticando uno."
good,"receiving and processing product, sending the product to the store to replenish what was sold. there is no hard part but just alittle physical and the enjoyable is the Nike culture"
good,Great staff to work with and great pay if working full time as a young adult. Throughout my time working at nike i developed lots of life and work skills which i will carry with me throughout life.
good,"Strong learning experience with great exposure with amazing benefits.Have learnt enormous skills sets like business planning , cross functional alignment."
good,"Foi a melhor empresa que tive a honra de fazer parte, junto a inauguração da loja, criei bastante laços, fiquei quase 3 anos na empresa onde eu era muito feliz e realizada, sempre fiz de tudo pela empresa pois sei o peso que ela tem no mercado e ela sempre nos recompensou de todas as melhores formas, tanto com salário, vale refeição, premiações e outros excelentes benefícios... É uma empresa que pensa no funcionário e no crescimento desse vendendor, caixa, estoquista seja lá qual for a função, então eu sempre tive muito prazer em ter feito parte dessa grande empresa onde eu pude aprender e colher tudo aquilo que eu busquei de conhecimento, passando por todos os setores e conhecendo todos os processos da empresa."
good,"Loja com muita procura, mas pouca compra, para o consumidor comum, mas muito bem estruturada e bem oleada."
good,"advancement and bonuses every quarter made the urge to try to make sales a plus.  if you want more hours, all you have to do is ask and if you are a benefit to the company, you get noticed and tapped for advancement."
good,"Nike is a very up beat and diverse retail store that specializes in performance products for the greatest athlete. "
good,Love working with other people because you not only learn from them but you teach as well. Different enviroment is a good source of living.
good,I liked working for nike was a good learning stepping stone. The managers were good people and so were my coworkers. Most days i looked foward to going to work and i cant say that about every job i have had lol
good,"It was really exciting at first to work for such a notable company, however the pay is not great for the service that you are expected to provide. It is an overwhelming environment where customers are almost always unsatisfied. You are expected to go above and beyond to make sure that every customer leaves with exactly what they want. For the most part, the company relies on electronic devices to look up more product and order shoes for consumers but they often fail to connect to the provided wifi and make the process even slower. Management does not communicate effectively amongst each other and especially not with the associates. Asking for anything may take up to two weeks for an actual reply. "
good,"Great events at vibrant venues. Good marketing experience. Face-to -face interaction with potential clients. Helpful in developing networking skills and lead generation. Focused on leveraging the Zico Coconut Water brand. "
good,"In my final 3-4 weeks there just felt bad, like something was going on. I numerous times tried to quit but always got some reason why I shouldn't."
good,"Working at Nike Outlet was mostly fun, the managers were not very nice and they had favorites. The co-workers were sometimes fun but if you are sarcastic I wouldn't try to use it on them."
good,"A typical day at work would be, hitting the floor. Shoes on display as phones are ringing every 15 seconds. Hardest part of the job was dealing with dissatisfied customers. The most enjoyable part would be  talking about different shoe concepts and releases."
good,Days were good but due to school could't manage the time. Location of the store was really good and as its a well known brand so the store use to be very crowdy.
good,"Nike was a very fun place to work. I met people from all cultures. The benefits were great, but the pay was not good. They did giveaways for the employees twice a year. It was really nice."
good,"Meet merchandising standards to a ""T"""
good,"seasonal only because i was in high school at the time but was very cool qorking there, so many great coworkers and customers"
good,management aside this was a great job. because of issues with management you have low pay little to no advancement based on actual work experience
good,"Nike on  a day to day basis consists of driving KPI's, ensuring delivery and replen is as efficient as possible to maximise sales potential, leading and coaching a store team of 5 on any given day."
good,"When I arrive at work, I go see my supervisor to check in.Working at Nike, I've learned to stay positive and commited to my goals set daily. Our coaches aid us every step of the way by keeping us motivated and focused. My teammates are supportive and keep commited to providing customer service. The best part is knowing that this company will always innovate for the future."
good,Very nice co-workers! Some management very strict and unforgiving of mistakes. I went home crying a lot. Very nice in the start. other managers were great and made you feel appreciated and not completely replaceable at all times.
good,"The stores are kept in good shape, upbeat music, coworkers are pretty cool and easy going, the most enjoyable part of the job is being able to have fun while at work."
good,good hours
good,"I wouldn’t work there again the commute and the pay didn’t weren’t worth it, I thought the people were very nice but the I didn’t see myself moving up in that industry."
good,some tasks are very difficult to get the hang of its a fast paced job if you get the press line good place to start out young and move up in if you can but its a more who you know then what you can do
good,"Nike was okay, I would go back if I had the chance to. The food was great the work was easy and most of the people are kind. The managers could be more helpful."
good,"The team at nike was good. I was together with every one and had a good time. The work was a bit annoying. Some of the days, the customers were rude. The work is nothing special, you have to learn how to deal with customers. I did it very well, I guess, but its time for me to search for another thing."
good,"Great culture at Nike. Development is huge with the company. You may not move up, but you will be prepared to move up. Safety oriented company, but still allow employees to enjoy there music tunes."
good,"I am enjoyed my job , it was good think to learn for future ."
good,I wasn’t making enough money to support my home plus hard to move up depends on if management know and like you not on Job experience. I heard however they pay went up I was in quality only making 10.75 wow
good,Nike is a fun work environment if you really enjoy anything to do with athletics. The seasonal time is a busy time to work but the management have plenty of holiday events for the crew.
good,the schedule is great and gives you plenty if time to do things outsude of work but the coworkers are to invasive and try to throw you under if they feel like you are trying to outperform them
good,"They over hired and I was never trained in properly, but constantly yelled at for not knowing what to do even though I wasnt trained.  The managers were amazing women who portrayed a confident and safe work environment."
good,Theres good hours and flexibility if you are a student. you meet alot of cool people with the same common interest. there is a good employee discount and the employyee store is amazing
good,"Cool company, fun people, boring e-commerce postion, was not the right start for me. Loved to switch to a different role, but that wasn't an option within a couple of months."
good,"good environment to work at"
good,"Picking , packing, and being knowledgeable about products. Fast paced and very on point. Being able to meet numbers and knowing my job task. Knowing that my Job was complete"
good,"Was a great experience working in such a beautiful location however if you are looking for more there isnt much to offer. "
good,"repetitive work making shoe soles for nike, 12 hour shifts, one week 3 days the next week 4 days, so all together you work 7 days in two weeks. Management depends on your supervisor whether they like you or not or if they think you are a fast and great worker. Worked with great people but there are a lot of people in the building but gossip always goes around. The job was not that hard but it would be hard to work 12 hours for some people. Most enjoyable part of the job is you get to meet a lot of interesting people from different countries."
good,"Its been a very exciting journey at Nike with varied experiences ,the global exposure has been phenomenal  .The freedom to operate is there ,the work culture is informal"
good,Nike is a fast pace environment where our customers are number one. Nike allows the athlete to be versatile as far as the work place goes.  Working in different areas of the store really helps me to be versatile in the work place.
good,"My typical day at work was to be unloading the trucks, and what I have gained is I have became more physically active and stronger when unloading heavy boxes from the truck."
good,"Mostly , You by yourself, management comes around every so often. What i learn was the shipping and picking. The hardest part is the walking around the whole time warehouse ."
good,"Great place to work while in school, great resume builder. Experience with management varies. Great energetic youth environment. Longevity and welfare depends on work ethics."
good,Ik vond het werk opzich heel fijn maar de omgeving was wat minder.
good,Nike was well put together just wished some of the managers did a better job at making it fair to all the employees not just a select few but other than that Nike was great
good,"great place, if like work in a warehouse, with benefits and discounts, hot conditions, great opportunities to advance, work really great people and management"
good,"Great benefits and fast paced environment if that's what you're into. The management was cool, however they're not very lenient of staff needs as far as understanding."
good,Answering 1-800 line calls from existing accounts. Job itself is pretty easy going and great culture/people. Management needs to focus on being leaders and not micro managing.
good,a typical day at work is standing up all day and sweating. The most enjoyable part is lunch and going home. co workers was pretty laid back.
good,"Started my day in there back of house doing pulls for the floor. "
good,"Nike is a great company to work at. They promote health from the mind, body and spirit. I've worked with a handful of strong and hard workers. Granted they weren't rewarded no championed."
good,Working at nike wasn't horrible.  Retail isn't exactly my cup of tea but I can definitely see why someone who is into retail would enjoy working at nike.  Great work culture with fun energetic people.  Atmosphere is usually a positive one which really helps.
good,"A typical day at Nike for me required a lot. I was a full time visual merchandiser and really enjoyed being there. The energy from other employees was great to see everyday. I came in every morning to replenish the floor, re-merchandise product, change mannequins, check for new product, looked over allocation grids, etc. I learned a lot from working here. Arranging a whole store by the product that is selling the best and what we thought would grab the attention of our target market. Always coming up with new ideas to improve the business was challenging, but felt rewarded when accomplished."
good,good company to work for. Its just not stable enough for a full time job. sometimes we only have 2 days of work in a week. The pay is great but most people need stable jobs. Co workers are great. Jobs are basically easy. and the company provide free coffee and tea.
good,I enjoyed working for this company. I gained experience about the warehousing business. I left this job to attend college.
good,"Nike knows how to take care of their employees with generous discounts that are extended to the families of employees.  You will definitely work for the perks though, as expected, Nike is busy around the clock."
good,"Travailler en tant que RH opérationnelle dans le flagship de la marque m'a permis d'acquérir une expérience professionnelle extrêmement formatrice. J'ai été en poste au moment où le magasin devait effectuer de grands changements pour accroitre son rayonnement, et a fortiori celui de la marque : Nike devenait le nouvel équipementier sportif de l'équipe de France de football à cette période. Il a fallu à la fois assurer le bon fonctionnement de la vie salariale au quotidien (paie, tickets restaurant, organisation du temps de travail, arrêts maladie, visites médicales, procédures disciplinaires, ...) et remplir les nouveaux objectifs RH liés à la politique d'accroissement de l'activité en vigueur (recrutement, modulation, intégration, ...)."
good,"typical work was in the mornings, i learned how to find product make sure the customer is happy with what we give them. Co-workers were ok to work with. The hardest part of the job was maintain a accuate rate. the enjoyment of my job is getting to know my co-worker and be able have good relationship and positive work ethic"
good,"Well Nike would be a nice job just we don't get many hours, but I work with nice people that shows me my mistakes without attitudes. Then have people in there that act like they care.Then sometime I drive from Coldwater, MS for just 3-4 hours a day for $8.00 which really just gas money. Therefore I'm looking for a job to start off part time then make my way to be Fulltime. I have learned a lot about just working in a warehouse. Which not bad because I'm a people person and don't mind working with a group of people to get the job done."
good,A good Nike day was when we had alot of work to do. When we had alot of work to do the time went by fast.The hardest part of the day was when we had so many same days that had to go out before 8pm.
good,"Been working at Nike for a few months. Its your basic retail job. The work is really easy, nothing out the normal. Work more than 5 hours, you get a hour break. Job is really great but Management is what drove me away. MUST HAVE 40 hours of availability for each week w/ your weekends are free. So they schedule you anytime during the week. Not good if you have classes or a 2nd job."
good,"Provide premium customer service to make others want to return to service with Nike. "
good,"Nike was a fun place to work. As long as you're willing to learn, they're willing to train. There is a lot of room to advance and most of the management team is willing to help you get there."
good,J’etais Stockman dans un factory c’est vraiment super bien quand on est avec une bonne équipe
good,VAS goed teamwork pauze beetje kort valt mee labelen.  Lunch perfekct
good,"nothing to really say, its pretty much like a regular retail job. Staff was like family and I really enjoy speaking and helping customers on their specific needs."
good,The environment at NIKE is real laid back and family oriented! We definitely stress the value of family and hard work! Nike is a place where you learn to bring your best everyday. Because that’s what the best do. You.put your best foot forward despite the circumstance. Nike has also shown me that they care about their consumers and athletes! Great place to work
good,"I didn't plan to end my employment! I had been there for almost 15 years and they out sourced my position. "
good,The managers definitely need to work on communication. There is like 6 managers but no communication and that's stressful!!! You CAN'T run a business with NO communication. The work place is amazing though and a lot of fun. I really enjoyed being there. The people you work with is like a second family. And I will NEVER forget that.
good,"Laid-back environment, not a lot of focus on IT teams.   Just Do It is very real there.   A good is being had by all.   Management is great but overall easy place to work"
good,Flexible hours. Rocking booming all day. friendly environment. Enjoyed every moment. Great team. Discount plus fam too. Easy tasks. Able to balance work & social life.
good,Fast pace working environment and the people are friendly and helpful. The food is great and not costly. I liked my job but I was hired through a temp agency and my job ended. If you get hired straight through the company a person makes more money and better benefits.
good,"Working at Nike you get to enjoy being a part of a team. The company really strives on store culture. Working as a manager, you received free merchandise to be worn as part of the uniform to help drive sales."
good,a lot of talking and typing and resolving consumer issues. can be a loud environment if everybody is talking at one time. the management team is good. hardest part is the rude consumers
good,"I started out as a seasonal worker. Over the four years I've worked there I've moved up to a full time position. Advancement within the company is very limited. The company would rather hire outside rather than using the employed there already have. At the location where I worked, it was a lot of confusion within management."
good,fun experince great  job it was  fast past and lost of hard works. I learned how to work as a team. really like the streches in the morning really helped The hardest part of the job was the constance packaging all day 8 hrs strong.
good,Worked with some of the most inspiring people. Great work environment. Most enjoyable part was seeing customers faces when satisfied with product.
good,"•	Continuously growing my product knowledge and helping with knowledge of the team."
good,"Fun job to build on your customer service experience. Not a good job if you have bills to pay. Look at it as a fun summer job. The co-workers are fun as well as the management, they make your day at work worth coming."
good,"Nike, Inc. is an American multinational corporation that is engaged in the design, development, manufacturing and worldwide marketing and selling of footwear, apparel, equipment, accessories"
good,Hire people who are not so rude when they are giving orientation for new hire. The people there they are very rude and stand off. When u ask them something they get very smart.
good,Each day was the same. Would come in and attempt to reach sales goals. Although it is a group environment the job is also very individual based. Good stop gap job.
good,"Muy buen ambiente laboral, apoyo para aprender cosas nuevas, facilidad de horario en caso de emergencias o actividades personales y muy buen trabajo en equipo."
good,"A empresa e Boa horários bons organizações ótima a gente era uma equipe,com único objetivo alcança a meta é bom ama o que faz adoraria de trabalha de nova na loja mais agora como vendedora adoro trabalha com público se precisa vou trabalhar  no estoque de novo.nao tem ruim"
good,"working here was okay. Starting was fun but you do not start with hours. if you want full time you have to work your way up, i don't know if that's changed. overall it was good, lenient, fun at times."
good,"great place to work , cool client and very well organized management team  and good place to learn new things and very friendly environment to work  ."
good,"Fantastic company to work for, unfortunately the HR team and Regional management, do not support you, then hang you out to dry, to hide their own failings of their lack of support for their Head Coaches"
good,Fun experience.. It is super fun and you meet some of the best people. It was easily the best job I ever had with the worst management I have ever experienced.
good,This is a good job to start off with. You can advance quickly and they have great benefits. The management there was pretty professional and actually cared about each employee as a person. They give you giveaways and you get the best discount on shoes.
good,Working at Mike was also fun I got to see all the shoes before they enter the stores I could really work at my own pace at Mike the only thing I didn't like is we could wear nike while working there
good,"Possibilité de mobilité géographique de par les ouvertures des magasins européens."
good,"Great environment, opportunities to meet good people. Not enough hours available. It's the perfect job for students or a part time second job. Overall I can say working for Nike has been an interesting experience."
good,"Grato ambiente labarol, staff comprometido con el trabajo de la tienda"
good,"Typical day of work involved selling shoes, helping customers with clothing as well. Having to learn the product knowledge of all the nike products in the store. Co-workers are very friendly and outgoing. Right away they introduce themselves to me and they want to get to know me. The most enjoyable part of the job is getting to know the customers by interacting with them. Sometimes they would become my friend and exchange numbers or emails to get in contact with each other outside of work."
good,I love working here they really care about their employees. I learn differnet techniologies in differnet items and I share with the consumers how they can use them to their benefit
good,I love that when i arrived to work there was already work to be done. I learned how to take on multi tasks n accomplish them in a timely matter. The managemt wasn't goos at dealing with problems within employees and handling them professionally.
good,Destaco el trabajo en equipo y el gran compañerismo que hay.
good,Nike taught me a lot of valuable experiences both as an athlete and as an individual. The culture really helps you grow into a better version of yourself.
good,"it was a nice place  to work as a teams , i was so lucky to make friends in workplace as my team . it was my first experience and it was nice and fun."
good,"Over all this was a great place to work. The hours were great and mangers were great , they also were very helpful and dependable. It was just that the workplace was to hot. There was hardly air flowing thru the work place."
good,Being able to learn how to maintain the ability to use more electronic tools to help throughout the workplace. Meeting new employees everyday and being able to get the job done.
good,I just did a freelance gig for them.  We were hired by an outside company.  Our performance was out at the Red Rock Hotel in Las Vegas.  The people that I did have contact with were all great.
good,"I worked in  retail as a customer service. I work in the basement where I would ascend the sneakers to different floors. I would transition sneakers that were not making a good profit. Also I would deflate the prices of a lot of product that were not selling fast enough."
good,"Being in the sales floor for the nike mall was really fun for me, especially because I am an outgoing person and really enjoy helping the people out."
good,I worked at Nike through a temp service! The people I work with was nice and very eager to help me learn the aspects of doing the required job. The most enjoyable part of the job was we didn't work holidays and meeting new people.
good,Nike was a easy job I am a hard worker so it didn’t take long for me to adjust to it just the managers wasn’t so professional including the employee but overall it was an easy job
good,"The workplace culture is very family like. Everyone was welcoming and inviting compared to any other job I've had. Although, management does need work I think. There are selective people they like and will only attend to rather than give another person a try or just to teach someone how to do something new."
good,Wasn't enough money to provide for me and my son and the managers where never to be found when I had a question. I learned how to pick and the only thing that made me like the job is that I can see all the new shoes before anybody. Some of my co-workers was very playful and some was hard working like me.
good,Era boa mais com horário ruins e trabalhava todo dia tinha hora de entrar mais não de sair
good,"We can't provide any information about the work environment it does need improvement available upon request. "
good,Maaş çalışma koşullarına göre çok düşük prim alınamıyor alınsada çok düşük miktar
good,Its a weekdays work. from 7 - 3:30pm. i have learned to be flexible with my co-workers. On how to work properly with speed. The management is ok. The workpace is spacious which is good for the employees. the most enjoyable part of the job is that we have done the qouta...
good,Work on a line as a team.Process energy-efficiency air units for shoes nike brand shoes. Demonstrate accuracy in the assembling of air units.
good,Great company but some stores have Managers that dont represent what the company stands behind. They treat employees like their always replaceable and not valued while threatening their jobs weekly if numbers are not met.
good,Just what you’d expect for a retail job. It’s good for leaving school or college but not a job you you would have as a long term as the pay isn’t as good
good,"Great place to get your typing speed up. Some nice people, clean facility, nice coworkers, training was good.  Breaks and lunches were never on time because you would be on two chats at one time and they could take up your whole day.  Customer feedback and review was not a positive for me in my work life, left like I was a failure."
good,"Biggest issue with Nike is that while the designers got paid really well and got to go on great retreats, most of the rest of the employees received low pay."
good,"Being a s full time student, this job has gotten me through school. The environment was fun to work in and all the other employees I met were very friendly."
good,"Fast paced environment, always something to do for the most part even keeled atmosphere good if you need a little extra money on the side.  In terms of career advancement it's possible but very hard most places u can obtain in home but with certain Nike locations you have to relocate every time u want to take on more responsibilities"
good,"You need to be a shameless self-promoter for long-term success at Nike. It is not a meritocracy. Your work cannot stand alone; you must constantly sell your ideas and market yourself. Power Point is essential. There is also a significant bias to younger people, preferably with top school credentials (including MBA). The company is relatively successful, so it's hard to knock. But you can also see that the internal salesmanship has led to many missed opportunities to improve products and financials."
good,"Everyday is basically the same just selling the products to the customers."
good,"working there was very easy, it helps if you pay close attention to what you are doing, the coworkers are nice and friendly, the most enjoyable part of the job is that their is more positive than negative that happens when working there.l"
good,Nice environment with constant flow of customers fast pace a lot of rules and restrictions on employees. Versatile with positions short breaks new clothes from Nike
good,"Associate job was good at the time, however, there was a lot of workplace drama, very little hours, and no training or certifications offered. The pay was competitive for the work being done."
good,"Overall Nike Was A Nice Environment, However The Staff Wasn't A Great Team Player. If I Had A Chance To Return I Would Apply Once Again And Just Take What I Accomplish With Me Why I Was There Along The Journey."
good,"restocking is a pretty laid-back thing to do, half of the time. when you start getting work,  you'll stand busy most of the time frame.But so far its ok to work there."
good,"A GF Guarani - NIKE Store é uma excelente empresa para se trabalhar. "
good,"referring to retail jobs."
good,"Great place to work,you can move up easily,  diagnosis are cool,  discount on shoes and clothes,  they will hire temps after grace period and you will receive benefits"
good,"Awesome and amazing until  the mid 2000's when every decision was based on saving dollars.  Company of have and have not's!  Enormous trench between mid-level managers and VP's. Plus significant layoffs every seven years.  Culture destroyed with ""experts"" brought in from every corner of the Globe."
good,Management was absolutely terrible. I will never work there again. They don't care about the associates' schedules or them being in school. They only cared about themselves and were rude to others.
good,"* orderpicking"
good,"the atmosphere is very light and you do not have to work that hard."
good,"A great part-time job. My co-workers where all cool, though I have to keep learning new names before my store is always hiring new people."
good,"Pochi lavorano tanti chiacchierano."
good,"very fun to work there everything is done in a team. Meet new people from lots of different cultures, and they always treat you with the upmost respect."
good,"Worked as a color designer for nearly 2 years. The company culture can be heavy to deal with every day, but the people you work with make it worth it."
good,"Nike hires and promotes people who do not take coaching and mentoring seriously, despite this being the one aspect of the job they promote the most when recruiting you. They do not have any type of real accountability for athlete performance when it comes to metrics, yet as a manager you are personally held responsible. Nike is not your standard retail store. Labor is never an issue because of such high margin so they have athletes work 8-10 hours a day even if it is slow. Upper management “leads” with a stick versus trying to inspire and grow the leaders beneath them. Upper management micromanages leaders and if you do not go about your leadership style in exactly the way THEY want you to , they deem you not to “fit” in their team. If you want to go to work everyday have fun, mess around and not actually have to build your business, this is a great place for you. Work like balance is horrible, some upper management makes you work every weekend even during off peak times of the year."
good,"During my time at Nike, I furthered my skills and became an amazing coworker at the same time. I worked hard and enhanced my communication skills with other people. This helped make the job better and overall a better customer experience."
good,"The job itself is fun if you make it fun, this job is mostly upon if you want to be in a high school setting. There is a lot of drama between employees."
good,I didn't like the management that was in place. There was no room for growth at the site I was at. I love the company as a whole but I would not go back to work for that location.
good,"Uma ótima empresa, mas a gerência é totalmente movida a amizades e não dão oportunidade a quem merece."
good,"Well Nike is a wonderful place to work u meet a lot of new faces everyday, employees gets a 30% discount off every item in the store. The management kinda sucks because they don’t want you to correspond with your teammates but other from that it was a great experience."
good,Company itself is amazing. However it only takes one leader who only wants to promote his own people at any cost to ruin it. Head coach was so stubborn he would never like getting corrected. Felt like retaliation was a huge deal there.
good,"The working environment was very unprofessional, intense and management was not there to set you up to successed,but to break you down."
good,I hear there better than they used to be but the turn over rate is still very high and its mostly temp so i doubt it. It's now a go to for a part time temp job.
good,"discount was amazing, specially going back to school sales. family members are allowed to enjoy the discounts as well. cons, extremely difficult to have a full time position"
good,"lack of upward mobility and myopic Senior Leadership creates an environment where one feels diminished. "
good,Lots to do and great volunteer experience. Always meeting new people and on the weekends during dummer time there is a guest dj in the store. Free t shirts and events.
good,I met alot of hardworking people. I worked with a group that I could trust and count on to get the job done. I had a great manager who taught us well.. We were a very organized and dependable team.
good,Great summer job but not stable enough to support yourself on. Staff is friendly and knowledgeable but management is sub-par and the pay is not great for the workload.
good,Overall a good experience.  An ETW (External Temporary Worker) wherein one does not get benefits from Nike is a big blow to the employment.  One may feel the division between FTEs (Full Time Employees) and ETWs.
good,Morning huddles are usually inspiring to get the day started. The hardest part of working at Niketown NY is dealing with the horrible management team and moving up in the company.
good,"Nike is a great company. The security department is NOT!!! Pay ($16-$18/hr starting) and benefits are great. With security shift work is inevitable, however, this department has no fair or consistent policy on who gets what shift or when. They move you from shift to shift and change your days off whenever they feel like it. You might be on a shift for a year or it could only last 4 months. Seniority doesn't matter, so there are employees that have been there for 10-15 years and are working grave shift. Basically, there is no way to work your way to a better shift or better days off. There is no room for advancement. They would rather hire from the outside for Lead/Supervising positions. There is no real written training program or policy for anything. It's very inconsistent, supervisors are inconsistent, and they would rather keep you in the dark as far as company benefits/policies/procedures, than help you out. If you are young and single with little or no family or commitments then I would HIGHLY suggest applying. If you like seeing your family and being able to work your way up to better opportunities then I would avoid."
good,"buisy,attentive and standing all day."
good,Nike is a very cool place to work you definitely learn a lot. Only thing is the managers they are a little up tight and go by the book to much they expect you to basically live there even though you have a life outside of work. And these mandatory weekends are too much and suck
good,"Il mio titolo può riassumere tutto."
good,I have 5 year old son. I need as many hours and as money as possible to raise him... The job was good just not enough hours. I also think they could have a better benefit package..
good,Management got worse the longer I stayed. All the best employees left because of the non flexible schedule. I moved to Knoxville and management became worse throughout the year I was there so I was in need of a change
good,"Nike is a great starter job for college kids who are home for summer and looking for great pay and a lot of hours. If you value a good work/life balance I would not recommend working there just because retail does require holidays and weekends, and good luck getting shifts covered or request off approved."
good,Siempre es interesante trabajar con grandes multinacionales como NIke. Aun así generalmente lo que falla son las productoras o agencias escogidas por ella.
good,"My work experience has been nothing but top notch.I worked primarily to secure extra spending money, not even realizing that I was actually sampling careers to see where I might fit."
good,I love working at Nike Because I was able to do a lot of cross’s traine in different departments and I was able to manage small group of people and I was able to do a lot of on hands work and I also work with people on team building skills
good,"I worked at an outlet store during fall of 2016, including black Friday as a ""sports associate"". Don't fall for the out of the ordinary title, you are and always will be a retail associate, unless you have some sort of in with upper management or have been working several years FT. Little to no promotions, and very competitive."
good,"Laid back everyone does their job"
good,Easy work that managers made out to be tough and demanding.  On feet for the most of your shift.  Low pay. The best part about the job was discounts on products.
good,I don’t know what to say here it was a good place with some bad management on there end promoting the best kiss ups and making money. New people come In making more money than older people.
good,It was better with the management I had my first couple years but then it changed and the store went downhill. Met some people there that will be friends for the rest of my life so that is a huge plus.
good,"Mi sono trovata molto bene anche se per pochi mesi, azienda seria e ben organizzata"
good,The tale of two companies. Nike is completely different from Converse. Nike has high tech tools and processes while Converse is no tech tools or processes.
good,It was a great place to work at and I really enjoyed it. But you couldn't easily move up in the company. I did learn a lot of skills working at Nike and I will forever be thankful for that.
good,throwing boxes for 10 hours and with only a 30 minute lunch. Hourly wages were't good enough. The company that I worked through did not provide any health benefits.
good,"It was a paycheck for me. Easy project, nice people to work with, but a little conservation. Loved the project but they didn't implement half the items I recommended"
good,This is a good place to work if you are young without bills. There is no room for growth as they hire supervisors and managers externally. I would advise anyone wanting a factory job to look somewhere else unless you want to tread water. I am not posting this to bad mouth the company. If you want to move up the ladder this isnt the company for you.
good,"i have learned from this company such like stock receiving and returning procedure.other than that, visual merchandising and product knowledge training."
good,"busy"
good,"consisted of fast production,and safety"
good,"At my time at Nike it was a very busy and fast paced job environment. I was taught how to do many things and I picked them up very quickly, from working the register to finding a shoe in the back to doing shipment. Everything had to be done in a very timly manor."
good,The bad review has to do with the management and the direction taken by this new Workforce Managemnt Program
good,This is a cool company to work for if you love their products. They give their employees a great deal of Nike products. They pay is very low. Not what I expected. Most of the managers are full of themselves and are very rude. The work is not hard but to make production is almost impossible. The breaks are cool but the pay is not! They really could pay their workers more. You do get a small raise yearly.
good,Fun productive work environment. Full of opportunities just gotta make something out of them.Hardest part ill say is just the high volume of consumers and trying to attend to more than one at a time.
good,Great employee discounts but terrible management. They will work you to ground and opportunities to move up are scarce. This is more of a stepping stone kind of job.
good,It was a fun place to work but the managers were also young and didn’t have proper management skills. They were very caddy and kept up drama between employees. You have to be very patient with customers because they can be rude and expect for you to work at their command.
good,A typical day at works entails with me having great interactions with customers. This is all while having great relationships with coworkers having great impact in the work environment. The hardest part about the job is dealing with some of the managers due to the fact that they aren't really an organized group of managers and the workplace culture is not great.
good,Great to work at Nike you get to new a lot of different people and actually have fun doing it it was a great experience and if things were different I wouldn’t have left
good,"Typical day had the focus on customer service and sales. Doing all the merchandising, stocktaking and pricing, opening and closing store at start or end of work day and maintenance/ cleaning."
good,Nike was a ok job the management was not good they where not Professional in the Processing department me and I would tell everyone about them other than that Nike was a ok job
good,"Demand alot of all leaders. Hourly leaders end up working off the clock because OT is not allowed. At smaller stores, the work life balance is much better than the top doors."
good,"At Nike in Jersey Gardens, I always found myself multitasking by helping customers in front of me, answering the telephone, and running to go find sizes for customers. I would say that I definitely learned how to stay calm under pressure and If you stay calm the tasks would be easiest to complete. overall, Nike was a fun place to work. The energy was mostly good. There was always a lot to do though, so days went by fast."
good,Keep to yourself and work. Anybody can get fired if they just throw your name in stuff.alot of people are envy of good workers here. Keep to yourself and you should be good
good,"They are very petty. They believe anything somebody tells you about them. They have their favorites. They get mad when you don’t have no work , so they think you’re playing around."
good,Trabajo  con poca estabilidad laboral ya que los beneficios no eran los optimos
good,The work is easy to do and learn. Some of the supervisors and managers are not professional and take they’re power to they’re head and it’s not fair..
good,I am a contract Employee at Nike and have been for 13 months. The best part of the job is the employees I work with.  My least favorite part is that there is not a full time position offered externally in my department.
good,Was a decent place to work however management kept changing things for the worse and it became a very toxic environment my last few months there. finally I decided it was just a stopping point and left
good,"Started off as a fun place to work, went in with a good attitude thoroughly enjoyed all aspects of the job under first management team. As people left for better positions within the company or found outside opportunities, I felt a decline in the store morale and turnover in store staff was unprecedented."
good,"Could have been more in depth knowledge transfer.I was in a contract role for one role, then I was also asked to take on an additional role without informing my temp agency Kelly Services."
good,"Nike retail is tricky. It's on a steady decline, despite overall financial goals being achieved. The location I worked at had awful management, which always threatened employees. When hired, the roster was at 100+ employees. I've seen worse turnover here than at previous jobs, where salary was 100% commission based. "
good,You learn a lot about the start of Nike and the technology behind the items. The location I was at had a lot of teenagers and college students. It was fine but there was a reasonable amount of favoritism and it showed clearly. But it was still a decent company to work for itself.
good,"customer service strongly required and a fun type of atmosphere . I learned a lot about the different types of nikes and what each one was made for, the best part was that we got 50 percent off so I had tons of shoes."
good,"Nike is a great company, however the way managers are selected (from outside and not within) show that there is minimal growth available within the company at a retail position,"
good,"As a future social worker, I felt that Nike wasn't advancing my career and I decided to look for a job elsewhere. I was happy with the range of children that I was able to work with and the staff, in which I was able to rely on for support in and out of the classroom. The job is fast-paced and there isn't much room for mistakes."
good,The balance to work life to home life balance is non exist-ant and the culture in the comatose is not well. Advnacement comes in terms of favors for other employees .
good,It was an okay place to work it all depends on the department you work in. The hardest part of the job is when the cut hours down to 15- 20. the best part is the cafeteria. you dont have to leave for lunch if you dont want to
good,"Nike was a joy to work at, Manager was great and outlets have their perks, you get discounted name brand clothing and a discount at most of the other stores."
good,"I am a very hardworking what is looking for a job always ready to work "
good,"Empresa forte no segmento esportivo com treinamentos para os funcionários semanalmente, aprendi muito sobre a tecnologia dos produtos da família Nike. A gerência é o único ponto fraco, pois na hora de promover algum funcionário ou até mesmo uma mudança de turno para estudar não é concedido oportunidades. O ambiente é agradável e aconchegante. O trabalho é muito bom, todos em busca do melhor para o cliente."
good,"Everything was great until I got a new manager.  Was highly successful at the company (7 years) and in less than a year, was told I didn't know how to do my job."
good,Well my overall experience at Nike has been quite the rollercoaster. A lot of favoritism as well as managers tend to be some what immature. Weekends are gone. The discount is pretty much the only pro about the job. It could be just my store because we've had a lot of different changes throughout the years and the feedback I hear from other stores is different.
good,When I first started working at the Nike store in Albertville I loved it. That changed a lot over the 3 years I worked there because of the managers. They didn't do anything and barked orders at the Full-Time employees like myself.
good,"um theres not much to say, I went to work and did my job. no one was rude and it was a nice place to work at for the most part  i have nothing bad to say"
good,"Awwsome,I've enjoyed jobs I've learned task I never knew how to perform until employees by nike ,company provides 401k,health benefits,pto payed time off,"
good,"Work was hardly given, but work days typically went by fast. I learned the system and as the store is known as a outlet store, getting better at figuring out discounted prices in my head is something i will never forget."
good,"About what i would expect for a retail outlet store, the coworkers were mostly competent and knowledgable in the product being sold. Management tended to apply what appeared to be excessive pressure to increase sales and improve performance. Hardest part of the job was meeting the company expectations for performance when preparing merchandise for sale, best part was the camaraderie of the floor employees."
good,"I loved the people i got to work with if anything nike does right its choosing employees. New management sucks, rules suck, finding coverage sucks. The discount was good. there is favorites picked for higher positions not fair with interviews."
good,"buen trato , falencias en algunas gestiones administrativas"
good,Greet my co workers each morning I'm scheduled. Discuss what shipment is coming what needs to be processed and whats new merchandise. The job tasks aren't hard but can be time consuming more than usual.
good,"Dia a dia de trabalho corrido, bastante serviço. Aprendi a mexer em um sistema chamado SRM. Meus colegas de trabalho eram simpáticos e divertidos, porém profissionais. Eu gosto de todas as atividades que prestava a empresa Nike."
good,This is a great place to work especially if your a athlete and love shoe wear. I had such a great experience working for this company.
good,"I work in a particular store that exists in a dangerous neighborhood. Between the excessive amount of loss and questionable clientele we are faced with daily, the leadership team is never cooperating. They fight in front of us ""lower-level employees,"" they consistently undermine one another, and operate on their individual agendas such that there is never complete organization within the walls of that store."
good,"Trabalhava de manhã, tarde e noite."
good,"not a bad place to work. the employees a friendly and great to work with, the only problem is that they very rarely hire full time employees and there is no job security."
good,"A typical day at work would include a meeting 5-10 minutes prior to starting the shift about targets, KPI's and general feed back within previous working days and any news coming up within the company. "
good,"Assist customers in finding what they are  looking for and what would best suit them for their needs. Straighten up  whatever area  that is  assigned to in the store. Help new associates in training, watch out  for and use prevention statements for shoplifters."
good,I handle all the shipments that come into Nike. I push product to the floor for it to be sold and also handle customer service.
good,"En un día simple de trabajo en las empresas no hay un día simple todos los días hay que dar el 100% para que la sección o tienda se lleve bien y los clientes queden satisfechos, aprendes varias cosas todos los días, porque cada día es un mundo nuevo,la parte mas difícil del trabajo no llegué a ver ninguna y lo más que me gustó es seguir trabajando en un sector del que estoy contento de que me hayan dejado estar dentro de la empresa aunque no me hayan dejado fijo porque no dejaban fijo a nadie."
good,non posso esprimermi per motivi personali.posso solo dire che negli anni che ho lavorato presso la ditta ho conosciuto e vissuto delle splendide giornate sia con le colleghe che con gli anziani stessi
good,"At NIKE you are in one of four departments: shoes, apparel, register or the BOH (back of house).  It was a fun and energetic place to work as a lot of young people were employed.  The management seemed to be inadequately trained as they have such high turnover but it was an overall good place to work."
good,"Fun place to work at, discount on shoes. Ability to go to sport related programs. Learned about how the company was started and the different parts of the company around the world."
good,Conduct the sales of merchandise in an high traffic store. Typical duties of an retail store. Great networking environment; you meet a lot of people in this store.
good,"Greeted with a heray welcome to work from peers, never had so many different types of friendly and interesting co-workers in one building before. Clock in begin the balance of bring my personality version of customer service to the sells floor. Educate new employees of standards and requirements while they teach me about them, there culture and views, and thoughts about myself and how to improve. Engaging with customers from all corners of the world. Clock out and do it all over again."
good,What you hear everyday is that ambiguity is everywhere in this org. Mostly everyone learns as the day passes. I saw how it can be a great place to work for if you're well connected (just like all orgs). But the truth of the matter is asking yourself is it really worth it? Job titles are vague as some individuals do not have the expertise. The process in finance sucks! there is no centrality around the foundation. All depts continue to rely only on excel for report building. Really? In such a large org. like this??? IT support feels like prison. Folks here seem they are forced to work here.
good,A gerência trocava o horário para vc pedir a conta
good,The company itself along with management is great but the reliability of hours and set priorities for long term employees lack. Hours given are poorly divided and the amount of hires is too high to maintain a fair living budget for a large number of employees.
good,"Working at Nike was great. I just wanted more days off and a better salary. I had only one day off there. But all in all, it was fun working at Nike. I learnt alot there and I felt free to talk to my area manager and all managers about any issues I was facing. It felt like a second home"
good,"Nothing to share great marketing company high turnover............"
good,"Kontra"
good,Great job and awesome atmosphere. Would love to go back and work there. The benefits are wonderful and the workers are caring. The management was great.
good,"Had a great time working here, fun environment, fast paced and I also met some great people working here. The managers were cool too, you also get real good discounts."
good,"Loved working for nike as a company, leaders in the store are to into their personal agenda and if something makes them looks good and dont care how it affects other leaders or the store as a whole."
good,It was a nice job. I loved working there while I had the opportunity. Benefits are good but by the time you got to where you could receive them they would end your assignment abruptly. Not cool.
good,I liked it even though it was only temporary. It was for a single event and it was a hard job but very rewarding. The hours were long and it was very cold.
good,"Nike is a good place to work for a short amount of time. The store I worked for was not a place you could really grow into much higher position. Also, management always made promises to promote me, but would kept pushing it off saying they needed new employees before they could promote me. Never got that promotion after waiting 3-4 months, and ended up quitting. But the discount is great!!"
good,"I have seen like 10 person quit before me and since I left this job about 20 more added to the number, it’s a good transitioning job that you don’t intend ti keep because the possibilities of advancing are low."
good,"Morning checklist review, assignment, and group meeting. I learned the daily operations of scanning and itemizing merchandise through various technological and manual laboring. Management would vary, as there were several managers assigned to manage various areas of said warehouse. Workplace culture was respectful, efficient, and mature. Hardest assignments were when ordered merchandise were defective and required extensive reproaching, re-labeling, and re-scanning which would disrupt our daily quota goals. I mostly enjoyed the perks of being employed by such a quality company."
good,"- Nice people to work with "
good,"Converse is a OK place to work... during my tenure, the brand went through 4 re-organizations, we had 2 CEOs, and I had 7 supervisors. Demands of the job were relentless - expect long hours, constant shifts in strategy, and lack of development / career path with the company. I did learn a lot about running a business, marketing products, and constantly innovating."
good,"Fun, fast paced, retail environment. Difficult schedules. Fast advancement. Typical day at work is fast paced and diverse. High traffic volume retail environment."
good,"A typical work day at Nike included talking and selling merchandise to consumers. I learned that the more you know about the product you're selling to the consumer the more likely you are to sell that merchandise. Working there was very upbeat and very fun. The hardest part of the job was trying to find a specific item for a customer in the back storage room. The most enjoyable, however, was being out on the salesfloor with the team."
good,this was a good place to work while a student. Good with scheduling around your class schedule; great employee discounts on merchandise and was a fun place to work.
good,Management is awful at the retail level.  Also there was an inconsistent influx of workers with varying talent.  Some seemed rather incompetent while others seemed well aware.
good,"Esperienza tutto sommato positiva; mi sono purtroppo trovato male con il manager ed alcuni colleghi, e questo non mi ha dato modo di proseguire la carriera in un'azienda valida."
good,"A typical day includes filling, moving, and stocking product. "
good,Nike was a very positive work environment with a very friendly staff where everybody gets along and works as a team. It is an organized store with always something to do and keeps you busy.
good,Got the job as a summer job and it filled its purpose. We got great discounts on products. Did not plan on staying there very long and when the season was over and hours dropped I left to pursue other opportunities.
good,"Removed my position and didn't really communicate. Didn't really communicate with my job responsibilities were. Spent most of my work day researching and learning various aspects of my career goals, not really work related"
good,"The people you work with are friendly and tend to help make your day at work a good fun day. Management can be iffy and tend to lash out at times for no reason. On good days management can be great but they are all about the work, which is typical. If management is on them about work though, expect a lashing."
good,The most typical of days would usually consist of customer service and reordering or moving products. Often times management would find busy work when it was perceived that employees had no projects or helping service customers
good,"Company overall is fun to work for, but my biggest complaint is that the managers at my specific store aren’t good at communicating. I have also changed my availability a couple times and they have yet to fix it."
good,Coolest place I have ever worked.  The company/experience changes drastically depending on what team you're on. Be ready to play the game if you want to advance.
good,I liked working at nike. They always had good employees with good vibes. the only thing was that it was seasonal. I never made the cut to stay full time.
good,"It is a good place to work, relaxed environment. Managers are respectful and take their jobs seriously. However, they appreciate their employees. The hardest part of the job for was knowing the different technologies and ensuring that the right product is given to customers."
good,"Very cooperative with scheduling their coworkers, very friendly company. The management could use some work. Learn to move people up in a timely manner."
good,"a typical day at work consist of coming in and carrying on unfinished work from the day before."
good,"Only thing that sucks is pay. Discount are great and management was cool too. Cant say anything bad abut this job other than pay, If I was making more I would of definitely stayed."
good,lover of shoes so the discount locked me in. in love with the company as a whole and the history. but if your not planning to go hard in retail this isn’t your job. you have to walk a  line of perfection and the chosen few can handle it. very detail oriented job
good,"Nike is a good place to work because of the people. Although the company culture is going through an identity crisis, if you surround yourself with the right people, work can be very enjoyable."
good,A typical day is full of good vibes and moving at a fast pace. overall a great job to have as a part time. management is very friendly and works around your schedule. very helpful!
good,"Working at Nike as a Seasonal Athlete was just alright. I got to work with a lot of different people and gain some valuable work experience, but there were a lot of things that should have been done differently. For example, at the store I worked for, I spend one full summer working in the stockroom, and when I returned the next summer asked to spend some time on the floor. I ended up being put on the floor on Memorial Day (which for that store is one of the busiest of the year) without any type of refresher training at all (I had been trained on how to work on the floor the summer before, but since I hadn't actually used that training I didn't retain a lot of it). Also, they employed many students from abroad (Russia, Albania, etc). Personally, I understand that it is necessary to do so, however, a store like Nike should also understand that students from those countries don't speak the best English. As a result, that made it difficult for us in the stockroom to find products they asked us to look for because we didn't understand, and the same issue applied to customers who came in as well."
good,start to end easily manageble fun loving enviorment loving people. due to long hours and unstable hours had to leave.when its busy not fully staffed and stressfull.
good,"I have enjoyed my time working Nike.  "
good,i liked working at nike but the environment just did not suit me at all the adults there were by far the most difficult people to work with and i would not prefer to work there anymore
good,The nike employee store was a nice place to work. Not too much stress wise & the work day was pretty smooth. Staff dress was nice plus the customers were fun.
good,"Nike is a place where things happen fast.  You can be a leader if you prove yourself, but it's not a place to work if you want a 9-5 job. There's lots of people from around the world on staff.  Probably the most diverse place I've ever worked.  Lower level people don't make much money.  There can be lots of travel depending on your position."
good,Overall Nike was a fun awesome job that i could learn so much from. So many nice people from different walks of life customers and employees. i would love to go back to nike but under a different management team.
good,You get cross trained in every department. Very family oriented. The management is good. Hard part is the footwear department. They always find ways to make it fun
good,This job was not a bad one but it can definitely use better staffing. There was no type of communication at all. I felt like I could have ran that company.
good,Being an employee at NIke Clearance use to be fun. I really enjoyed coming into work and the atmosphere was just great. Everyone got along whether it was manager or employee. I miss that. Now its like i dread being there. The manager i feel micromanage too much an dworry too much about their own internal staff than dealing with the theft of the merchandise and watch their employees get abused by customers that isnt right. Its not right to work there. But the bills have to get paid.

good,"Missione e strategia comune condivisa a tutti i livelli aziendali"
good,"It's a nice area to work in.. You just have to look over some people, if possible. I'm looking for permanent employment. There's a clause in this certain temp services' contract that won't let you get hired permanent with this company."
good,"Managers tend to only care about themselves while the company itself is great, your location matters. Certain specialists and managers tend to be condescending and think they're above everyone. The pay's alright, your coworkers are what really make the job tolerable."
good,"You basically clock in, go to your floor and do your job. it's a very repetitive and  unsatisfying job to do. If you love Nike and wish to be a long term part of the company it's a great way to get a foot in the door."
good,"I worked with the team as a shop assistant at Nike in Durham on a part-time contract. During that time I undertook a number of roles including, sales, merchandising, replenishment, customer processing, cash handling and customer service. During this time, I developed excellent customer service and communication skills through supporting our customer’s needs from their arrival to their departure. "
good,It was a great job for the holidays but concentrix is not a good company. They basically changed up the whole hiring process and fired the entire floor for little things. Like taking more than 1:30 minutes to write your notes when they have to be detailed notes. The the facility is disgusting! If Nike had their own facility I would love to work there again.
good,"While working in retail at Nike, they really trained us thoroughly on what we were selling and the ins and outs of the workplace, making sure I felt confident selling the product and really believed in their mission. At first, the environment was so fun and the product is truly wonderful and practically sells itself. Coming to work truly felt like being part of a family, and we all worked so well as a team. Then, as time went on, the managers got really lazy and began to display favoritism. They hired way too many employees and hours became sparse, especially for those who were not very senior. This has continued to become worse, and employee turnover rate has skyrocketed. For example, I have worked there for more than a year, and the head manager couldn't even remember who I was. I'm not sure what happened, but that wonderful workplace turned really negative really quickly. Overall still absolutely love the company and what it stands for and hope to return higher up in the rank one day, but my days working in retail at Nike are definitely over."

good,On a busy day it gets pretty busy. Getting shoes and keeping the section clean. Time really goes by fast. On slow days it the day seems really long. mostly refolding shirt all day and helping some consumers once an a while.
good,"Nike sculpted critical soft skills that I will be using throughout my entire career. I learned how to find a great middle ground between offering excellent customer service / displaying my product knowledge as well as learning the operations side of the store. Throughout my years with Nike, I have spent time in each part of the store, such as the back of house, operations coach, cashier, etc. The most enjoyable part of the job has to be my coworkers. There is nothing better than walking into work and seeing not only who you view as coworkers but friends as well. The hardest part of the job was the high speed, high pressure environment, especially during peak times of business. I thrive under pressure so I greatly enjoyed it as well, but it is a little difficult to manage at times."
good,"Neste momento encontro na função de empregado de armazém, onde sou responsável por todo o tipo de tarefas que lidem directamente com mercadoria, transferência de mercadoria recepcionar, armazenar, repor directamente na loja, controlo de defeituosos, gerir stock mais vendido da loja e menos vendido, para existir uma rotação de stock entre lojas mais realista."
good,overall i loved my time there i felt very happy with the job and the mangagement was always welcoming plus the other employees were always amazing and very helpful.
good,"the company is good but had certain individuals at management level that believe they are now owners of the company. i learned a lot on teamwork, team building. field work was the most fun part of the job but the hard part was planning the stores look and knowing that there will be comparison with global."
good,"A typical day at Nike included an early morning safety briefing accompanied with stretching and a production overview of the previous shift or day. Most managers were reliable and co-workers were easy to work with. The most difficult thing about the job was dealing with the down time when equipment or personnel wasn't performing at optimum levels. However, the most enjoyable part of the job for me was the weekly pay and receiving gratitude for a job well done at the end of my shift."
good,"The Supply Chain team always deliver as needed to ensure Nike's athletes are performing at their best!!"
good,"Although sometimes the job itself is demanding, your coworkers will be some of the greatest people you will ever meet  in a retail setting."
good,"Empresa de cultura multinacional norteamericana, cujo princiípio básico é a rentabilidade sem muita definição de processos."
good,The employees make the store. The environment of a locker room you would find in football or basketball. The worst part is the management that doesn't do their job and you have to pick up their slack. The company from a retail or district perspective is non supportive and doesn't have a clear view of policy. The customers are great and the athletes that work there are great people.
good,I love working with the many multicultural customers that walk through the doors. It really gives a worldly perspective on life just being able to meet people from all over the world. Working here has given me the opportunity to meet people from at least 100 different countries around the world.
good,"My day at work is frenetic, i worked in the Termini station, the main station in Rome and of Italy."
good,I definitely learned a lot working here. This was my first job and the managers really invested in me. They taught me a lot of skills that at the time annoyed me. I will forever be thankful for my experience here. They offer a pretty generous discount and can sometimes be flexible.
good,"17 jaar gewerkt bij dit prachtige bedrijf. Heel veel gedaan nog meer geleerd. Het is een snelle en productieve organisatie met een no nonsense mentaliteit. Hard werken en veel overuren draaien. "
good,"great place to work, nice benefits. Able to meet famous ppl. Free nike gear. Good Deal. BUT AS MUCH MONEY AS THEY MAKE A DAY THEY COULD PAY THEIR TEAM MORE."
good,"ik was het contactpunt tussen de klanten en de fabrikanten."
good,"No dia-dia do trabalho atendemos os clientes aplicando os treinamentos de relações humanas, aprendi muito sobre processos gerenciais e operacionais da loja, o time gerencial em sua maioria são pessoas competentes e prestativas, a parte mais difícil do trabalho são os problemas estruturais da loja, como muito calor por não ter ar condicionado, goteiras pela loja quando chove entre outros, a parte mais agradável do trabalho é o trabalho em equipe, todos são unidos para prestar o melhor atendimento sempre ajudando o colega de trabalho, atuando como um time mesmo."
good,Unfortunately management at my store was horrible and the next closest store was an hour away.. I would definitely recommend Nike to others.
good,"large work load "
good,"A great atmosphere with a multicultural mix. Overall great product and a lot of information at your disposal should you need to know more. The management altogether is a solid team that cares about their company and the people that support the bottom line, selling it's product. The pay is remarkably low for such a high profile company as is the company discount (they only give you 40%), that said this is more of a second job to hold unless you're in management position. "
good,accuracy is always important. really enjoy working with a team.
good,"Assambling materials, cutting and putting into oven all day 12 hours shift"
good,"I like the uniform, it's really comfortable. But I didn't like the environment & the favoritism."
good,Worst management ever. Great culture except for management.
good,"If you are into marketing, you may really enjoy working with Nike. It is  impressive how large scale of their marketing is and fun working in a company with such international brand recognition."
good,"Working at Nike you get a nice employee discount, but there are times where you are dealing with numerous people simultaneously. For a minimum wage job, it is hard to work your way up and get recognized. If you are a young person looking for any job and you love Nike, you should work here."
good,A lot of great perks and room for growth. Everything is based on working as a Team and getting and giving feedback. The pay could be better considering the amount of work.
good,Nike was an okay job to start in retail. It's probably one of the craziest retail or in mall jobs around. If you can work there you can work anywhere  .
good,"La mia esperienza lavorativa in Nike può dirsi positiva. Tipico contratto del commercio, buon ambiente lavorativo, responsabili affidabili e punto di riferimento per il negozio."
good,Great place to work. Management works well with your scheduale. Amazing atmosphere. You get free shirts and shoes and employee discounts. Training is high priority there.
good,Only worked here for a summer in-between semesters. Typical retail job for me that was nothing special. Was able to form new relationships with people from other areas.
good,"The employers were very open and friendly with the employees, making them feel at ease in the workplace while promoting productive work ethic among the employees"
good,Was a great experience and I enjoyed working there. There are a lot of different opportunities there to move up and you are always learning something.
good,"Cool place to work, associates are called athletes, but to be honest, there are no benefits. only quarterly bonuses. For that the company is a flop for me."
good,"Working at Nike was great for a while. Exceptional benefits and off times. Shifts were 12 hours and breaks were aplenty. My only gripe about working for Nike was that the management team never made it their responsibility to promote those who put in strides to move up in position, instead the floor managers just picked whoever they had the closest relationship with for advancement training."
good,"Had a great group of people to work with. Learned a lot about sales, but more importantly, learned how to understand people and their needs and how to be of service to them."
good,Nike employs temps and direct hires so everything depends on what you do or where you work in Nike. Overall I enjoyed most of my time working for Nike.
good,An average work day is basically the same day in and day out. The staff is very energetic and makes the day go by much faster. Not being able to leave the premises for lunch and or break is the biggest drawback in our work enviroment
good,A typical day at nike was very fast paced. Management was great and very experienced. The hardest part of the job was keeping up with the customers. The workplace was great as a whole.
good,a typical day at work would consist of helping the costumers and building a one on one relationship with them maintaining your goals of the day keeping your work zone clean and just having fun and enjoying the job itself
good,"The discount is nice, the coworkers are great but management is mediocre. Will be required to work pretty much every weekend with the exception of the months January through March."
good,"My time with Nike was an truly wonderful experience. I had great mentors and a leadership team that believed in the growth of its employees. My daily tasks were fun and creative, and I was always engaging with others, be it customers or employees."
good,"Management is great they are always hiring, great meeting new people love the training and opportunities they give, they really teach you about their product and so your able to help customers."
good,"Limited mobility within company. Struggle for additional hours."
good,Great work place. I enjoyed the time working there wasnt a place I seen as a career. Timing was perfect. Just like i said not a career job for me. Benefits were also good.
good,Working at Nike is a very easy and decent job. You have a lot of opportunities for advancement. The culture is real diverse. Its really no hard part of your job
good,Nike helped me come out of my shell but also helped me reinforce my warehouse skills when i would receive shipments and i would have to audit the shipment. But i can really say Nike has helped me frow personally
good,Nike continues to evolve with their consumer direct offense that places consumers first in the quest to become the most dominate Brand in sport today.
good,"You got to be able to be on your Feet , Be On Time To Work , And Work as best as you can . You must be prepared to work if not Nike is not a fit for you ."
good,Working for Nike was a real eye opening experience. The environment was amazing I loved the work and the people I worked there with were are so nice and helpful. The coworkers are so diverse and it is n ice working with people who have a common goal of making money and having fun. I really have no complaints except management. They're the only reason I left. Some of their managers are really nice but the higher up managers are just too overwhleming and don't have a good balance of team work and leadership.
good,it's not a job it's a pleasure. You're not in Nike to sell products but to advise and speak about them
good,Nike est une entreprise agreable et empathique. Votre salaire depend du travail et surtout l'effort que vous fournissez.
good,"we had a team meeting daily that conducted a team chant at the end of the meeting, everyone there was always helpful overcoming obstacles. Fun atmosphere to be around."
good,I started Nike a year ago. The job was easy but you have to still make requirements. We couldn’t talk not ask question to nobody. The breaks are short and walks are long
good,The job was a good experience to get your foot in the door. I enjoyed my time with my co workers and learned a lot about the retail industry. Nike has a positive culture that I am grateful to have been apart of.
good,"The team was like a big family, and did activities before opening which made us a lot stronger and eager for the day. You start as a temp and must work your way up to permanent which I feel every company should do."
good,"-its a decent place to work at "
good,"Aprendi todas as áreas da loja, no qual eu vejo como ótima oportunidade, é um local com o ambiente bem esportivo. A parte mais difícil é lidar com a rotina  a mais fácil é vender os produtos Nike."
good,"Fun and relaxed environment, but is highly goal oriented. Make the job very easy on the employees when it comes to helping the customer get what they need."
good,"Los beneficios son buenos además que te dan training, no te dan uniformes, tienes que comprarlo ,hay demasiados empleados en el mismo turno y es un poco frustrante. No hay mucho compañerismo cuando eres se puede decir que eres la única  persona hispana en el grupo de trabajo. "
good,Learn a lot about the nike culture and learn how to deal with customers on a daily basis and how to act in certain situations. Holiday hours are good after that it dies out.
good,"The people were great and the managers very accommodating, although they would send people home early a lot, especially on weekdays ( holidays not counting)"
good,It was a wonderful experience working there. You have to be politically correct though. You have to watch what you say and who you say things around because people can get offended easily and report you and it can possibly jeopardize your job. It is all about matter of respect (MOR).
good,"Good company to work for with good benefits and discounts. It is a fast pace environment with always something to do, which I like. You get to wear comfortable workout clothes to work everyday."
good,I worked smart and not good small smooth  everyone was friendly easy to get along with  some will even help you out at time when you where going through things
good,"En arbetsplats man går till för att träffa kollegorna, inte för att det är speciellt mycket kul att göra. Det finns bara så många gånger man kan hjälpa skrikande barn och vika tröjor utan att bli ganska less på det. Men, roliga produkter och om du träffar rätt kund kan en dag vända helt. Men det är inte ett ställe att utvecklas på, utan funkar bättre som extra- eller ett sommarjobb."
good,"New skills and nice people. Growing up with the company."
good,"Productive work place, competitive environment. growth is possible but have to ask and ask and ask. constantly competing against other for better positions. very very competitive."
good,overall a great place to work. Some managers really are there to help you. Some are just there to collect a check. Favorites are usually the ones to get the promotion even if they know that person isnt respected by their fellow workers.
good,"- Bonne école "
good,"Good job , great pay rate , good shifts and good management just was temporarily and work hours was short after production went down i would recommend it if you want weekends off though and have another source of income also."
good,Just do it. Nike was as fine experience although the HR manager wasn't the best. The culture is rich and some days it's fast paced but fun interacting with customers
good,"Not a place for advancement, there is a good ol boy management system, employees are being exploited and not really cultivated for success or advancement"
good,"My tune at Nike has been great. I’ve met some good people, customers and employees, I enjoy going into work. It’s great energy in the job. I would really recommend someone who like sports and sports wear clothes to work at Nike."
good,"good place to work with great people and a good working environment. "
good,"I had a great experience working at Nike. Opportunity to work on cutting edge technology."
good,"Management could've been more attentive to their employees needs. Nike as a company is great, they give exceptional employee discounts. A memorable activity would definitely have been the morning meetings before shift, it allowed every one to get to know each other and the business better."
good,Be weary of what store you choose to work in. GREAT company. Not every store is great however. Some places have management that is not so great. they don't do everything that they can to help.
good,i was a temp but the management and people there was good people to work with.it is a veury nice company to work for i could imagine.if i ocould get the chance to work there again i most definetly would
good,"The discount was cool. The people that came in were cool too. The interaction with the customer always made my day. It didn't matter who it was as long as I put a smile on my face or not they could always put a smile on mine, except for those select few but hey I guess that's retail. Its also work, you can build relationships there. Having pride in your work will get you recognized."
good,Great company with many opportunities for multiple career paths. Always a fun workplace with many opportunities to grow within or outside of the company.
good,I would recommend to people who love shoes. I wouldn't personally go back but some people can find a career in this work place. They do a lot of coworker events and there's a lot of benefits.
good,El equipo de trabajo apoyaba siempre en todos los procesos
good,It was an okay place to work.  What I really didnt like was they do not train people for very long or very well. It would have been nice to have more training hours.
good,"Great bosses, fun coworkers, and fun job. Although pay isn’t representative of the work some athletes do and they should be compensated more. Great company too."
good,I have 1.5 year Canadian experience as a project manager in a long distance calling card company. they have a multiple stores in all around Toronto and i am managing all the store.
good,A nice cool loving busy environment easy  to get along with staff opportunities available to move up in the company  and also a diverse workplace and friendly.
good,"The district manager can make or break you and you will have to learn what each district manager wants to hear.  The is very little consistency in how the company runs and you will have to be prepared for change at any moment.  Be prepared to suck up to the district manager, because that is how you get ahead in this company"
good,I enjoyed my time here. Extremely accommodating work schedule. A great attention to detail and customer service. A great place to grow your people and customer service skills.
good,By far Nike's biggest store in terms of overall sales and unit velocity. Overall great place to work if you want to understand how to directly impact the business and the consumer. Very large team (400+ people) so being able to work with a wide variety of different personalities.
good,Pick/process/labor all items and ensured that they met sales price standards.Made sure that all fed ex and ups trucks were loaded and ready to be shipped out.
good,"During my time at Nike, I worked as a sales associate (athlete). My time there was filled with great relationships with co-workers and busy days. However, because Nike is such a large business, they are very numbers driven, and often seem to care more about how much money they are making, rather than their own employees well being. Now with that being said, because I worked in a store front, this could be a 1 location issue that many other Nike stores don't have."
good,Nike is a great place to work. There are opportunities for advancement and career development for those interested. Its the people that make this company the most enjoyable.
good,nike was a fast pace work enviroment the cool part at nike supervisor were great the hardest part walking on your feet 10 hours an learn how to use and rf gun an work in packing
good,"great place to work, flexible student schedule.  this job allowed me to pick up extra shifts. I obtained product knowledge and customer service skills"
good,Terrific opportunity to work for the most recognized brand in the world. Went from creating deck packs to actually designing graphics for Women's Sportswear tee graphics.
good,"9hr work day with two 15-minute breaks and 1 hour lunch. I would review product placement throughout the store on mannequins, tables, flyer, etc while also customer servicing and providing training for entry-level associates. I learned a lot of useful skills while in my role. Management was decent however after some managers left, the store became unorganized and uncommunicative. There was a lot more pressure put on athletes and not so much management. Hardest part of the job was being spread thin and doing way more than my job role entailed. The most enjoyable part was the team members."
good,"Was working from offshore for a web analytics  project, had a great learning experience, worked on Apache Spark which was a challenging, yet a fun experience."
good,"Nike Retail is a fun place to work. With the right management team you can learn a lot and advance your career. Hours get tough, lots of nights and usually 3/4 weekends. Takes its toll on your quality of life."
good,"i learned alot about shoes and clothing working there , it was fun helping people find shoes they always wanted , the beginning management was great two years later i got a new boss and he sucked and didnt care about my well being"
good,"Good place to work if you choose to work steadily and learn what you need to learn to function properly. Pay is sufficient enough for starting out. Basic work, for basic skills..."
good,"While working for the company  it was not uncommon for managers to come and go causing the lack of experience to overshadow the culture and store as a whole. With this being said, many employees were given mixed feedback, false information, and fabricated information for the gain of those in management."
good,"Ik vond het een fijne werkervaring. Door in Nike Laakdal te werken, heb ik geleerd wat tempo betekent. In de zomervakantie was het enorm warm, maar dat viel mee."
good,It is a good place to build a career. There are great networking events on campus.  The company puts time and effort into its people. They are constantly trying to start over which means you never feel stable with one thing you are doing.
good,Live your best! Life is too short to be stressing on a regular basis. Find peace in your life and explore that with loved ones and friends. Take a vacation enjoy earth.
good,"Had a great work experience. I learned a great deal about shoes and equipment, plus how much charity work that Nike Co does in local communities......"
good,"professional staff,good workers, good and fun environment to work in and a great working experience for me to learn to work with coworkers and customers."
good,"I was responsible for knowing the NIKE history, the background of the running, walking shoes, etc., cleaning the shoe area,  stocking and arranging the store merchandise."
good,"Starting out, I was excited to be in a place that fits me. Discount is awesome, people are amazing, and work was easy. The pay is not that great. Advancement is good if you work hard for it. Favoritism may exist depending on the store. Every store in your area is different. Management changed up and it got worse. Listen to the veteran workers on what they have to say."
good,"It was a decent experience. I gained new skills and learned more about the business. They offered over time. They offered good benefits. I was given the opportunity to train new workers. I also inspected shoes and learned the quality of good product. I worked with great co-workers, managers and supervisors."
good,Good job if you love Nike apparel. Management were often dissociative or cliquey. Exercised coercion on employees. Call outs and shift coverage was looked down upon. Employee discount was exceptional-- seemed like a main incentive for many employees.
good,People have good manners good work place good work ethics helpful environment from start to finish working hard to maintain and make sure everyone is happy and taken care of.
good,"Nike is an extremely fun place to work. Typically I process apparel in the storeroom. I have learned how to use company technology. The management is nice but they do not listen to their employees sometimes. The hardest part of the job is balancing your tasks with customer service if you work on the sales floor. Working in the back, the hardest part is keeping up with the processing quota. The most enjoyable part of the job are the people you meet and the events you can go to."
good,"Estuve trabajando solo un verano, al ser la Nike factory había mucho trabajo, eso es bueno. Antes de empezar el día hacíamos una reunion donde nos marcaban los objetivos mensuales, y diarios--casi siempre los cumplimos. "
good,Typical day depends on what time you start (shift patterns are all over the place) but it is busy nonetheless! Great benefits such as 44% discount online. Management are partly okay. job security is pretty non existent (It is a revolving door of employees e.g. 5 leave 10 more come)
good,Nike is een productief bedrijf. Zo staan de veranderingen binnen het bedrijf ook nooit stil.
good,"I made the best out of every day, I enjoyed the targets set and the pressure applied to reach the target however management needs to be a bit more organised and structured. The growth in the company is not quick at all it takes about a year and a half to two years to become permanent. It is idle for students looking for a part-time job.."
good,"more benefits are needed, and the product range needs to  be varied. they were a bit organised with payroll but overall the employees are friendly and warm"
good,Working for Nike can be very fun if you have the right mind set. You need to work hard but you will feel respected and valued. The company gives you a lot of support if you want to take advantage of it and move up in the retail industry
good,"my store manager was fantastic, but there was a lack of communication between assistant managers and it made working there very difficult. The pay is okay if youre a college student with no bills to pay."
good,It's not that bad but if your trying to get paid or some quick change work at Nike. There food is good for the time being but I advise people to get on permanently not temp.
good,"Fast paced environment, a place where you will be able to learn something new about the company everyday. Family orientated as far as employees are concerned."
good,I was a packing lead there I worked 12 hours a day for 4 days a week  I worked with a lot of nice people and some wasn't so nice but that almost everywhere you go now but it was a good work place.
good,"This was a great job since i was in college. They are very good at working around your school schedule. The enviroment was great, the store was always clean, and the workers were great. At times it was hectic since Nike is very popular, but other then that it was a great job. I would definitley work there again if givent he opportunity."
good,"The most enjoyable part about my job is the people. Everyone has a similar passion for sport and strives to make the best product possible. Overall, a great company to work for!"
good,"Because Nike knows that so many people want to work there, they sort of don’t really care about their employees too much. They know that if one person chooses to leave Nike, they can replace that person within minutes. However the people who do in fact make the tough cut are usually awesome to work with."
good,A typical day of would b dealing climbing up and down stairs. Handling items returning them to the correct spot as well as keeping a log of what items I replace or remove. Having and hr lunch break and eating real food cooked. The hard part about the warehouses work would be when its hot the warehouse is extremely hot and stuffy
good,"Very warm work environment, face paced work place that has a diverse group of employees that are able to adapt to meet the needs of the consumers and fit the values of the company."
good,"Fast paced environment - team is fun and work is standard - compensation is low and hours and work/life balance are non existent.  Schedule frequently late and not posted, $ very low."
good,Good place for growth and experience with other cultures and sports. Also a great place to learn organization and patience especially working in the kids section
good,"Overall a good place work; super competitive and internal politics sometimes get in the way but am sure this is experienced at most other companies."
good,Its a great place to work in terms of making friends and family oriented but there is a lot of issues with management. I don't feel like I get paid enough for the amount of work I do but that's abut it.
good,The management was okay. On a typical day I would be on the sales floor assisting customer with needs whether it be getting them a size of a product or helping them buy an item online.
good,Processing was pretty easy and its easy to catch on and learn. Nothing hard about it. keep up with your personal items because it is a warehouse and people tend to steal
good,"I got booked for a 1 day shoot for a Nike ad. Great team, worked quickly, competitive day rate. Directives were laid out very clearly for me and location was easy to find."
good,"Customer Service. Lead Athlete, Peer Mentor, process orders; pulling materials, packing boxes, maintain safe and clean work environment by keeping shelves, pallet area and workstations clean and complying with procedures, rules and regulations."
good,I was hired as a local tailor/seamstress to lead a team with the fitting of an award winning Olympian for a commercial recorded and played during the 2016 Summer Olympics. It was a half day of work starting early morning and finishing during the early afternoon. They were easy to work with an enjoyable.
good,"The team you work with is amazing, the coaches help you out with out a doubt if you're having troubles with sizes or customer questions. Definitely a fun job to have"
good,"Great company, but a little challenging to fit in the culture for someone on the conservative end of political spectrum. Lots of events in support of politically charged far left ideas. Otherwise, good servant leadership, very supportive and collaborative culture."
good,"Nike is a great place to work. Reorganizations are challenging but a part of growth. Pay is low in general but experience and benefits balance that out. Loved working for company."
good,Overall it’s a great place to be in. You meet tremendous people from all over as well as other athletes and celebrities. Nike also always have something going on. I learned a lot about the history of Nike and the products that they sell. Hardest part of the job is the scheduling. trying to move up. Enjoyable part is the events the visitors the discounts off products and most of the people you work with.
good,Overall great place to work and family oriented work environment. Working in Nike taught me how to manage time and work as a team towards a deadline..
good,"Can be a fun place to work, but depends largely on your team. Was disappointed with the lack of modern workplace amenities, there is sparkling water on tap (people are stoked about this), but eating on campus is expensive. I think it should be subsidized."
good,"A lot of opportunities and work, good team spirit and company philosophy"
good,"Getting orders and completing them by end of shift.  Learned who to pack loads properly.  Given the freedom to train in other departments.  Workplace culture, is laid back and friendly."
good,Good place to work. Itʻs busy all the time for the most part so you never feel like work is a drag. Really great people work there and it is a great environment. Really good discounts too.
good,Lenient scheduling other than on weekends. I recommend working here to gain experience with customer service and a little extra cash to help with summer endeavors or schooling
good,"Nike is een leuk bedrijf met een casual bedrijfscultuur. Er wordt echter veel heel veel van je verwacht en als je hier niet aan voldoet, wordt je vervangen."
good,Nike是一個與時俱進的公司，運動員可以透過Nike apps來自我訓練，員工可以透過nike只為員工開展名為學道apps來自我增值。
good,"I had a pretty good experience overall at Nike. Besides being dog tired after an 8-hour shift, it is a good place for people looking for a  part-time or seasonal job."
good,A typical day: Fun/energetic
good,Its an ok temporary job. Good discount on Nike products. They are big on recycling. Decent training. Not to big on really teaching you how the software works though. If there is a problem regarding software they want leads to deal with it rather than really teaching you how to resolve issues even though its fairly good software and almost idiotproof.
good,Every day a different problem to solve in a diverse and productive working environment.
good,"It was ok, worked overnight so mostly left to our own devices, Management and training were pretty bad though had to rely alot on my team to help me through basic training"
good,Relaxed company in a fast pace environment. Most management was willing to work with you and help you either advance or improve. Fun to meet new individuals on a daily basis.
good,"Working for a company like Nike is fun.... If you have the right management. There are managers who have it out for some employees while others are awesome. We have 10 Managers/Leads who want 10 Different things. My store was all over the place. "
good,The hyper competitive culture is both its strength and its weakness. Can be fun but middle managers are poorly trained and some are empire builders who do not have the companies or the employees best interests in mind.
good,Great environment to work with a lot of support from your team. Energetic atmosphere with competitive flow from peers to accommodate customers. Could be a bit overwhelming come holiday season if not ready.
good,"La cultura laboral es extraordinaria, la forma de comunicación es excelente, ya que es una direccion horizontal."
good,"buen ambiente, muy buenos compañeros y facilidad de empleo"
good,"Es un buen puesto de trabajo temporal, ya que trabajas fines de semana y el centro esta abierto todos los días del año 7 días a la semana, y para trabajar toda la vida no lo veo bien, ya que vas al revés del mundo y trabajas siempre que es fiesta para todos. Así que para un tiempo trabajar allí esta bien, ya que se cobra bien."
good,"Manage Support Desk logged requests and ensuring work is undertaken in accordance with Service Level Agreement (SLAs).  Where SLAs are not met, liaise with the up line or relevant team to address, and rectify failed SLAs.  Effectively communicate progress of request to users, Regional and International IT teams, businesses, and external service providers. Provide application, desktop, Mac, Desktop & MFP printers, Smart & IP telephone, Web & email, user access& Accounts, support to end users via phone, remote connectivity and by visiting their location.

Maintain current with the latest technology and techniques to support the technical environment and business needs.  Adhere to policies and procedures maintaining confidentiality in matters of sensitive or restricted information.  Perform other related duties that may be requested from time to time"
good,"I enjoyed my time with Nike, and was even fortunate to even help reopen the one in Santa Monica. I enjoy the team work that everyone there seems to poses. I was able to grow with the company within only a year. I believe this is one of those rare cases of if you actually try hard you get appreciated for it. I unfortunately was in my final semester of school and had to go back full time, but I recommend working for this company."
good,Management was sub par but the co-workers make the job fun not to mention you were athletic gear everyday as a uniform. The discounts definitely make the job worth it.
good,Nike is a great place if your first job. They are super flexible for school and if you have a second job. The weekends can get backed but overall its easy work.
good,it was pretty fun for a while. then you see that you HAVE to have an open availability for the weekends which really sucks because if you do try and get another part time job it limits you very much
good,"Clock in"
good,everything was good at nike! we had a supervisor who was a real jerk ! but for the most part nike is a great and well respected company to work for. I enjoyed my experience
good,"Most people that work there are there for the benefits of working at Nike. It's a clicky sort of group. You're either in or your not. To make it, so to speak, you have to drink the Kool-Aid so to speak, but that's just the Nike lifestyle."
good,"Same as Dubai World Comments as this is one company.  This is the retail division of the Dubai World Managing the GO sport stores earlier, one of the division for DW."
good,"Excellent perks. Great place to work for. HQ is beautiful. Great work culture. World class gym on site, take breaks from work to go work out and be active."
good,The management team was friendly and fun! Typical retail duties. Great discount and free shoes and pants/shorts every 6 months. Free shirts as promotions changed.
good,"Friendly and nice environment. Management has a lot of issues within their group that is noticable throughout the store. Unrealistic expectations that only a robot is capable of. Personally, I feel like I should be getting paid more. I started at $8.75/hr, now new hires are getting paid just as much as I do and I had to work about 5 years total to get where I'm at financially."
good,"My work with young children and families in the program has been invaluable. Decent enough pay for the field, great benefits, fun Nike community. Not much room to move non-laterally."
good,Aangenaam werksfeer en goede job goede loon super ervaring
good,"I like working there because I learned a lot of things like to checked shoes, pack and unpacked. The management is strict but its okay. The workplace is good. The hardest part of my job is being far from my house where I live. I Enjoyed working with my co-workers because we treat each other like a family."
good,Great people and experience. I learned a lot throughout the years. Management wasn't very good but overall a cool place of employment. Very laid back. You work independently.
good,"Great company, esp. you are an FTE. In general, people are nice, and supportive, and you can always find a tech guru in any area when you need any help."
good,"As an accounting assistant, we have a specific set of responsibilities to tend to around the store, operations wise. The most difficult part of the job is the difficult customers."
good,É uma empresa onde se preocupam com seus colaboradores.
good,"I work in recon and the people are lazy. They have everyone work but people they show favoritism to. Unfair pay"
good,I mean the job was a job. Nothing special or different really but the discount you received when you go to the Nike factory. I was temp not permanent.
good,"The typical workday at Nike is very busy projects, meetings, follow-ups, etc. working in the team is the major part when working within the team and cross-functional. Management is good. The environment is Productive and fun workplace."
good,Nike is a great place to work with great benefits and excellent pay.  I  considered it my dream job was was laid off due to budget issues.  I would recommend this company to anyone.  Although getting an interview call is very tough.
good,Leukste baan van de wereld met heel veel vrijheid. Goede structuur
good,Nike Is job if you need money badly. There is no room for advancement. The management team is ok but the team leads are terrible. They are very judgmental and doesn't like to help or answer your questions. They are Unnecessarily strict
good,"A typical day on the job includes morning reporting and putting out fires. Afternoon is built around report creation and meetings."
good,"With Nike, you meet a lot of people and hear a lot of great stories. A great learning experience. It is a retail store so you still have to work busy weekends Black Friday, Back to school etc.."
good,Nike is a fast pace business of employment.  You must be attentive and be aware of your cycle counts so that you do not run out of your products.  This is very important.
good,During the week the traffic was pretty slow but when the weekends came it was super busy.  I enjoy helping customers find their style of work out clothes or shoes.  i enjoyed being behind the register and keeping up with fraud
good,"Productive and fun workplace. Reflects the culture they promote. Plenty of opportunity for advancement through the company. Good benefits, company discounts, and incentives."
good,"1o emprego, boa experiência. Equipa simpática e dedicada. Bom espírito de equipa e de trabalho de equipa. Bom ambiente. Empresa cumpridora a nível de pagamentos."
good,Nike was a fun place to work at. You were able to meet all kinds of costumers from all over the world. Being able to help people pick out the right kind of equipment for things was great getting them prepared for whatever activity they were going for.
good,"Benefits outway the salary. And you're not allowed to where competitor brands, but the salary in the manufacturing facility it sufficient to pay the price for nike garb."
good,I just feel like we hire the wrong management and they don't reward the real hard workers. we go through about 5 or 6 different managers a year. other than that it would be a great place for opportunity.
good,"Besides my current manager and the way he manages I have no problem with working for Nike. Good benefits,discounts and overall a great company to work for."
good,"A normal day at Nike would be working in the stockroom, taking in large amounts of shipment, and processing all the new product that comes in. Over the years i have learned a lot about the standard business model, how to run a high volume store while training multiple employees, and how to work together in a close environment. The store is a laid back but hard working group of about 80 people. The hardest part of the job is going through the orientation. It is a lot to take in all at once. The most enjoyable part of the job is the friends you make there."
good,over all working at nike has been a good experience only thing dislike about nike is its takes a while be for people from temporary to perminet........
good,"Team work but with a lot of stress and pressure due to deadlines and production. Peak seasons are really stressful but you gain a lot of experience from them. Nike lets you cross train in all of their areas, Returns, Picking, Packing, Processing, Shipping, Receiving,"
good,The place is great the merchandise is great. Management is not all that great. For managers to get payed about $20 an hour all they do is sit in the office.
good,"Fun, fast-paced team sports focused job. Completed daily tasks working with team sports designing flyers, logos, and coupons. Worked from home submitting daily projects."
good,"It was a privilege to work for the #1 Athletic company in the World for as long as I did.  The benefits and compensation were very good, and I am extremely grateful for the many opportunities, career experiences, and quality people I was fortunate to work with. The culture, people, and brand direction changed intensely during my time there, and the company became very ""corporate.""  Leaders were put in place that had little to no experience with the respective sport category they were directed to lead, and the culture of fostering career development went very stale.  While change is inevitable, as a lifelong fan of the Brand I do hope that the company never loses sight of the vision of Coach Bill Bowerman and Phil Knight, and what the heritage and foundation of Nike was built upon."
good,Overall great environment. Individuals who value great opportunity and are driven to succeed will do well here. work ethic means a lot to the company.
good,had a great experience working here besides the grown children and the mean stuck up bosses it was great. Clean and safe working environment. very easy tasks
good,"the sport world for joggers,runners the different style of footwear and items to wear for the different weather will depend what you are doing for the day"
good,"The brand is great. Each job depends primarily on manager. I have had great ones, and recently bad ones. When they are good you truly learn a lot and how to exceed. When they are and, they simply don't care."
good,de werksfeer met de collega's was heel goed maar en werd door de coaches meestal niet geluisterd en er was een verschil te merken hoe sommige collega's voorrang kregen.
good,It's a fun place to work at. They don't give you many hours but it's still good experience and a good time working there. Give it a try. I know you'll like it.
good,I loved the cultured atmosphere working at nike. Every body type from every background would visit from all around the world. We built incredible relationships with everyone.
good,Great job if you like being around Nike and working retail. You get to learn a lot about nike and its history. Work attire is very comfortable because its all nike apparel.
good,"A typical workday consisted of unloading a delivery truck with nike material. And then processing the new material. Also throughout the day, the items sold in the store need to be re-stocked with the items in the stock room."
good,"Great places to work for, so many things to learn. Great place for athletes that want to get far in the industry. Best retail job I've ever worked for hands down."
good,"Productive and fun place to work. "
good,I was working through a temporary service Adecco. But while I was working at Nike it was a nice place of employment everyone there helped one another. The supper visor's were working with the employees and made our job fun
good,In Nike there is a strong emphasis on teamwork  so we all work together very well. It is a fun work environment because everyone gets along so well. fun!
good,"I'm only a contractor for Nike. So, I'm rarely on-site. But going to shoots, meeting with athletes and interviewers, creating content that would eventually be seen by millions, is all very exciting."
good,A typical night at work was pretty fun. It was fast pace but not the uncomfortable kind it was more encouraging and made you want to put all your effort to do your best.
good,"Pretty cool atmosphere, While managing 350 emplpoyees in our store it's a great place to show the team what they are really capable of and make something of themselves. By interacting with guests day to day, problem solve strategies that may be difficult for members to get out of. We try to incorporate FUN into the workplace. We do that in our mornings before the store opens. It makes the team happy and take the intuitive to help guests out, it gets the morale in the store flowing enthusiaticness, overall team satisfaction. "
good,A typical day at work is a win win win mentality. We strive to reach our daily goals each and every shift. We usually have a meeting before we start work. We discuss everything we need to know for the shift and the rest of the week.
good,Working on this place was more than learning. I got to know the skill of saling items and how to interact with customers. I find this place most challenging than any place. Learning about things and how things works & made. What is the difference between quality product i find in this place while working.
good,Nike fostered a very good work environment. Employees and management worked well together. Daily work experience promoted team work and camaraderie.
good,"Good for college students. Very poor job work/life balance. Job security is fair."
good,A typical day would consist of talking to every customer walking into the door and assuring them in finding whatever product they are looking for. The hardest part of my job was dealing with theft and learning how to approach people. The most enjoyable part was being able to constantly interact with people and co-workers.
good,Everyday I'm learning from small things to big things. In items or in different kinds of people that I'm encountering. I learned how to be patient in every customer and situations that I'm facing. For me the hardest and enjoyable part of being a sales associate is the customers. I find it hard because it's really hard to handle irate customers but in the same time enjoyable because whenever i served them genuinely i felt successful because they are living the store with a smile in their faces.
good,Great place to work for.  The people are nice and easy to get along with.  I've learned many things at this company.  They take a long time putting people on as a permanent employee.
good,Normal day was helping customers and teammates. You learn what it means to be a team player. Everyone was just wonderful to work with. Hardest part of the job was making sure everyone was satisfied.
good,"was very organized and well ran for the most part; while continuing to stay positive and get the job done. Gave promised hours and stuck to them, management was very approachable."
good,"I loved my job, being surrounded by sports, and the brand in general because Nike was always such a big part of my life. I helped in footwear, apparel, the register, and in the back. I was usually really busy because I'm bilingual, so I liked it."
good,Most mornings I greet my coworkers and begin to discuss the plans for the day. Once we've had a discussion wewait on our truck for the day. Process our product and discus what goes where.
good,"The Jordan Brand is fast paced and well-connected to the consumer. Energy runs high in the brand and one must be ready to keep up with the pace. A division of Nike, Jordan Brand has high expectations and strong goals very much in line with the expectations of the Inc."
good,"Before I started to study I completed a 3-year apprenticeship as a management assistant for"
good,"There is opportunity depending on your work location.  If you have good leaders, and you are willing to move stores, there is opportunity for advancement."
good,"everyday was different but the same. you get to talk to a wide variety of people and show them what you have in store. everybody that works there is chill and get along as a ""team."" discount was pretty sweet. black friday kind of sucked but it only came once a year."
good,i learned a lot about where nike came from and all the latest about nike products. there are some really good nike stories
good,"La plus grande force de NIKE est l'esprit d'équipe , quand vous rentré dans un magasin NIKE vous pouvez la sentir et presque la touché ."
good,"On an average work day, we would have to clock in and have an early meeting to run down the daily goals. After the meeting, it was time to voice pick objects and send them down the line. Production was measured."
good,Work at nike is easy and the people you work with are great. the allen store gets really rude customers on a daily basis. The management for nike would be the biggest con in my opinion. The hourly staff members hold the store together compared to management.
good,"Most of my days where spent in meetings discussing what needed to be done rather than doing it. "
good,"If you get the job you want, you're set.  However, if you get a job at a store or in a general labor position and are expecting to move somewhere else in the company, do not expect a lot of support or information.  People simply do not respond to emails and HR isn't very helpful."
good,"- Writing ui automation and performance scripts for could application"
good,loved working here. the managers were friendly. you had great coworkers. fun atmosphere. hot new clothes and shoes. it was never a dull moment working there.
good,"The free stuff was cool, but can repetitive after awhile. Also working weekends is a must to keep this job. But if you just need a job to make some extra cash Nike is pretty good"
good,The type of work place they have I would say it's a easy going type. The style is retail and the customers and employees all have smiles and they all greet you well.
good,"I worked as a Sales associate for Nike in Deer Park, New York. Handled customer service and product management. Worked about 40 hours per week."
good,A typical day at work consist of me counting inventory (because I am an inventory specialist) and on days we ran out of work me threw shoes.
good,"nike is a great company with so much to offer and knowlegde to learn about retail, sports, social environments, up beat work environment and nike clothing and shoe advancements"
good,"I was in charge of setting up activities and practice. I would instruct the campers on certain exercises and help them improve their individual events such as sprinting, distance running, long jump, and high jump."
good,"Nike is a fast paced international company with collegues from all over the world. Working here, you are willing to run the extra mile and show what you bring to the company, but also benefit from the extra little things the company offers you.."
good,Very fun environment to be in. The job does require a lot of energy and patience with getting task done as well as making sure customer satisfaction is key.
good,I loved it. I got a chance to talk about shoes all day. I just needed something more realistic and higher paying. Overall I have nothing bad to say about my experience with Nike. Great place for a younger student to start.
good,A typical day at work is busy being a trainer. I grew a lot and learned many new skills. We had a strong team and always worked well together. The hardest part of the job is how physical it is. The best part of the job was helping others achieve their health and fitness goals.
good,"pazarlama ile alakalı bilgi kazandığım işyerinden biri"
good,It was a very steady pace every day ther . learn how to use tools there and be given handy tips there.the mangers are always on their job an superviers also. cowokers dnt worry bout nobody but themselves only if u do.
good,I typical day at Nike is working with people whom do not appeciate your work. Working there can be a depressed space in your life.
good,"great place to learn "
good,"Nike culture is very fast paced and it is very fun. Sometimes the management is not very helpful, especially when there is a high tourist volume. Employees definitely make the workplace alot of fun."
good,"Growing company with opportunity for the most diverse work force imaginable. "
good,"Having worked at Nike for 2 years now i have gained a lot of experience and have experienced every kind of customer that could possibly walk into a retail store, being such a popular store there is no average genre of people that come into this store in West Brom. My typical day at work would consist of either, working on the till, being the face of the store, greeting customers, selling their desired items, stock co-ordinating, handling cash, processing stock (e.g pricing, hanging, counting, tagging ect.) arranging footwear into the correct order so that its easier for the customers to shop and staying on top of standards. I have learn't a lot about customer service, how to handle customers according to their desires or needs, and how to present myself in those situations. also learning how to stay concentrated and get the task done as quick as possible as been a clearance store there is a lot to stay on top of and a lot to be done throughout the day. I get on so well with my co-workers its like we are a little family, with banter and also being proffesional when need be.The hardest part of the job would be trying to get everything done within one day, and one shift seeing as there is so much to get through, its a busy store. the most enjoyable part of my job, is being able to represent a large brand such as Nike and knowing that there is so many opportunities when working for such a company as this."
good,Good place for part-time work. Little room for advancement. Not enough hours. Good place for retail experience. And discounts on shoes.
good,McDonalds was a ok job for someone who don't have kids and just worried about theyself but for someone with kids and looking for better things in life McDonalds just wasn't the career job for anyone..
good,"c'est une entreprise ou il est agreabmle de travailler l'esprit d'equipe règne "
good,Working for Nike has been a good Filler job for me. I make a little bit of extra money which helps some with paying bills. A nice benefit is the discount that they offer. I have gone through a few store managers in the time I have worked for them (some better than others). Overall though the experience has not been bad.
good,"Nike is a great place to work if you are motivated and can stay focused on your goals that will drive your career.  There are many distractions, but if you stay focused and network well you will always have opportunities."
good,"With the creative, energetic and diverse employees, a day at work is always exciting and interesting.  I learned about managing deliverables from a cross-functional team of 12 to ensure quality completion of tasks on or before project due date.  I learned how to manage inventory of digital assets and coordinate placement into appropriate customer-facing media to maximize impact of presentation and drive sales.  I also coordinated and managed outside vendors and agencies and negotiated contracts to ensure project budget compliance. I enhanced my skills to initiate problem solving protocol when adverse events arise to ensure project integrity and completion within designated timeframe.  "
good,The constant innovation and desire to by the most dynamic company in sporting goods was ideal.  Due to corporate restructuring they unfortunately eliminated half of our sales force.
good,nice and friendly staff. Days would be busy and kept active. Gained many skills from working here from a business prospective. Management would be reasonable and helpful when shift swapping was needed. Highly respectable in the sense of study comes first to the workers that needed time off for school or college.
good,"The most enjoyable part of my job is doing the job in a timely manner, while maintaining professionalism with your co workers."
good,they will work u like a dogg! WE have had mandatory overtime for the past 9months with only 1 day off. you have no time for your family oryour self.
good,Great place to work. The fast paced environment was a great test of my troubleshooting abilities and the turnover rate of work. Management had a clear vision and were able to convey the messages clearly to all employees.
good,"A empresa em si, era boa de se trabalha com pessoas legal como toda empresa sempre tem aquelas má pessoas, porem as boas eram mais, a gestão também era bem legal beneficio e condições boas, não queria ter saído da empresa porém era temporário e o quadro de funcionários estava completo."
good,I loved it here!! All the people were friendly and I got a chance to move around all day. The shifts weren't long enough because of all the employees. It was definitely an enjoyable and learning experience.
good,"I loved my time at Nike because the pay was great, most of my coworkers were great, and a couple of the managers were great. However, I was let go and told it was because of one thing, but it left a bad taste in my mouth because I wasn't given a chance to stay on with my position and other coworkers were. After having mutual friends with some of the coworkers tell them no one understands or knows why I was let go, it's hard to have good memories or respect the store itself and who's running it. Pay and coworkers are awesome though."
good,Great pay but you always have to look busy even though most of the time you won't be. One of the worst set of customers I've ever had to deal with.
good,"I enjoyed my time at Nike. Everyone really worked as a team, ane everyone was very supportive of one another. The Manager was very big or helping the employees grow,and reaching higher levels within the Nike community."
good,O ambiente de trabalho é extremamente agradável mas a valorização do profissional não é tão agradável quanto o ambiente tendo salários baixos e impossibilidade na utilização de alguns benefícios da empresa.
good,"Working at Nike, I would work in mens and women's apparel, footwear and the cash registers. My tasks included cleaning, handling cash, organizing, stocking, folding, and customer service"
good,During my time working in the Nike Store i found it was an easy place to work and the staff members were nice and i would recommend anyone who is into sports retail to work here.
good,Its a great place to work. If you want to build up your resume they are a great company. Staff is great and so is management.
good,"Waiting to find out where you will be working , doing exercise before work began, how to perform job, okay .the cafeteria."
good,"Key is sales, so looking at previous years sales is essential. Set up daily goals for each employee and make sure the stores goals are meet.  We hired a great staff which reflected in the sales. "
good,"De samenwerking met de collega's was voor mij een belangrijke meerwaarde."
good,"Une journée type tourne autour des indicateurs de vente et du coaching des équipes de vente. Beaucoup d’opportunités de développement verticales et transversales. Management assez perfectible avec des collaborateurs imprégnés de la culture d'entreprise."
good,I really enjoyed my job I learned a lot and this job helped me realize I like fast paced jobs that keep you busy . Just wasn't fond of the way you have the feeling that you might not have a job the next day. People were getting laid off and let go they seem to not understand people have a life outside of work and life happens to where sometimes you can't show up for work not very understanding. We had a meeting one time where one of the supervisor of Kelly Service said this is Oregon we can fire you for whatever reason we want many people did not like they way her voice was directed toward us and her attitude. Made as though we have no reason to even show up at all if they can basically fire you for no reason. Not stable enough. But I did like my other temp Co workers everyone is friendly and I got a long with basically everyone. The supervisors for Kelly services gave you false hopes about this job at the orientation saying you will be hired after the contract for a year and you collect unemployment and then they hire you back on which it doesn't seem nothing that way once you havebbeen  there for more then a month and really see how things fly there I felt as though I was wasting my time even though I really did enjoy the work there . I don't get why companies go through temp services other then that I did like my job at Nike but did not enjoy Kelly services.
good,"Great Brand,  great product, great events. Nike is one of the most innovative brands in the world. Most enjoyable part of the job was being so closely connected to the consumer. Hardest part of adapting to the culture. Typical day was in the market connecting with accounts, consumers, influencers etc."

good,"1. Manage QA SAP systems for Nike Inc."
good,"A typical day at work lasted approximately four to six hours because that is how long most of my shifts were. Some weeks I was only scheduled for 10 hours. I learned  a lot about retail and a lot about customer service. My co-workers were amazing with the exception of one using the ""sucking up"" to management method to get ahead. The hardest part of the job was learning the register. The most enjoyable part was working in footwear and helping customers find the right shoe for them."
good,Nike is a very fun environment to work in! especially if you enjoy helping people and love having fun while keeping busy. The things you learn are cool with apperal and footwear.
good,it has much to offer for those who can spend a lot of time there
good,"Offering premium customer service to the public. Maintaining the sales floor (apparel, equipment, and footwear). At the end of the night, athletes (employees) will work together to restore the look of all areas of the store, take out the trash, clean windows, and sweep. Hardest part of the job is making sure the customers feel welcomed, and staying knowledgeable about products."
good,I enjoyed the high energy atmosphere. I did not enjoy the unstable scheduling.
good,Short term contracts but great place.You will really like it
good,I did enjoy working here and learning a lot f new techniques when it comes to working in apparel. I enjoyed feeling the team bond between co-workers. I enjoyed being able to help consumers find what they were looking for.

We use carts to help us get boxes each and every day i had to pack the product lab n push it on the scanner.The hardest part of my job was meeting production on the days we were slow. And my most enjoyable part about my job was having a great team behind you helping and looking out for each other."

good,"Learned to maintain good Standards,"
good,A typical day at work is just another day. I have learned that you cannot be friend everyone.
good,"The Nike brand was involved in the 2013 Chicago Marathon and I had the responsibility of gathering, organizing and beginning the edit of the sizzle video of the event.  There were over 6 cameras with different capturing formats which needed to be organized and labeled properly so that myself and other editors could work seamlessly and quickly."
good,Nike is a great organization to work for.  Lots opportunities for those who are passionate about the brand and work hard.  Sport is a lifestyle working for Nike; it never feels like a chore.  The best part about the job is being able to speak and be authentic to the brand.
good,"As administrative assistant in the facility, I am involved in several daily facets of picking, packing and shipping of all golf apparel and equipment made by Nike and is shipped all around the world.  We also supply the requests from all athletes, celebrities, etc and ship directly to them or their agents."

good,"gezellige collegas en een leuke sfeer,het was vrij normaal en verder niet veel over te zeggen."
good,My co-workers were the best. A typical day at work never happened. Nothing is ever typical because we experienced something new every day. Our managers pushed the team motto very well.
good,A typical day at work included customer service along with clothing and footwear sales.
good,"A typical day at Nike is pretty fun depending on what type of day it is. If it's busy, then it's fun because you get to interact with customers as well as your fellow athlete's. If the day is less busy, then it may seem very boring, but there is always something to do to make them time go by fast. The employees were great people. Some were sneakerheads and some some weren't, but they love them some Nike shoes (and Jordans). Management is great depending who is manager. Sometimes they get at you about certain things but it's really not all that serious. Nike is a great job with many great opportunities."
good,"A day at Nike consist of hard work and dedication. The customer and the brand is alway our main focus. Striving for excellence is the key to making the job successful. The management team is a wonderful group of people. They are willing to always reach out and help any athlete in any area they need the most. The hardest part of my job is really try to satisfy the customer as much as possible. A lot of the times a consumer may come in looking for something they might have viewed online but because we are an outlet store we don't always get the newest footwear and apparel. The most enjoyable part of the job is really meeting new people each and every day from all different parts of the world, cultures, and backgrounds."
good,Continuing to push the limits in all regards.  Innovation is a must no matter what the job.  It is a place where you're always looking to the future and what could be improved to be better.

I learned how to work under a high stress environment and to put the needs of a customer first, providing the best shopping experience for them. I also learned how to be a team player at a job that has over 200 employees. The hardest part of the job is holiday season. The store is extremely packed with customers who are throwing the clothes everywhere to get whatever size they need and the lines to the registers are reaching the back of the store. But it all pays off when I see the customers walk out happy and when they give a compliment to my managers about my customer service. The most enjoyable part of the job is when I get a customer compliment and working with an awesome team of people."
good,Working here allowed me to do my best work. I was always able to stay focued on what i needed to do. Consumers coming and going just knowing youve made some impact upon their day.
good,"great camaraderie within design peers, which was great to have in an intense environment of hard work and play"
good,A typical day at work included testing golfs and developing new tests. I learned about different material that were used in golf balls and the benefits each material had on the performance of the ball.  My co-workers were very friendly and willing to teach.

good,Learned AFS process while at Nike and day to day production support issues.

good,"Very easy going location, get to work at your own pace. Good job to start off in the retail sales world."
good,"Tive grande crescimento profissional na Nike com diversas oportunidades que provavelmente não terei novamente em minha carreira profissional."
good,"This company has definitely changed over the years, they are the largest apparel manufacturer in the world."
good,An aspirational environment with department interaction and 'can-do' attitude.
good,"	Developed Sales Report Analysis and Support for Sales Team "
good,"asesorar al cliente, incrementar mis ventas objetivamente de la meta personal, mi gran labor era que el cliente quedara satisfecho con la compra que realizara,"
good,Typical retail experience with many perks in an environment that is procured by Nike. A great company to be associated with.
good," A typical day at work was to spend a lot of time talking and helping the customers and being in Cash. I learned there to work in group and to be more responsible with them. The hardest part of the job was the match day, because we had work until 3 am, but at the same time was the most enjoyable part of the job."
good,"Day to day operations don't have a lot of changes to them. Working to get out customer orders, maintaining work flow in the building, constant communication with management. I've learned a lot in my time with Nike. I have been fortunate enough to have great managers who have taught me the importance of communication, knowing your workers, and the difference between managing and leading. I've develop good leadership, listening, and communication skills. Co-worker are pretty much the same as in anywhere you might go. Supportive, team players, and show respect. You occasionally have the ones who will be jealous of you success and try to deter you. Overall Nike is a good company that I have been proud to work for, and grow within."
good,- Receiving the truck
good,A ter respeito é ser responsavel com os seus deveres mas as pessoas que nela prestão ó serviço não ó fazen por reponsabilidade é respeito mas por o brigação assim fica um ambiente frio e sem motivação
good,It is an overall good job. The only thing is they don't like to give raises.
good,A typical work day at Nike was fun and exciting everyday because we always had something great to do. Management was great and the co-workers where good to get along with. The hardest part about this job that i couldn't get use to having fun at work.
good,I've worked at Nike for eight years and was able to hone and learn skills that have been applicable in all areas of my professional and personal life.
good,"A busy, upbeat atmosphere selling premium product to enthused customers both new and long time Nike shoppers."
good,This was a fun place to work. It was busy and fast paced at times. The most enjoyable part of the job was the new people you meet on a regular basis.
good,It's nice to get a permanent job coz it's so close to my place but not hiring they use Agency workers for more than a year and you cannot go back.which is so sad for the .Agency workers(2080hrs).And 80% to 85% agency workers working on them the rest permanent workers.
good,I enjoyed this position since it brought together writing and design as I rolled out a new web presence for their vendors.
good,"My days at Nike were great. I would get in two hours before the store opened to make sure everything was in place and ready. When the store opened we did sales work, cashiers, clean, and customer service. We didn't get commission for the sales we helped make but we did them effectively anyways. The management was immature and unstable. The co-workers were a great set of people who got along well. The hardest part about it was standing and even that wasn't too bad. The best part to me was the interaction with people."
good,I love working in retail more behind the scenes making the workplace functional and successful.
good,Management empowers employees and they provide excellent benefits
good,Nike is a good company. The work isn't hard or dangerous. Great first start job. Safety plays a part in the smooth operation of day to day work. Hours are flexible and the location was beneficial to my travels to and from work.
good,I enjoyed working at Nike very much just didn't care for all the politics that went along. It wasn't really about how good of job you did it was all about who you know in the company
good,"Just do your job, come to work on time, come back from breaks on time and don’t stay in the restrooms too long. Also, if you allow them to take advantage of your work ethic they will so try not to over work yourself with out a proper pay raise like I often do"
good,Nike is amazing. But work is work and this is a difficult place to work and progress. Work life balance is great and the facilities for fitness are amazing. Compensation could be much better. There is minimal room for growth. Very difficult to jump from analyst to manager and manager to director.
good,Nike prides itself in always staying ahead of the competition and educating its employees to propel that innovation. They do try and take good care of their employees and ensure their brick and mortar stores are fresh and unique.
good,This is a fun calm work environment. I learned how to handle high traffic volume as far as customers. the most enjoyable part is the people you work with your team .
good,"Good experience, learnt a lot about the products and technology. Great staff discount. Nice work culture. People are nice to work with. Mixture of different employees."
good,"I worked in a Nike. I did many different jobs. Packing, Picking, Counting, Writing on the blackboard, Re stoking, Sorting label and many things in the apparel department. Apparel team is very good. I learned how to pick the items using bar code. My favorite part of the work is team work. I love to work in a Nike it is good place to work."
good,Working at Nike was a relax experience. When you work there you get to wear athletic attire. You didn’t have to wear pants or something. One of the job that you could show up to with the same outfit you wore in the job.
good,My overall experience at the nike warehouse was productive. Constantly able to get to work on time frequently. Worked as a team and would volunteer to help fellow package handlers process in the workplace.
good,"I loved my job, for a long time, the brand was something I could believe in and be proud of.  However the management is what killed it for me.  I never said no when they asked me to do something, but I never felt appreciated.  They will do what they have to save their own hides."
good,"all the managers were white... like really white. there was no understanding of the different groups of people"
good,"great culture, no discipline, no followup,can get away with anything if your not a leader. leaders are good but no backing and athletes have more control, especially when the are together and are friends, with leaders."
good,"vrij hoge productie vraag van medewerker,  weinig communicatie"
good,"The Nike team really made the job experience super fun! We were always learning new training and information about the products, it made selling fun!!"
good,"Great experience, fun people"
good,it was alright. they don't pay enough but the discount is clutch. the training i went through was amazing the management was cool except the lady who runs the stockroom she's a little annoying
good,"A typical day included patrolling the store, a ton of organizing, and making the best possible impressions with customers. I learned how to up-sell, provide great customer service, and work a retail type job. I liked the management, they were good leaders and were very clear with their expectations of us. The culture was very laid back and it was a good job for me as a high schooler. However, the hardest part was working retail because it was a lot of walking around doing busy work for not that much pay. I did really like my co-workers and managers. Everyone there was very easy to get along with."
good,It was ok I was glad to be apart of a thriving business. I would recommend this job to anyone who is interested in a good job but I had to move on to bigger and better things
good,When busy time flys by but when not managers want you to do something when there’s nothing to do. But overall I liked working there because of the clients and coworkers.
good,The hardest part of the job is the schedule. Sometimes we go home at 2 in the morning and going to work at 8 in the morning the next day. But it’s a such fun place to work because you get to know people with different nationalities and cultures. I have learned a lot and got the opportunity to upgrade my task to managerial position.
good,"Great job to work at, just high demanding schedule needs if part-time. For what my resume was worth, it definitely was not being taken into consideration for my worth. The pay is minimum unless you voice it. But the work environment is amazing and very energetic to be at so there is many percs."
good,A typical day at work was not challenging but did provide its speed bumps. Retail is sometimes sluggish industry to work in.  Management was smart and knew how to manage a big workforce.
good,"The company treats the employees well enough ( benefits, PTO, etc.) But they do not reward loyalty enough. I worked there for nearly 5 years and ran stores temporarily in between store managers and never felt truly respected or considered by my direct superiors. I got passed over for several promotions and noone could tell me what I needed to improve on."
good,Great company to work for and wonderful people.  Always looking out for one another and willing to step into any role to complete the task at hand.  Management understood most issues and was always willing to get their hands dirty and help in any situation that arose.  Amazing products and discounts for employees.
good,I loved the family aspect of the job. I would come in and be ready for anything and always knew my teammates had my back. I would say that it would depend on the store you work at though.
good,I am the stylist at Nike so I will change the mannequins into items that consumers will buy based on current trends. It is a great place to learn some customer service.
good,Empresa boa para primeiro emprego. Equipe boa de se trabalhar.
good,I loved Nike during highs cool as they were flexible with my work schedule. I liked their atmosphere but the managers were very overbearing. They love to micromanage and that makes people feel inadequate.
good,"I have worked in Nike for 2 years and enjoyed culture in Nike along with team. "
good,"The big thing is to be ready to change directions at a moment's notice. It happens a lot. With a company this big, frequent changes aren't surprising."
good,I've been with Nike Canada for over 12 years. It is a great company. I was able to work with amazing people and athletes. There is a lot of perks and excitement.
good,It is a fun place to work very flexible on hrs great part-time job.  Teamwork makes the dream work. great place to work Usually a lot of young employees. They give you free work clothes and shoes. not bad for a first job or part-time job for when you're at college.
good,"The workplace culture at Nike is very lazy. Not many people do their jobs and people are always talking, which becomes a problem if you're a hard worker and always trying to get a task done. It results in you doing all the work while everyone is slacking, and management doesn't even care. The plus side is that everyone is friends within the workplace."
good,Working at Nike was a great experience. They have a very open workplace culture and you're able to quickly learn the skills to help there busy grown and yourself at the same time.
good,"Working at Nike is cool and the hours were super flexible, but they hire many employees so it is difficult to accumulate more than about 10 hours/week."
good,"productive fast paced fun workplace great team mates"
good,"It's a competitive and fast-paced atmosphere, working on innovate projects. Teams are diverse and talented. Lots of opportunities to move to different groups."
good,"A typical day at work was nice, not too stressful and usually a different position daily."
good,"The majority of my time was in Asia. I was in China, Vietnam and Indonesia. The typical day at work in the factory as a Lean Master Coach drive improvement in the factory environment. Anything from problem solving on the spot, coaching people how to identify and solve problem, look for way to improve productivity and quality. "
good,Great store to start out at as far as part time. The associates are kind and helpful. Nice clean Work space. Good music. I really just wish they paid more
good,Lot's of opportunity when working with them. Their office culture is the best in sportswear design and development. I learned so much from this job. Truly.
good,"Nike has been a great place to work and Ive been lucky to have worked on some highly visible projects. Managers are ht and miss, just speak up. There still seems to be a preference to pedigree, meaning the more affluent you are (what school you attended, culture, etc.) the further you get at Nike."
good,I was a picker so normal day was always fast paced and long. You are on your feet walking non stop. There is quota here so you try to meet the quota on a daily basis. Sometimes there aren't of orders so the day may be short and you pay varied depending if you were working the full time or half of the day. TO me this job was okay for me at the time due to just coming home from college and trying to have income coming in until I was able to peruse something else.
good,Sales associate...help customers with Nike product. Assist them in making informative decisions on their purchases and providing product knowledge. Providing the best customer service for return visits
good,Great company to work for! Filled with great opportunities and the ability to enjoy going to work every singe day. The management teams seem to be the issue as most just squat on their position once they receive it. Coaching and developing is a colossal opportunity as most managers sit in the office and do not help coach in the moment.
good,"Nike is exactly what you think it is supposed to be. "
good,"I worked there seasonally for the summer during high school and really enjoyed it. It was fun and fast paced. After I graduated high school, I worked there part time but basically all the old managers had been fired or they quit. The new management was too much to deal with. Always rude and hovering over people. Expecting freight workers to finished an entire truck worth of merchandise within a day despite there being no room. The discount is great, the bonuses are amazing, and the hour long lunch is missed. Overall, I enjoyed the company just not management at my specific store."
good,"Everyday I was learning something new about the company. They had us stay up-to-date on the technologies in the apparel, footwear, and equipment by giving us a fifteen minute huddle at the start of every shift. I made some friends while working there, but it felt like a second home sometimes."
good,"A typical day at work consists of giving great customer service, helping clients with their needs. Restocking when product seems low in the store/racks."
good,Depending on the day of the week they would the management moods change often and different standards would be held for different people. Co-workers will also be ill-tempered to the managers making the managers to take things out on the other workers
good,Its A Great Place To Work unless your doing something your not supposed to be doing.They also have people walking around watching makin Sure your doin your job.
good,"the job was okay, but truth be told I would like better benefits for the work and stress having to be dealt with on a daily basis. staff worked very hard"
good,"If you work a full time and consider this as a part time, consider if you have the commitment to do another 20+ hours a week also. I enjoyed working there but burned out."
good,"Nike store was a good place to work temporarily, the athletes all got along well with each other which made work enjoyable and fun however the management are not the best as they do little work themselves which can be a pain when really busy."
good,Everyone was very friendly and worked well together but the pay wasn't that great. Had to be on your feet a lot and breaks were short but if you wore comfortable shoes it would make the days a bit easier!
good,"The company as a whole is a great company. They strive to take care of their employees and offer a great amount of detail to the products they have to offer the consumer."
good,"Ce que j'aime beaucoup du Nike c'est que nous sommes une grande famille, tout le monde s'aide et s'apprécie."
good,"Nike was my absolute favorite job. Great people, managers and energy. I did not want to leave but their new availability policy changed and would do work with my school schedule or other job."
good,Nike was a fast paced work place with plenty of work to do and plenty of overtime.the lunch break was awesome they had cooks and gave away Nike stuff on a regular
good,"If you are looking for a first job I would recommend this to you. It was my first job and was beneficial to me at the time, however, I would not choose to work there now. A typical work day includes cleaning and organizing on the sales floor, using the register, talking to customers, and teaching people about the product. The hardest part of the job was that it usually was always very very busy on weekends especially when there were sales. Checkout lines would sometimes wrap around the whole store. Luckily our team was great as checking people out quickly so it was not too bad of an experience. I personally enjoyed the busier days more. The best part was the people that I worked with and also the benefit of discounts and multiple breaks if you worked a long shift."
good,Overall Nike was a great fun work environment fast pace amazing discount but wasn’t worth the travel.. would I go back? YES IF I WAS TO MOVE CLOSER & offered a full time position
good,"Nike is a very great place to work. It has a very great opportunity for you too, also great benefits and more it's just the walking to the break room to eat."
good,I’ve worked at a Nike factory store for just under a year and it’s great... sometimes. It’s a very laid back environment but it can also get very stressful at times for full time employees.
good,"It was easy to understand other products and merchandise that Nike promoted, and was not difficult to get along with the people that worked there. Management was understanding, and knew how to ensure their employees were happy and performing at their best."
good,"Innovative company with great benefits and perks. Beautiful campus with on-site cafeteria, gym and other amenities. Promotions are political; it can be hard to climb the ladder if you don't know the right people."
good,"Very friendly, just not much room for advancement. Great job for college students and high school students. Pay isn't that amazing. Great culture and work environment."
good,"A typical day at work consisted of unloading/loading up trucks. I learned to be a leader and to train others on how to properly do the job. Management was great, I got along with all of my managers. The hardest part of the job was to contact the truck drivers to bring the trucks back and forth. The most enjoyable part of the job was working with people that i got along with and competitive individuals."
good,"Fun place when your in high school or junior college but once you start to need more, management wont move you up. They will dangle your ""promotion"" making you think you will get it until its been 8 months and still nothing. Other than that its good competitive place for youths to work and get a general idea of teamwork, commitment, and responsibility."
good,i enjoy working for Nike.  there are a few challenges that i faced while working here but overall it was nothing that i couldn't handle. i would love to work for this company as a full time employee.
good,"Nike is an amazing company and would have been a job I would love to have climbed the ladder for, however they required unrealistic availability hours for a part-time job."
good,"It was really funny to work there, The environment was good and working for nike was amazing. I like sports so I liked to sell products related on it."
good,Love that I have my own space to work  in... We find a computer log in shoot the towt down with clothes in them some have to be hung up some don't.. find the right size box for the order.. fill the order package the box and ship them down the line
good,"Big brand but they don't act that way sometimes,  Limited resources in certain instances.  Inconsistent business practices with in the industry.  Not focused on building long term customer relationships."
good,bad pay bad schedules but employees are fun and great to work with. will be a great job for someone with no kids and no life. Nike can do much better in compensating there employees who helps them make millions every year
good,Quella in Nike è stata una grandissima esperienza lavorativa finita purtroppo per mia scelta per esigenze diverse dalle opportunità fornite dall'azienda. Ho avuto modo di imparare comunque tantissime cose e sopratutto il lavoro di squadra e la definizione dei ruoli.
good,"Can be a stressful place to work at times, especially in the factory/retail setting. Some managers are hard to work with, but staff is fun to engage with. Wish there was more store team hangouts. PTO is generous, but you have blackout dates."
good,The sales associate job at Nike was very busy at times but it also very rewarding. The ability to personally help those who came in was a great experience. The hardest part was to service all the customers who would come in on busy weekends but that didnt stop most of us from doing our very best to help every person who came into the store that day.
good,At the Nike factory it was very fast paced and cut-throat. I was expecting to have fun working at Nike but the manager was very rude and disrespectful.
good,"well payed work place with incredible benefits, although can be hard to progress as there are few opportunities beyond a sales assistant and when they do arise there are a many people that apply"
good,The work space provided makes you feel really comfortable doing your tasks. They have large break rooms with all the accommodations you will need. Management can be a bit discomforting depending on your work area but the overall vibe of the company is great.
good,"I  greatly enjoyed my time as a sales associate for Nike. The work environment was laid back and extremely friendly. My coworkers felt like family. A typical day at work would include cleaning the store such as wiping down windows and dusting off clothing racks, organizing my designated section of the store, checking customers out at the register and providing any other customer satisfaction as desired."
good,"Uma empresa que busca conexão com pessoas relevantes em seus segmentos, que inspira cada ser e faz com que o esporte gere autênticas experiências."
good,Most days at Nike were good. The busy days brought out the team player in every one. The benefits made you feel secure and well taken care of. Managers step in and help when needed.
good,"Nike offers you a chance to build your social abilities with co-workers and customers, while working with other ethnicity Nike’s allows you to naturally learn from your employees, which creates a bond at a work environment"
good,I worked at Nike Chicago within the retail division at Nike. The store is located on the Magnificent Mile shopping district on Michigan Avenue. I started as a sales associate and left as an assistant floor manager.
good,"Fun employment I had in my teens, relaxed environment and good coworkers. Typical workday included assisting customers, cleaning store, answering phones, working register."
good,Enjoyed working for Converse. Management was strong and development focused. They allowed the team to learn and take ownership of there duties. All took time to reward and recognize the accomplishments of team and individuals
good,The better you are the more they rely on you.  you get to do other peoples work.  some fast pace machines and some slow pace machines.  you'll have to put up with rude people as nike tends to wait a few months before letting them go.
good,"Been working at nike for over 7 months and I have to say the work environment is really good. The team members you work with are awesome but some managers are a bit of a pain. The pay is alright, it is a standard retail pay with weekend rates. however the amount of hours you get at work will all depend on how much sale you are making. That however will make a lot of people stressed and look for a second job if you don't meet that sale target. Working at Nike they expect you to love the brand. If you are someone who likes other brand more than nike (like me), you may find yourself to have conflicts with some of your managers as some of them are die hard nike fans. The benefits aren't amazing, depending on which franchise you work for, RPG offers you 30% staff discount and generous amount of uniform voucher and Af1 offers just staff discount. please note that staff discounts only apply on items that are not limited and not on top of discounted items. So Vapormax, Jordans etc are not included. It is not amazing since competitors like adidas offer 50%."
good,"Fantastic sports oriented culture, the campus environment is meant to model a college campus."
good,"Part of it is that I was reaching the peak of my craft about  the same time my assignment was winding down and they had a major reorganization in HR and got a new manager. Was a good manager but not as easy to convince it was worth her while .to stick out her neck to ask for me to be converted as my previous manager."
good,"Liked the group I worked with, but management has changed a lot, impacting the culture.  Some lack of motivation has set in over the last year or so with a lot of the team."
good,Cool place to work if your looking for something part time and some good discounts . Managers were cool very good with working with the scheduling. Laid back culture.
good,"A lot of favoritism. You can work hard and it goes unnoticed and false promises will be made to you about certain positions. Overall culturally is a fun store, great discounts plus your discount on top of sale items. Doesn't feel like work, time flies by."
good,"Assure product is available, displayed, and priced properly for consumers. Receive and transfer product in and out of the store properly according to company standards. Executed in company mandated ""floor moves"" for everyday store function. Trained and developed new associates to their full potential."
good,"Great work environment. Good retail experience to be gained here. All kinds of customers come into the store, so you gain many adaptable ways to deal with different situations."
good,If you want a life don’t work here... if you like long hours and no personal time work here.. if the factory/warehouse is not for you don’t work here; just find another job
good,"You have daily goals to meet as a store and you and your co workers work together to meet the goal of sales for each day. Hour breaks, ping pong table"
good,"Nike is overall a great company to work for. At time's the work would be very slow, which would result in days of just being at home. The food in the cafeteria was good."
good,"Es un ambiente grato para trabajar, pero se necesita un poco más de motivaciones para las personas de retail"
good,"Fun workplace, coworkers are like family. Management has been slacking as of late. Compensation could be a lot better for the amount of money the company and, our store in particular, makes."
good,"Generally, Nike is what you make of it and you will see lots of leadership changes which often leads to an unclear vision and focus on things. Change is guaranteed to happen so roll with it and find your place. Collaboration and teamwork is a must as the fast pace and quick changes often shorten timeframe on projects and increase risk and that at least is acknowledged by management."
good,This job was fast paced especially during holidays. Pay was fair due to being a first time job. Received discounts and management was great. Friendly place to work at and there was room for growth.
good,"I loved the teams I worked with, but that management has room to grow. The culture of each store is different and you have to learn on the fly or get left behind. Moving up is almost impossible in this Market."
good,"Utilize customer service skills, basic sales techniques, and product knowledge to connect customers with the right product and drive sales. I learnt how to build the bond between the consumers and the brand by providing superior service and adapting brand stories to the retail setting.i also learnt to maintain knowledge of various store departments and be available to operate cash register for regular transactions, perform shipping and receiving duties, stock the floor, perform cleaning duties, and build visual displays when necessary."
good,"Overall I really Liked working at Nike. I think it is an interesting experience to work at the global headquarters for a major international brand. I learned a lot and I would go back if the right opportunity presented itself. "
good,Cool place to work for a sneaker head. The discounts and the intel you get first on certain products is enough alone to make the job worth it. You also meet lots of cool people.
good,The company is an interesting and valuable place to work.  It exposes the employees to many cultures and provides excellent advancement opportunities.
good,"You get what you put in. If you work hard, you will be rewarded and noticed. Quick paced environment centered totally on the consumers. You will form great relationships with your co workers"
good,A typical work day consist of packaging boxes and preparing them to be shipped. I learned how to make packaging labels and packaging slips. The job wasn't hard. Management wasn't the best. My co-workers made the job enjoyable
good,"A typical day would be spent at various accounts, 4 days a week, maintaining store presentations for each account. Mostly Monday through Friday, 8-5 with some days being longer during special campaigns/launching."
good,"Overall not a bad place to work, just management on on thernoforming is a very rude individual other supervisors are very nice. The place is also climate controlled so great working conditions"
good,"Nice work environment. Pleasant work place. Good to place. Have Lots of Activities. Fun filling. Gain more knowledge. Acheived a Lot. Loads of work ."
good,Fun and entertaining atmosphere. Steady work pace and employee friendly. Customer interaction with great humor to go along with salesman persuasion. Just needs to pay more money.
good,working with NIKE was a fun experience.The only reason I left was to better my education. I can say as long as you know what you are doing the job will be easy.
good,"Great job ! best brand in the world. You do what is asked of you everytime you come in and everything will definitle be fine. I enjoyed working there day by day and everyone should join the nike family,"
good,Loved working here. The biggest problem was their wasn't much room to move up in the company. I had to move on and find a better paying job. I didn't like management much there either.
good,"It is a good place to work for, even though the management needs to work a little bit in the engagement with the consumers."
good,It is mostly a fun and challenging place to work.  Lots of opportunities for those willing to make time and effort to learn and connect across the matrix environment.
good,My co workers are great at times. But we also have some that are lazy and get by easy and this increases our workload. Some of the manangement is very unfair and this also drops on us. If they don't hold our co workers accountable then the workers who work hard will continue to over work themselves.
good,"Ambiente propício ao avanço profissional , conhecimento e crescimento."
good,"Clock in complete assigned tasks in your department, I learned about Nike's policies standards certain aspects such as money handling how to deal with irate customers, the workplace culture makes the job a joy to be at, there is no hardest part of the job, the most enjoyable part is getting to know and meet new people"
good,"I would normally start my day off by walking the department checking inventory levels. Next go through and check to make sure everyone was on their lunch or break schedule as not to interrupt to set the rest of the teams schedule. I would then delegate what area's would need to be filled and or reassessed due to sale through. The culture was fun and upbeat we would try to come up with themes for each month to get the athlete's to fellowship with one and other. There are many teenagers employed there so we do have our share of typical teenage tiffs. The hardest part of the job was keeping up with the paper work and office time they wanted you to spend, when I feel in retail your sales are made on the sales floor not from an office. I enjoy getting to wear workout attire."
good,"Nike is a good place to work if you're active in your everyday lifestyle for the discount on clothes, you can advance easily if you just do your job and not stand around talking, not good money, but willing to provide hours if you just keep on them."
good,This is a great place for young college students to work in. Their pay is ok. The best part about the job is that your co workers become your family. The only thing is that management is micromanaging and the parking is terrible.
good,"work hours :9 hours"
good,"Hay beneficios que te sirven como trabajador pero aún así son pocos ,empresa que te exige un alto nivel como vendedor y trabajador."
good,Good compensation friendly people great for summer jobs for all ages. company with flexible shifts that can fit almost any schedule for people with multiple jobs.
good,"Nike was a great place to work, but lacks more well trained diverse Management and Leadership.  That can identify key players in the organization mentor them, and manage people to grow and develop."
good,"A typical day would be:"
good,"A typical work day at nike was pretty easy, it was repetitive and after a while you get used to it. I earned how to process clothing and other various merchandise. I stocked and restocked shelves on a daily basis. Management was always on there A game making sure the workers are getting their work done. Inside the work place it was almost like we were all working for a team so we relied on each other to get our work done. There wasn't anything too hard about the job. The most enjoyable part of the job was that we were allowed to converse with employees because we were in a warehouse and it made work much easier."
good,"I've been working for Nike for a long time now and its a great fun place to work at especially those in high school and college. Management sucks now, and its very hard to advance here"
good,Nike a production based environment. The management staff has high expectation and down to earth. The hardest part of the job is walking all day.
good,"Nike is very simply."
good,Nike is a great job for younger people. It's a very energetic place and need energetic people to perform the job duties. It was a nice experience working up front on the cashier but I prefer the back of the house
good,Young close knit culture. Fun place to work! I have worked there for a little over 2 years and love the work I do there. The weekend requirements are a tough one for a family though.
good,"Keeping up with the new innovations and technologies within the Fashion and Sporting industry is always an interesting challenge."
good,"Loved my coworkers and most managers. Easy tasks, people were always helping each other when help was needed. The discount was great but moving up in the company takes quite some time but if you are willing to wait there is a plethora of opportunities."
good,"enjoyed my time working for Nike sf got a lot of experience workig with people from different backgrounds. I am also very passionate about soccer a sport which i have been playing from a tender age, working at Nike sf gave me an avenue to work and be close to the sport which i love dearly."
good,"Huge company that where you have many resources to advance your career. Making an ""impact"" is challenging due to sheer size."
good,"Advancement in the company is tough, but there are opportunities. Great co-workers, fun job at times. High turnover due to low pay and scheduling."
good,It has changed a lot in the past three years that I have been there. Part time workers have to be available for at least 24 hours a week. Training isn't set up the way it is supposed to be.
good,"My review about my job honestly, its a great and amazing experience. I love working with my co workers and getting things done. I learned how to be more patient and more understanding when it comes to others as well. The hardest part of the job was being able to maintain patience but overall helped me a lot, not just in the work place but out of work as well. The most enjoyable part of the job is being able to interact with the customers."
good,"Overall this is a great company to work for, but I was not happy in this specific store due to a number of reasons. The salary is good for the type of work, and benefits such as discounts and monthly bonuses."
good,"Very busy place of employment. Meet new people every day, there's a new problem or way to troubleshoot a problem every day. New machines to learn how to run."
good,"A empresa é ótima, apesar de ser uma franquia do grupo sbf, a própria nike nos oferecia produtos e participação em treinamentos e lançamentos, creio eu que quem gosta da nike, vai adorar trabalhar nessa empresa, pois você aprende muito, e ter uma experiencia em algo, é sempre bom."
good,Es un lugar de prospero conocimiento en el desarropo de la ropa del deportista
good,"excellent company culture. Work friendly environment."
good,"During a typical day at work I had to interact with many new customers. This was an amazing experience because every day it was someone new with new preferences and I had to adapt to the new persons likes and dislikes and work with them to make sure they were satisfied with our care. My co-workers were all extremely kind and all had similar likes. The hardest part of the job was dealing with an unkind furious customer, but the best thing to do during that time was to stay calm. Staying calm is extremely important and I learned this after my second day at work when an angry customer had came to return his worn shoes. The most enjoyable part of this job was the daily interaction I had with new people since I love talking and meeting new faces."
good,"I lean "
good,The job at Nike was a great environment to be in because of the people you worked with. The only issue was the amount of hours given per week & the pay.
good,"It was a great first job to get introduced to retail and becoming a sales associate. I loved the environment and the people I worked with. I learned a lot with restocking the back-house and everyday communication skills. The only downfall that I seen of working at Nike, was the management. It was a seasonal job, but the managers seemed so uninterested and sent us out on our own. They were very unorganized with schedules."
good,i've made friendships for a lifetime since i started working there. Not somewhere I see myself working long-term. Still a nice place to work.
good,"Don't know a head coach or someone up the ladder, don't expect to move up.  Learn to kiss some butts too.  The discount was great, the perks were too.  I loved the team and the atmosphere.  even with the flaws, just like most retail places, I loved this job."
good,"While my time was brief, I can definitively state that Nike is a brand that cannot be broken. Forever thankful of Nike for my employment."
good,"Awesome Co-workers"
good,All about numbers and productivity based off performance. Very demanding at times of the year depending on the season. The work environment is very stressful due to consistent days of working.
good,"Amazing co workers. Upbeat, fast - paced, busy work place. It was my favourite past time job. Everyone is literally a team."
good,Hard work with high expectations from corporate but fun work environment. Managers tended to pick favorites and show them special attention.
good,Great store and numerous people to work with. Management tends to oversee a lot of daily activities which sometimes hurt sales and never plan ahead. They usually worry about what needs to get fix now rather than trying to prevent it in the future. Hardest part of my job has been attendence as the job itself is fairly easy. The enjoyable part are the benefits received and the flexibility they provide with your work schedule.
good,"Working at Nike has been an awesome experience. Nike is a place where one day you can work in one area and the next a completely different area requiring a whole new set of skills. However this is something you must aim for yourself, as in my experience management is not going to help. Even though management might not be the best, coworkers are awesome and very easy going."
good,Since holding a position with the back of house staff we made sure that the store was well stocked and supplied. At the same time a very close bond was established amongst the department. A great way to help a work day go by!
good,"a typical day at Nike involved being able to take initiative to approach customers and be able to communicate effectively and provide quality sales support to customers."
good,"I enjoyed the seasonal work at Nike, I only wish there were more open positions to keep more of us on board at the time of release. I enjoyed working with Nike employees, including their family and friends. I loved helping with product knowledge from shoes to athletic wear to fit each customer / athletes needs. I took away from this a better understanding on how shoes provide comfort and support depending on the need, and how the apparel can aid the training process. The hardest part of the job was not being able to spend a lot of time with each customer as the demand was high for help. I definitely would go back and work other seasons if asked."
good,Nike is a great company to work for but in retail it is hard to move up.  The retail environment is great and Nike usually always hits their bonuses.
good,"Helaas, dit bedrijf bestaat niet meer."
good,"Going in I had no prior knowledge of how to sell to a consumer other than working at McDonald's. I learned interaction with staff and consumers, how to interact with consumers on such a level that they want more of your product. The people you work with are loving and caring, they try to get a personal rather than just a  co-worker relationship with you. Very fun, and influential work environment. The best part of the closing, yes you are working and cleaning, but a lot of great relationships are built within those moments. Also engaging with the consumer was very important and fun, it created the unforgettable moments everyday."
good,completed orders and assured quailty. maintained a high production number
good,Managed teens stall of 60 employees and 6 managers had multiple locations at the end of this tenure.  learned to hire more pt time people and have more coverage and create several full time positions and create competition for those positions.  Hardest part of this job was being open all but 2 days of the year. Most enjoyable part of the job was the people worked with.
good,"followed and employee around for a typical day, went to a conference call over saw magazine layouts for an up coming ad."
good,"Es buen trabajo pero había ciertas preferencias en algunos empleados siendo de cierta manera injustos con otros, había muchas chismes y criticas entre los trabajadores pero en si el trabajo era bueno para trabajar agusto."
good,"interesting place to work,never a dull moment."
good,"Will be working on the tickets assigned to me"
good,Retail is a grind but stick with it and good things can happen.
good,"great company to work for and move up, managers are ok at times be can be frustrating to work with. Learning about all the products will come in due time but is fun also. Co workers are good people and usually is no drama."
good,"inpakken van kleren in doos"
good,I remember it was one of the jordan releases and the night before we had gotten a large shipment of of the jordan as well as the other sneakers. we had to spend almost all night fixing and maintaining everything neat for the next morning.
good,"Empresa com bom ambiente de trabalho, onde aprendí mais sobre excel, sistema SAP e sistema de livro fiscal."
good,"Typical day would be signing in kids talking with parents"
good,"A day at Nike store starts in the morning hours when the store opens and customers begin to come into the store, basically first thing I do as the sales supervisor is recheck previous sales and make notes. i also attend to customers in need of attention like helping them get the items they need."
good,"Os lideres, ao proporcionar um ambiente tranquilo, agradável, e de uma disposição razoável para o aprendizagem, faz do colaborador em sua disposição o discernimento para a formação de uma futura promoção."
good,Very Fun job I learned a lot about shoes and how to run shipping office Co-workers was cool haredst part about this job was leaving to come home
good,"Empresa bem organizada, e estruturada, boa se trabalhar. Onde eu tive a oportunidade de entrar no ramo metalúrgico e aprender a profissão."
good,Works fun alot of great people ready to help real laid back environment and thats why i think nike so successful because of its low key profile. learn something new everyday mamangement shows alot of support and in reward of all the hard work they bless us with a mean every now and then
good,some of my coworkers are cool to work with . i go to work to get the job done and go home. there isnt a hard part of the job overall it is pretty easy.
good,"I truly enjoyed working here, its a great seasonal job and management is very flexible."
good,"Great work environment, learned a lot about fast paced retail. Everything about the job was enjoyable."
good,"What can you say, Nike is a cool brand and working there has it's advantages. Casual sports oriented culture, product discounts and challenging work."
good,It was a fun job for the most part. Just have to deal with the drama of retail and all of the gossip.
good,"run daily inventory reports, keyed computer data inquiry, correct errors in DC sales using SAP,DCMC. Learn to work best as a team, all reports I work goes to management daily. Great co-workers! I enjoyed the job learn something new everyday!"
good,Really enjoyed this job. Gave me the insight of what to look for in my own child and other children that needed additional help. Always had to be alert. The hardest part was having to use TACT to restrain a child. The enjoyable part was going out with the co-workers after a long/hard day.
good,Great opportunity to work in the sports industry and live on the road for a year promoting one of the largest brands in the country.
good,Some Management didn’t really seem to care about staff wasn’t encouraging overlooked good workers standing on your feet for long time periods breaks would get skipped over sometimes
good,"Constantly working, no life balance and people are looking elsewhere for job satisfaction because constant re-orgs make it hard for them to know what their job will be after the re-org"
good,Great Place to work but hours are short depending on the time. If you are not full time you have to fight or ask for ours even if your availability is full time.
good,Senior technical leadership seems disconnected with the actual state of the systems and teams. A major void in technical vision and direction has resulted in chaotic implementations without oversight or enforcement of best practices.
good,Good Company And Benefits. Some days are better than others. Employees are motivating around you. Hardest part of the job letting a customer down.....
good,Its good to work there. Nice environment and the other wokers are respectful. We had a fair  break time. And the work wasnt hard at all. The people were good to work with and around.
good,I liked working at Nike because everyone is very hard working and it is always go go go. There is always something to be doing so you are always doing different tasks and challenging yourself.
good,"Same as summary. I liked going to work at Nike. For a factory/warehouse it wasn't bad even though there were some people that would talk down about other people all the time. I should mention that there are some real weirdos that work there. Harmless really, just out there."
good,It's a good place to work and keep yourself fit and sportive anytime. Good knowledge you can earn in this company. You can learn lot about footwear especially running footwear training and other sports category footwears. Each and every footwear has it's different technology for the different type of users. If you go into the detail of the brand Nike it's really amazing.
good,"Worked at Nike at the beginning of through the holiday season. Staff were nice, coworkers were great. Great discount in-store and online. Hours were got lowered after holiday rush but, was a good retail job experience."
good,My time with Nike was fun at times. We had strong associates that never got appreciated for the hard work they have done. There was no growth at this store in particular. Other than no growth my time there was fun and the our team was strong and dependable.
good,It was fun to work at Nike but contractors are not given any notice if they are let go. So should keep in mind be cautious about what you're doing and speaking out is the most important in Nike
good,"Pretty good workplace. Managers are very competent and not overbearing. You are treated as a responsible adult. Schedule can be irregular. Weekends are required. If you like Nike products, employee discount is very generous. Managers are also very cooperative for college hours. Don't recommend having an open schedule. Can get very busy during summer."
good,"Overall Nike isn’t a bad company to work for, but there is some structural disconnect when it comes to communication and team morale.  There seems to be seasoned employees whom are stuck in there ways and the new employees feed on the negative energy...team lacking new innovation and motivation."
good,"no review really it was all ways work as usually. pick orders. nothing special about anything really but it was a job.  "
good,Il lavoro era ben retribuito e il leader del negozio valido e preparato. Il problema era il lavoro su turni poco flessibili e soprattutto sul mancato rispetto di un week end di riposo al mese come da contratto.
good,"During my time at Nike, it was fun and everyday there was a new learning experience. Unfortunately, the pay did not match my several job requirements/daily duties."
good,"Work day is fun, can get really slow during the weekdays. Not much to learn outside of your everyday duty of helping consumers and everyday tasks. Overall great place to work."
good,"Great first job for someone looking for some part-time work. Starting seasonal allows you the full retail experience, what it's like to work during peak times. Managers strict but know how to have fun. Pay is good, great discounts. Good environment. Unreliable hours."
good,"The people you worked with made the day go by faster, management was a disappointment. They really didn't show much effort on helping you with your problems until you talked to HR but once they found that out they'll start treating you different. Also it was a lot of politics going on at the job so that didn't make anything better. If management was better I believe the full work experience would have been better."
good,"Empresa que tem grande reconhecimento mundial,busca sempre estar atualizada"
good,"A typical day of work is either very busy or quite slow, you will always have something to do though. I've learned how to work fast pace and be productive. The management within this Nike could be better but keep in mind its a big coorporation, they dont care about you, they care about the numbers. The culture is very diverse working here, many travelers from different countries come here to shop. The hardest part is a very inconsistent schedule, you dont have a set schedule. The most enjoyable part of the job is that you can always grow if you really wanted to and they play good music. If you are a student and need a part time job they are really good with working with school."
good,Nike is a cool place to work. Laid back environment most of the managers are cool as long as you do your job. Great discounts for employees in store and online.
good,One if my favorite jobs I've worked for just not so good on the pay for a company that makes billions but everything else is a 5star rating . Anybody can work at that job and be happy .
good,"Discount is generous. 30% off in store and 40% off online. Other than that, work is boring and they tell you when you can take your breaks. You are most likely going to be standing and walking around the store the whole day so it can get pretty tiring. Work is easy and being a part of the team was very fun. Made lots of life long friends working there."
good,"I learned so much about customer service in a sales industry. I had the opportunity to advance my knowledge in shoes and apparel, which was my most enjoyable part of the job."
good,"Good company to work for. Opportunity abounds, but it often depends on the manager for whom you work. Plenty of movement, however, so you can find new opportunities fairly easily."
good,"The typical day at Nike - Johnson Creek was a high energy demanding sales and retail position that required a large dose of customer interaction as well as interaction with ""teammates"" or fellow associates as well. The staff demographic is primarily college-aged students seeing as the Johnson Creek falls just outside of Whitewater, WI. It is a great college job for those with people skills and are looking for a 30% discount on Nike gear."
good,"Es bueno en el aspecto de que aprendes mucho, la cultura de sus propios valores es muy alta y te permean con información de nuevas inclusiones y tecnologías."
good,It was an awesome place to work steady work patterns. Great paid time off. Lots of room for advancement depending on self growth. Schedules are set never change.
good,"It was cool working there, clean work environment. Coffee in break rooms, everyone was nice and respectful. Didn't have many problems or complaints. The work was also easy. Cafeteria always had good reasonable priced food."
good,Worked with some amazing people. Had fun while i was in my young 20's. Found out that I hated running by using the run club. I did enjoy the clothe alot tho
good,"They did help with people in school, but management was disrespectful. The schedule runs from sunday - saturday, and sometimes you wouldn't know if you work sunday until two days before your shift."
good,"Although management was sometimes lacking, the overall workplace culture was always very laid back and fun. Going to work was always a good time and it was easy to get along with most coworkers. I felt that there was not a lot of room for growth within the company on a retail level. Nike itself was a great company to work for because they really care about the quality of their products and services."
good,"En esta empresa reforcé lo que era el cumplimiento de meta, trabajo en equipo y desarrollé mi liderazgo personal."
good,首先基本parttime sales 工作，平時負責promote 產品，讓客人唔只買一件，最少起碼兩件產品先離開舖頭。但係有d鋪冇乜客人，你就要做摺衫同整理貨場。而我離職原因並唔係因為我做得唔好，而系舖頭營業額不足，要cut人。我比人cut原因系因為我最遲入職所以一系選擇調鋪或者辭職。最後當然選擇後者。
good,"Nike Miami is a great people, especially if you indeed love the brand and their products. The working environment and/or atmosphere is good, but could be better."
good,Team is great and nice events but sometimes they made it too competitive. Some managers were better than others and had more experience. Nike truly takes care of employee
good,"The workplace culture was great, everyone was friendly to each other and we available when another coworker needed help. It allowed me to work comfortable, but also push me a to be a better salesman."
good,The environment was great to be in and my coworkers always made it fun to come into work. We were a well organized store then some management changes occurred and they were a little bit less accountable for specific items or details. For the most part it was a fast paced environment and enjoyed it being like that. It's always good to stay busy.
good,No comment. I have no information to provide regarding this employer. I had a good experience it retail is not cut out for everyone. I ultimately wanted to leave because of the work schedule
good,"Hours are inconsistent, get burned out quick if you're flexible. Other than that if you love Nike then you'll love it. Great discounts, discount on employee stock program, paid time off even if you're part-time"
good,"Nike the brand is great , the store is fun, exciting and loads of learning. However the head coach is unstable most days, but the DM and Head Coach are best friends, they have worked together previously,so there is no chance it will change . She is well protected there , if the DM moved she would not make it with another DM. The  way she functions in the store is not always professional. The people are great,I love of the brand, it is one in a million . It just needs to be handled better on a day to day basis . On visit days she(head coach) is great(motivated) etc..., other than that she is a basket case, and it really effects all involved. Switch DM for this location and you will see."
good,The managers are great to get a long with but I just can't help to question some of the people they seem to hire around the end of quarter. They just tend to over hire and reduce the overall weekly hour.
good,some days at Nike were amazing others made you question why certain people still had jobs there. it can be a draining environment and rewarding at the same time. but all in all its a good first job.
good,El contacto con el cliente favorece la jornada laboral
good,"I worked there for 3.5 years as an ""E Band"" (one down from the bottom).  The company is not living up to their mission.  Management is a hot mess and disconnected from reality.  Senior leadership has no clue what is going on.  That said, the ""culture"" of the employees and the brand is magical.  I never thought I would want to leave, but it got way too toxic.  Disappointing.  Get it together, Nike."
good,"Nike overall was a really good place to work at with a fun work atmosphere, however, the majority of my coworkers and I felt as if people really didn't know what was going on from a day to day basis. A lot of the time we were finding busy work for us to do instead of having a set plan of how the day was going to go."
good,Help customers know differences between products and help them choose the right one for their needs. Fast paced environment and a lot of multi tasking.
good,"Nike, was a wonderful place to work. The only thing I disliked was the inconsistent hours, I had three schedule changes. Your schedule can change without notice, which is hard if you have a busy life outside of work. The job can be a bit challenging during peak season, which is not a problem because it keeps you busy. I would recommend this job to a friend."
good,"diversity and culture sensitivity.learned to apply discounts,stock shelves correct, design an showcase window increased my communication skills. offers career opportunities"
good,"What you'll find at Nike is that the customer interaction is tenfold from what you might find in a normal retail store, and the same can be said about the staff. It's an average job, with good managers."
good,"It was nothing out of the ordinary for a retail job. I enjoyed working there until they changed how to divvied up hours. I was surprised that corporate gave the okay to make PART TIME employees devote 32 available hours during the week and 24 available hours during the weekend. With myself in school, I knew they were going to let me go because of this new change, so I quit before they fired me for not being able to give them those hours."
good,"Fast-paced, enjoyable students who were receiving part-time coaching/tutoring in ESL.  Classes were fun, small, with time for individualized attention. I sub-contracted to Nike."
good,"Aprendi muito neste trabalho, cresci muito. Mas também precisava de mais estabilidade financeira."
good,"The work is fast paced and stressful, but my coworkers and managers are amazing, and honestly they're the reason I go into work everyday. Whenever the consumers, or the workload, or the holiday madness hits me, I can always turn to them and trust them to have my back."
good,"Great company to work for, however there are too many backstabbers that bring down the dynamic. Be careful of what you say around people you trust, they may hurt you in the end. I was outsourced by a contracting company even after they said I wouldn't be. I took my package and left."
good,I loved working at Nike but my management was very inconsistent which lead to me ultimately resigning from the company. I would love to work for them again if the management changed.
good,"Great company to work for, especially if you like sports. Fun atmosphere and beautiful campus. Good opportunities to travel overseas and to gain international experience."
good,Nike is one of the best sports brand ever. Always being sports say and checking out the new styles of product is always a great head start. A typical day for me is working in shipping and receiving. I bring in the new products or i send out or transfer product.
good,"L'environnement est agréable"
good,"Working at Nike SF in downtown San Francisco is very fast paced compared to a lot of other retail shops. You learn how to handle multiple situations at a time and also learn how to be really patient when it comes to offering excellent customer service. Management was somewhat unorganized. Some of the so called managers should be re evaluated to make sure they can handle such position. The workplace culture is very hip. You meet a lot of incredible people from all different parts of the country/world. The hardest part of the job is being able to offer services and products to different people at the same time. Definitely need to be able to multitask, have good listening skills and be very patient. The most enjoyable part of the job is working with amazing people, and offering products and services that only Nike can provide. They strive to be the best out there."
good,Mes collègues m'ont beaucoup aidés à m'intégrer dans l'entreprise. M'ont soutenu dans des situations de crise. J'ai pu développer mes connaissances dans le domaine de gestionnaire de commerce de détail.
good,Overall work experience was fine. The environment is very fast paced for the most part. Managers were flexible with hours at times. I expanded my customer service customers while working here.
good,"They do not give yearly raises when minimum wage goes up. You get paid barely anything and you are expected to go way out of your way to do hard things. Nike culture is by far the best out of any company I have ever worked for, but the pay really is a downfall. For a company that makes so much money, you'd think they'd pay the employees more."
good,"Durante meu período de trabalho na companhia Nike, pude me desenvolver e  aprender muito sobre trabalho em equipe e metas em busco do melhor de uma empresa. O ambiente sempre nos proporcionou aprendizados relacionados as relações interpessoais e os desafios aconteciam de forma singular."
good,I liked the job and the people just wasn't enough income for me and my children plus my bills and car note overall its a very good job and the people are so helpful
good,Fast paced store. Lots of room for learning. Great employees. Management is a little hectic. Great place to work if you enjoy having lots to do. Great environment.
good,It was a fun place to work. A lot of customer enagement. Management was fair. The money wasn’t good at all. It’s an okay part time job can’t be your only job.
good,"Customer Service. Lead Athlete, Peer Mentor, process orders; pulling materials, packing boxes, maintain safe and clean work environment by keeping shelves, pallet area and workstations clean and complying with procedures, rules and regulations."
good,it was great place to work and build a foundation. but beyond that the benefits and perks were ok. the discounts and potential for growth is a bit scarce. but its a start
good,"Each day presents challenges, finding the right product for customers. The managers are respectful and the coworkers are outgoing and fun. The most enjoyable part of the job is the work culture."
good,Must be able to work diligently and provide great customer service and it is essential to know Spanish when working here. Staff are very professional.
good,"When I first started at Nike, I absolutely loved it. When certain management left, and new management came in, things started to shift in a negative way."
good,"The environment was face paced and competitive."
good,It was a great opportunity to be part of the team. The atmosphere was also great. Coworkers were helpful and patient when one needed help. Management handle situation in a professional manner.
good,"As a Part-Time Under Athlete at Nike I mostly worked product flow operations. I mainly dealt with product inventory. Work environment is fast-paced, but still very enjoyable. The environment was very fun most times. Management team included very phenomenal people."
good,"Great company to work at, high volume and if willing can advance and learn a lot about the business. Can be very stressful on busy days with a lot of people in the store at one time."
good,"The staff were all amazing, but being such a large group (no less than 100 people on payroll in the store at once) it could feel like you had to fight for hours. Great place for students though if you're only looking for 10-15 hrs/week "
good,"Since Nike is dealing primarily with athletes the employees and customers we get are usually very high energy. Working at Nike is almost like going to the gym. There are social times, but one is mainly there to work harder and push themselves further."
good,Flexible and nice working environment but the pay tends to be on the low end. Summer Friday’s a definite plus. Getting a decent pay raise is difficult so be sure to negotiate before getting hired.
good,very productive place to work. Daily goals to be met in a timely manner. Can be stressful when your pushed with an last minute task. Overall great place to work.
good,it was a pretty decent job and  I really don't have much to say about them. I really enjoyed most days there on the clock. The management were kind of rude.
good,The managers are very patient and helpful which helps you grow as a employee. Also the employees that work there are very diverse which makes the workplace interesting. The only discontent I have would be the lack of hours.
good,"en nike aprendí muchísimo sobre formación de caracterer, ventas y atención a clientes, en estos 3 años he sido el líder del almacén me encargo de la logística y auditar el producto."
good,"Nike itself is a great company to work for, great discount and perks, the World Headquarters is amazing and working with different athletes is fun and exciting. However, the Head Coach at the Marysville-Tulalip Outlet is a nightmare. She has no idea how to motivate a team or run a store."
good,"Très bonne expérience client, le travail en équipe est très agréable."
good,"Teamwork valued, management was lacking.  Tight deadlines, but achievable for the most part.  Summer Fridays are a definite plus for those departments that are able to take them,"
good,It was a seasonal position job I immediately took because I had just moved to Georgia. Great for a second job but I was only scheduled for holiday season par time.
good,"Very Fun and Interesting job, great intro to the company and retail. Nike is an innovative company and you learn about the tech behind the products. Great first retail job."
good,"Associate must be able to continuously lift up to 75 pounds daily tasks would include loading and unloading trailers, scanning and imputing data with various computer programs"
good,"Although the job didn't pay all that well, benefits were above standard, work was consistent and non-stressful. Compressed work weeks, with paid time off, cant complain there."
good,"Don't get mixed into the hype. Keep it fresh and be willing to learn at a fast pace. Also, don't take things to heart and keep everything super professional."
good,Its fun working at Nike. Great environment! love the staff. They really work with you so you can achieve daily goals and you can outgrow as a person and retail associate's
good,I really like working at nike cause it was a very easy job for me only on the weekends i worked around alot of people and learned different things while i was with the company.
good,"Overall this is a good place to work with great pay and benefits (their updated maternity/paternity leave program is fantastic)."
good,"Nike is THE industry leader. For the most part that's a great thing but they have gotten sluggish over the years which has provided opportunities for their competitors. And by the way, I was a Pacer for Nike+ Run Club; it was one of my duties as an assistant manager."
good,Helping customers in certain areas of the store. Daily tasks change every working day. A bigger store with merchandise sections dedicated to a certain sport or activity.
good,Nike is a great company to work for and instills a great deal of determination and drive into its employees. The people are great to work with and there are plenty of opportunities to experience roles outside your daily job.
good,better know how to make friends with the area supervisors otherwise they will make working there suck by placing you in areas you've either never worked and got training for or the spot you hate the most.
good,"Nike requires a lot of store maintenance throughout the day, along with vast communication/customer service with both employees and customers. There's long periods were you'll be on your feet as well as walking around the store. The company provides you with long enough breaks to get you through the day. Dependent on your position will determine how active you are at the workplace. However the company is a fun environment with a good management team that is easily approachable."
good,"A typical day included checking and responding to emails. A majority of the job consisted in answering calls and assist customers. These calls ranged between taking orders,claims,product information or handling transfers."
good,"Greet customers"
good,It was a hard working job that was easy to do they work with u alot just don't be late and the pay is good and everyone is nice and always talking and smiling
good,"An average day on the sales floor is much like any other retail job, customer interaction, general cleaning & stocking. Many opportunities in company via passionate work and openness to relocation."
good,"Dress code: anything nike. "
good,"Working at Nike was fun in the beginning, But due to the overwhelming amount of people at any giving time, it takes a lot of time to get used to balancing out the different task."
good,Great place to work at. Met a ton of people who are now very good friends. Job culture is amazing. Management can be very plastic at times. Direction on their end can be sometimes be nonexistent.
good,"A typical workday just meant helping customers find what their exact fit was. The atmosphere was eneretic while I worked there, there was a variety of people, mostly young people working there while I was employed there."
good,It was a good team culture at the store at Northpark Dallas. The management was always trying to help us out but recently management has changed to where it is less sales associate focused. Benefits are worth it though.
good,"La giornata di lavoro piena e stimolante. Ho imparato a organizzare e delegare il lavoro all'ineterno di un team. So gestire l'apertura e chiusura del negozio, cassa e servizio al cliente."
good,Nike was a summer and winter job that i had while i was on break from college. The environment was extremely fun with many young individuals working there on a daily basis.
good,"Working at Nike was a cool first job, everyday I help people pick out what they wanted or need. I learned how the history of Nike and sneakers. Also, working there improved my people skills. Some of the mangers I love while others I didn't care too much of. Everyone was so unique in their own was and pleasant. The hardest part was standing all day on slow days and the best part was socializing on slow days."
good,"Work as a team and help each other , learning a lot about shoes and clothes technologies , as a manager learned a lot how to run a store , happy environment to be at . Most enjoyable part of this job is that you get Nike Stuff."
good,"I learned a lot about Nike's history and the evolution of their products. I had a lot of hands on experience and was cross trained in all departments, but mostly worked in the footwear department. I also was in charge of processing and pricing of all footwear as I rotated new product onto the floor on a daily basis. I helped other team members locate footwear that they needed for a customer. I also organized and stocked backroom and updated all footwear prices during clearance sales. I was in charge of training new team members on how to prevent theft and help customers while keeping your assigned area stocked and organized. The best part of the job was helping customers/team members find what they need."
good,"My time spent at Nike I can and will say was a success sort of for the time I spent there. I was only there for a little over a year looking forward to making a career out of something I found I love with a brand people as a whole love like myself. Working there had its pros and cons like any job but Nike doesn't feel exactly like your typical retail job. You actually get involved in your work slow day or not it's always something to do especially as team. As far as the pay it was decent for a minute but just in my honest opinion I felt could be a tad bit more due to the volume of traffic and everyday visitors, site seers, community based events, constantly learning and absorbing new information on a daily basis and putting on your best to make consumers feel welcomed I think with all of that the athletes just might deserve a little more. But other than that I loved it, I sought it to be long term for me unfortunately it didn't due to a mistake. The culture is Great, they accept you for who you are when you walk through their doors, they encourage team work, diverse culture, individuality, spirit, health among many other things, I just feel like makes them a leader in what they do."
good,"A typical day at work consists of several employees taking advantage of their relaxed schedule. Change is necessary but very few welcome it. I believe if everyone is more willing to help and sacrifice, the work place would be much more efficient."
good,"I worked at an Outlet store as a part-time employee while I was still in school. It was a great job because I would get the hours I needed and the pay was decent enough to get by. While this was a good part-time job, I could not see myself personally using this as a full-time job to support myself."
good,I love working at Nike because everyone is part of a big team and always willing to help out. Everyone gets along and are always helping teach someone something new.
good,I enjoyed working at Nike. The managers and crew members were very nice and respectful. Whenever you asked for hp they never hesitated and always offered to help.
good,This job started as a seasonal position and eventually became a career to management 4 years into it. It was an excellent experience and the management was good.
good,Nike under pays their employees a lot.... they seem to talent give raises & when they do it's a very small amount.... Nike doesn't promote u from working. U have to apply on your on time for promotions.
good,"Main duties are to process daily shipment, as well as restock the floor, and to maintain the daily back of house duties. Management is usually fair and hours can range from 8-19 for part-time under employees. 6 month raises, and quarterly staff dress changes."
good,"You must be okay with ambiguity.  You must be prepared for a sink or swim mentality.  You must be okay with former high school, collegiate and professional athletes trying to relive their glory days in the board room. You must be okay with doing multiple jobs and only getting paid for one.  You must be okay with uprooting your family and your life to move about the country every 1-2 years."
good,En un día típico hay que estar preparado para cualquier cambio en las reglas de juego.
good,"have been with for 11 years and I am truly excited each day because I have an opportunity to think about my current role, my opportunity to grow and most important my value to the community and believe it or not earth."
good,"For a young aspiring businessman Nike was the perfect development ground. Brand new ideas, brand new markets, out of this universe product, allowed me to learn, grow and develop a foundation for life. I still refer to lessons learnt at Nike all those years ago."
good,"Nike Vision is a fast paced, dynamic work environment. Strong brand heritage and  focused brand retail objectives. Strong subsidiary relationships with the main brand and international principals."
good,Its a cool fun environment to work in if you love clothes and shoes the pay is good and hours are good if there is work but sometimes you may not get your full 40 hours if there is less work and the mangers there do show favoritism its best to just stay to yourself and just make money or else you are bound to go downhill its just like high school all over again.
good,"Nike is a great company to work for, if you're into sports culture and even if you're not. I love the environment there, it makes connecting and enjoying working the everyone easy. I love how they engrain the Nike culture into you as an athlete and that the motto is ""If you have a body, you're an athlete."" Making sure to make everyone included and just the culture; that we eat, sleep, and bleed orange. By the time you leave (if your work there for a substantial time) you'll leave devoted to the brand. "
good,"Lots going on every day - You'll need to manage your time wisely.  The culture has changed dynamically - especially when the company sold it's soul to Wall St. ($50 Bn by 2020)  It's all very corporate now & nothing is more important than the bottom line.  So make sure you are hitting your financial goals."
good,Great place to work depending on team and your leadership. Competitive and smart people. As with most corporate cultures riddled with politics and land grabbing. Great brand overall.
good,"Good management, and nice team cooperation. some employees are good in selling sometime overtime is not paid and some incentive are not gave on time.."
good,Working for a multinational company is highly interesting and very fast. This company only hires the best and I saw this in virtually everyone I met/worked with. My days were always busy and mostly full of face to face interaction. I was helping people non-stop and trying my best to make a difference in their work day and impact my teams in positive ways. The most challenging part of the job was having a never ending to-do list. The best part of the job was the people.
good,"Good place to work, high paced but fun. Good benefits but poor salary. Dealing with athletes is a plus! The workaholic mentality makes the job stressful."
good,Working at Nike was cool and a laid back job but you had to work at a fast pace so you want get bagged up and behind with the work schedule for the day.
good,"Worklife balance great people to work with, very fast pace, great experience, benefit package great, need more define training programs, I would recommend"
good,"I grew up strictly wearing Nike gear, the culture there is great, relaxed, and 2+2 does not equal 4. So you work around that ideal and if you have a vision you will make it very far."
good,to be part of the nike team was great at the beginning but just like any other place sometimes your voice gets lost in the politics of the company i enjoy most of my time there if i had the opportunity to go back i will know now how to change some of my own mistakes
good,"Nike has great product , but the service provided by the staff is decent , especially when you get to know them better once you have issues , and they are all unreliable , and they pass the problems to each other and no one solve your problem , they only want to get rid of u , customer service is sub par and disappointing ."
good,buen ambiente de trabajo pero el sueldo no es nada competitivo
good,"A typical day at work was eventful and some what stressful. I learned how to communicate, and work effectively with others and group assignments. The workplace culture was enjoyable and free of any obstacles. The hardest part of the job was getting the work done. The easiest part of the job was working with different people."
good,"Most days are enjoyable. The work is fair for the pay. The people are friendly and mostly everyone socializes and gets their job done at the same time. The hardest part of the job is meeting high production numbers, but everyone works as a team and the job always gets done."
good,"Perfilar en cierre es muy pero muy pesado, más cuando es temporada alta"
good,"Nike is an incredible place to work. If you are passionate about sports and/ore product, it's even better.  Campus is beautiful and continuing to grow. There are endless food options too."
good,loved working with other athletic co workers. It was a fun environment to work in along with something i was interested in. Their work place accepted many different types of employees.
good,"Great place to talk about sports. "
good,It's not all about the discount but it is a plus. They're very demanding to your life and schedule. They're not that flexible or considerate to your time. It's fast paced and you do meet some decent people. It's a lot of managers and not all of them are great. Some will talk to you as if you're a child even if you're older than them. You meet great workers and customers. The uniform is nice and comfy. It's really hard to move up in the business
good,"Uma grande escola de Marketing, onde podemos aprender todos os dias. O poder da marca e suas enovações. Tenho grande satisfação de fazer parte de deste time de vencedores."
good,Nike was a very fun place to work at and you really do feel a part of a team. They actually show you videos about the company and how it became to be what it is. You go to work dressed very comfortable. If you needed any help co workers were very helpful.
good,"The company as a whole is great. There is tons of brand passion and there is opportunities to advance within the company when it comes to the retail side. However, if you want to get into corporate it is all about who you know. There is some inconsistency with upper management and the district managers."
good,great work place but if you want to grow with this company dont get invovled in drama work hard can take advantage of what this company provides for you
good,"Great lifestyle and culture and benefits. "
good,"Kelly Services got me a position in the Team Sports division. Got along great with my manager, who brought me back for another 1 year contract. I got to work with a number of different departments performing a variety of administrative, order processing, and sales analysis tasks. After a couple of years management was ready to hire me. Then along came the hiring freeze. Sadly, over the years I have met many others who went through a similar experience. But, if you do become a permanent employee, the benefits are pretty great."
good,"Nike was a great place to work, they always have people at had to deal with any situation. work environment is very friendly and inviting both for customers and staff."
good,The only reason I don't work here anymore is because I hit the point in my life that I needed a grown up full-time job. Nike is an amazing place to work with a great atmosphere with management and co-workers.
good,The typical day at work involves customer service and straightening. The culture is great and filled with youthful energy. I learned how to customer service and many skills for use later. Nike gives many opportunities to experience new things and go different places.
good,"Empresa boa para trabalho, equipe excelente porem salario muito baixo e um pouco exploradora"
good,great people to work with hard workers will only see the advancement . great benefits and good consumers. Company  stands  and equal rights . Many programs to help you grow within the Company just have to take advantage
good,Worked for Nike while I was still attending college and it allowed for a good work life balance. Management was not out on the floor too often but was able to help if needed.
good,Busy retail environment and an opportunity to learn the basics that can propel you if you have the desire to do so.  If you are willing to work hard it gets noticed.  If you are effective at organizing and communicating well and positively with customers you will be happy here!
good,Nike is a very nice company to work for with excellent benefits. The salary is competitive with other companies. I work on 3 day work week with four days off. The workplace is nice especially with the new break rooms we have. The hardest part of the job is being up for twelve hours at night. What I enjoy the most is the perks we receive throughout the year.
good,"They make us to work for long hours and make us to work on weekends to get their job done for an inaccurate estimate they made."
good,Working with Nike has been a great overall experience. Nike was my first job and I have worked with the company for 4 years and I've learned and grew a lot with the company.
good,"NIKE is a great company to work for.  They have excellent benefits and perks, however the work life balance can get a bit too much in management levels."
good,"If you are planning to work for Nike, prepare to work. It is a competitive job that rewards success over all else. The level of training is the most difficult and repetitive of any retail job. You will go over what to do with a customer thousands of time. What's important is that it is professional. A $40 billion dollar company won't accept mediocracy."
good,"I honestly had a blast working here, I learned many skills and loved going into work. I wish there was more opportunity to move up in the company, the hardest part would probably be learning how to deal with costumers. Overall, its a fun experience and I have made many memories."
good,"very noisy, stand on foot all day, learned how to use a scan gun and move productive while packing and unpacking boxes, very busy place horrible supervisors"
good,"A day at work at Nike was actually pretty fun. Dealing with people all day long that are just out to have a good time is always fun. At Nike I learned how to manage my time, and I also learned that I lacked situational awareness, this allowed me to gain what I was lacking and better myself. Management was up and down, a lot of the managers were really amazing and wanted nothing more for you than for you to succeed and some managers weren't as enthused as others. The culture at Nike was amazing as well, a lot of young folk who got along very well. The hardest part of the job at Nike was the security portion of the job. In order to ensure safety of all customers we were trained to try an identify threats to the store and attempt to prevent negatives from happening. Most times we get it right but there have been occasions when it wasn't as such, and those were always the worst feeling. The most enjoyable part of the job was the fact that as an athlete who has always supported Nike I was able to work in an environment where I was already comfortable in from the beginning."
good,Day to day work is fine. Has a great vibe to the store. Unfortunately bad management that are disrespectful but besides that a great job. Wish it could have had more structure.
good,"Unless you're an assistant Head Coach or a Head Coach you aren't taken seriously. It's a shame but that's how it is. You can advance so long as the positions are available, otherwise you just bounce from position to position."
good,"Meeting new people and getting to know the person"
good,"My professional experience and educational background of having an MBA (Marketing) degree makes me a potential candidate for any open position in Sales/Marketing within your organization."
good,Nike is a very high spirited fast- paced work place which I thoroughly enjoyed. Your team members are great to work with and consistently have a positive can-do attitude. The work atmosphere is possibly one of the best things about working at Nike.
good,My day at job consist of working with consumers and interacting to make their shopping experience the best it can be. Working with my co-workers helping each other out.
good,"They gave great benefits and pay! Only thing I disagree with is the attitudes the managers had! Either they didn't care, or just avoided some employees problems"
good,"In house team is friendly and great to work with.  Corporate people tend to be less supportive.  They are interested in a very specific personality type."
good,"Loved helping consumes get what they came to the store to get. Very busy environment on holidays such as tax free weekend, Christmas holidays and all through summer. Set daily goals of sales daily to reach success and be a top competitive store in the United States of America. Outlet is in the top 5 in the world of being visited by tourist because of so many different options you have to choose from. I don't necessarily think there is a hard part of the job unless it's filling the shelves after the consumers have almost bought out the store. Sometimes it can be the customers that want to get angry because the store doesn't necessarily have what they are looking for or didn't recieve the proper help they needed to find the product they wanted. I enjoyed getting customer compliments because of my assistance and as much as I love helping others, it meant so much for me. My co workers were great whenever I didn't know about a certain product or had to check back of house to see if we had in certain size. They were very fast to reply and let know about a certain product and what it provides in order to explain it to the customers. The management were pretty good. Always made sure the consumers enjoyed shopping at the store and put them up to knowledge on upcoming sales and promotions. Also kept the store looking great every morning before opening up. Team meetings are very important to get to go over the day before it starts, to approach customers and make sure everything is going okay and to assist them if needed."
good,"I worked at Nike while pursuing higher education. The hours and availability are flexible (excluding weekends), and the benefits are very fair."
good,"It is always a mystery when you try to figure out how the day is going to go at work. It is such a fast pace environment to deal with even on days where you'd expect it to be slow. As much as your co workers make it interesting and fun for you, the amount of work that needs to get done while being on the job is extremely overwhelming at times."
good,"Buen ambiente laboral, home office 1 dia a la semana, horarios flexibles"
good,"We are taught teamwork is the key to success in this retail position. A typical day includes of course clocking in, meeting with your Team Captain(aka manger), finding which section you are scheduled and receiving a headset and mobile device to better service the consumers. Management is still learning but making improvements each day to make a better work environment."
good,"Great work environment with a large team focused on achieving one goal. Extremely fast paced and efficient. I learned how to communicate with people who speak different languages such as Spanish, Portuguese, and Mandarin. The hardest part of the job was learning how to help people who do not speak English. My favorite part of the job is the team/family environment."
good,you make enough money if you would work in this job but maybe a little tough for the people who doesn't like to work indoor.
good,"Assessing the filling for apparel floor daily, checking my daily incoming inventory, planning apparel moves within the department. Planning the monthly visual merchandising initiative campaign and taking conference calls based on the monthly visual initiative. Training part time athletes with the same merchandising skills that will make the apparel department better and better."
good,"Very fast paced, team involved, keen eye for defects on shoes. I learn how to work effectively in a team setting. Making productions goals was the most gratifying experience."
good,The Nike culture was harmonious with a huge emphasis on training and customer service.  Knowing all you can know about the product was imperative to a successful encounter with the customers and offer great customer service.
good,"Great till season is over,and they dont keep any seasonals. Other than that it was a cool place to work at and meet awesome people."
good,"Empresa en la que el trabajo en equipo se está abandonando un poco por parte de algún directivo promocionando el individualismo pero que se compensa con la gran calidad de sus empleados y del ambiente que generan."
good,Good place to work and is great for a first job and isllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllll
good,"Questo posto di lavoro i ha insegnato a lavorare in team, a relazionarmi con la clientela e a portare a termine gli obiettivi prefissati."
good,"Associated with one of the big branding in the world ,came to learn all about the working of  a retail store in uae including the various aspects of the work cashing , merchandising ,stock controlling customers support problem solving ,floor coverage .."
good,"A typical work day at Nike would involve pre-work meetings. These meetings would include teaching tools, coaching, and objective oriented goals. Managements job was to ensure that productivity was high and efficient."
good,"The management is very good, I work Hard Stay Focused And do the job correctly. The most enjoyable part of the is the people are very nice and keep everything on point."
good,"Always looked forward to going to work. "
good,"i learned many things inside the store, the management are good to me, my co-workers are also good to me, the hardest part is when i duty without exact rest because that i am student, but the most enjoyable is when my co-workers are going to star city."
good,"ouverture de magasin ,Preparation des reportings afin d'objectiver les equipes,receptions des marchandises,controle de la marchandise,mise en place des equipes ,organisation de la stock,management de l'espace de vente. fermeture magasin (cloture des caisses )"
good,"A typical day at work would be, greeting consumers and directing them to the departments needed. I make sure they were properly assisted in finding everything they need. I would say the hardest part is, trying to correct another associates impression on the consumer. finding a way to make their experience better at the end of their journey at niketown."
good,"Extended hours, feels most like a family. Changing priorities and mangement styles all the time."
good,The vison of company is for the future. And they were focused in improving knowlodge of employees to achieve their goals. The workplace were nice.
good,"Fun and technical job which requires very good commutation and analysis skills for presenting information to potential clients. Keeps you interacting and on your toes, enjoyable."
good,Great customer service experience and atmosphere. Ability to move up is limited to certain few. Employees are energetic and fun to be around.
good,Everyday at Nike was enjoyable. I got along good with my coworkers and i made sure i always got the job done. The hardest part of the day usually would be toward the end of the shift we get hit with alot of work after it had been slow earlier that day.
good,Very fast pace always busy. Customer are rude and don't speak English well. Learn a lot about product knowledge. It is a fun environment for teenagers looking for a first job. Hardest part is understanding customers who dont speak English
good,"recebimento de mercadorias,arrumção do estoque,possiveis vendas diretas aos clientes,colegas muito legais que semopre ajudavam ,direçao que sempre davam conselhos e ajudavam sempre."
good,This company is always striving to be better than the year before and to inspire its employees to innovate.
good,Create and manage training and development programs; as well as creating a great work place for co-workers
good,A typical day would consist of maintaing the store to premium standard. Merchandising product in departments as well as working closely with management and associates for training.
good,Typical retail position but you work every position. Very fast paced especially during holidays.
good,I really enjoyed working for Nike. The job was easier then I believe most warehouse jobs are. The management was very understanding and considerate to any concerns or issues. And I most enjoyed having the gymnasium at my leisure.
good,fun  environment work flow always on schedule. Flexible hours great management overtime offered.
good,"As a sales associate, you basically clock in and you're ready for your day. Best part of the job is interacting with customers from all over the world as it's a hot shopping spot for tourist. The store may get messy but if you communicate with your team, you will have no trouble getting things done. The hardest part of the job is being on your feet for hours, wear comfortable shoes (Make sure they're Nike though)."
good,"The benefits, rewards, recognition was excellent. Management policy was inconsistent and turnover was prevalent. Temp staff were not treated properly."
good,"Gets busy at times. I learned a lot about the technical aspects of product. Also, learned more in depth about inventory management, visual merchandising. I enjoyed the recurrent consumers and their positive feedback on the service from the store at whole. Some things that were difficult at times was trying to finish a task within a very short amount of time while working 2 departments at a time."
good,"everything you learn adds experience to your resume, but the only issue is not very good security, customers are able to walk out with shoes with no one knowing."
good,great sports and fitness company. Wonderful co-workers and great managers
good,"A typical work day at Nike is me helping consumers in every way  finding the perfect shoe, apparel or equipment to fit their personal needs. Some days i am working in footwear, men's apparel/fitting room, women's/kids apparel, cash register or even just standing in the front greeting consumers. Some days at work are slow dry and empty of consumers and other days its fast busy and crowded. I learn different things every day whether its from Nike facts, opinions, and ideas from my co-workers, management, and or even from the consumers. My coworkers are all unique in their own way some have alot of knowledge about Nike shoes, equipment and or apparel. My management are very helpful friendly and all around cool people to work with. The hardest part of my job i would say is trying to get more hours and the most enjoyable part is working with consumers and putting that smile on their face and having them come back or even remember you from the great service you gave them. Last is i enjoy working with my coworkers and managers."
good,"En Nike aprendí mucho sobre los distintos productos que se vendían (sus tejidos, sus funciones...) y me ayudó a mejorar a la hora de atender a los clientes, aconsejandolos en sus dudas."
good,Nice people to work with.  Beautiful campus if you can get an office there.  Lots of turnover.  Struggle with IT.
good,"It was a great job but the pay rate did not support my finacial needs,"
good,"Day starts at 9 AM and finishes at 6PM. (Mon -Fri). a typical day is checking all the import shipments throiugh AIR & ocean if they are arriving on time, customs clearance on time etc."
good,"Hier hield ik mij bezig met vooral administratieve werkzaamheden, zoals het archiveren, in en uitboeken van auto's etc. Wat ik vooral heb geleerd is het goed organiseren en secuurheid van je werk. Wat mij vooral is bijgebleven is de manier hoe personeel en de directie met elkaar omgingen, je zag echt dat het als 1 team samenwerkte dat er niemand hoger was dan de rest alleen op papier dan."
good,"A typical day at work would start with tweaks on the sales floor. Making sure the store was clean, and the cash registers were balanced from the day before.  The job always revolved around the customer so  a sales associate would always be moving around.  I got the chance to know different kind of materials Nike always surrounded itself with, what new trends they were creating or if they were adapting themselves to new ideas such as ""Nike better world"".  I was also given the chance to experience direct selling with customers.  Management have always been strict when it came to work but they would also be understanding.  It was easy to get along with everyone of my co-workers.  Hardest part of the job would be re-stocking.  It must be done swiftly and efficiently which could get hard depending on the time of the year.  The most enjoyable part of the job would be the customer interaction.  Every person has a different personality which you get to know about, it can sometimes make your day."
good,"costumer servicing"
good,Cool place to work for wouldnt necessarily make a career out of working here unless in an Administrative/Managerial position.
good,When arriving at work the supervisor would give us the review of the tasks that need to be done by certain time. I learned how to divide the quantity of the product into separate packages. My job was to manage my own section.  The hardest part of the job was finishing the quotes they asked us of packaging.  
good,"- Receber mercadorias, colocar preços e alarme nos produtos novos, separar para o profissional responsável pelo visual merchandising todos os produtos novos para expor no salão de vendas, passar os produtos como camisas, casacos, calças, blusas e shorts para exposição de vendas, manter os produtos organizados e bem armazenados para preservar a qualidade  e assim evitar possíveis perdas dos produtos por mal manuseio."
good,"Belle ambiance et un management motivé, au siège cela doit être encore plus intéressant"
good,"The culture at Nike is great. Everyone wears sneakers, of course. Lot's of events on campus. Half-days on Fridays during the summer.. Great campus, great people. "
good,"I love working different athletic events, that has made my experience  unforgettable. I love being a part of our athletic run club twice a week. I find it interesting and very helpful to be able to run with consumers and be able to bring the experiences back to the store to share with consumers to provide good feed back on the product. Management could be better and co workers are no very liable but i  always work hard to succeed my personal goals. The hardest part of the job is having to deal with hard consumers, but i always find a way to make it a positive experience. "
good,work wasnt so hard co worker cool learned somthing new every day
good,a typical day at work is mainly assisting custoemrs. Help assist customers and answer questions on out products. We clean the store and maintain facility.
good,O.K. Job.Kick back and easy. Not a real job.Low stress. Good product to sell.
good,"Nike Factory is a great place to work. Typically I work in the footwear department and promote our product to the customer, as well as, answering all their questions. It is a fast environment during peak hours it can get very busy, but I love it when that happens. My co-workers are great people they have shown me a lot for the time I been there. As for management they are a great group. Always making sure we are good and encouraging us all the time. I have no complaints about management."
good,"A typical work day was very busy, a lot of interacting with customers from all around the globe. Co- workers work as a team. The most enjoyable part of the job was the changes through out each shift."
good,"I would go from one site to another to increase the brand of Nike Basketball, implementing many marketing strategies and ideas to promote the brand."
good,"a typical work day was to expect the unexpected. I learned to take each day for what it was, no matter if it was smooth or hectic, I rolled with the punches. For the most part, management was really good, but they had some bad apples. Co-workers band together and got the job done as planned. The wear and tear of the machinery. The most enjoyable part of the day was at the very end of the of the shift, just knowing that that we met our goals for the shift was extremely pleasing."
good,Fair clean environment. I learned to supervise other. Excellent team management. Co- worker are very actuary and determination. Hardest part of work when we short of co-worker perform production. My opinion learning new things from work.
good,there is so many positives about nike that you really need to sit down with me and let me tell you wat they have done for me and what i can do for you.
good,"Good, clean, upbeat atmosphere to work in. Management and leads are very cool to work for."
good,Working in a group that observes Summer Fridays is the best. Who doesn't want a half day on Fridays during the entire summer?
good,Nike is the perfect job to turn into a career . Great balanced work schedule. Holidays off with available holiday pay. Excellent cafeteria. Understanding management and family knit community and culture.
good,Un stage particulièrement riche et intense. Les managers savent mettre le nouveau stagiaire à l'aise.
good,Uma ótimo empresa com valores definidos e muita oportunidade de promoção.
good,"Everyone knew their jobs and roles, but was willing to step in to assist others when they could.  The new management was very supportive and encouraged people to succeed.  They also promoted career development and training.  "
good,"Os 2 pontos fortes da empresa sem dúvidas são, a maravilhosa filosofia da empresa que ensina a pensar fora da caixa e a remuneração que é muito acima do mercado."
good,"Ótima experiência de trabalho que me proporcionaram , um excelente ambiente de trabalho! Recomendo sem sombra de dúvidas."
good,"Very Good team work. Great place to learn and develop, as always coaching and inmproving"
good,"If it weren't for the people working here, I wouldn't have stayed as long as I did. I loved the culture here. Although, I did not enjoy how unorganized management was."
good,"For anyone who loves the swoosh this is a great pit stop on the road to your career field. you'll get involved with various community and brand events such as the Kyrie Irving invitational and Mamba league events held annually. Inside your main store however you're bound to meet a diverse group of people who share at least one thing in common with you and some of your coworkers will grow to become great friends in the outside world. Being surrounded by the products you love and getting paid to wear it is the ultimate upside, who wouldn't want to get paid to wear nike tech every day and depending on location you never know who you may run into, from higher ups in the company to A list celebrities like Kevin durant, Floyd mayweather and kevin hart. If youre working to ward your true passion and on the retail portion of your journey, this wont be a bad place to stop along the way"
good,"It is really good working for the NIKE project, It is a good platform to enhance my SAP knowledge and also to collaborate with other modules. You get chance to work in shifts."
good,"trabajo en equipo, flexibilidad horaria, beneficios para empleados y familiares"
good,There no real room for growth and development within the company. Often feels like you aren't really serving a actual purpose. the benefits are decent but not to the cost of living.
good,"The only issue that really had most of us employees not appreciate, was not having flexible hours. Most of the employees are students wether it is full time or part time student. When they had shortages on employees it was harder for us students to balance school and work due to their scheduling requirments."
good,"Entreprise très machiste! Les femmes ne sont pas prises au sérieux par les supérieurs. Et les hommes on tendance à abuser de leur statut de manager."
good,They easily pivot to the latest technology if the technology makes sense and will help the business. This gives you the opportunity to learn the latest cutting edge technology.
good,Nike is pretty chill and a great place to work. They have a great sense of work life balance and do a great job at making sure you are adjusted to the culture. I have learned a lot within technology and gained new skills.
good,"At first, Nike was very fun. I got to meet great people, great leaders, etc. but it got to a point where it didnt matter if the work place was hectic. All that mattered were the numbers, how much more we can beat other stores in the region, how much better we can do against other coworkers. It was no longer a fun working environment for many of us."
good,Great place to work and fun crew to be around. Pay was not the best but it  is great for people going to college that need a few bucks or high school students needing the experience.
good,Cool experience with amazing co workers and management. Very low pay leads to losing a lot of talent. Learn valuable customer service and marketing skills.
good,"Estuve trabajando para nike 5 meses, me quedaron debiendo 1 mes para completar los 6, pero lamentablemente llego un jefe de santiago y recortó personal, no vieron todo el esfuerzo que hicimos en bodega ya que los dos bodegueros que éramos habíamos parado toda la bodega, y el jefe de nike la Serena se autoproclamo que el había organizado la bodega, cosa que fue errónea, terminando ya el trabajo nos echaron a los dos. Un asco de jefe más encima acosador, el está en un una denuncia que la hizo una trabajadora del mismo lugar, así que ahora el está en proceso."
good,"Une équipe jeune, plein de bonne humeur, travaillant bien et sérieusement. L'équipe managériale est à l'écoute et plein de bon conseil."
good,"It was a very 'chilled' out environment, yet quite busy at times. It is very easy to get along with fellow staff members. Working at Nike felt like being a part of a family."
good,"I was there for three years and it is a regular retail job, nothing exciting happening too often, management have some interesting personalities and workers are mostly friendly and fun to be around."
good,Nike has been a good place to work for because of the environment and what they stand for with equal opportunities. I do love it there and only hard part there is dealing with foreign consumers.
good,"When it comes to looking at a normal typical day at work it gets really busy either around opening time or after 3 pm, you tend to find a lot of customers and traders queuing to perchance there select products. Other than that the rest of the day seems calm until closing time. I was disappointed  that it had to shut down but furthermore i liked working at the Nike factory store as i thought it was a fun working place and very productive. I have no regrets and it was a really good work experience as i have a passion for retail and love being either a sales assistant or an associate. Management seems meet my satisfactory level as i have no problems.The main hardest thing in the job would have to be the rush doing the day as customers want to get there desired products as fast as possible but i have found a way to multitask and help each customer with what they are looking for and also sorting out the stations as boxes or clothes are sometimes left unattended and misplaced. There are lots of different people wanting to purchase shoes or even clothes and you tend to see different cultures."
good,Flexible schedule. Good pay and with good attendance comes great store discounts. Off on major holidays. Overtime is available to workers when necessary
good,"Great benefits. great work culture. Management can do better with scheduling and man management. overall, the company is a great place to work. If you intend on climbing the corporate ladder at Nike, my advice is to leave to find experience elsewhere."
good,"a good company, has very step into the future concepts, that keep it on the edge and trend setting ideas, over all great people to work with and most are highly motivated and team a team concept mentality."
good,"My job was great except the entire building got shut down because my call center got outsourced. I managed to get out just before then, but it was a disaster."
good,Every employee that works for nike is very motivated and active. Which kept the everyday environment very light hearted and fun. Not to mention we would start every open shift with a fun game of four square.
good,"For the experience and for the pay, it was a fun job. You learned and obtained a lot of experience and knowledge with customers. The hardest part about my job was to deal with large crowds of consumers"
good,Productive place to work. Proper training was provided. The staff/co-workers were friendly and always willing to help. I would recommend this job role to a person willing to learn and also gain experience in the IT field.
good,Nike is large and complex company and should be reviewed based on the team you are on.  Nike has a great culture and really tries hard to keep its employee's happy and excited.  There are groups that are not fun to work with and some that have 70% of the team as contractors and 30% permanent.  That makes a hard workplace.
good,"High paced retail space with great job culture, learning opportunities, and advanced opportunities for growth. Hardest post would probably be hours and the commitment that is asked of you."
good,"My experience at Nike was that of a typical retail associate. I stocked clothes, processed inventory and assisted customers with any of their needs. The job requires standing almost the entire shift, so wearing comfortable shoes is a must. luckily they provide you with your first uniform including shoes, and all you pay are the taxes which is deducted out your first check."
good,Tremendous culture with vast appreciation for sports and remaining active. I genuinely enjoyed coming to work every day. I was challenged and given an opportunity to grow as a professional
good,Wonderful place to work fun team setting high intensity lots of traffic it’s all about customer service AndProduct knowledge  it’s typical workday is having a store meeting at the beginning of the day getting your zone assigned to you greeting customers helping them find what they’re looking for when it comes to shoes the technology in the shoes is key to best fit customers lifestyle from From running a marathon or if they’re walking to a fashion Sneaker and the same goes for clothing
good,"Nike was a lifestyle. A lifestyle which compelled you to live more consciously."
good,"One of the best companies i've worked for on a retail lens. Diverse environment and high energy. Every job has it's pros and cons, it's what you are will to deal with, but I have nothing bad to say about this one. Love the brand and company!"
good,"Working at Nike has a lot of benefits, but the problem is career advancement. Very political with who gets promoted and that was the ONLY problem I had with the job. Everything was great but pay isn't great though it was fair for the type of work."
good,"Nike is a fun place to work, always seeing the latest products can be exciting. However, required hours are extremely unflexible and they do not allowed requested time off, even if requested months in advance. This was a little annoying since it seemed like I could not plan out other events in my life in fear I had a shift that day."
good,"Great team environment with opportunity to grow and develop. General Managers are given ownership and autonomy with their stores and manage all aspect including HR, Employee Relation, Operations, Loss Prevention, and Services."
good,I learned how to deal with customer issues at the cash register. Everyday was a learning experience from dealing with customers to organizing the products.
good,"A typical day at work was in the back of the store. The managers would write down who is assigned to what task each day. I learned additional teamwork and team building skills from working at Nike. This is due to the flow of items in the back needing to be displayed out front and making sure my job was getting accomplished so the rest of the team can continue to work smoothly. The overall culture of the workplace is based around teamwork. The hardest part of the job was unloading the trucks and making room for inventory, while the most enjoyable part of the job was creating new friendships and conversing with my coworkers."
good,"My time at Nike was very enjoyable and had very encouraging management. Like most companies, there is always room to improve and grow. The only downside was the pay. It was not enough for me during that time."
good,"Job is a fast paced, yet fun job. Pay can be a little bit of struggle, but opportunities for growth are endless and job is great for those looking for expanding marketing skills."
good,"Very frendfull relations between coulleagues.  Supply chain Management system  is  not very flexible for cost saving and service improvements. I have been leading WH logistic service in Russia and I have faced bad communication between Evropean Head Office and Top Management in Russia,  feed back  for improvements was not taking into account when it should be Head Office level of responsibility."
good,"I love my time at Nike and had a manager that was wonderful, smart and a good teacher. She had a way of making the worst job seem like the best job. After she retired, the following managers were ok, my last manager was a joke, no real experience."
good,"nothing too hard, required to be productive and communicate with customers. Team is super friendly and open to new people and always a fun day at work."
good,"Company culture was challenging for a women in an engineer role, but if you can manage to hold on there are a lot of positives. I worked in a culturally and globally diverse team which was nice compared to the fairly mono-cultural scene in Oregon. Pace was kept very high to keep motivation which at sometimes felt oppressive as you could not dive too deep into problems that would benefit a product or project. Overall a fun place to work if you can handle the taste of the kool-aid."
good,"Experience with pace, management and potential for career advancement vary between store locations. The discount is probably the sweetest part of the deal."
good,"Nike was my first retail job, I had no experience and they took me and taught me everything. Now, I love working retail. Working for Nike was a great experience."
good,Closed mouths don't get fed at Nike. You can have potential but you must make others aware of exactly what you're trying to accomplish within the company in order to progress or have your work tailored to your future role.
good,"carreira focada em relacionamento, ser bom tecnicamente não é uma vantagem"
good,"Order-picking of replenishment taken uitvoeren"
good,"Nike employers say they like to hire within, but they constantly hire externally because they're ""afraid coworkers won't take you serious"" if you get a promotion. It is a close knit family environment, but that shouldn't be a reason to not promote people."
good,"Everyone is nice, but hours are a bit inconsistent because of the availability I have. Overall would recommend to my friends looking for a short term job."
good,It's fast paced. An very percised an no mistaks can be made. If you dont know something just ask. An everything will be fine. An run smoothly. Great job
good,"Job was a great start jumping into the work world. They were not promoting much growth in the company as a sales representative. Managers were great, staff was great & location was perfect"
good,Days consisted of mainly receiving and processing product. I learned how to work in a very fast paced environment and had to consistently meet deadlines while still performing at a standard.
good,"Productive, Nike was a nice job I myself always focusing on my task at hand so no bad reviews I come handle my business do my job and go same thing the next day"
good,"Pretty good place to work at. Hours were kind of hard to come by. Discounts were great. Co-workers were cool. But when its slow, it makes time go by a little slow."
good,This job as a full time employee was fun to go to because of the working environment. However pay was too minimal in order for me to stay. Would love to work this job for a higher annual salary but this is impossible given the nature of the work.
good,"I love working for Nike, They have created a fun environment and workspace for the employees and treat us fairly well, but being a college student they do not understand that I (and many others) am a student first and require us to have availability Friday-Sunday with 36 peak hours open. We often work every weekend and find it hard to get days off for school or family purposes."
good,The diversity was spectacular. We brought in different types of people and made everyone feel like home (Workers and Customers). I also learned the different technologies that went into the different types of shoes and apperal. It helped us a store and individually grow within the company and make us better as a family and more unified.
good,meetings every morning about goals and new material. learn a lot about sales and how to relate and communicate with customers. management wasn't always the best some times they can be a bit too much but overall experience at Nike is great.
good,"Great place to work but currently a seasonal position.  Need full time employment.  Management easy to work for. Schedules ahead of time so that I am aware of the days and hours I will work, I love working with people and the Nike Brand. Only issue is working until closing with out knowing the exact time when work will be completed because of transportation issues. I would love to continue to work if the position was full time with benefits. Unfortunately I can not wait until the end of the season to find out if this will occur as I have bills that need to be paid."
good,"I had a great time working for Nike. The customer service aspect can be draining, but it was much more bearable with great coworkers & managers. It was a good time!"
good,"It was an okay job, I am glad they raised the pay because it was much needed. The people you work with our fun, but sometimes managers can get annoying and try and tell you how to operate something when you already know how to operate it."
good,A typical day at work was long especially if you're scheduled on the floor. But it made it much easier if you were zoned with a good friend who worked with you.
good,Great place to work at. The focus of sales at nike is very customer driven. Developing a relationship with the customer was a must in order to drive sales.
good,"Best wel een goede werkomgeving qua sfeer en een veilige werkomgeving, werken met mensen van verschillende nationaliteiten."
good,"Nike is a great place to learn management and customer service skills in a retail environment. The leadership at the top of the company is focused on providing a great experience at all levels of employees and consumers. You get out of the job what you put in. Experience in-store varies depending on your location. Benefits are great once you are in a full-time position, including preferred stock and health care."
good,The job was a good part time job for a college student. For the most part I was able to work around my sports schedules and it was a company that I could relate too.
good,"Working with this company was a real true & unforgettable experience . The times spent on this job will not be overlooked & displayed very key & essential points in life making decisions.  I am grateful for the experiences that I gained working for this company it taught me a lot about independence , Leadership & working as a team ..."
good,"Nike is a great company to work for, however the compensation could be much better.  I would recommend family and friends to work for Nike.  I started as a sales and quickly advanced to Visuals due to my previous work and educational background."
good,good working place. has a great working environment and energetic staff. the shifts are also flexible and adaptable to your schedule. overall great place with good benefits .
good,Great job for anyone who is looking to make retail a career.  Great benefits and fair pay.  There is an opportunity to advance if you are willing to relocate.
good,Its an ok Job great for college students or resent graduates looking to get their foot into the nike corporate world. Really awesome discount and cool uniforms.
good,It is a good and inspiring company to work for but the opportunities to grow and get promoted are few and far between.   You may have to move to another country such as the States to get more and better opportunities to grow with the company.  Management is very professional and fellow co workers are fun and enthusiastic.   The Nike culture is a great environment.   This positive environment shows in the products and initiatives they offer to the public.
good,It’s a okay job managers can be rude and the warehouse is very hot but they have good food they have two big cafeterias in the warehouse . Overall I did not like the job
good,"Has alot of unfair managers working at the location I work at, but the job was fun and benifits are great. have a great lunch room that was cheap and provided good food."
good,"I loved the smell of the building. Lunchtime was always great, always. They had chefs in the lunchrooms and the prices for the food was very affordable. Pay was every week, a plus. The staff was attractive and friendly, a plus. Favortism is everywhere, luckily I was a favorite. Most managers were angels, a few were demons."
good,A typical day at work included starting the day with a meeting in which we discussed promotions and sales goals. Management gave updates on sales approximately every 15 minutes in order to stay on track. Made it personal with customers and provided great service. Most enjoyable part of the job is knowing that customers are truly satisfied with the companies services and products.
good,"Flexible work environment and great perks."
good,Donde el sentido de trabajo en equipo cobra sentido... mucha energía positiva y valores laborales que se transmiten a cada colaborador. terminas amando la marca...just do it.
good,"I am sure people experience different situations at different stores but I have loved my time at nike. The only issue was poor management. Your average day is talking to customers, engaging with fellow employees and wearing a brand you love. There is a lot of flexible that also comes with the job, they do work around your schedule if needed."
good,"Nike retail has a wonderful corporate culture due to the fact that the brand is built around athletes, sports and products to serve both. My team has been through a lot of changes over the past year, but most companies go through changes that are positive and negative. I have enjoyed the fast-paced work, the interactions with consumers and the small victories."
good,Empresa apresenta ambiente estimulante e inovador.
good,It all depends on who is on your team and management. Which helps you realize whether Nike is a good fit for you or not. I learned a lot about who is Nike as a component and company.
good,Nike Marion is very typically like any retail job except you're working for the biggest sporting company in the world. The products are exceptional and the technology behind everything is out of this world.
good,They push you to be the very best employee you can be and are very adamant about maintaining a positive and friendly work place. Schedule flexibility is fair.
good,"It was nice to not always have your boss checking on you. Basically do your own thing, listen to music and get your work done. Loved how they allowed us to fit in working out into our daily work life."
good,"Enjoyed my time working for Nike, the most enjoyable part of the job was the people you get to work with apart from that it's the same as any other retail job."
good,"I had a good time working at Nike, if there is anything I would change it would be the pay. For such a greatly respected company Nike didn't pay it's employees much."
good,"I really enjoyed my time at NIKE."
good,One of the best places I've ever worked. Just wasnt getting the desired hours I wanted. Wish I could've stayed working there. Management wasn't bad at all and it's a clean place too.
good,"It was a perfect job for anyone who is looking for work during the summer that includes comfy work attire, fun atmosphere with a young culture, and decently flexible hours with the amount of people working at once. Obviously a little chaotic at times, but what retail job isnt, and the managers had a nice balance between effectively managing and being an understanding coworker at the same time. Kept early morning light and motivating and continued that throughout that work days or longer night shifts."
good,great place to work love the associates and the appreciating was
good,Very fun and strong environment teamwork job.  Very flexible with hours.  Have good discounts.  A lot of opportunities to play sports with your coworkers
good,The chefs were very knowledgeable in the culinary arts and were always exceeding expectations set forth by the catering department. The chefs were more than willing to help teach anyone in the kitchen and pushed for perfection in everything that was made.
good,"Overall my experience was pretty positive.  For the most part I enjoyed the group I worked with.  Contractors do not gain access to all the amenities Nike provides its full-time employees, which was annoying (ie, no access to the fitness centers, summer working hours, etc.). "
good,"-Sales goals for the day were expressed to every associate beginning their shift"
good,Great job for students gets great discounts and you get flexible hours and a fun and energetic work environment. You will enjoy the team because they act as a team and everyone feels apart.
good,Cool employees and a few of the manager were decent. Not a lot of promotion  throughout the company. Had to be interviewed for a higher position. Nice breaks.
good,"Es muy agradable todos son jóvenes y puedes ir en zapatillas."
good,"Working at Nike offered many great experiences. I was able to enjoy the benefits of working many events for the community and other events outside of the retail space that were highly enjoyable and interesting. The culture of Nike is premium for customer service, more so than any other retailer I've worked for in the past and that also gave me so much knowledge and understanding as to why Nike is one of the top companies in the world. Management however is at times lacking. I felt that often the plans set in place were constantly shifting and sometimes ideas you were told were important got left behind and forgotten."
good,"fun place to work at, great way to build retail experiences, especially with less than desirable customers.  pay was competitive with other retail positions."
good,Was a great experience it built up confidence and character and learnt the training for generic retail jobs such as: tills. In addition to this it is a very fun and dynamic place to work.
good,"Had there not been mixed messages of what th primary focus of my job was, i may have stayed working there longer. Quotas were high and unrealistic based on their picking methods. Had I had the chance to stay, i would have. I enjoyed my co-workers and the nature of the job."
good,"Nike can be extremely fun, depending on your staff and management for the day. Getting hours can be a struggle, as 4 hour shifts are often offered. They want weekend availability, but only to work a 4 hour shift."
good,"It was quite an experience being with the company for 9 years and being apart of an strong brand.  It felt really good being apart of a brand that represent some of the best athletes in the world.  Getting insights on what the company has planned for the future and whats yet to come as far as shoes, threads, events, athletes visiting for conference meetings, and most of the company give aways"
good,"Es una empresa con posibilidad de promoción interna siempre y cuando el empleado tenga un performance ejemplar así como movilidad geográfica. Hay que tener en cuenta que el crecimiento no suele darse a corto plazo."
good,I love working for Nike. The pay could be better but overall loved it. The managers is fair and down to Earth. Money is not the best. You can not live off just being an associate
good,"As a Manufacture worker, there is a lot of hazardous things that happen through out the day, and should be paid more than minimum wage. It is a fun place to be with the right people and working 12/h a day can be hard."
good,"Its easy place to work. Two hour job. Cleaning store, shoping area and the kitchen. In addition to that dusting is required. I like this job becouse its very easy."
good,"Nike, une très bonne école surtout concernant la VENTE, "
good,"Nike is a phenomenal company. The products that we are selling are some of the best athletic equipment in the world, and it is extremely interesting to be able to work on that level everyday. The only problem is that there is not much area for athletes to move up and advance their career."
good,"As it should be, Sports rule the day at Nike.  For people who are ambivalent about sports and aren't comfortable with the lingo and goals, it can be confusing and a little intimidating to engage."
good,its a amazing team with a great environment the company makes the job fun and the people feel like a family also great discount... even tho is fast paced environment time goes far because you enjoy what you are doing
good,"Nike is a great place to work if you want to grow in the retail industry. The environment is very relaxed but sometimes upper management can be very strict. It use to be a great company to work for with lost of great discounts, and benefits but they've cut back on a lot of it. I would definitely recommend to anyone who plans to grow in the retail industry. But I must say its little to no room for advancement if you come in as a part time worker."
good,Delivering a premium consumer experience by demonstrating the expertise to navigate through individual needs and providing a complete solution through Nike products and services.
good,"Great Team, and Company Philosophy. worked for several years and it was an impressive place to work. Great benefits and discounts also to make the staff feel part of the team. However some management care more about numbers than people."
good,"This place keeps you on your toes, quick paced and fast environment. You have to be aware of everything that's going on around you especially in the summer time and holidays it attracts a lot of tourist which sometimes comes with the cons such as stealing which happened a lot and also being in customer service you have to worry about hostile customers."
good,"It's OK to work for Nike, the culture is a little bit to liberal for me.  It also sucks being the lowest pay band on campus for full time Nike employees but the benefits make up for it."
good,Nike is a great place to work if you want to learn more about the product and the background of the company. Nike is a smooth paced job and you also can enjoy yourself by networking with a lot of good people. The hardest part of the job is accepting the actual base pay that they provide to you.  The most enjoyable part o the job are the coworkers everybody has their own personality and everybody treats everybody with respect.
good,If your are looking for a relaxed but fun and energetic place to work. Nike is the place to be. The environment is very positive even on the busiest days of the year.
good,Great place to work for Nike company. Good thing is management changes often and company has a great culture.Management can be a bit taxing depending on who you work for.
good,Great place to start your first job. A typical day as a Nike Pro Athlete revolves around balancing your time training your peer about product and customer servicing. It can be challenging at first but once you get the hang of it you'll have fun with it.
good,I was able to challenge my pace level everyday. there was not too much room for advancement at this location. there were a few good manager that were already here who stood out.
good,The most enjoyable part of the job was having a lot of co-workers with a common interest and same age group. Fun and upbeat music playing at all times.
good,typical day would be you come in for shift punch in pick up a mic and walk out to the floor ask manager for zone you will be at and goals for day. i learned alot about shoes and the technology that goes into the shoes as well as thw materials. the managment are very goal oriented but like to meet goals in fun ways.
good,"Nike is probably one of the best places to work in retail. The environment is energetic and sporty, without having pressure of being athletic. You help customers pick out product tailored to the type of sport or activity they are doing, while wearing the product that is for sale in the store. The management team really trys to push passion onto the team, and sometimes even have friendly competitions to help boost team morale. Workers are usually college students, so the work environment is very young and fresh."
good,Job was fun and offered a lot of perks and plus for employees but often hired the wrong people for certain positions and could get to be stressful on the management level.
good,"The coworkers are great, you learn everything about apparel and shoes and the skill of engaging with consumers. The workplace culture is great. Working at Nike requires hard workers who will work together to finish tasks and get through the sales day."
good,"I actually enjoy working here. It is by no means perfect, but compared to my last place of employment Nike is a dream job. It is an excellent first time job for anyone."
good,Nike is a great part-time job for college students and athletes. Moving up is hard. Working retail is easy and you may get bored but it's a lot of fun making new friends.
good,Help me to learn about NIKE and about the technology of NIKE's equipment such as shoes and shirt. Can meet a lot of diffrent kind of people through the customers.
good,"Nike is a great company to work for, anywhere in the world.  The Geo GM truly cares about the people, the office is nice but located in the sticks, and most people are trying to do good work.  "
good,"The doors at Nike never closed, making it one of the fastest paced jobs. The best part about working at Nike was the fun staff. Lots of peers my age that helped make it seem like it wasn't work."
good,"Nike is a very fast-paced environment has multiple opportunities for growth. I learned how to make personal connections with consumers and how to genuinely offer products/services to people with help. Nike is a place where the culture is very young and fun so your peers will definitely become your friends, However, at my particular store management was not up to par. They were very self-oriented and never had the best interest for the employee. But other than management this was a very fun job and i'd recommend for anyone interested in retail, while also having a passion in sports."
good,with the right manager its a great place to work with lots of opportunities to do different things every day.  Lots of other little perks as well like gym and sports culture.
good,"Great job for new workers to work for, not good to stay longer than a year or two. A typical day at work is either fast paced or slow paced, never in between."
good,"A typical day at Nike consists of greeting and assisting customers while keeping the store neat and straightened. The management team is very understanding especially during a family emergency. The hardest part of my job is dealing with upset customers, while the most enjoyable part is working as a team to make the customer's experience awesome and genuine."
good,The events were fun to attend and work. Pushing Nike's golf product could be difficult at times due to other major manufacturing brands grabbing the attention of consumers.
good,"I enjoyed meeting new people at Nike and receiving discounts. I wish I was able to work full time instead of part time under. Overall i learned a lot being at Nike, just wasn't paid enough and didn't get enough hours."
good,"Made up of driven people who work hard and play hard. Long hour at times, but value work life balance. Ambiguity is a part of the culture and it can be challenging, but it sparks ideas and debate. Very smart executive leadership. Team work is highly valued. "
good,"Bottom line, it's a retail job at the outlets. You get long shifts on weekends and moderate shifts during the week, which is helpful when you're also in school. Don't expect to go home during the holidays, especially if you get hired as a seasonal athlete. Management doesn't do much for consistent employee interaction/motivation, they definitely play favorites. As far as the other athletes, there is always a great group of people to work with. There are so many employees, you will typically work with different people each shift. Great place to make money during the holidays if you don't plan on leaving town!"
good,"A typical day at Nike. When arriving to work the traffic is horrible. I would recommend you to arrive 30 minutes before shift starts. I learned the matter of respect. Management is not dependable. I've had five different managers within the time I've been there.The environment is like a typical distribution center. The hardest part at work is maintaining good health and your life outside of work. Most enjoyable part of the job is knowing you've exceeded the goal, receiving annual bonus's, giveaways, and the food."
good,"Overall as a place to work, it's really hard to beat. The company's mission is compelling, the product is fantastic, all your friends are envious."
good,"Working for Nike is a great experience that I would recommend to anyone. If you have a body, then you are an athlete is the slogan that is embodied always at Nike. Employees maintain a wonderful culture and environment and help the consumers feel like they are truly cared for and cared about. I look forward to going into work everyday at Nike."
good,"Nike Logistics Center is good place to work. They offer good benefits and the job is basically secure. The compensation could be better compared to other logistic centers in the area.  but the overall experience is a good one. They do a good job of complying with labor laws, so employees are treated fairly.  Grievances are heard and addressed. The hardest part of the job is the long ours at times."
good,"Self teaching will be key to succeed. Relaxed and fast pace environment will keep you on your toes. There is not much formal training, reading and trail and error will be the name of the game."
good,"Nike is wonderful but it is hard to move from corporate services into corporate, so it's easy to get stuck in a shift and job where your skills and talent are under used."
good,"It was a little slow when I was there, but the work was interesting when we had it.  This probably had to do with the fact that they were in the midst of a re-org.  My coworkers and managers were nice.  I was at Nike Golf, and our building was off campus so I experienced a fraction of the culture on campus."
good,"Overall a good place to work, but advancement can be difficult. The best way to be successful here is to know someone. That is most likely how you will get the job you desire."
good,"Has lost most of it's culture that existed in the 90's - 2000's.  It has become a cut-throat, ageist company that has lost it's cool factor.  It will likely come back if they can get their act together."
good,This is definitely a great atmosphere for College students who are looking for a decent paying job and to work around school. Great discounts and it's fun when you meet fun people.
good,"Good work hours flexibility, manager inspirational, encouraging, sometimes business requirements can be demanding, requires overtime occasionally during peak"
good,This job was me thinking outside the box. I didn't think it was a good fit for me.  I had a great shift leader as well as a great supervisor. I just prefer an office environment.
good,"Working overnight is stressful in itself, working at Nike Flagship store adds more stress due to the workload but if you can balance it out the culture is amazing, however if you are not for a lack of better words ""sacking"" management, don't expect to grow at this company, It was hard enough overnight had to compete with Daytime staff but when your own management team uses any excuse to not promote you because you call them out on favoritism, you will not last."
good,"Buen ambiente de trabajo, con muchas oportunidades para aprender y desarrollarse profesionalmente."
good,A great team atmosphere in a high paced work place. They care about the well being of their employees and have fantastic amenities across their campus.
good,"Nike the World shoe Home. I learnt how a team can and can not work on a large scale. To see how management see's over the team at a very fast pace."
good,Its a great company that you can learn a lot if you apply yourself and really want to learn. There is a strong difference between contractors and full time nike employees. The hardest part is being a contractor.
good,"Great benefits for most of the staff. It's great to have the ability to jump into benefits early. The benefits are amazing, and they truly take care of the people."
good,Positive environment with passionate people. Pay is low but if you start in management you will be paid well. Productive people inside and out of work.
good,"The NIKE work campus was ok it was hard to work with a lot of the people that they hired for managers but the workers were able to speak their mind about the management  or the other workers. i did like the work but it was not the job for me. "
good,"Good company to work for.  Work/Life balance is talked about a lot, but you truly are on the clock 24/7, as emails will be exchanged throughout the night.  Management is focused on making sure they meet their commitments to Wall Street, and will do everything they can to meet those numbers.  Focus on innovation is great - the bar is always being set higher."
good,"Very up beat and busy, always active. Dealing with customers so a lot of costumer service and customer satisfaction. Management was well organized and very constructive. I learned how to work independently. Hardest part of the job was learning all the new tasks. Most enjoyable part would be selling items that I can relate to."
good,"Working for Nike is an experience. It's a very vibrant, cutting edge and forward thinking company with real passion for their employees and their athletes. Multi-cultural and national with awesome opportunities to travel and work all across the globe depending on your position. Fabulous benefits like discount on products, campus based work with gyms, restaurants, shops, parks and outside sporting facilities, travel for work, company sponsored sporting trips etc. In everything Nike aims to be the number one and that is also demanded from it's employees. Due to this attitude you tend to work a lot and this could interfer with your home life sometimes. But you can make that choice. It's not a company for sleepers. The company certainly embodies their motto 'Just Do It'."
good,"Not a very busy location so shifts went by slowly most days, often shifts were very over staffed, everyone was very friendly but the management was on the unorganized side"
good,Love meeting people from all walks of life and learning about the technology of different NIKE products. I enjoy the hours and engaging coworkers. Very rewarding.
good,Good employee discount and allotment for clothing purchases rather than a uniform. Most management and the supervisors are very friendly. The pay is sub-par.
good,Really laid back atmosphere. No complaints with management but would prefer not working on the weekends. Job is faily fast paced but not too demanding. the pay is good for a lift driver.
good,"You'll run in with many problems; lack of communication. People have their good days and some have their bad days, so I say be around people with their good days."
good,"A typical day of work for me consists of moving around boxes and making sure the stock room is clean, this job inst hard especially with my fellow co-workers. I learned a lot about time management and efficiency while working at Nike. I also learned to be more of a people person and more engaging with others. The hardest part of the job is the labor part because sometimes Id be required to take in trucks in the hot Florida sun but i still got it done with a smile nevertheless. The most enjoyable part of the job is communicating with the people that work there as well as being able to meet great customers each day."
good,"As an athlete, the work load was spreaded out well. The type of departments that the store has are the shoes department, appareal, shipping and receiving, equipment and human resource. This place is maining for working part time."
good,Nike was a great sports based environment where we'd address everything in sports terms. It has a wonderful team atmosphere with good perks in nike gear. Who doesn't love Nike gear? Management was overall cool and laid back.
good,"Journée de travail typique :"
good,"Nike is an amazing company to work for. The company puts a lot of emphasis on being a sponge. In part, because the culture is innovative.   Great JOB!"
good,"Nike is a fun place to work at first, the discounts are amazing. The only poor thing about the place is the lack of flexibility in schedules. I had a few times I wasn't able to make it because of family reasons and the only thing they said I could do was call out. I couldn't even swap shifts with someone else."
good,"It's a great place to work.The co workers are great, the management is good as well. The benefits for working with Nike are amazing and enjoyable. It is a wonderful place to be."
good,"I enjoyed the job it was very welcoming and comfortable. Very open to new workers. It's a relaxing work space, not too busy. Though, if you are looking for a place to build retail experience this is a comfortable space to work in and the other workers are friendly."
good,I started Nike during a time that managers were leaving and being replaced. This led to a lot of chaos in the back of house (shipping and receiving) by the time I left it had been much improved.
good,"Os horários são flexíveis, temos a oportunidade de conhecer sobre a história da marca, sobre os produtos e dividir essa experiência com os clientes"
good,"Mucho trabajo en equipo y apoyo dentro de la empresa, aprendi hacer inventarios y cajero"
good,"Working at NIKE I developed lifelong friends from all walks of life. Everyone on staff had a passion for the job. Work didn't seem like work, because we all enjoyed our jobs so much. The different cultures and backgrounds made works so interesting."
good,"Ambiente dinamico, preciso, interattivo, socievole, nuove conoscenze culturali. Salario leggermente basso alle aspettative. "
good,I enjoy working for a company that is one of the best in innovation for the world of sports. What I do specifically isn't life giving because I'm not interacting with people on a daily basis as much as I'd like too.
good,"Aprendí a analizar mas a fondo y con más variables los resultados de las cuentas asignadas, pudiendo proyectar resultados mas exactos."
good,"I had a lot of fun working at Nike. The typical day is to help and greet each consumer in the area to find their needs or provide the next best thing. "
good,Work was always fun. Co-workers were very outgoing and social. It was never really too much too handle or I was never overwhelmed with the workload. They also had great discount for their workers.
good,The pay was great but overall this place was the most unorganized place that I have ever worked at. The workers where great people but the people overhead where not up to par
good,"Nice managmet "
good,"Learned a lot about motivating others with Nike, to see everybody as a vessel that can be filled with positive energy and information, you just to use the right method to reach each one of them."
good,"Very easy going job, very pleasant atmosphere and coworkers. Daily tasks were simple enough, only thing hard was shipment. One supervisor and manager were hard to deal with but other than that its a  great job if you're not commuting and are working full-time"
good,I think it's a perfect place to work at in regards to learning more about the Nike culture and the lifestyle as an athlete. If you are looking for a place to develop as a person this is the place
good,"This was a fun, relaxed job where I was pushed to learn more about different products and my co-workers in a helthy, stress free environment. I had the oppurtunity to learn how to store large quantities of merchandise, up-sale products to customers on a regular basis, and had a chance to open the store from the ground up. The management staff was extraordinarily kind and caring about their employees but was also strict enough to keep their employees dedicated and motivated."
good,manager présent et qui accompagne le proeet professionnel de son équipe
good,"Everyday is a great day to be at work. I learned how to be the great associate for the company I can be, making a connection with each person that walks in. With the managers it is a tug of war, instead of them moving people up from inside the store, they brought people from outside of the store. The hardest part of the job was double working, when the other person in your area would call out. The great enjoyable part about the job, was making everyone smile in the store."
good,"Nike is a brand, Nike is a business. In the retail sector of the business the consumer always comes first, we like to give each consumer a memorable journey from the moment they arrive instire to the moment they leave. Excellent career opportunities for those who are goal driven and passionate about the brand, and help will be given to those who wish to progress and and broaden there knowledge within Nike."
good,Avaliar os salários conforme a importância de cada função não sendo injusto com ninguém.
good,"Empresa dinâmica, agradável em se trabalhar, ótimos benefícios."
good,"You would have to report to the opening manager to get a brief report on what section you will be in and the sales goal you are required to make per hour. I learned deciding what sneaker to get is more complex than that, theirs the sole, how wide your feet are, what do you need the shoe for, etc. We had about 10 managers with 10 different fun personalities. No question is a dumb question, everyone is here to learn. We had about 80 assassinates of all races and cultures, I loved it because we all learned about each other. The hardest part was reaching for shoes that were out of my reach due to me being 4'11 and still having assistance with a ladder. The most enjoyable part was group meeting, we played games, spoke about goals, new inventory, loss prevention, and how to give excellent customer service."
good,"I worked in the back here. All i did was shipping and receiving and i liked that. unload trucks, process apparel and footwear. Stock the floor."
good,"A typical day at work would be to assist customers on various footwear, I would also answer any questions the customer has regarding footwear and apparel. I would also recommend shoes based on the customers requirements, which is quite rewarding. "
good,"I worked for nike for quite some time. Decent hours and decent pay, management was awesome, coworkers were better. I enjoyed working with customers and my staff day in and day out I enjoyed the discounts of our service"
good,"Ótimo Local de trabalho, empresa oferecia ótimos benefícios, e quanto ao ambiente era ótimo o convívio entre os funcionários e gerencia ."
good,I didn't like it as much as I thought but the money was kinda good.The staff was nice the work was easy .I learned how to work at a quicker paste. The hardest part was putting all the clothes on the hanger & in the box on time.Management was nice and understanding.
good,"-Everyday goals to have consumers try out any nike products."
good,"Excellent Team to work with. A lot of online modules to learn about the footwear and apparel Nike products."
good,"Nike was een werkomgeving die veel van je vroeg maar ook veel terug gaf. Veel jeugdige energie. Just to do it, get the job done. Heel veel gereisd door bijkans heel Europa en daardoor heel veel ervaring opgedaan in retail en retail development.Veel geld verdiend voor Nike, iets te weinig voor mezelf."
good,Boa cultura empresarial e desenvolvimento dos funcionários
good,"Aprendi a ter o controle das contas dos clientes e de todos os seus pedidos, até á entrega, através de processos eficazes de reporting e tabelas dinâmicas."
good,Typical work day requires for employees to be engaging and Friendly with consumers and help them locate merchandise using assist devices
good,"I enjoyed working at Nike, each day was very busy and getting a chance to interact with customers made my day. Assisting parents, siblings, and even friends with clothing was something I became very fond of. My coworkers were very determined and competitive when it came to sales. Determination and competition are what made our days intriguing and allowed us to meet our goals for the day."
good,Good conditions of work place made our team provide excellent customer service. Gaining anormous skills I handled to show my best rate of profit as a sales attendant in 2008.
good,The key is to stay productive. Make sure shipments are done accurately and posthaste. Accuracy is very important. Once the merchandise is processed it is very urgent that it is correct and ready to be shipped.
good,Good team to work with. The management team could use some work but overall good job. I would recommend this job and company
good,"Relaxing environment, dealing with travelers and regular customers on the daily. I've learned great communication skills dealing with celebrities and rich customers. Hardest part of the job is weekends when you have to multi-task 5 customers at a time. The most enjoyable is doing group activities with the co-workers"
good,"The one thing I really enjoyed about the job was the diversity, from the employees to the customers it was always something new. Everyday I worked I would interact with someone new from all over the country. From them coming to Nike and me making their experience a good one is what made my job such a great thing. I was giving them knowledge about our products while getting to know them more personally. I really enjoyed communicating with new people everyday."
good,"*They understand their consumer better than any other firm in their industry (and probably better than any other brand)"
good,"You get what you put into the work. Just feels either its really cut throat or the store makes it difficult for any advancement to occur. Definitely enjoyed the experiences received from activation, Nike + Run Club, and launch products."
good,"Superb working environment with a great team who are always there to support. My day consists of supporting the management, carrying out health and safety checks throughout the store and customer service. "
good,"Nike stores are awesome, so working there is pretty cool, too. Typical cashier responsibilities along with some folding/straightening of clothes. It was pretty cool to know the technology in most of the products. Management was okay, pretty bossy and unfriendly. The co-workers were awesome, as long as you are a sporty type person. The hardest part was knowing how to deal with customers who are confused, upset, etc. The most enjoyable part was the sweet discount they gave, especially when things are already on sale!"
good,"A typical day at work is fun and fairly enjoyable. I have learned to be a team player and to enjoy customer service. Being in a entry level management position, it has taught me the most valuable assets are knowledge and your co workers. Building great team work relationships makes the job that much better. The hardest part of the job has been knowing the team you build will one day disperse to do their own things in life and you will definitely have had a part in creating their new lives. It is just kind of hard knowing you will one day have to leave them as well due to growth and development."
good,"-Assist the Store Manager"
good,"great benefits, cool place to work, i repeat great benefits."
good,"In a typical day at work I'd come in and provide customer service, I learned to stock, help customers, and how to properly work a register. The most enjoyable part of the day was probably just being there and walking around helping customers."
good,A topical consist of meeting with a variety of consumers in the store and finding the best shoe and or clothing that will best fit their needs. With Nike everyone is an athlete.
good,"North America's Largest Distribution Center, 3rd largest in the world. Over 3million sq. ft. Great people great attitudes."
good,"This was my first job out of high school. At first I somewhat slow to start due to all the product knowledge I needed to gain but with proper time management and training I grew to learn the store inside and out. The team was always in good spirit and had high energy! The management was friendly but not really professional, but thats just for this store. The hardest part of the job was managing store organization and customer service."
good,"Management has declined over the past few years but the individuals that you work with are the heart and soul of your job experience. They work hard, keep the tempo and environment alive, and allow consumers and others to feed off of that energy. If it wasn't for the people working there the job wouldn't be anything like it is."
good,A typical work day would be me working on the register keeping the customers happy and keeping my section clean. I loved my team members they made working a lot easier.
good,With less customers to serve the less business. I learned that you to do your best regard less of the situation. have a good team work.
good,A typical day at Nike would consist of organizing and stocking clothing and shoes. the employees are managers were really nice
good,Fun fast paced environment with a chance to be part of a team. Sharing products and stories from the brand to loyal and new customers daily.
good,"Love the job, great environment. Relaxed, laid back environment.  Meet a lot of different people daily."
good,"A typical day at work usually consists of customer servicing the consumers that come by the shop and touching up the store during the down time. Having worked at Nike for almost 3 years, I have learned how to manage my time better and collaborating as a team. My coworkers are the most fun-loving people I can surround myself with because they have helped me grow as an individual over the last 3 years and made my day better when it is not going well. The hardest part of the job is dealing with the inconsistencies of the hours I am given per week. The most enjoyable part of the job is the ability to interact with the consumer that come by the store and informing them about the latest Nike products."
good,"*The most typical day at work is  varied rewarding and very busy."
good,Almost everyone tried to help each other out when there was a heavy work load or someone was learning some thing new. I enjoyed working with all the different departments to resolve any issues they may have had with their billing.
good,"Artigos Esportivos, acessórios, vestuários e equipamentos"
good,"Working at the flagship retail store, you get exposed to the latest and most exclusive products and activities. But management as a whole has an abundance of work to do. With the changing of available hours to the workplace its hard to be a student and balance out your scholastic career. Co-workers are the most fun and the best part of working here. You meet a variety of people, from around the country and the world. The hardest part is the hours on your feet and the micro managing, but that comes with working in retail."
good,"the day starts with updating sop and replenishing the store stocks following orders given by the superiors,"
good,Have a great R&D department. Product is often ahead of its time
good,From and day to day life at Nike its a great place to work overall.The managers are a nice.They get involved with you and are very helpful with whatever i need help with or my co workers need help with! My co workers are wonderful we all get along with one another.Were like a big family!!! My job isn't always easy but it isn't stressful  either.I  love that Nike is a stress free place and i like that they allow you to be you.There not a Discriminated work place.What i love most about Nike is that your working and your comfortable.And at the end of the day your satisfying your customers and they're leaving happy!.
good,"A typical day at work would be making sure that the department that you are in is filled. Also make sure that you are customer serving and acknowledge every customer that walk threw the doors,answering phones also to always smile and to be friendly. The management teams works well with the associates. The hardest part of the job sometimes is making the customer happy . I love talking to people and helping them find what there are looking for so they leave the store happy and will return at a later time."
good,Nike is a good company to work for. The Maxims and Brand Truths are the companies core vision and mission. Delegating and multi-tasking are a must for leadership and advancement.
good,"Aprendi a me comunicar melhor"
good,"A typical day at work is finding where you will be at In the store and get started. Really not much of the micromanagement there you have to know what to do and just do it. I enjoy working at the store because I love being around people, that simply keeps me busy helping them find what they need and time flys by some days. Would. It have changed this job for the world. It's worth it."
good,"We were asked to serve customers whenever and wherever possible. A positive vibe and strong connection with the customers in store wad required. I learned how to stay positive no matter what reaction or situation occurs through the customer and I also gained experience in dealing and engaging with customers."
good,"Fun work environment, friendly managers, easy place to work at, and its a great company to work for. Managers are very understanding and always willing to help."
good,"Dozen die aan mijn baan aankomen openen, kledingstukken uithalen en ophangen op een hanger en/of stikkers plakken."
good,Nice benefits but lower wages and not a lot of room for advancment
good,I loved working for Nike SA and if given the opportunity I would work there again however I would like a more permanent role.
good,too many people employed very short hours great management co-workers were helpful at times getting to help different people was definetly a plus to the job
good,You have to be comfortable with people you will be working with people all day long so if you don't know how to do that you might as well not work there. You will be asking if people need any help finding anything or ask them what they were looking for.
good,Its good but the work getting done is not compensated with the work i am doing
good,"I learned all about the different types of shoes and clothing that is produced by the brand. I learned how to be more social and how to communicate with peers and consumers. The management is a little iffy at times, but ultimately works together to get the job done. My co-workers were great; they never had any issues, and there was a great bond between them and myself. The job wasn't really hard because you had everything right in front of you, and instructed on what to do all the time. What I enjoyed most about the job is the experience you gain and all the friendships you create, as well as the growth in the company."
good,I learned how to build up management skills at Nike by talking to the managers everyday about the skills they use to manage a workplace.
good,"best work associates, long hours"
good,"Worked for Nike for 3 years at one point, it was a fun experience the management where nice and the people I worked with where awesome. Leaned a lot about the product, shoes, sports band and so forth. Dealt with all types of people while working there, definitely a learning experience. A good place to work for."
good,"I was given a temporary position at Nike that offered me the opportunity to learn new skills. Management wasn't perfect, but was a step up from what I'd experienced in most prior positions in that there was usually at least an effort made to work as a team and listen to all members of the team (not just those in management). Co-workers were passionate about their work, usually respectful of others, and generally made an effort to excel in their individual areas of responsibility. Finger-pointing when things went wrong, and trying to push through shoddy work when deadlines were tight were the worst behaviors I witnessed, and they were limited to a few individuals. One of the more challenging aspects of working at Nike is that their policy of hiring internally, and encouraging employees to stay in a particular role for only a few years at most, means that often times an entire group will be made up of individuals who have only been in their roles for a short time and are ""making it up as they go."" While this means there is a considerable amount of ""re-inventing the wheel"" and lost knowledge, it also means faster innovation as there is a constant influx of new people with new ideas. Unfortunately, Nike is engaging in the typical corporate strategy of using temporary labor / contractors to fill positions that are truly permanent and simply rotates individuals out after a year or so in order to avoid legal difficulties. After they could no longer extend my contract, due to the 1 year limitation, they asked me to train my replacement. There was no expectation that the position would"
good,"learned nike core values such as nike maxims"
good,I had worked for Nike for almost 10 years. I obtained many roles within this time frame. To pin point each one would be a lot to describe. Although I can say that overall each role is similar in the sense of the vision that the company and as a whole brand believes and looks at the story telling in the same way. A typical day at work for my last role within Marketing would have been a day to day presentation in meeting's reporting to both US and Global about seasonal campaigns that Nike as a Brand forcast future visions. Working with both my managment and co-worers were all a wonderful team to learn and grow from. The hardest part was maintaing the balance of last minute request and changing the agenda a minute before each meeting. The most enjoyable part of my job and many roles within Nike was the overall experience and life long learning I have now applied to all my new roles and personal life style.
good,"I began working for Nike on a three month contract; however, I stayed for nearly a year and a half. This was because both them and I were so happy working with each other."
good,"Azienda orientata al raggiungimento degli  obiettivi di cui ogni dipendente è responsabilmente coinvolto  e che ti premette di autogetire il lavoro in maniera autonoma, forte orientamento alla crescita professionale e al team work. Forte senso di appartenenza al brand."
good,"good place to work, advancement takes way to much time, longer than it should.good place to learn retail skill sets "
good,"Nike is a great company to work for, but, as with most retail operations, there was a disconnect between the stores and the corporate office. My job as shipping and receiving manager came with a staff that was too small for the high volume store I worked at, and a workload that was highly unrealistic. On an average day I would receive 200 to 600 boxes, all of which were required to go through a complicated and time consuming inventory check in and pricing process. The inventory process would not have been so bad if I had double the staff and was not also required to do many other duties in a day, sometimes requiring floor supervision which left me unable to complete any of my department tasks. I should have noticed the red flags when I found out they had gone through several S&R managers over the last couple years prior to my employment."
good,"There is no typical day at work because employees change sections constantly so that way they can become well-rounded in all aspects of the job. An employee can move from footwear to apparel or to registers and the stockroom. Management is actually very good, coworkers are friendly and helpful. There is no hard part because the job is actually very simple and is quite easy to learn. The hardest part would actually be setting up displays and moving product to the floor during store hours because it is very detail oriented, as well as time consuming. The most enjoyable part of the job would have to be helping a customer and seeing them leave the store truely satisfied with the product and with the customer service recieved."
good,Wonderful experience with fun activities . Especially we all enjoy ping pong games after work .
good,"A typical day at this employer was usually fun and exciting. All people played as team members and worked together to get a job done. Management was fair. My co-workers were great to be aroud, we were all like family."
good,"I was Sales Associate at Nike for two years. I learned a vast amount of information as far as product information, customer service, and sales."
good,"being a sales staff our duty is to provide a good customer service to each client, I learnd to gain more patience management they're cool, i had a good time with my colleagues... the hardest part of my job is when we are surviving to reach our target and I enjoy serving customer and reaching our monthly target..."
good,"A great place to work and learn the essentials of teamwork. Very customer oriented. Lots for product knowledge is important, and my be the hardest past retaining all the info that is provided. The most enjoyable part to satisfying a customer's need. Going above nd beyond to help with with whatever they need."
good,"Nike allowed their employees to work at their own pace, and consistently encouraged good work and coached through rough patches. Employees go into work, receive their assignment, and go to rolling on their job, nothing difficult about that. There are rough days where everything seems to go wrong, but the support system is great and they allow overtime to get the job done as necessary. The toughest part of the job was when the machines broke down after the mechanics left for the day. The easiest part of the job is when full staff handles all their end and the day runs smoothly. However, I was never a full Nike employee, just a temp through Kelly Services, which I didn't like. their management was terrible and disrespectful."
good,It is a great company to work for. i learned shoes are alot more than just style.
good,"My employer is very good company, but looking for a change. the work conditions are good as well my co-workers."
good,"Working at Nike, everyone was casually dressed, but they were all very devoted to getting the job done, and done well. Managers had a good rapport with their employees and ideas were easily shared, frequently resulting in very good solutions."
good,"My work experience, along with some of my closest colleagues today, could only be described as a phenomenal experience. However, the room for growth is setback when working at a normal retail store. I've also come to notice that management varies on the physical location of each store. Some would be able to describe the highest of regards towards one Manager, while others (including customers) felt polar opposite feelings towards other managers. All together I wouldn't have traded the two years working there for anything in the world, but in a lot of respects, my experience fell short due to very poor management and a lack in growth opportunities."
good,"Nike is a great place to work.  Passion and energy are a staple and love of sport and achieving greatness is a benchmark attitude.        "
good,The atmosphere at Nike is relaxed but also sales goal oriented. As long as goals are reached or exceeded there is no reason for work to not be enjoyable.
good,"It was a great job! I met plenty of people everyday that was nice and good sprit! You work a lot there because the number of employers there are super low, but they pay well."
good,"Its like Love and Hip Hop but with Athletes that couldn't make the team. The  store is huge and each floor had about 70 staff to itself. Its easy to get lost in all the noise sometimes, but you can always find different career routes there."
good,"Relaxed work place with multi cultured people."
good,"A typical day at work was a breeze, I worked no more than 6 hours a shift most of the time. I learned so much about connecting with customers and how to increase the chances of conversion. The management seemed honest and trustworthy. The workplace culture was ideal, as all of the co-workers were kind and respectful. The hardest part about the job was trusting the location. The most enjoyable part of the job was how much passion we put towards taking care of every customer's needs."
good,Great work hours great salary. Enjoyed working with the co workers. It  was an great job and i loved the people i work with.  Pay was great and hours were also
good,"Ambiente leve e confortável de se trabalhar, porem, comunicação da diretoria com o time de loja, existe muita oportunidade de melhoria."
good,I was able to work full time as a summer employee. It was really fun working in Nike Las Vegas. Summer league kept the store really busy so shifts went quick! Training was great and I loved working with my managers and co workers.
good,"It was fun good Pros and a few cons. Pretty flexible with school and holidays, great place to work if your young and like shoes. Started of making $9.50 ended making $11."
good,"it was a great company to work for at Nike, it was just the process of the transition phase that was difficult to deal with. Adecco didn't have any incentive programs, PTO etc. It was tough to transition from floor supervisor to an area manager even with your peers referral. I managed 35-60+ staff members in multiple areas daily and was the only positive feedback for the whole city of Memphis for Adecco and was acknowledged and rewarded by corporate. I loved the culture of the company."
good,"Une journée typique commence par la mise en place des produits dans le magasin, le réassort, les réceptions de marchandises et tout ce qui suit. Le stage que j'ai réalisé là bas m'a permit de développer mes compétences."
good,"Nike had a holiday calendar so every day of December we did and wore something different related to the holiday or something that was going on so everyone was included or way or another. Also, it was a fun environment to work with because you work with such a huge variety of people."
good,"I just couldn't see myself there in the future. It didn't look like there was a path to get to where I wanted to be and balancing school, sports, and a job is difficult. If I could have had more flexible timing for my schedule, I think I would have stuck it out but it was too time demanding."
good,Great Job for any one in college looking to build relationships and develop skill sets needed for future jobs as well as understanding the business aspect of the company.
good,My time workimg at nike was interesting had a great time working there had a great work experience with stuff exellent staff relation but problem in salary is not sustainable or comparable to the need of employees
good,"Great place to work at. They really care about you and make sure that you're happy and get the time off that you need whenever you need it. Nice people easy to get along with everyone never had any issues, and if you ever need help co-workers are always willing to help."
good,The work/Life balance is great and the pay is very competitive. There is however a discrepancy in the workload and expectations for mid-level management which drains the morale of individuals.
good,"ho lavorato per un anno e mezzo nel punto vendita nike store di Roma Termini, ed è un ambiente stimolante e che fa accrescere molto la maturità personale, anche solo per la facilità con la quale si apprende il livello minimo/medio di lingua inglese."
good,Nike is a good company to get your foot in the door at. They definitely hire more from within than without.Benefits are descent but not too many raises in pay
good,"Nike has a great atmosphere and great discount.  Availability requirements are not the best, but managers are typically willing to work around our schedule. Overall my favorite part time job so far."
good,The management is phenomenal. All of the staff is friendly and welcoming and makes work a great time. You get recognized for hard work and those who do their job well are appreciated.
good,"Most days were the same getting to work and find out what location I was at whether it was register or shoe department, we would grab our mobile device and head to our location and try to help out customers looking around. The hardest part of the job was trying to help a customer find something else when we did have what they were looking for, the most enjoyable part was making new friends and all having the same interests."
good,"Work hard, play hard. Pockets of amazing people and opportunity, pockets of leadership that cultivate a cult of personality. If you hustle and manage yourself you can learn tons and get great experience. The politics weigh on a lot of people, and can create some career dead-ends."
good,A typical day at nike would be slow paced during the week but very fast during the weekend and new apparel releases. The nike location i was at was located in lenox mall which attracts a vast amount of consumers from all around the world. I would meet many different people every day assisting them with purchases and teaching them about the new technollogy and innovations.
good,Working with the company is fine. Working with managers who only care about the job is the problem.People have real issues going on and it's more about the job and getting the work.
good,"Good company to work for, great benefits and work/life balance"
good,"Nike is truly a brand that creates new ways to tackle the fashion industry, while at the same time evoking a feeling of nostalgia. Working for this company one learns how one small company that started with a dream and became the innovating powerhouse that it is today. Everyone is dedicated to the brand, from management to all the workers within the company. Nike is truly a team oriented company that bonds people together. It was truly an experience working for them that I will never forget and the opportunities and skills I learned starting from the bottom moving up are ones that I will carry with me for a lifetime."
good,"stocking floor and receiving shipment, organizational and communication skills, hard working and fun environment to be around, sharing a passion of history and innovation with a great brand."
good,"Ive worked at nike for a year now, love the job. I was part time, enjoyed my time as a part time employee, looking for something more full time now.  Loved"
good,High emphasis on serving customers and showing brilliant customer service which serving multiple consumers. Learn the technologies of shoes and give recommendations. Great benefits
good,"Nike was easy money, everything was self explanatory. The work was simple and the hours were more of the same, unless I would go in for over time which was always a bonus"
good,"Had fun working there most of the time. Managers are great... THey believe in trying to get you to move up in the company if you put in the work. Pay is horrible but it is retail so you can't expect much. Overall, good job."
good,I have been working from past 18 years because I'm not getting good growth in my salary's I'm very hard worker not taken more leaves hardly I have take my weekly offs and I'm settled in Delhi with my family's need a good salary's so I can do my job without any tension
good,"I worked the weekend shift, Friday through Sunday, 12 hours a day. In the beginning weeks I never worked a full shift. We always got off early. The breaks were too short."
good,"Nike was an amazing place to work but it is extremely busy and intense. I worked in GA and Orlando and I loved working for Nike in GA. Once I moved to Orlando it was totally different. I was a manager at a large volume store and the hours, stress and workload was too much. This company knows how to get the most out of its employees but leaves them hollow and a shell of their former selves when they leave. Management was great in GA, but horrible in Orlando."
good,"Scheduling is fair, hours are good for part time. Mostly college students working there so the work environment is pretty fun. There are lots of tasks to do throughout the day, try to accomplish ALL and you’ll do great."
good,"Nike was a great place to work for in high school. When I graduated I was one of the oldest people working there. Most of the employees were high schooler. I had a child and left in 2017, was great up until then."
good,We would clock in around 4:30pm . Scheduled to work a 9 to 10 hour shift.  Most days the cooling system would go out . Hours did not match the rate of pay .
good,It was a decent job that enjoyed the time i was there. It is a great environment and Inwould recommend the job to anyone. Nike has one of the best jobs out there.
good,Great place for first time job after you graduate. Great place to shop for back to school gear and shoes. great discounts for you and your family. Good job to prosper from
good,"Would work here again, very fast paced but good work, helping customers was a pleasant experience. Lots of expectations from management definitely not a job if you’re lazy"
good,"Nike offers more breadth and depth of opportunities in every area of athletic and athleisure product creation and marketing than you can imagine. Especially in the area of digital experience you have a chance to contribute to world-class projects and work with top-tier creative professionals."
good,My job consist of Data Entry and monitoring  employees and also I worked folding table which conducted production. When asked to stay for overtime no complaints by me.
good,Nike is a good company to work.  It is a very multicultural company and the office are very nice in Hilversum Sportpark.
good,"Made a lot of new friends, decent pay, management is okay just a few people can be annoying. I would work here again but as a summer job! Pay raises ever 6 months as long as you pass your CFE's which are easy."
good,If you like not just having co-workers but feeling like a family Nike is the place to work. Nike environment is a great atmosphere if you like meeting new people and helping them find the comfort they need.
good,"It was a super productive and fun environment where the motto ""Just do it!"" is embedded in all staff. The office allows the staff to have their own exercise activities and encourages the staff to be fit. They incentived the staff by providing footwear, clothes wear to encourage a healthy lifestyle"
good,This is a good job for high school kids. On your feet all day you can not sit down. The leads talk to you crazy. And you will get fired for any little thing.
good,"I enjoy working for Nike, they have great benefits and treat you like an adult with a life outside of work. Opportunities for advancement exist in some jobs, but not all based on how many people are in that field and if the company is actually hiring. Compensation can be competitive, but you have to know you're worth and be able to prove your worth to leadership. Most managers try to show appreciation to their team, and encourage growth."
good,Working at Nike allowed me to earn status with the company at a young age. Help me learn customer service skills and more. Understanding that working with a team will allow ones job to be a lighter load and allow the company success in sales. I take all these skills given to me and apply them to my everyday life.
good,Working with Nike was fun and energetic. Things were simply explained from the beginning and management was with me every step of the way helping me to succeed and feel confident.
good,I didn't receive the benefits of a fulltime employee. But as a temp. The management and coworkers were professional and always helpful. I give this company two thumbs up.. And have nothing bad to say... Thanks for the time of employment.
good,"A typical day at work was very routine, I would definitely recommend this job to anyone that enjoys a relaxed but fast paced work environment and sorting, The 12 hour days were kind of rough, and then off 4 days. Not bad but I had weekend shift, Over all it was a nice place to work."
good,Everybody had a good attitude manager was understanding and kind a very clean and comfrotable work environment everybody did their job and was on the ball with getting organized and receiving truck shipments.
good,"For those who are looking for a supplementary source of income, Nike is for you! The climate of the workplace is pretty quick-paced, especially behind the register, but it's easy to find moments to slow down and regroup. "
good,"-Generally stable and predictable day-to-day job"
good,"is nice to work and chill."
good,Great environment to work in. We had great leaders pushing our team past comfort zones to get more sales. The managers are very understanding if you have a time conflict with work and adapt schedules to meet everyone's wants and needs.
good,"Con questa societa' (Percassi Group ) che mi ha assunto nel 2015,sono sempre stato bene sotto il punto di vista lavorativo e forse meno umanamente.Mi ha formato tanto sotto l aspetto personale e professionale ,seguendo sempre target e obiettivi giornalieri, c'era poca opportunità di crescita nel mio periodo di lavoro."
good,Great place to work as college student but not a lot of advancement in to social enterprise. Really enjoyed the culture around basketball and sports. More advancement into Nike's social enterprise area.
good,"The most enjoyable part of working at Nike Town is the diverse cultures. Being able to be around and serve the consumers, putting a smile on their faces."
good,Working at Nike gave me the ability to work in a diverse fast paced environment. Work was always fun to go to just because I knew every time I go to work It would be a different experience and you never knew what or could walk in there since where I worked is a tourist attraction celebrities would walk in unexpectedly in there all the time I would say that is the most enjoyable but the hardest not even the most hardest and annoying part of the job is closing on a busy day just because they come in and trash the store and it takes forever to try and reorganize it for the Morning.
good,"I worked at the Nike Factory Store in Round Rock while I was still in high school, yet Nike presented the opportunity for me to be flexible with my hours while providing great pay. You're able to work with a very diverse and cultural group, as everybody has the passion that propels them forward. It was very enjoyable to help customers and individuals find that exact product they were looking for, but dealing with those who didn't understand the business was very frustrating as they did not know how the store itself worked, and put the blame on you because you were in front of them. Overall it was a great environment, and even though it could get very strenuous with it being retail, I don't regret a single second."
good,"-Very welcoming environment "
good,"Nike is a high paced environment so brining your a game every workday was a must. working consisted of loading and unloading products to the sales floor. Everythign must be done in a timely fashion because there will eventually be another truck coming in the next 1 hour or so. Also, I had experience on the cash register when the register was low on staff. Honestly the back of house athletes are the most versatile of the whole store because we can do it all with no questions asked."
good,good place to work and the folks are nice to work with. I love the Nike shoes for reduced prices. Nike location was great however the weather does make you depressed at times
good,"Great work environment and awesome discounts, but pay is not great. It us one of the only few jobs that I have had that I did not dred at the thought of coming to work."
good,"If you like sports this job is for you. You clock in and its sports. You go throughout you day, SPORTS. All in all sports is nike and so are all the people there."
good,"During my 18 years with Nike, I learned a lot, developed so many relationships both professional and personal."
good,"This was my first job so I learned a lot during my time there.  The staff, management and environment was a great place to work and i thoroughly enjoyed my time working at the store."
good,Work with very satisfied colleagues and in a fast pace environment. Not that stressful.  The management team would take your personal factors into consideration and were compromising. The job is not very demanding just requires a fast worker.
good,"Despite the long hours, you were constantly busy working so the day went by fast. Everyone there is very helpful and friendly. Lunch was awesome, there was ping pong, great freshly made food you could buy if you didn't bring a lunch."
good,"In nike , it is the job where everyone wants to.. Specially to the persons who have passion and love all the clothes and shies that nike offer. Just do it."
good,"Easy job for students, parents, as well as seniors."
good,"Nike is slowly branching out into the sportswear world. Involving its everyday sportswear pieces with running and training. Nike is now on a different playing filed than other athlesuire companies. At my particular store, management is good but there isn't a lot of room to grow."
good,"My day at work would consist of serving and approaching customers meeting their needs and expectations on a daily basis, putting out delivery and maintaining standards on the shop floor."
good,"There was never a dull moment from the beginning to the end of my shifts at Nike. The environment was very fast paced, due to the popular location. Employees were quick to adapt, and made sure every guest left happy.  I had excellent relationships with my managers, they definitely took wonderful care of us."
good,"For a retail job, it ranked in my top 5. I enjoyed working at the store and  the people I worked with made the experience so much better. There was room for growth if you were looking for it and you were well informed about what you were selling."
good,It is a very competitive work place amongst co workers and it makes it a very lovely one to learn new things about the company every day. It is a very dependable place and it relies a lot on commitments.
good,"The environment was very laid back and people were easy to work with; however, half the managers did not take to necessary time to couch you or provide worth while tips to help you succeed and advance in the company."
good,You work with good people and you have fun with activities and little competitions given. And you become a family with the department your in. Good company.
good,"福利好：員工供股折扣及年尾雙糧"
good,"Nike is a good employer, they offer competitive wages and benefits. A typical day, with the right crew and management was a fun day, that didn't feel like work. From the moment you walk in, you are showered with a lot of facts and information about Nike and Nike products that the average person would not know. Nike gives you all the tools and knowledge needed to jump start your career with the company."
good,"Management and employee's found a way to make the workday enjoyable while also maintaining focus on daily goals. Throughout the week there were special dress days where we would dress up following a theme like NFL Sunday where you could wear NFL themed clothing (Jersey's, hats, shirts etc.) Overall a great company to work for"
good,productive fast pace easy dress code would recommend the job to another individual. could use better pay and better benefits but overall decent place of work
good,"I learned a lot of the different products that they offer, therefore, passing that information to the customers.  Management was always helpful with whatever the employees needed.  The work atmosphere was very positive.  The hardest part of the job was trying to satisfy the customer when they were being a bit impossible to please.  At the end, they would leave with great products.  The most enjoyable part of my job was being able to inform the customers of the benefits of the Nike products."
good,Not your typical retail job. Higher expectations from Management and consumers. Must be ready to work in a fast paced environment and versatility is a must!
good,They found it hard to work around my university. This is do to having a high staff turn over and not enough employee to cover the hours need by the shop.
good,"Great place to work! Opportunities for advancement but I wasn't there long enough to experience that. Management I thought was unreasonable at times, and looking back I would've like to receive more training- otherwise a great company!"
good,A ton of mid shifts that take up the entire day. 12-10 and 11-8 are very common shifts while many days you are forced to stand in your zone because there is little traffic. Always seemed either understaffed or overstaffed. The managers and fellow employees were always great though.
good,"I worked full time with Nike for two years and learned a lot there in my time. Biggest lesson I came away with was that it's really up to you to make the most of the job. It was a fun environment for me and I enjoyed having great coworkers. Some of the management could do better with regards to providing good constructive feedback to help you grow and develop your own skills, but you'll experience that at most retail stores one way or another at some point."
good,Nike is a great company if one is looking to advance their career in a short period of time.   There are plenty of perks associated with working for Nike.
good,"Nike was a Great job, the most enjoyable part is probably at the end of the day when you find out that the sale number goals were met and I learned how to be patient wit customers and about how Nike was more than just a brand."
good,Project management at Nike is about networking and marketing/communicating leadership's ideas effectively. It's a highly competitive environment and only the people who are best at marketing their ideas will be heard or have the opportunity to advance.
good,Working at Nike is a great experience. You get to interact with so many new people and get to make great friendships with the customers. The staff is great and the management is well organized.
good,"a typical work day is fast-paced and very productive there's always something to do rather its tending to consumers or maintaining the cleanliness of the sales floor with the help of your co-workers as well as, management team. The workplace is altogether a great place to meet new people with different backgrounds and make new friends. The job itself isn't hard, instead it's tedious and repetitive, but all around its a great atmosphere with great people who make you feel welcomed, great product for consumers to purchase, but best of all excellent benefits for employees."
good,All’interno dello store di appartenenza si respirava una bellissima aria positiva dovuta ai dipendenti giovani e sportivi e alla gestione dei manager.
good,Nike has the best work culture I've encountered so far. Management is very attentive to employee needs and is open to change. Nike is a great place to work!
good,"Good Job I just didn't like how employs treated each other and how things where being handled, I feel like that environment is more for the younger crowd."
good,"Worked as a summer job, Very easy with very fun people to work with. Managers are very helpful and relatable. Best part about the job is the benefits. discounts and access to employee only website are very nice."
good,"If you are about sports or fitness, this is a really fun place to work. The employees are all fun to work with. You can be trained front of house, back of house and get a feel for most positions in the store."
good,"En general  muy buena empresa para trabajar, buenos horarios"
good,"Un ambiente muy dinámico , aprendizaje diario tanto comercial como personal, la empresa te ayuda mucho."
good,nike was ok the same thing usually gets a little busy but a ok place to work sometimes it gets a little busy and other days are sometimes slow nike is not all bad
good,"J'ai appris à organiser des activités et inculquer une certaine mentalité à un jeune groupe de filles. "
good,Everybody collaborated and worked together to meet goals. The managers made work a fun experience and they are very caring and supportive. It was overall a great experience.
good,"Nike is an exciting place to work as not everyday is the same whilst promoting and testing new products in aid to better the customer service experience. "
good,"Comprised mostly of contractors, all vying for only few full-time spots.  Very demanding user-base, but all of the hard work pays off and is satisfying,"
good,"Nike is a great place to work with unlimited potential for career advancement depending on your area of expertise. The work environment is young, progressive, and competitive."
good,"El día a día con el equipo humano que me tocó en la oficina de Madrid, (comerciales, marketing , directores...) basándose en la colaboración, compromiso y la actitud positiva, han sido un ejemplo de que cada miembro de la oficina es muy importante para ayudar a que la empresa esté donde está hoy y se llegue a los objetivos."
good,"Overall working for Nike is fun. The people are great, the service is great. The managers for the most part are understanding. The only part that sucks is that even though Nike is  a multibillion company they still cut hours at the location i worked at to were most employees only worked 1-2 days a week for the past month."
good,"This job rocks if you like to have fun AND work, but if you intend to go into work and chill, this isn't the place for you. Expectations are high, and you're held to them, but management is always willing to work with you."
good,Buon ambiente di lavoro giovane e dinamico. Buone possibilità di crescita.
good,One of the best jobs I ever. Love this place. Great managers and a great place to work at. Started as a seasonal worker and became a full time employee.
good,The Company is nice great benefits. Good discount deals. Great giveaway. Nice newly built cafe and gym. Coworkers can be very messy. But overall nice company.
good,"A typical work day could vary with Nike being a multi-billion dollar company. I learned a lot of things from Nike like teamwork, the importance of community outreach, and the importance of sport and health. The only downside I have seen working here is management can sometimes be tone deaf to the needs and wants of the employees they are overseeing. Management also can sometimes be inconsistent with the policies they implement and also fail to effectively communicate with not only their employees but also the other members of management which leads to some clunky meetings and missteps. Overall the actual workplace environment is very positive fast paced and competitive."
good,"Really fun staff and really good culture, just not advancing the right people that i believe should be getting promoted. These people work really hard and put there life into there work but get pushed aside."
good,Best management team ever. everyone there was like family to me and work was easy. No pressure to do anything that i felt uncomfortable doing and I could talk to management about my personal problems and they would understand if i needed a few days off.
good,"Fast paced, cut throat, matrix organization that can be as fun to work at as frustrating. Brand passion is infectious, but can blind some internally.  Innovation and Sport are at the heart of the company.  Extremely competitive internally and externally.  On average within headquarters, you won't truly grasp the complexity of vastness of the organization until 18 months.  Don't expect management to own your career path, you're ability to network and navigate internally with peers and leaders as well as having a proven track record of successes will drive your long term career arc at Nike."
good,work place was very relaxed dealing with customers working on customer service and dealing with customer relations on a daily basis. the most enjoyable part of the job was helping customers find the exact product that they need.
good,"Meet a lot of different people "
good,A typical day includes serving customers and aiming to make customers happy. I learned to use tills and operate fitting rooms. The management encouraged us to work efficiently and towards a daily target. They made work fun whilst keeping it professional.
good,"venice/los ángeles office is where the magic happens, where creative breeds. midwest/HQ is more standard agency life. nice people, good clients with decent projects"
good,Nike is a dominate in the sport retail industry and it's a really laid back place to work. Everyone that works knows they have to do their job and everyones super helpful. It's a pretty chill place to work. I only did part time.
good,Good company for young people. Opportunity to advance.  Opportunity to move in with company in USA and out of USA. Opportunity grow and move within different jobs.
good,"Excellent environment, energetic, creative, a little too informal sometimes, freedom to work by goals on your own way."
good,"Fast pace, 'Just Do It' attitude needed for this high octane environment. "
good,This was a fun and relaxed place to work but always busy so you were always occupied and they were very good about hours and management and money if you wanted a raise
good,"Jong bedrijf met gedreven werknemers. Veel enthousiasme op de werkvloer en gezonde onderlinge competitie. Faciliteiten die een aangename werkomgeving creeren zoals sportschool, employee store met korting, 3 restaurants, eigen Starbucks."
good,"Muy buena marca, los empleados son muy importantes para la empresa, siempre al pendiente del empleado"
good,"The Job overall was good. You got to meet new people and learn a lot from the brand and that is something I will cherish. The managers really believe in working together and are involved with the community whenever they can get the chance."
good,"Working at Nike was fun. Typical retail job. Most employees of Nike have  a true passion for Nike brand products. Everyone enjoys the discount they offer. Especially family members. Hours are typical retail hours, they very. Like most retail jobs, they are open most holidays which makes it tough to get a holiday off."
good,Nike was a fun place to work at in the beginning. But everything started changing when they started hiring new managers. Super disrespectful. not professional.
good,It is a enjoyable place to work at. You have some people their days where they don't get their work done at a time frame. The break room and restroom very clean and neat.
good,"Great place to work.  Loved the fast paced environment, and the consumers.  If you like the atmosphere of a team, you will enjoy working at Nike.  Every thing they do is premium!!"
good,"You always had to greet clients well. Understand client’s needs"
good,The job was very fast pace because work had to be complete in a timely manner. management was overall good. Information was given in a timely manner. The hardest part would be some different personalties.
good,"You work hard and are rewarded for hard work."
good,"productive, fun,, quick paced work site,,,customer interaction is incredible,,and sports is the love of all athletes professional or not..great management..felt wanted there"
good,En este trabajo adquirí nuevas técnicas de venta. Equilibrar el número de clientes que visitaban la tienda con el número de ventas. Aumentar la venta complementaria. Buen conocimiento del producto para conectar lo mejor posible con las necesidades de búsqueda y satisfación de los clientes. Encargarme de que la compra y la venta se una buena experiencia y afiliar a los clientes.
good,"The hardest part of my job is, trying the speak Spanish to our consumers that doesn't speck any English. After awhile you start to pick up on learning how to speak Spanish."
good,I truly enjoyed working for the company. I was unfortunate to have a terrible Store manager that left me with a tainted name in the company which is why I departed. I would love to return to Nike and pick up where I left off with my career.
good,Manager was flexible; great team of ETW's supporting each other to get the work done. No dress code except must not wear competitors' brands.  Had credentials and laptop ready to go on the first day!
good,This is a great place to work. The biggest con I can think of is that promotional opportunities are competitive and difficult. They require you to build your own network and find your own mentors to get the next job.
good,"Working for the #1 brand in the world is an honor. It really boils down to management and regular athletes. If everyone is on the same page regarding the overall success of the store, it'll be all good. Since there are employees who come to work just to get a paycheck or just to enjoy the perks, the environment can get a bit more challenging. I'm passionate about putting a smile on a consumer's ( Young or experienced) face and therefore I enjoy my position a bit more than others."
good,"Nike is one of the most innovative and competitive company across the world, the culture at Nike is very open and inclusive, passion for sports and teamwork is central to all the success that Nike has achieved so far. "
good,An excellent job for getting accustomed to new sports products and equipment with the leading apparel company in the world. Get to learn about new technologies and products and see them first hand. Great place for sharing your sports stories with consumers.
good,"Working at Nike has a lot of fun activities, learning opportunities, and Nike community events to participate in.  Nike's WHQ campus is very beautifully landscaped.  Nike employees can join the corporate gym on-site, with an in-door swimming pool.  There are a lot of sport teams to get involved with, such as golf, soccer, etc.  A lot of people take their lunch time to exercise, jogging around campus.  There are a lot of sporting events and opportunities to meet with the Nike athletes on campus.  There are often team building or learning opportunities with games and competitions to show off your creativity and skills and win some prize.  It's a great work environment for enthusiastic, energetic, and out-going people.  Some teams may supply snacks and a ping pong table to enjoy during a short break from work.  The challenge of working at Nike is to manage your time, to get work done well, to have fun, and to have a life outside of work."
good,Nike is a great place to work but by having a customer driver company especially the .com part you do not have a work life balance. It is very hard to work all the hours and not have time to spend it with the family.
good,The company as a whole is huge which can be intimidating.  But working within your category and team shows you that the work you do is important.  I have been very lucky with the categories I've gotten to work with while contracting at Nike.  I love how they support and physical fitness and equal rights for all.
good,"Great work environment , management isn't the best , kind of disorganized , co workers are a huge pro . Team atmosphere is always high which makes it fun to work"
good,Oversaw Womens' and Children apparel.Was in charge of changing displays every 2 weeks and making sure shipment was correct. Oversaw meetings with fellow managers.
good,"Nike has good company environment,management ad work place. i love to work there"
good,"- Work was always busy"
good,The Nike store is a great place. It thought me how to work in a team and make me a team player. I have learned how to handle customers in a positive way. The workplace and the work culture is impeccable. The most enjoyable part of the job was seeing a customer satisfied and happy.
good,"Great team environment to be apart of. Good hours, and 50% off benefit is really nice. It is very face paced, and is often very busy. All around, I felt that it was great experience."
good,"es buena empresa, el ambiente es un poco frió pero es agradable tabajar para una empresa internacional"
good,"I have a wonderful time working at Nike Swim Camp every summer alongside an NCAA Divison I swim coach. I enjoy meeting campers and helping them develop their skills in the pool, during dryland, and nutritionally."
good,"I worked with a group of very smart people, but I had some concerns about the way projects were managed. They say agile, but it is a very weird combination of waterfall and agile. Which makes testing / deployment a fun process..."
good,"Trabalhei durante 2 anos e 7 meses na empresa. Entrei como estoquista temporário em um período de grande importância para a empresa (Copa do Mundo) e acabei gostando muito de lá por conta de seu ambiente descontraído. Por conta do meu desempenho, apareceu oportunidades de crescimento em 3 meses e novamente depois de 11 meses. "
good,"Learned a lot about the culture of Nike while working there along with the history and technology behind every product. It made me appreciate Nike items more and I adopted the work attitude to everyday life. Overall, great experience."
good,"Working for Nike showed me, diversity and having premium service is a great thing to have in life. Helping others as I was, put a new attitude in my life."
good,"Of all the jobs that I have ever had, working at Nike Factory was hands down my favorite. The people; management, and my fellow coworkers were great with welcoming me onto their teams and helping to make me feel comfortable."
good,Nike is a great place to work.  The environment is very welcoming. You have plenty of opportunities to grow. It's all perfect for college students who are looking for extra inform while pursuing other dreams.

good,Nike has been a interesting start into the retail world for me. The brand itself is one I have been connected to for years and working for them has been very entertaining because the people are lovely and the environment is very positive and upbeat.
good,"Boa empresa,fornece os treinamentos adequados, entende quando se passe por uma dificuldade pessoal, dão o suporte necessário para promoção (alterar cargo), te proporciona  grande aprendizado no varejo."
good,"I love the Nike brand and the products. I worked at an awesome store with great product and a great team. Not every store is the same though. Your managers and team make or break the job. The discounts are awesome, though!"
good,Nike is a powerhouse for sports footwear and apparel. It is a productive work environment and your always interacting with customers making them feel like their time is valued. We work and communicate as team to be able to meet our daily goals. The energy there is always delightful.
good,"Nike was a nice place to work. The job was not complicated but did require you to lift and carry boxes up to 40 pounds. The benefits offered  by the company are some of the best I have seen. This is a great place to work with opportunities for advancement. Once you understand the mission, actions of managers are better understood. The hardest part of the job for me was the standing for a 10 hour shift with one 15 minute break."
good,"We had a team huddle every morning. I learned a lot about the different products Nike has to offer, also how to lead my team when necessary. I gained more organization skills and overall enjoyed my time working there."
good,"Bonne entreprise, travail intense mais intéressent, beaucoup de stress mais de réeles perspectives d'évolution( au sein du magasin, siège France, siège Europe)."
good,Nike is a very nice company to work for with excellent benefits. The salary is competitive with other companies. I work on 3 day work week with four days off. The workplace is nice especially with the new break rooms we have. The hardest part of the job is being up for twelve hours at night. What I enjoy the most is the perks we receive throughout the year.
good,"Good place to work, amazing team that worked there good work/life style balance, hardest part was seasonal change, Good management"
good,"dynamisme, une équipe extraordinaire ! Une réel motivation chaque matin, avec un cri de guerre qui entraîne l'équipe à donner le meilleur de sois !"
good,"This job wasn't only repetitive it made my mind stronger. 12 hour shifts of doing the same thing can be boring but the pay was worth it. "
good,"Really fun to work at! Awesome people within the store, as well as those who shop there. paced but in a good way. Teaches you new things everyday, all you have to do is ask!"
good,"I learned how to be organized and keeping the store nice and tidy. I oversaw the format of the store and helped organize the traffic flow. I also would show off the manikins with our new products and would promote those to customers. My co-workers were very nice and kept the job enjoyable. The management at NIKE was very supportive and interested in my personal development. The most enjoyable part of the job was how I got along with everyone and I was able to be myself there. The hardest part of the job would be the hours given to the staff, we were understaffed so our hours given to us was hard to work around."
good,"A great company to work for, with great staff ethos, staff benefits and training. The Company could listen more to its staff members on some issues..."
good,"I loved this job. Nike is always looking for ways to update product knowledge so employees can easily sell their product. Great advancement opportunities, if that is what you're looking for."
good,"Loved working there. I learned better ways to interact with people. Management was dependable, understanding, and guided me properly. Most enjoyable part of the job was being in my favorite brand store."
good,"* Not a typical work routine "
good,"3 Day weekend"
good,"Overall, a great retail job. They really take care of you there, and it's a fun environment. I would say that it's a great place to have your first job, but if you feel that you are not growing there, talk to management and they will guide you in the right direction."
good,Working at Nike was quite fun as I enjoyed working with my co-workers and dealing with customers. I settled in pretty quickly as the store managers and fellow sales reps were kind and taught me what i needed to know. The sales targets are not easy to reach and I needed to put in the work and improve my sales skills everyday. The work does get pretty tiring as I had to stand for hours on end but the satisfaction of satisfying a customer is worth it
good,Basically the work isn't too hard. The other employees help you and  wont allow you to do all the work by yourself. The most enjoyable part of the job was the hour long breaks.
good,Great work environment.  Data entry and analyst work. Community environment.  I was an intern for the planning team of Nike.  I learned a lot about the Distribution part of Nike.
good,"Boa empresa em todos os aspectos, um lugar agradável onde todo mundo tem um espírito de equipe,recomendo"
good,"like sports - you need to have a keen focus on the challenges, solid gameplan, a good team around you, and strong competitive nature to thrive here."
good,Learned a great deal due to the diversity of workers and work experience. Lots of talented people and structured in a way to help people succeed. Hardest part of the job was adjusting to director shifting to different business unit and having new leadership come in.
good,"The retail side of the business is very cookie cutter as far as promoting from within. It is a west coast based business, so east coast corporate advancement is very hard. Most likely will be in retail stores for a long time. However the company does do a great job of recognizing their employees and they put people first."
good,Veel productkennis en productinformatie. Werkt in een leuk jong en gemotiveerd team.
good,"The hardest part of the job is not having weekends off. We are suppose to be allowed at least one weekend off a month but that doesn't usually happen. My typical day at work is clocking in then going to the sales floor to provide the legendary customer service that I was trained to do and also show new athletes what that looks like and train them on new technologies of shoes and apparel. The most enjoyable pat of the job is just that its Nike, it's a great company with good benefits."
good,"I loved the people I worked with - it make a world of a difference considering this was not at all the career path I was interested in pursuing.  The managers were wonderful and considerate, as well as the coworkers.  As it was a very structured company and environment, everything was ""by the book""."
good,"Every day you can be given different tasks, is a really fun job. I learned to talk to costumers and I also gained confidence talking to costumers. My co-workers were excellent, they vibe a work was a positive one all the time ."
good,A typical day at work would be a busy day helping customers. Learnd teamwork makes the dream work. Management wasn't bad. Co workers we hard workers that wanted to build and grow with the company
good,As a maintenance technician you will find yourself working on many team projects and individual projects.  You can get job satisfaction and a since of accomplishment as you apply your maintenance skills.
good,"En tant que vendeuse, le commencement de la journée de travail se fait par un debrief de la journée précédente ainsi que des objectifs de la journée. Le poste de vendeuse est polyvalent, selon la journée et les besoins je pouvais être placée au stock, en renfort caisse ou sur le ""floor"". La fermeture du magasin consiste à rester entre 30 minutes et 1 heure afin de rendre le magasin comme neuf. L'ouverture du magasin consiste à remplir les rayons."
good,While on the floor you are either helping customers or making sure the product is looking good and organized. I was able to learn a lot about working with other co-workers as well as providing good customer service.
good,"nike's great. "
good,"A typical day at work of course I would clock in and every shift a manger would do a jump start with us. In the jump start we were basically told what was going on in the store, what we needed make (money wise), what the goal target was for that day and week. We also review the customer ratio, how many customers came in the store verses how many of them actually purchased. At Nike I learned a lot, from the typical training they did with us, such as learning the different types of apparel and footwear. I also learned how to work the register because everyone had to be trainer as a cashier just in case they were short on employees. My co-workers were nice, I never came across any issues or problems. To me there wasn't really a hard part about working at Nike, I really loved and enjoyed everything about it."
good,"The working environment was spectacular. I was blessed to work with a group great coworkers and management. Nike helped sharpen my communication and sales skills. Nike challenged me to better myself and to push my limit. Nike also taught me how to ask the right questions in order connect with the consumer and their needs. A few consumers made the job tough at times but it was not anything manageable. Overall, the job was a fun job."
good,"Bonne entreprise,bonnes perspectives d'évolution et de bons avantages."
good,my co workers were so fun and helpful. love it and enjoyed it the management were great and didn't find anything to prevent me being great at this job.
good,"I wish I could have stayed with the company longer, due to some unforseen life changes I was unable to do so. "
good,a very enthusiastic work place that leaves room for growth within the company. A place where you are constantly on your toes trying to achieve the highest for of customer service.
good,"respeto, liderazgo, trabajo en equipo, participación de los atletas en mejoras de atención y servicio a todos los clientes."
good,"Nike was by far one of the best employers I've had, they really take care of their employees.It's really hard to have a bad day when you work with such a large diverse group of employees,"
good,"I learned a vast number of things from nike, it was hard work in shipping and receiving in back of house but I enjoyed my experience there."
good,"Existe un buen equilibrio entre la vida privada y laboral del trabajador. El salario es el básico, sin embargo, las comisiones por ventas son las mejores, muy bien dadas. Cumplen con la entrega de todos los beneficios de ley. Relativa estabilidad laboral y no mucha facilidad de promoción. Acertada administración y buen clima y cultura laboral."
good,Working at Nike is a great first retail job. You learn about the product and everything it's made of. You learn how communicate with new people on the spot. Makes you are friendlier approachable person. I learned many new skills with different type of people and customer sales. I learned how to multi- task and happen to be very well at it. The Co- workers are really friend and open to help and share knowledge. The management is fun and always a joy and excitement to go to work. The hardest part is to deal with customer complaints and to help them find better product. The most enjoyable part of the job is that you meet the most random people and you learn a little more about them and gain future knowledge on how to communicate and speck with similar people. Making friends are easy since everyone is so nice.
good,es muy buena empresa que se preocupa por que los empleados aprendan mas y estén en constante capacitacion
good,"Great and full of energy company, full of inspiration and innovations. One of greatest experiences I ever had, seen a lot and learned a lot. This is a company which takes most of your time, doesn't leave space for life outside. Great company to work for and learn but not for long time. Overall I am very happy that I was part of Nike family but I think its time for me to move on."
good,heb voor al geleerd om in team te werken.samen met zeer fijne collega's
good,A very busy store to work at but coworkers and management make it  fun job. Relationships with coworkers and management are also very good. Not a very personal relationship with customers type of job but was easy to make conversation with customers on a personal level. Most enjoyable was getting to meet so many people at work at the relationships built with colleagues. The store was also always hiring so it was sometimes difficult to get to know everyone that worked there. Since there was a lot to learn everyone got to learn something new from each other especially from management that helped our customer service with consumers. There was always something different to do each day so it was fun to take on new projects throughout the store.
good,Fun great work place. good way to educate yourself on how to sell sholes and the history of nike. where the shoe comes from and where the nike swoosh logo comes from.
good,Our work is centered around customers and product. Everyone is open to helping each other. I love being able to interact with customers who need their questions answered.
good,"Nike was a fun place to work at, but the management could have been better. There were times when I had to stay 2 hours after my shift to get things done. If the store was managed better, some of these things could have been avoided. Overall, it was not a bad place to work out."
good,"My typical day:  Multiple meetings, stakeholder influencing and networking, team 121s and coaching sessions, global conference calls."
good,"Always something new going on when you clock on for the day, friendly and helpful co workers, management is very willing to work around your schedule whether it's for school or another job. "
good,"As a boy I remember looking up to Michael Jordan and famous athletes everywhere. I had been a believer in Nike ever since I can remember, so much that at the age of 17 when I opened my first investment account I purchased Nike stock. When I got the opportunity to join the team I took it without hesitation. In my 5 years of work here I have been provided the opportunity to issue financial statements, manage a small accounting team while the manager was on maternity leave, learn to use SAP efficiently, implement new process and create documented procedures throughout the growing manufacturing company. My day to day tasks ranged from collecting receivables to leading a committee tasked with implementing an equipment transfer procedure. As part of the Total Productive Maintenance team I was involved in creating an End of Life team that was responsible for ensuring that every department was aware of equipment moves from production managers to the safety department. I was able to build and develop strong relationships with my co-workers that allowed me to reach out to the various departments and open a line of cross department communication that had been non-existent for over 10 years. I've loved the opportunity to meet with our famous athletes that we create these products for as well as battling my co-workers at our newly purchased ping pong tables. While my experience has been wonderful up to this point, I've realized that my next career progression will lead me somewhere new. I'm looking to take on a new challenge in a place outside of my comfort zone."
good,"Very fun work place with very friendly and supportive staff. Very enjoyable to work for this company given the benefits, hours and the opportunity to help out customers who have the same athletic interests as me. Also a great company that gives each of its employees an opportunity to grow."
good,Greet customers; assist with specific shoe purchases for customers. Served as a cashier and assisted with closing of store.
good,"Proporciona um ambiente de trabalho muito agradável, aprendi muito sobre vendas, organização e relacionamento pessoal."
good,Great job culture and supports work life balance. The culture is very organic making the brand authentic. Nike encourages relationships and networking. Lacking in management direction and vision. Job responsibility and duties are vague and undefined at times.
good,Great Company..Nice Brand.. learn new item within in company..Great people ....how much value a company hold as team..
good,"Fun place to work, great team always a lot of events happening and opportunities for learning and growth. The hardest part of the job was anticipating the needs of the team without being given direction and balancing the needs of 5 people."
good,"A typical day at work includes me showing up fifteen minutes prior to my shift to learn about the promotions and where in the store i will be working today. I learned a vast amount of information about customer service and how to actively listen to customers of all different backgrounds. I also gained knowledge on many different types of sporting equipment and how to find a product the will suit all the customers needs and wants. The management is great here and I thoroughly enjoy all the individuals that i work with. The hardest part of this job is gaining trust with a customer over a short period of time because customers sometimes believe that we are just trying to push a product, but by listening to their needs and wants I am able to gain this trust. The most enjoyable part of this job is the environment that i work in. This is because I have played sports my entire life so i am passionate about the Nike product and the other thing that makes this a favorable environment to work in is my co-workers, we all were trained under a team model. This means we all help each other out, this leads to an non-hostile environment."
good,"Seasonal work would be long hours, small breaks in between, no paid breaks. some managers were boring but others I got along with. Co-workers were funny and easy to get along with."
good,"Benefits, discounts, and overall added perks are amazing. Energy is great but it varies from store to store. There should be a more universal energy felt throughout stores."
good,"Great and smile walk-in customer and client"
good,"Nike was a great place to work. It was a great job for college students, and was fun environment. I love the Nike brand, and was fun to see the new products they were coming out with!"
good,"I am asked to pretty much be a manager without the title and pay. Due to the fact I have management experience, I am relied upon heavily. The atmosphere with my coworkers is a great one. Although good workers are few and far between. Some managers aren't to keen on looking out and trying to advance those who deserve it."
good,"I currently support 9 Directors. I manage their calendars, expense reports, travel, assist their direct reports and Team Members of 10-15 people, supply ordering, on-boarding new Team Members, Event Planning & Offsites, and general day to day questions and concerns. "
good,"Working for Nike is good for someone looking to enter the retail world. You get good customer service experience while gaining skills in inventory management and Point of Sales. It's a fast paced environment to work but it helps you learn how to multitask. Coworkers and management make it a fun, enjoyable place to work. Unfortunately, opportunities to move up are slim. It's a waiting game: being able to obtain higher positions are based on waiting for people in those current positions to leave or get fired."
good,I enjoyed working at Nike. I learned a lot about fast pace work. Fast pace work was new to me and I actually like it better. Time fly by faster. I also stood on my feet for 15hrs a day.
good,A typical work day at Nike is very friendly and enjoyable. While working there I learned about the technology of the shoes which helps out a lot in helping not only me but customers. The other employees are a pleasure to work with and fun. the hardest part I must say about the job is sometimes them not understanding scheduling conflicts and working with people when they have another job.
good,"I was hired no as seasonal part time and stayed on for part time athlete. The work environment is really relaxed. You really get to know and become good friends with your coworkers and some of the management. You meet all kinds of different people from different walks of life, plenty of internationalist come in and it's fun to hear about life outside of the US. If you like sports then you'd love this job meeting athletes from various sports can be really fun, you really get to see how some of them react when they aren't wearing a uniform."
good,"clima muito animado e agitado ,todos trabalham em equipe ,aprendi a trabalhar sobre pressão , os lideres sempre procurava nos ajudar com campanhas de incentivo , O Gerente  e muito animado sempre procura desenvolver o perfil de cada funcionário. a parte mais difícil do trabalho era as metas que são muito altas mas a parte mais agradável era que conseguíamos sempre realiza-las"
good,Nike  Healthy work environment great employees as well as great benefits.  Fast pace the company is  very passionate about its People and Product.
good,This was a fun place to work for the most part. The managers were friendly and the environment felt good. There's really not much bad I can say about this job. It was fun and I met new people everyday through the interaction with customers.
good,A company of high achievers. Inspiring culture that encourages hard work but also health and play. Mentorship and networking was encouraged! They have good process and high standards. Most everyone is hardworking.
good,"A  typical day at work for me takes place in a cool laid back environment. Throughout the day I could perform one of many daily tasks or  or be seen helping prepare and plan for future events. My favorite part about the job is when I can help make a young athletes day, helping them find the perfect pair of shoes for their first basketball game."
good,"typical day making sales talking to the customers making inventory encoding new equipment monitoring products,"
good,Young workplace and full of energy and creativity.  Do not expect quick advancement though.  Job is geared for HS and college students.  They are very understanding of school and sport schedules.
good,"En un día normal teníamos que organizar todos los artículos que teníamos exhibidos, todo tenia que estar en orden y claro esta no tenia que faltar ninguna talla de cualquier prenda que tuviéramos expuesta para que cuando lo solicite el cliente la tengamos a mano. A esta tienda ingresaban toda clase de persona desde extranjeros que no hablan castellano hasta el típico abuelete que te habla en valenciano teníamos que atender a todos por igual con una sonrisa en la cara y atendiendo cualquier duda que surgiera, como anotando aquello que necesitaba y en ese momento no teníamos en almacén. La parte más difícil del Trabajo fue tener que hacer responsables ante un cliente de cualquier error que haya cometido un compañero, como decir mal el precio y los clientes iban contra cualquiera de nosotros, pero para eso estábamos para saber salir de esa situación y dar solución inmediata."
good,"My typical day at work depends on the calendar.  Been in merchandising we had our peak season and off seasons. During the peak season there is no  time to breath, with the true spirit of Nike there will be no finish line."
good,Terminer a cause de déménagement. Ranger les ordres dans le dépôt avec un système audio.
good,"Typical day was helping customers and maintaining presentation of the store. The store atmosphere was positive and fun, and would recommend this job for anyone."
good,"If you are in college or high school and you need a perfect balance between work and school, Nike is the place to go. Managers will give you good amount of hours and understand the situations you are in with life. Managers are friendly and they ask of you is to sell everything you can."
good,I would sale shoes and apparel to customers. The management was great and I loved the job.   I was currently in highschool when I worked here and that is the reason I had to quit.
good,Great company easy work little pay. The environment is very team oriented and fun
good,"Attended start up meeting,go over pre and post target goals,package shoes,placing shoes on conveyor belt, process orders for shipment including picking and packing..I learn it's better to do things as a team because you get better results.Management is there 100% always willing to help in any way possible.Coworkers are friendly and overall team  players.The hardest part of the job I will say was the ten hours standing.Enjoyable part of the job is the have giveaways for their employees.Having recognition for job services and awards giving to employees who've been there five years or more.They also do bonuses every year according to job performance."
good,Nike is a great company to work for because you have many opportunities to advance in positions. Depending on the Nike store you may meet around 600 people a day and sometimes you do learn things from the customer and some days you do get a day to make at least one customer smile and greatly appreciate the time you spent in them. Management team is pretty fun and relaxed but once a visit comes its time to get serious.

good,Great company. Looking to branch out and learn more techniques. Currently working with handling and receiving shipment
good,"In nike stadium is such a happy environment yet it was a place where you can feel that your not even working but playing ,playing in a way that you have to be a team player you need to assist your co-worker at the same time, I learned to be confident with all the words that I usually say to the customers and you have to wear always that smile in order to have a good conversation with the customers or  giving a good impression so that he will be convinced to buy, the hardest part of the job is just that you have to deal with different kind of people wit different kind of attitude but it was exciting , and the happiest part of the job is that when you convinced your customer to buy the items."
good,Fue una grata experiencia ya que el equipo de trabajadores está formado básicamente por gente joven y eso crea un ambiente agradable y dinámico.
good,"Have to be at work at 5 am every day."
good,"I completely enjoyed being employed at Nike the employees are awesome and some of the managers are to, but like every job there is pros and there are cons. Overall though, Nike was a great environment to meet great people and have fun while you are working."
good,"Les journées sont toutes différentes, si ont bosse dure on peut y voir une perspective d'évolution de carrière, le management est bien gérer et il faut avoir les nerfs solides, l'aspect du poste le plus difficile reste la pression et l'aspect le plus agréable reste l'harmonie au sein de cette structure."

good,Learned a lot from industry leading athletic provider. great company to work for
good,"Nike was overall, a great place to work. As a Visual Merchandising Manager, my day started at 7am. I'd review product catalogs, draw up schemes to place said product, and hit the sales floor around 7:30 each day. I'd then reset on floor dislays, walls, a=mannequins, and all other on floor displays to relfect new product."
good,Great company. Advancement possibilities are great since Converse and Hurley are under its Umbrella. Meaning you can apply to any of the three companies internally.
good,"A typical work day consisted of keeping back of house organized, keepimg stock on floor, and processing income shipment of merchandise. Management for the most part was good they helped you fins way to do your job better. Most of the co-workers were tolerable and friendly.

good,"Working in Retail is busy, busy, busy. Your always doing something, always focusing on the customer and trying to make the sale. There are many parts of working for Nike that I did enjoy. Of course the discounts were a plus, who doesn't like Nike? But I enjoyed meeting the diverse group of people I worked with, I enjoyed the freedom of doing things as you go. If your entire zone is a mess, you have the choice of where to start, what to fix first. As far as customers, they are the main priority. I am a people person and enjoy starting converstations.

good,I enjoyed working at nike but the scheduling is why I no longer work here. I had received a second job that would pay more and provide better hours. nike wasn't willing to be flexible with schedule. id have to not work a busy Friday at one job because nike had me scheduled a 4 hour shift right at shift change preventing me from making real money.
good,Good. N professional...................... Plenty of work and the always on there job... Very good company to work with............i loved it.... Dearly

good,"nike is a workplace where you sometimes forget that your in a place of business, that's how premium the environment is, nike makes it easy for one to forget that their working retail,it is by far the best retail experience one can have. the people are really friendly and the managers are really motivating. theres even a development plan to your career that you would like to have with nike. The only thing I would change about working for nike is having a set schedule it is hard to plan anything else that is going on in my life because I do not have a set schedule, yes I have a availability but my schedule changes every week."
good,"Nike worker's challenge all athletes to reach a specific goal but let us know to have fun with our goal, to not take it so seriously. Nike is challenging in some ways but not as much as other place's can be."
good,"Productive and fun workplace to work in."

good,"buen ambiente laboral, se aprende mucho de diversos temas, gran empresa con altos beneficios"
good,"Worked here for three years, Very professional management and the head coach even helped me with mock interviews even if that skill would be used outside Nike. They trust employees who have proven themselves to take on bigger projects and there was little to no micro managing."
good,Très bonne expérience professionnelle matériel high-tech pour fidélisation
good,"worth the perks/discounts, get staff dress every quarter (only pay taxes out of your paycheck, fun environment, management at my specific store wasn't the greatest but overall good experience."

good,"Discounts were great. Location was great. Office space was good"
good,"Nike's work environment is very casual and friendly.  They are experts at implementing agile processes, but not so good at driving project so completion.   Inter-organizational battles sometimes diminished the quality of product decisions."
good,esperienza di lavoro fantastica e formativa ottimo management
good,"it was decent, had a lot of fun and also enjoyed the discount made lots of friends but the management was terrible, the fired all of them at one point"
good,"I worked for Nike for close to 4 years and I loved every second of it. My managers were very team oriented and always wanted us to do our best. The training was very well put together and once I started working I felt very secure and ready to help customers make the best choices. I would say if given the opportunity to work for this company, do it."
good,Ótima empresa para aprender a filosofia de trabalho em equipe.
good,Nice place to work but unsteady management.  The management was all over the board switching chat to phones.  Very unbalanced.  met a lot of really great people there.
good,"cool place to work"
good,"Great place to advance in retail management. Competitive pay and training provided. It can be a challenge to manage competing priorities at times based on constant evolution, but worth it."
good,"Clock in then, go onto the floor with name tag and mic. Then head to a leader and get put into a zone. so that you can begin helping maintain the store and assisting consumers."
good,"This is a great job for students. Their scheduling was flexible because it was a retail establishment. The environment is very team-like, my manager gave us some incentives to have fun at work, and rewarded us for doing positive things at work. This was usually pep-talk, free lunch, gift cards, etc."
good,The work environment is very good. They always do a great job of representing the passion for Nike. Pay was decent once they bumped it for the athletes that worked there for more than 2 years. Management was okay depending on the store you worked at. Just know the bigger the store the worst it will be.
good,"Overall I was happy with my work experience at Nike. The managers were very transparent about operations and my role as a part of the team. The location I worked at was incredibly understaffed which caused a lot of stress between managers and employees. There was also a lack of a collaborative and ""good"" culture which did not help the situation at all. The managers were very attentive and cared about my work experience. I am still a very big fan of the brand and would recommend a friend to work for Nike."
good,its a great place to work the people that work there are fun to be around. The boss are good when u are sick or u have family trubles you can make a lot of good friends

good,"I loved my job at nike but returning to college required me to give up my position. While at nike I worked the sales floor which involved; getting shoes from the stock room, helping customers, and cashing them out. Overall great experience."
good,"Fast paced and exciting job.  Buying footwear, apparel and accessories for each season for multiple stores.  You get to be apart of what people will be wearing each season!"

good,"Nike is a great company to work for. "
good,Nike is a fun place to work with fair compensation. It is competitive because of position advancements. A lot is required because the image of the company is very important.
good,Quite laid back with not a lot of stress and doing something which I like. The management is very nice and the environment is very positive with very polite co-workers. I also love the fact that when you get scheduled you won't get your hours cut if there's no traffic.
good,"Productive and fun workplace with great coworkers, food, managers, leads, opportunities, welcoming, exercise, complementing rewards, and safety practices"
good,"A Nike Athlete is just Nike slang for a Sales Associate. The company treats the athletes very well compared to other retail jobs. There can be room for improvement for career advancement out of retail, depending at which store you work. But overall, the work environment is net positive."
good,Nike will hire you and then lay you off after you get them caught up with production. It has  high turnover rate and the employees steal from time to time.
good,Nike was a place of mostly competition rather it was who could pick and pack the fastest or who were at the top of the production boards by a certain time of the day. Friendly competition made working at nike a much more fun experience.
good,The staff at nike is amazing. Everyone of the staff members are good to work with. The management are easy to talk to. Everyone looks out for one another.
good,"If you are interested in learning about how a business runs and need a job, Nike would be the place for you. The work culture was awesome with the management staff."

good,Stressful but fun when you're working with friends. Literally only writing this cause I'm forced to otherwise I can't access indeed but yeah back then managers weren't all that great but I think it's fine now. I have a few friends still working there and they don't seem to have it all that much
good,I work unsupervised. Manage my own time. Maintain tooling for production. I diagnose issues with machines.  This can be a challenging but rewarding position at times.
good,"In the whole it was a good experience,I was very loyal to this company where I worked for 13 years."
good,I received training on how to use a RF gun. I walked and stood on my feet for 12 hours a day.Nike is a very stress free work environment. I enjoyed working there. My salary was $11 an hour.
good,It was fast-paced and a team oriented environment. I enjoyed working collectively in group settings. I also enjoyed running for the company and inspiring others to run as well.
good,To many people are constantly involved in things that have nothing to do with work......focus people. Its alot of jelousy also amongst the females. Just alot of childish things that shouldnt accure
good,"With any billion dollar company is pressure. Nonetheless, once you get into the swing of things at swoosh, at least in my experience, it becomes a walk in the park."
good,I really enjoyed working for Nike. I got see the newer merchandise before it hit the streets. I learned a lot of my warehouse techniques working for Nike. It pretty much a fun company to work for.
good,I learned a lot being with Nike how to work with computers scanning things learning how to pick things put them same order the hardest part it’s the walking from lunch but everything else it’s okay I love it.
good,"Jaren lang met plezier bij Nike gewerkt. Het international karakter, de mensen, de vrijheid om te sporten maakten het een geweldige werkomgeving."
good,"Long hours, but you get used to it after awhile. Very diverse work environment, which is a plus. You switch areas and people you work with each week, which keeps things interesting. Management is very nice and does a good job making sure employee's have work-life balance."
good,Fun work place to enjoy your day at your work environment.. Makes time fly to end the day not tired and feeling like u haven't had a hard day as u would at a cpany that's not up to part
good,"I spent 20 years at Nike Town in New York. Unfortunately they closed down. I have a great desire to continue with them, given the chance. It’s where I feel I belong."
good,nike was a great experience with great and fun people only down side were the rude people calling and complaining about the collin kaepernick commercial
good,It is a fun place to work. You will never get bored and the staff becomes family. I played with a ball all day and that was my sales method because it attracted other people to join in and then I would talk about the ball and the cleats we had on offer.
good,"Daily tasks include reviewing reporting, cash counting, assigning salesfloor tasks, customer service, responding to emails, replenishment of merchandise"
good,"good co-workers and strong team emphasis by all or most employees. morning meetings to talk about daily, weekly, or monthly goals. All around good experience with the company."
good,A great team of people to work with and for. There is good opportunity for promotion and support from management. It is great to work in such a fun and friendly environment.
good,"I was only a temp was not full time. but i learned the value Nike take in its company to scribe to be the best at what they do. They also make sure there employees have benefits in they also get the Nike clothes,shoes,and sport gear on there give away days each month."
good,Had a great time working with Nike. They used to have great benefits and it created a great atmosphere. They then reduced the benefits and became very strict on allowing discounts (outlet) and the morale quickly diminished.
good,I learned that Nike is more that athletic shoes. It's a global company that care about the employees and their products.They also reach out to schools and other organizations to help young people to advance.
good,Great company to work with. They offered quarter bonuses based off total money made by the location of the company and the amount of hours you worked during that time period.
good,Very fun place to work and very energetic I would highly recommend this as a good start up Job. I would consider working here again because it was such a pleasing experience
good,"It was a very serious work place, when you clocked in, it was time to work. The managers took their jobs serious which helped my associates take it serious."
good,While at Nike the place of work was wonderful to be around. I worked the afternoon shift and had many responsibilities that I took great pride in. The most enjoyable part was the opportunity to train new employees.
good,"Nike is an awesome company. Great Paternity leave program. I was able to help my wife with our first born. I loved the work environment, but the pay is not great. Would have loved to grow with the company, but advancement was slow and not idea salary for a family."
good,"I personally liked working at nike , I liked the fact that the discount was 50% off at the clearance store i was working i liked the people . I liked the envirment how comfortable i was."
good,Overall Nike is a pretty decent company to work for. The discount is great and you meet plenty of people who may help you move up. There are always chances to progress it just depends on your drive and how hard you work
good,"I enjoyed the co-workers, they made sure you recieved your breaks. The lead was helpful. You could make your own schedule. Felt parking lot was secured"
good,"Worked there for the summer and it was an awesome experience, staff was friendly and accommodating. It was at the College World Series in Omaha and was a great chance to get involved with a reputable company."
good,"Great work atmosphere for daily morning, and evening meetings. The management team was extremely enthusiastic about employee growth and even person development. My most enjoyable moments were with working with the local YMCA boys and girls club."
good,Nike was an good experience for me. The leads gave good vibes at work as well the coworkers. The hardest part of the job was when line get backed up. The good part about the job was they made sure you get your hours.
good,The executive position I filled at Nike Inc. was a once in a life time opportunity that I was very successful at thanks to the wonderful team I had at Nike.
good,Everyday was a day for working. I learned how to pack properly. Management was nice to everyone not just picks. It was an easy place to adapt to and I enjoyed going to work everyday when everyone was ready to work.
good,"Not difficult. Easy daily tasks. Fun meeting new friends and new consumers. Management when I first started wasn't great, but by the time I left the company, It was excellent."
good,"NIke is not just a brand but it is a culture.  It doesn't take long to feel like part of the team.  Most of the staff and management want to see to win.  There is paid training and then you are shadowing an associate for about a week so you get a better understanding of what is expected of you.  "
good,Great place to work definitely a great opportunity to advance within the company. You can network and me a lot of people. Nike teaches as well as show you the true meaning of team work.
good,All of the employees were great but it felt as if Nike was too driven to reach numbers than how the associates feel. We went from a close bet group of people that got along great to everyone is for themselves and numbers are why drive us. We even had fun calendars with special uniform apparel days but that was taken away. It felt like there was more negative than positive toward the end but overall it is a good company.
good,"Nike is a good company to work for. very competitive and diverse of different styling of sneakers, clothing, equipment, etc. Enjoyed working there and would recommend it for anyone who engages in sports."
good,Its was very easy and laid back. if work was slow then we would get sent home early which means less money. You do get to go the nike factory and get discount off shoes.
good,"It was really fun working there and I made a lot of friends bc even though not everyone is the same age, we were united as a team and everyone got along with everyone. Still kind of miss it!"
good,As you make your way to work you first have a meeting to tell you your expectations for the day. There was a certain number we had to obtain before we could be released to go home. We all seemed to get along pretty well and if anyone needed help with something there were always people around willing and able to help.  The work enviornment was very friendly and we always put the job first.
good,"The distribution center was fast-paced and innovative, always looking to improve overall operations; however, the focus on the company’s well-being sometimes stepped on the toes of employees, instead of a collaborative relationship.  Few opportunities to advance within the locale."
good,The location was very fun and the entire team allow the customer to always feel like they were part of the team. Being able to always deliver the expectations for the location was an amazing feeling.
good,Working conditions on Nike were rally nice. The warehouse was always cool and not hot. Everyone working there were really nice and caring people. Nice place to work.
good,"Great place to work, fun atmosphere and great supervisors. Would love to work for the company again. Benefits are clothes & shoes discounts and contest prizes."
good,"Employees who become family and all work together to reach goals. Plenty of room for career advancement, managers dedicated to getting you to the next level."
good,"me gusto el ambiente laboral "
good,"No matter your mood or the atmosphere of the day, you can always depend on the staff and management to make the work environment fun for the entire staff."
good,Most days were quiet while some days were busy! Lovely colleagues; had lot's of fun while working (yet still professionally). Great teamwork. Gained experience working in retail and confidence in building new relationships with colleagues. Hardest part of the job was tidying up the shop floor at the end of each day as it became messy quick! Most enjoyable part of the job was being able to wear uniform that was Nike and very comfortable whilst working in a bubbly atmosphere with motivating colleagues.
good,"Good place to work if your a shoe fanatic. The Nike culture is very vast, with lots of opportunities. Management definitely needs to be more proactive, lots of promises, hard to actually accomplish anything, kinda like our government. Be careful though, lots of petty drama, a lot like high school. Hardest thing to do there besides closing the store is special events like black Friday and Friends and Family."
good,"I loved Nike, the benefits are great and the employees were good caring people, it was a easy fun job! The managers are willing to work with you on everything."
good,"Operate a forklift to move, relocate and stack merchandise. Other responsibilities include order picking, load/unload trucks and inventory. Inspect and perform minor maintenance daily on forklift."
good,Good environment to work in. The store I worked in had culture like none other. It was inviting and fun. Enjoyable for customers and employees. Job was pretty simple
good,"Job is good"
good,Any kind of retail can have hard days. People can be obnoxious but Nike knew how to make sure the customer always happy. The other employees were all nice and all dependable
good,"Although working at Nike was fun, the work environment was very stressful. Depending on your manager, the work environment for me was really fun, but it was also fast-paced. The discounts were great! I miss working there at times, and Nike is a place where you will learn about customer service!"
good,Nike was a great place to work and I would've stayed there longer if it wasn't for conflict with my sports schedule.  But other than that th manager's were great and the rest of the staff was really welcoming
good,"This was a part-time position while in college at an outlet store location.  It was very high-paced seasonally, but rarely slow.  You were expected to give the best customer service and product presentation every day.  The people I worked for and with were great.  Product discounts were icing on the cake."
good,"They trained the team and played unique games to help us retain the information. There were also, activities and in the moment train techniques used to help us apply the info to the sales floor"
good,Felt like the job was very relaxed job good for a first job. Will teach you alot of things and very competive. One of the best companies I have worked for.
good,"I worked for the Nike outlet in Waterloo and had a lot of fun! The managers were awesome and very understanding, team meetings were a blast, and the sales were great."
good,"Worked at Nike on contract for a year, then product line was ramped down. Great campus with excellent amenities, good benefits, good compensation. Enjoyed my time there."
good,The environment was very diverse. The managers were very understanding but once we had a lot of new hires come in for the people who have been there very long the hours got cut. THE CUSTOMER ISN'T ALWAYS RIGHT.
good,Overall my experience at Nike was good. It's just unfortunate when management is not very good. I would work there again but would want to work for a different manager.
good,"I think the environment at Nike is great. I think that there is room for advancement and as long as I work hard and have a great attitude, it is a fairly easy job. Great benefits and perks."
good,"busy and non-stop the team was strong and dedicated to staying one of the top selling stores in the tri-state area, managers were easy going and precise with direction"
good,"just for fun, its easy to move up but management needs work. my job was a as a customer service rep and also a administrative accounting assistant . its a easy job thought."
good,Overall Nike was a good experience. Managers are very good at what they do and training. Some employees were just there for a check rather than provide good customer service.
good,"Beautiful place to work, friendly people, fun, and caring about employees. Young and diverse place to work.  However, management tends to micromanage."
good,"it was great working at Nike because i have always been a loyal customer of Nike and always wanted to work at one of the stores, but it was also  great working at Nike because the management and the staff made it a memorable experience and while i was there i learned a lot of things, like better time management and how to build good relationships with customers. It was a really memorable experience and one i will never forget."
good,"Manufacturing is rough but team members are great. It is fast pace. There is always a lot competition, which is great. There is always something new to learn."
good,"Very fun job to have as a retail associate, slow at times but good way to make connections in the industry and learn a lot about a major company. Work hard and you will be recognized."
good,"they were a good company to work for in terms of teaching, compensation, understanding. they made it hard to swap shifts though which is ridiculous when there are so many college students working at the location. also some of the managers (not all) would talk down to people."
good,It was fun job while in college. Nike Factory On the Boardwalk was a very great learning experience. It was my first retail job but had to get a better job that offered more money.
good,"It's retail, the pay is low but the job is fairly simple. There are plenty of benefits if you choose to go for them. The training is superb and you're also paid for your time learning. Overall excellent experience for an early high school job."
good,"It's basically like being in highschool again. So many associates are sleeping with other associates, everyone talks trash behind the other's back, but if you can find a clique of really nice people you get along with, they're ride or die."
good,Great benefits and always learning new things about the products which just makes you love the company even more. Workplace is fast paced and customer based.
good,"great work environment, some days can be busy. hardest part  is closing just because things almost have to be 100% perfect. if you enjoy sports you will have a blast just being in the environment of nothing but Nike."
good,"Overall, the entire team always tend to be on the same page, they are understanding and welcoming. Many employees even meet outside of work because the bond created through the job is that strong"
good,"Enjoyable time when I worked here"
good,"They have excellent benefits. Training is on par, they take the time to make sure all levels of staff are up to date on the latest protocols. It's a high volume company so face paced is a bit of an understatement, there are so may days during peak season (back to school and holiday) where you blink and your 8 hours have gone by because you're constantly busy."

good,Jente preocupada x sus empleados mucha motivacion mucha ayuda
good,"Working with Nike was a different experience from day to day based on the employees you worked with, the customers that came into the store, and the jobs that needed to be completed for the day. It was enjoyable to be there, the people were enjoyable to work with, and the work place environment was relaxed and kept you engaged during the day."
good,Typical day Nike : cashier for many 4 to 5 hours. Then switch to walking the floor to help customers and clear/ organize sneakers and  clothes. I would also restore and sneakers that were sold earlier in the day. Organize the stockroom if needed.
good,I enjoyed working there for the short period I was able to.  The managers were great to work for because they were understanding and laid back.  The other employees were related and approachable as well.
good,NIke is a fast pace job five days a week. Standing on my feet on concerete for period on time. The culture is like family. I enjoyed my time at the shoe capitol.

good,"Days went by kind of slow whenever there werent many customers, but other than that the day would go by quick and easy. My manager was beyond and above one of the greatest people ive met and knows what shes doing. Hardest part of job is dealing with rude customers or in my case we had one lead who was not very friendly. Most enjoyable part of a job was helping some young kid find the perfect pair of shoes."
good,"•	Process and stock the sales floor with product and assisted in thief determent measures ESA Standards"
good,I loved my co-workers at Nike. Working there was very team-oriented and fun. The main reason I left was because it was going to take too long to work my way up to a position where I would receive the benefits I needed immediately.
good,It was a great job I just can work with you shifts no longer If you want to go on a company like he’s a great job for you I learned a lot about the business
good,Nike is not bad place to work. Safe environment  The pay is not that great. The long hours. They provide you with the protection equipment you need to work with  It has alot of groups you can join. It has a gym on site that I love. The people are pretty nice.

good,Working with nike is living nike.  It will be with you outside and inside of work.  I learned that change is something everyone should be open to.  The workplace is a place of equality where everyone will be treated the same no matter their position.
good,"Nike is a great company and I would never stop liking their actions with local communities and branding. Awesome home feeling at work, never walked in dissatisfied."
good,"i love working for Nike, the Nike hype is real and everyone in Nike are supper cool.. every talks to each other and you always meet new people at workk"
good,"Modern, flexible and innovating. "
good,"The managers are very outgoing and personable.  Everyone is willing to help with tasks, processing, and customers.  I will say my hours fluctuate as I am part time over 20.  I range from 20-28 hours a week.  Sometimes it is frustrating because of bills that need paid."
good,"Its been a while since ive worked for them,but they were ok back in the day. For some odd reason im on some form of list that wont allow me to work there ever again since i quit. I dont really know why,but i assume thats what they do to people who quit."
good,Nike is a great company to work for as they provide their employees with good benefits as well as the ability to have the best brand currently in the world
good,"If you want a relaxed (at least it was when I was there..hehe), this is the place for you. At first I worked on Mainframe applications and was able to pick up DB2 (database) experience. I was then able to apply Visual Basic experience on some other projects. After that I was able to learn Brio (Business Reporting) from them at their cost, which was fantastic. I also picked up Unix Kshell programming experience there... I really liked the environment and novelty at working at such a dynamic ""tennis shoe"" company.... I would go back here, as a part time contractor, if I had the opportunity..."
good,I loved working here and the management team is amazing! They know what they're talking about and are very helpful when you have any questions or concerns. The employees there are also the best and will make your time there even more enjoyable!
good,"Great job for retail, good company to work with as far as team building and a reputable company to have on resume. Gained lots of experience with sales, binning items, etc. Only left because I had to go to school again. If you don’t mind retail, its a fun place to be."
good,I’ve learned at Nike to use computer to locate clothing items an to see if the barcode from both computer an material match before packing at a fast pace. I also like Nike because they give you many opertunity.
good,Uma empresa com grande chance de crescimento e um bom ambiente de trabalho
good,Nike was my first job it was great they worked well with my schedule and payed good and the discounts are great. The management could use some work but there's definitely some good parts especially depending on the section you are in.
good,A typical day at nike would be getting into work clocking in and going into the sales floor to provide premium customer service. Making sure that the customers were right fitted into their desired shoe or apparel. Fun environment to work in and was able to participate in many sport events within the company.
good,The job was very customer oriented and friendly. Dressing attire was very comfortable and relaxing also. you get good discounts off all Nike products.
good,Great organization to work. You can expect lots of work and all work are in a fast mood. Nike always cares about the fitness. You can work and go for a jogging if you want. :)
good,Me gustabo trabajar. Muy flexibles. Jornadas completas. Trabajo los fines de semanas.
good,"Nike is a great company to work for. They take care of all of their employees! It was just my first retail job and it just wasn't my speed. I enjoy fast paced, challenging work and this job just wasn't for me."
good,It was a great job to work there just needed to move on personal issues and death in the family was hoping to return but doing the circumstances I couldn't make it back had to relocate but all in all Nikes been a very great company to work for the staff the sales associates are just great
good,"Since I couldn't beat them, I had to join them. I enjoy my experiences with this company. Working in a historic location Georgetown Washington, DC brings exposure to the different cultures, people, languages and lifestyles represented across the globe. It's retail and the company focus on the Athlete and performance of the product."
good,"A typical day at work would be giving customers premium service as being efficient with job tasks throughout the day."
good,"Working everyday unpacking boxes with Nike equipment. Like bags, tshirts...etc. Labeling the prices on the tag of the products. Also lifting heavy boxes."
good,"Maintain proper stock level on line ,loading and unloading trucks using forklift: observed safety and seurity procedures reports injuries/accidents immediately,uses equipment and materials properly"
good,Nike was a very friendly workplace that allowed you to be social with your co-workers as well as your customers. On a typical day I would go to my zone which was normally women's shoes and make sure every person who needed help was helped. This job taught me the importance of punctuality as they made it very clear that they won't accept employees showing up late for no reason. The hardest part would have to be on slow days when there really wasn't a lot to do. On those days my zone would be perfectly neat and clean at all times and every customer would have been helped. The most enjoyable part of the job was when a friend that I made while working there would work in a zone next to mine and we could easily flow through our areas and be able to help each other do our jobs.
good,"Working at Nike is pretty laid-back, coworkers become family, managers are really chill and easy going. Working part-time under can be hard during months that are typically slower, business-wise. May get scheduled like 4 hours a week. Taking time off is pretty easy and switching shifts is easy as well."
good,"It is a great company to work for.  There were many opportunities for advancement.  The culture is informal and diverse.  Being part of Nike is more than just a job, it becomes part of your identity."
good,"Great employer, great company. Great work envirement!"
good,"Great place with a great team. Duties included as a Nike Athlete (Sales Associate):"
good,"Nous sommes des athlètes, le client est au centre de notre préoccupation."
good,"A typical day at Nike was fast paces and busy. I learned how to work in a busy environment. The mangers at Nike were very supportive and understanding. Furthermore, there were not any hard parts about the job, however I enjoyed working there."
good,"Nike was going to cut my pay from 15.00 to 10.00 worked as machine operator,enjoyed working there, but would not be able to support my family on 10.00 hr"
good,Good place to work for extra cash. You get to meet all type of people when working here. great selection of footwear and apparel. Also they are flexible for hours and time off.
good,I worked here at 18 and left when I was 23 It was an amazing job and I had so much fun and learned so much from here. Plus the 40% off for employees and family ain't bad either
good,Nike is a fun fast paced environment filled with people that are extremely passionate about their job. They help you find more in yourself along the way.
good,"Worklife balance can sometimes be tough, but good people and great work.  The work is challenging and there is a heavy reliance on the matrix.  I would highly recommend this company to a friend."
good,"-learn the best way to serve customer."
good,"Great learning enviroment "
good,the work was enjoyable but the hours was 12 hours or more and the workplace culture getting bad.  The pay was great and graveyard for me working out with our family.
good,A normal day as a material handler was just make sure the pickers and packers had everything they needed to do their jobs. Management was annoying sometimes. My coworkers were okay we were the same age. I didn't like how strict management could be but I did my job regardless. I liked being around people I could talk to.
good,"i typically work a closing shift some times its hard when they dont schedule enough people, and they expect so much out of you. i do enjoy my teammates they are very supportive"
good,"A typical day at work here is usually pretty relaxed sometimes there's projects to be done and other times it's just helping customers.  Learn more about time management,  I had respect other people's time as well as my own. The hardest part of the job  was finding a room in the tiny stockroom that we had to put extra boxes of shoes.  This enjoyable part of the job was the people that I worked with."
good,"I love this company, I love my job, and I love the experiences I have made while employed by Nike; however, although Nike does offer a solid healthcare plan and retirement options (as do most billion dollar companies) I feel that the pay rate at the retail level is unfairly low. There is a high expectation for in-store athletes at all levels but not nearly enough compensation."
good,"Check Work Orders "
good,"Typical day at work would be restocking/security tagging, helping customer find the right size and placing the apparel where they belong in a neat and tidy order."
good,"Quality Control Inspector with several years of hands-on experience inspecting precision production manufactured parts. Along with being detail-oriented, I am equipped with great communication and computer skills. Also skilled with numerous hand tools ranging from power drills to calipers and micrometers. I pride myself on continuous improvement, and I hope I can continue my growth with this company."
good,"Uses all the latest AWS tech stack. Highly collaborative environment with scope for growth"
good,I worked there more The Lin 2 years. It's a great company to work with . I work through manpower agency in contact. I worked there as a order picker and quality controller
good,Nike has always been an ideal destination as a young man for employment but I had no idea that I would flourish under its wings. There are many opportunities to grow and serve not only customers within your store but the community as well through special events and charitable donations of your time or earnings. The store management varies but I have had a pleasurable experience in my two years with Nike and will continue to sustain myself within the company and look for more opportunities for advancement.
good,"Nike was a great place to work for. They take good car of there employees. Discounts on Shoes or clothing, Management was there when needing help or to even ask a questions. To provided coaching to help you successful in the job."
good,Loved working here and I miss it at times. The management could be a lot better. The employees make it worth it. Everyone helps out and does their part.
good,Was a great first job to have. I really enjoyed the environment as well as the people I worked with . Gave me the right amount of responsibility and discipline I needed .
good,Everyone was friendly. The managers did a good job to ensure that each employee felt comfortable and was able to be relaxed while working. The hours were reasonable.
good,"Learning a lot from these shoe companies is an absolute must. You will know how shoes works, technologies they use for it. Officers are also very generous of their knowledge."
good,Nike Alto Las Condes me dio la oportunidad de conocer a distintas personalidades en un ambiente muy grato. Quiza hubieron una que otra diferencia pero pudimos pasarlas con el trabajo en equipo.
good,Good job and benefits loved working for nike . Co workers was awesome. Hours was easy to come by if committed .Discount was nice perk as well. Manger was cool.
good,"Its not a bad place to work , just wasn't for me. I know some people that has been working there 10 years plus and is very happy and comfortable. That's not me, I want to get out and try new things."
good,The hours are long but the job itself is not hard. The people are friendly and easy to get along with. Learned a lot about how the shoes are made which I didn't know anything about before.
good,"Working for Nike was the best. Great benefits, beautiful store, coworkers that I am still friends with to this day and a company culture that inspires."
good,"Ik ben dagelijks bezig geweest met het beste uit mijzelf te halen, iets wast bij Nike belangrijk is. Wat ik bij Nike geleerd om jezelf onafhankelijk op de kaart te zetten zonder daarbij het teamgevoel te verliezen."
good,Enjoyed my short time at Nike. The management payed attention to their employees. Always did team building exercises. They were hands on and communicated effectively. They also interacted with consumers as well. Scheduling was flexible and great employee discounts.
good,"Fun retail job with a great discount. Hours very depending on what you want. Management isn't the worst, but it could  be better. If you want to move up you have to work for it."
good,Very cool company that utilizes as many opportunities as they can to make sure that their employees are having a great time. Will do anything to make sure their employees come first.
good,I enjoyed my time working for Nike when I was there.  The atmosphere was very enjoying and never dull.  The work is easy and relaxed.  My leaders was always there to motivate and provide feedback when needed.
good,"A typical day is to get the orders out without mistakes and help others if there isn't a lead around. I've learned that if u be productive and have less mistakes u will move up and get to do overtime. The management is ok they are always on the watch and making sure you are following protocol. This is a fast pace environment but fun, butt the hardest part is when the line is down and u can't finish the order because u surrounded by boxes that needs to be on the line. The enjoyable part u can get overtime and stay late if needed and they have a great cafe"
good,worth the process loved being there meeting new people at niketown 5th ave nyc. i will always and high recommend this job to everyone I was seasonal and went back to school after.
good,I haven't had a bad experience with any company that I can recall.... I like Nike very well I want to go back to work at Nike I worked as a Inventory clerk scanning and locating product using an RF gun and key mung in daily counts into the RF gun.
good,like any other retail job great co workers typical retail rules understaff over work no down time short shifts hours cut great discount easy going at times
good,"Loved working there great enviornment."
good,A typical day would include simple aid to customers and easy conversations with co-workers and managers. Work was not too strenuous unless it was a busy day or a holiday sale/weekend. I learned how to great customers and smile a lot more. You gain patience working for Nike because there is a lot of foreigners that come shop at the store (I have had to pull up google translate to help some customers before). The hardest part of the job would be the check-offs before I clocked out. I would have to clean and organize a specific section of the workplace and fill missing spots on shelves with inventory from the back. The most enjoyable part was simply being there. Everyone generally had a great personality and the staff dress was very relaxed so I was always comfortable.
good,"Initially a very great place to work. You meet a ton of people and a great discount with staff dress. However, over time the drilling of meeting metrics and meeting sales diminishes the spirit of one. The work schedule is also very inflexible for a part-time job and students."
good,"Meet alot of great people with similar interests. "
good,The employees were great and so were the supervisors. The work kept me busy which made my day very advanced. I wold love to work there again sometime in the future.
good,"I worked here for several months, before and after christmas season so it was a very busy store. The people were all friendly and we had a very good discount in the store. On christmas day we had a very kindly bonus that I never expected. Great people and a very funny boss."
good,"Relaxed place to work, very upbeat and energetic. working with the public will always be difficult at times, but making the best of it is rather easy at Nike. Everyone is generally nice and respectful"
good,"Break down tables and chairs, put away tables and place chairs neatly in a corner of the room. If setting the room up vice, versa and go get tables needed for the room as well as other necessities (i.e. Pen, Pad, Mints, and water glasses."
good,"Great place to work, not much time for anything except work, benefits are great. Management works with you to make sure you are always happy on the job"
good,Prepare boxes with shipping labels then pick product according to customer order. Management was great and willing to work with you. The hardest part of this job for my was being on my feet all day.  The best part was working with friendly co-workers.
good,Some opportunities for those willing to make time and effort to learn and connect across the complex work environment.  Easy to get lost in background unless you deliver numbers
good,"Nike is a great place to work. Like every job, it has its pros and cons. I enjoy working for such a large company who works on getting to know you outside of work along with making you a better person. They either want to help you grow with their company, or help you grow into another career"
good,Loved working here. Great team environment and emphasis on teamwork. Management was very nice and easy to talk to. Made every employee feel as though they belonged.
good,A typical day for me would involve working as a cashier in a fast paced and very busy environment. Along with being a cashier I wold also work apparel.
good,Good work environment. Very little stress. Overall a good place to work. This job has taught me a lot in product management and teamwork. And a very nice place to shop.
good,"It was a part time job while I was a student. Overall it was a fun job with cool employees. Once management changed, the morale of the store changed and took a downward spiral."
good,"Typical day consists of processing and organizing a lot of incoming product. Along with being tasked to help the sales floor refill product, with assisting in customer service."
good,Very productive atmosphere and fun to work. I liked working with Nike a lot. My colleagues were very helpful and welcoming. I felt like I was apart of the team for a long time.
good,"NIKE, Inc. does more than outfit the world's best athletes. It is a place to explore potential, obliterate boundaries and push out the edges of what can be. The company looks for people who can grow, think, dream and create. Its culture thrives by embracing diversity and rewarding imagination. The brand seeks achievers, leaders and visionaries. At Nike, it’s about each person bringing skills and passion to a challenging and constantly evolving game."
good,"Good company to work, you enjoy working. NIke WHQ is something where you can meet with sport persons in campus."
good,For your experience in retail it's a good way to dive straight in but pick up on really fast. In terms of being able to really get hands on with the full on work experience it's a bit unorganized and bit random.
good,Súper chevere y ambiente bonito y amable para conmigo
good,"Constantly evolving, changing corporate structure, and positions."
good,I worked in the mail room as a temporary worker and we sorted the mail and delivered it and it was hard work but a lot of fun to see the campus in the summer time.
good,"Very flat organization structure making growth difficult."
good,I loved working for this company. It was a professional business place with great working conditions. Nice staffing with good benefits. The walk from the parking lot to work area is too long.
good,"Empresa perfeita, bom ambiente para trabalhar.Excelentes benefícios."
good,"At Nike they will call mandatory work days even when you are scheduled to be off. To me they work you to much like you don't have a life outside of Nike. It is a good place to work, they just need to consider their employees family."
good,was a really good place to work but had few opportunities to advance without relocation which is an issue sometimes as was my case due to family commitments and needs
good,"DOminoes was a great job that gave me the flexiblity to do what I had to do outside of going to work, It was really easy to get hired there. Probably needed more training but getting thrown into the fire early taught me what I needed to know about the job"
good,je passe un tres bon moment avec la société Nike encore merci
good,"A typical day at work consists of meeting a lot of people from other countries. More than half of the people who come in are not people who live in the state. "
good,Nike was a blast to work for. Gain knowledge of multiple forklifts and mastered them all. Nike is growing so much that it can't handle the request it has proficiently in my opinion. They also think because of the discount program that it makes up for the terrible pay rate.
good,It's a great work environment with great managers & employees. i learned quite a bit about people skills and how to communicate with consumers without coming off as pushy.
good,"Work was fun at all times. Learning about technologies of the products was absolutely worth it, especially handling and engaging to customers. The workplace was fun. Hardest part of  the job was Audit, but it's fun though. And the most enjoyable part of the job was making friends with co-workers."
good,On a slow day it was great to focus on a customer and have one on one time with them and finding the perfect product for them. On the weekends very fast paced environment but still filled with positivity from managers and other team members to reach our daily goals. Enjoyable part of the job was gaining a lot of experience and knowledge in the company as well as having a great and strong culture within other employees.
good,"Great company to work for"
good,Great working for a company with such great clients and learned a lot about managing a team of people and day to day responsibilities at the same time.
good,"Great staff, great environment great people. A good place to learn and grow. I suggest every IT person try a role at Nike."
good,I enjoyed working for Nike because they worked great with schedules for school or family issues. It was easy to get extra hours. Management was wonderful and extremely helpful.
good,Working at Nike was my first job and it was unbelievable. The chemistry with co-workers is amazing and the discounts are definitely a plus. The only con is sometimes they don't follow the scheduling you plan out.
good,the ok just very strict you cant miss days and you cant play around its time to work and get down to business.and they suck. i hate them as well
good,A good working company with great benefits steady pace of work not many hours but good pay. Would like to move ahead on the job but won't get Step Up 2 Nike if working for simos
good,Fast pace during holidays. Learn how to work with a team and learn how to excel individually. Managers are always willing to help you advance. Its a fun company to work for.
good,"Nike Scottsdale is a typical retail store. The merchandise essentially sells itself so ""athletes"" need little to no sales experience. Overall good people, good managers, and awesome clothing hook ups!"
good,basically come to work do your job and go home. Good Nike give away really helped people that was in need for clothes etc. Some people had rude attitude but besides that good work place.
good,"very fast paced, overwhelming but fun, very sociable work environment with a lot to do and a lot to fix.would love to  work here again"
good,"A typical day at work is helping large amounts of customers find products that they need, while providing valuable information of the product the customer. "
good,"Un petit peu trop de pression sur les employés, mais dans l'ensemble, environnement agréable"
good,"At Nike, I learned how to become very productive, and manage my time because we were always on a timed schedule to get things done in an orderly fashion."
good,"Very fast paced and hard working. It can be fun at times but you must make sure you are pitching your share of the work. Most of the employees there were cool but because they come and go, its never the same."
good,It's good to spend woth co-workers.i learn how to be manageable with all the things during work.Enjoyed the work alot and love the place im working for such a long time.
good,The culture is to do work in a fun way. you have to manage your own time and provide best result. Nice co-workers. Nice environment.
good,"Review of sales."
good,Nike has great leaders and awesome employee's. We are hard working and keep a great environment at all times. We balance work flow with break's. We always are willing to help each other and stay a little after shifts if our help is needed.
good,Hard work but rewarding. Great people. You can build your career. Compensation met your performance. You feel valued as an employee.  Management seems to care about the people who worked for them.
good,daily routine as a staff is to achieve daily target and upt target and in nike brand really helps to all sale associates regarding the feature and benefits of the brand and as we all know that nike brand is vey popular in the industry. Management was really good and they provide the right benefits for all the staffs and my colleague also help me so much especially the daily SOP and policies of the company and the daily routine in the store. I really enjoyed working in my team because they treat me as their family. The hardest part in my job when I start to work in this company because I don't know anuthing especially the culture.
good,"Great team environment"
good,"As for personal experience, Nike is a great place to develop a project. Just like Bill Bowerman argued in its mission statement: “to be source of inspiration for all athletes in the world”, it is also inspiration for its employees to go further than their limits. In other words, there is constant empowerment by peer coaches (mentors) and managers."
good,Buen ambiente laboral pero hay súper poca proyección laboral .
good,"Everyday was a exciting day, would come into work and have a great time. able to wear new shoes every month and learn about new clothes, shoes, and watches"
good,"All in all, the company truly cares about the employees, based on the fact that all my store management I've worked for have all shown they respect you, including my district and territory managers, who occasionally visit the store and have a ""chat it up"" with employees with no manager sitting in. Pay is also higher than average retail (here in Texas is around $7.50 and everybody here started at $9.00) and up until the start of FY17, received quarterly bonuses. We still receive yearly raises. Only downfall is though I've worked there for 2 years, I still get passed up for promotions and the only reason I can assume is that despite my constant high ratings with customers in store surveys, I'm probably passed up since I don't suck up."
good,I learned a lot from working at Nike. The atmosphere is great to work in and someone who works there will learn a lot.

good,"This company provides a place for individuals retail/sport oriented that are able to handle time management, leadership, change, and a constant urge to remain upbeat about the company's mission and culture."
good,"Working at Nike is fun at the beginning but like all things, as time passes the glitz and glamour begins to fade. It really all comes down to who your managed by."
good,"The typical day consists of a huddle, which the manager or lead would use to take the time to explain the game plan for the shift. Everyone's broken up into teams to complete the tasks given. All huddles end in a Nike spirit cheer. Games are often played mid shift to keep the energy high. The job culture is built like a family. The perks are meeting amazing people, hearing amazing stories and the discounts/ gratis . "
good,"Easy job "
good,Your day can start slow but the pace picks by break. As I trained i learned  patience with my trainees and that every person has their own capabilities.
good,"It was a great place to work at when I first started there but as time went by the rules got stricter and they started coming up with new rules such as no phone use on your break.  I felt like that was absurd and crazy but hey what can I say. The management was ok just a little strict on attendance, phone usage, and the type of shoes you wear.  I learned how to read the label and how to use a scan gun while I was there.  The most enjoyable part of the job was that it was a easy laid back type of job and I caught on quick I just wished I was still there because I loved working there just hated the phone issue."
good,"Empresa de alto nível, onde da todo suporte para criar um ambiente propício a conquista de grandes resultados, possui um capital humano muito elevado fazendo com que a cultura seja fortíssima dentro da organização estimulando o colaborador a respirar a empresa e comprar suas idéias."
good,"Nike overall was a great company to work for. I really enjoyed traveling to the different distribution centers and learning how inventory is received, shipped and how inventory is carefully packaged. I did encounter some very mean staff employees that hindered my growth within the company. The scheduling was very flexible, lunch and the meals were provided and tons of free Nike gear, plus awesome discounts in the Nike Store and online. I'd definitely work for Nike again but not with the previous employee I worked with."
good,"A typical day at work is slow. On weekdays, traffic is slow, unless there was a sale going on. On weekends you would receive heavy loads of traffic. The main reason why you would receive heavy loads of traffic is because our clearance whether that was clearance or apparel was always discounted to either 20 or 30%. I learned how to work better with customers where English is not their native tongue. I also learned how to better my conversations with customers. The management at Nike was okay in my opinion. Many of the managers stood around and observed, but did not help out customers. There would even be days that the managers who were on the floor would stand around and be talking with the other manager the whole time being on the floor. The boss of the store was great. He worked with consumers, gave you feedback on how he thinks you could improve on your customer service, gave you compliments on when he saw you doing a good job, he would even go out of his way and talk to his employees about current events; making his employees comfortable."
good,"Nike has a great Environment to work in because you meet a ton of people various in ages that share the same love for sports, shoes and the Nike brand."
good,"The Nike Outlet that was located in the Rockvale Outlets in Lancaster, PA closed for business some years ago. They moved their store down to the Tanger Outlets."
good,Nike is an amazing place to work. The campus is beautiful there are great facilties a fun culture and if you are a lover of sports you will love it here!
good,"Daily stand up to review Sprint stories. "
good,Management could be better. Fun staff but management was unorganized and could not provide much guidance. They hire a lot of high schoolers who are not experience who stand around most of the time.
good,I like working there because I could dress comfortable also because the pay was good. The benefits of having 40% discounts in any Nike store.Great job
good,"While at Nike, I learnt a lot about what it was like working in the retail industry and the hard work that is required. Whether  the store  was super busy or had little traffic coming through, it was always tidy and clothes, equipment, and shoes displayed neatly. The team at Nike where all so friendly and inviting when I started working there. Everyone got along and any issues where dealt with maturely so no atmosphere was created for any of the other employees. During the holidays, the work load increased dramatically and at times was stressful, however everyone worked together and did their part in making the jobs as easy as possible for one and other."
good,Il y a toujours du nouveau à apprendre chez Nike. C'est souvent très achalandé durant le samedi et le dimanche et l'été. Il faut être patient avec les clients puisqu'Ils sont demandant.
good,The Nike team did not do much to assist me in learning how things worked they kind of expect you to know what to do but besides for that it was easy and light work
good,"While at Nike, I was working within a fast- paced and busy environment, in constant demand from customers, this helped me to develop new skills such as, how to keep calm under pressure when in busy shopping hours, I also, dealt with enquiries over the phone relating to Nike goods and services. I also, had a number responsibilities within the sales floor, such as assembling the mannequins and in- store displays while making sure the shop floor is well maintained by organizing the merchandise within the store. overall I was able to work as a big team and as an individual, which meant I was able to gain a number of skills which will help me if I was to work for any other fast paced, well known retail stores."
good,"Empresa cómoda, donde se disfruta lo que uno hace, buen equilibrio entre el trabajo y vida personal, falta carrera de crecimiento y capacitación en general."
good,Nike is a very fun place and also a busy place to work my experience was an amazing the worker was nice and respective so where the managers. the discounts are amazing and so was the pay and we got free stuff.
good,"It was a great work experience working at Nike with a great management. Especially, about learning how to assist customers, to be a team player and to having knowledge about Nike products"
good,"Was a fun place to work, management can break apart a good team with bad leadership. Lots of free Nike apparel  and great team building activities. Doesn't offer a lot of hours, good job for high school and college students."
good,typical work day including coming in with a smile on ready to learn. I loved the atmosphere there and the job was not very difficult either. I love there also because I wear the product so it made it very easy to sell.
good,"Nike is a very diverse company with tremendous talent that together drive the brand  success and promotes a great culture.  Nike's employee community while situated all across the globe come together with a common vision and value for their businesses.  There really is not a ""typical"" day from my perspective which helps make this an exciting and fun place to work and grow."
good,Its a job either you work or you don't. You standing up on your feet all day with one break that don't last long at all. Bout time you go down stairs break half way over.
good,"Get to work order lunch, reviewed information from television prompters, Clock-in & head to start ups, get with my team members & discuss plan of action to complete daily goals"
good,"Very professional staff. Everyone, including the employees themselves felt like they wanted to contribute to something more than themselves every shift."
good,"Thoroughly enjoyed my employment at NIKE. It gave me great customer service and teamwork experience. It was fun, competitive, and extremely friendly. The managers were great team leaders and motivators."
good,NIKE was fast paced yet laid back at the same time. Almost all employees got along and had great relationships with each other which made working for them a fun experience
good,Whenever I worked there a manager would tell you what you needed to do that day as well as continuously help and consumer who needs it. I learned that when a lot of people work together with the same goal in mind things can be accomplished faster. The hardest part of this job was working the holidays. The most enjoyable part was the different ethnicities and backgrounds you were able to meet.
good,"Working at Nike is a great experience. Good work life balance, competitive pay, good benefits, great discount on a premium product that extends to your family."
good,Nike is cool and comes with a ton of different ways to advance in the company but they do not play. It's a good 500-700 people in the building at one time and they let it be known you can be replaced. Do your job and you're good but slip up once and you can very well be gone.
good,"This was a job I had obtained during college, during football season. The job consisted of making Nike Plus sales as well as selling shoes. Everyone was great to work with."
good,"If you are interested in fashion, working for a big named brand and great discount Nike is for you. However they are hard to get hired into. It took me 2 years to finally land a job with them. So persistence is key. My time at Nike Soho was very fun. The environment was what I wanted to be in. Which had it's mixture of fast and slow passed days. Your typical day at Nike depending on where you are on the floor can vary. You can be in the fitting room where it fluctuates from very busy to dead. Or be on the sales floor where the flow of people can be increasing but also become stagnant depending on the time and season. The stockroom suffers the same fate. Busy weekends usually result in the stockroom being hectic, unfortunately coverage has been known to be light so on chaotic days like Saturday and Sunday shoe orders can pile up. What I learned from Nike is to save money. The discount is very good, but will keep you broke if you don't know when to say no. I also learned how to multitask better. Multiple customers will sometimes approach you and you will have to be adept at handling the bombardment and many questions they have. Management was pretty solid depending on the floor you worked on. However, like any retail environment, you'll have the occasional ""but this manager told me to do so and so.."" The most enjoyable part of the job for me besides the discount was getting the new staff dress. Hardest part was remembering all the material certain sneakers were made of."
good,Worked on a relaxed and friendly environment.  Team was extremely helpful when hot issues were presented with network situations.  Management was courteous and open to all communications.
good,"MY time at Nike was amazing, I liked the work environment and the employees there was geared to work hand in hand with each other, no one was by themselves."
good,"It’s a great community and atmosphere to be apart of. Daily operations are very team oriented and innovation are always apart of company progression. PAy and hours could be improved, along with general Manager communication."
good,"A typical day of work included assisting customers, making sure the sales floor is properly maintained, keeping back of house operations in order and cashing people out at the register. I learned about basic business operations as well as communication skills while working with fellow customers, employees and management. The workplace culture is incomparable. Nike was represents what it means to be an athlete."
good,"Seek the good leaders, that's critical. Like any corporate entity of that scale, there are variations, but the overarching culture, when honored, is untouchable"
good,"Many areas to work in (e.g Footwear, Apparel, Registers, Stockroom). They will teach you how to do things! The culture is friendly and supportive. The management team is caring. You get what you take out."
good,"working at the nike company store is fun great athletes; and managers however, the store gets really repetitive same thing day in and day out. but don't get me wrong i love working for a company like Nike."
good,Even the bad days at Nike were easy to handle. Coworkers and managers are great. First job I had that I didn't dread going to because of the nice atmosphere the employees created.
good,"I had fun working at nike, nice co workers, good lead and mananger. What I didn't like was the shift I was on which was morning shift.  At the time I had two jobs, so the morning was crazy getting up at 5 o'clock"
good,"A typical day would normally start off with a department meeting giving the employees deeds of the day, Then start filling the conveyer belt with product (Being shoes, apparel, and gear) After completing all waves on assignment list then employees would forward to the packing area. In this area employees have to use PDF Machines to close cartons after they have been counted and organized. Once Complete Employees may be moved to Shipping Grounds Where shipping and processing is taken place, In this area employees have to palletize, wrap, and load outgoing trucks."
good,Warehouse was always very busy and management where very hands on with supervisors and team members. Lots of shipping traffic and support from logistics support was very prompt
good,"A typical day at work would be a lot of customer traffic during the day and it would tend to slow down towards the evening. What I learned from NIKE was their values, beliefs, and culture behind their products. Management was great! Hardest part about the job can be anything there as far as time management, skill, knowledge on their products, but for me nothing was hard at all working there."
good,"Collaborative environment. Everyone who I worked with are upbeat, team players, and all buy into the brand of Nike. You can move up at Nike but it is a slow process as it is very competitive."
good,"Although I really enjoyed a fun and exciting work environment, along with great coworkers and managers, I wish that there was more room for growth within the company."
good,A typical day at work is usually busy due to the sales and the new product we bring in. The hardest part part of the job processing and recovering. The most enjoyable part of the job is working with my team and keeping the customer satisfied.
good,"Loved the team and environment. Nike is still one of my favorite companies that I had worked for. The culture was excellent. It had a nice balance of getting stuff done, taking time to rest, and additional time dedicated to your health such as long lunch breaks for exercise."
good,"New training skills "
good,"I worked the overnight shift at the Nike factory and boy was it worth it. Not only did we get to manage ourselves overnight, we got an extra $2 as the overnight premium"
good,"Mostly youre by yourself, management comes around every so often. What I learn was shipping. One of the hardest part is the walking around the warehouse."
good,"Overall it is a good place to work in as training is provided and branch manager is kind to teach and guide, the only negative side is the colleagues are not friendly nor helpful."
good,"This was my first job ever. I did not know what to expect, but it sure was a nice and easy first job to have. I was trained well and because of my previous knowledge of the company and my love of sports it made the job fun and enjoyable."
good,To work in Nike is very good experience. Had a chance to learn new things.work  environment was great. Had a chance to work with best team. Management is also  quite good.
good,Awesome team and a great place to work.  Great culture and many great things for employees.  I was a Manager here and had a great time implementing policy and procedures.
good,"Aimer le contact avec les gens , et savoir donnée des conseils"
good,"Always a job to be done, the most enjoyable part of the job is learning about Nike history and products. Learning aboit nike technologies is fun and interesting. Also, meetig cutomers needs."
good,"High energy,fast-paced work environment with a winning culture.Like any other retail job, turnover is always a challenge. Finding the right mix of people that will represent the brand properly. The most difficult part of the job is the new challenges that show up every day due to the company growing at such an incredible rate. The most enjoyable part of the job is meeting new people every day and being able to share the wonderful brand with each of them."
good,"Un día normal, con gente con buen animo y disposición, aprendí a desarrollarme mejor con la clientela y a tener mas responsabilidades. El grupo de trabajo era muy acogedor y bueno."
good,"It's hard work but I like that I get to be on my feet and move around. The mangers work with my schedule really well, and again I love selling a brand that I love and getting to know where Nike came from and what it is now"
good,It was a nice place to work and work isn't hard at all. You have a a lot of sections to work in and the warehouse is very big. The security is very cautious and the cafe food is very good.
good,"A typical day at work was always fun as interactions with first time Nike or Nike veterans, as interactions always became a awesome experience but more importantly, a great memory. The culture in the store is very sports-oriented environment, as Nike harbors a wide selection of sports clothing and equipment. Overall experience of Nike is satisfactory as their content always meets the needs of the customers with full courtesy from the Nike company."
good,"Allows situational approach to discharging duties and responsibilities.  High level of individual empowerment allowing ample employee self-expression.  Very friendly atmosphere - but very results-oriented.  Open-door type of management.  "
good,"I've worked at the Nike Factory store in Vacaville for almost 3 years now. In the beginning I loved going to work, the employees and even management was great. Recently Nike fell under new management and the environment in the store has definitely changed and unfortunately not all for the better. But overall it is still a pretty okay place to work, and everyone loves the perks gained from being an employee, our discount is great!!"
good,Its ok. Its a normal job. Not too hard. Very manageable. Quite boring most of the time. AC works perfect. No sweating. May need a jacket most of the time
good,"I was a senior in high school while working at an outlet branch. Most of the other workers were high schoolers as well, excluding management. Most managers I really, really liked. One of them, who was the hiring manager was stingy about most things. But overall, it was a rewarding, and somewhat easy job. Definitely worth the compensation and clothes!"
good,Nike has great benefits as well as incentives for its' employees. Giveaways has always been an exciting yet rewarding time. The brand really does speaks for itself.
good,This job really helped me with my communication skills and how to be friendlier with people. Although there were always some rude and ignorant customers I always kept my cool and kept the customer experience positive. The management crew was always on top of things and never failed to point out any flaws I had in the work area which taught me how to really stay on top of my game. Overall I enjoyed working there and really learned a lot about how to communicate with others and how to keep a friendly work environment.
good,A typical day entailed verifying customer orders and picking them to totes. There are opportunities for advancement in many ways especially through cross- training.
good,More opportunities to grow within company but all in all i did enjoy my time with this company and i hope i can find something better that will allow me to stay for a long time
good,"Good fun company to work for only issue is lack of progression,free staff uniform and discount is a massive bonus. Overall a good company to work for and I would recommend"
good,Great environment and where you can achieve work life balance so much. Nike has such a good learning environment that encourages so much about self-studies and provides great tools and channels to do so.
good,"Respetan horarios laborales"
good,Nike is a great environment to work I learn people skills I enjoy coming to work everyday and the management is great and the discounts are great are good
good,"The culture of the company is awesome, they let you be yourself which is my favorite part. It is a judge free zone! Everyone gets a long and helps each other out when needed."
good,Going to work here was very fun. Everyone got along and it felt like a big team. The hardest part of the job was the long days because I was still in high school. I loved the job and it was never a dreadful day there.
good,"The Outlet was a lovely job mainly because of your co-workers, they are your lifeline throughout the day. Management was fair and understanding. Teamwork and conversation with your team made time fly and general chaos or calmness was a welcome change. The hardest part of the job will either be dealing with rude guests or finding a parking spot on the weekends. The most enjoyable part of the job was chatting with guests whom had a genuine interest in the products were more than happy to tell us why."
good,"La empresa es excelente, sólo en algunas ocasiones el capital humano no es el adecuado."
good,"yo trabaje 2 años muy buen ambiente laboral "
good,"Nike has a great work atmosphere with awesome management and staff. The whole team has a love for the job which leads to a strong, pleasant experience."
good,"A typical work day is very busy from every department but Ive learned a lot about my own leadership abilities. The hardest part of this job is the sometimes going above, beyond, and over hours for the betterment of the company and customers."
good,"A World Class organization from head to toe! Starting with the designs, to product manufacturing, to sales and management and through to customer service... this is a winning team!"
good,Leaving the company with many positives. The campus had a community vibe. Everyone enjoys their time at work. Very friendly positive atmosphere. learned a lot.
good,"Great environment and people to work around. Always upbeat and fun. Working with new product every day, always showing consumers what we have to offer that is new and improved. Management needs improvement for sure."
good,Nike has a multitude of opportunities for giving back to the community. The company volunteers with children who do not have much sport exposure. Nike creates an environment of funny and exploration for the kids.
good,"i came in the door wanting to know all areas of the company on the production floor..i did that ..get parking, security is always on point and they have a very nice cafeteria for the employee...fresh cooked food or ready made microwave goods"

good,Excelente equipe de trabalho e ótima estrutura de treinamentos para ajudar no conhecimento dos produtos.
good,"Really cool job, the people are really nice, give good benefits and give a lot of hours, only problem is that there's a lot of customers so it is demanding in the sense of urgency"
good,"The long term perks are unbeatable.  Plenty of PTO and sabbaticals every 5 years starting at 10 years of service.  As long as you got your job done, the work schedule was flexible.  Management was hit and miss.  Some were great and others out of their league.  The hardest part of the job was too many layers sometimes to get through to make a change."
good,"A work day consists of a set task to be completed before next shift of workers arrive while continuing to service consumers."
good,I learned a lot about the athletic industry and was able to work with a number of professional athletes.  I learned a lot of the technology of athletic footwear and apparel that is designed to increase athletes ability to perform.
good,Great work environment no matter what shift you have. the energy level are high at all times and the people you encounter are one of a kind.
good,"friendly staff "
good,The hardest part of the job is to willing someone work correctly and the enjoyable part of the job is that we can make new friends and learned lot from our coworkers and also how to manage thestore
good,fun environment to work they make sure employees are comfortable you get to wear shorts running pants and milers top and legend tees
good,Awesome brand to work with and gives you a great work life balance. The only thing about the brand is the salary is not at Par with industry standards.
good,I love the company in general and with the amazing management and coworkers that I have makes it even better. Nothing hard about the job if you enjoy meeting new people and selling.
good,"Trabajar para Nike ha sido muy positivo, puesto que el trabajador tiene cierta flexibilidad horaria y puede comunicarse directa y fácilmente con su superior."
good,"Enjoyable workplace, good management team and overall good group of people who work within the company. Throughout my time here i learnt a lot about time management, leadership skills, premium customer service to suit any customers needs."
good,"Working for Nike helps understand how globally present the brand is.  It is a fun, yet very professional environment.  The brand prides itself in premium consumer experiences and it treats its employees well!"

What i learn was how to be responsible with my attitude when customers come in complain or giving me a hard time . My Co-workers was fun and well respect knew how to work and make our company looks great. The most enjoyable part of my job is keeping the customers happy and satisfied.
good,"I interned at Nike during the summer of 2014.  I experienced an incredible environment to work in.  As an intern you are given an individual project to work on during your stay.  Projects are typically very challenging but doable. There's also a group project consisting of about 10 team members, though it's largely meaningless."
good,"A typical day at Nike would also be productive. There would always be something there for me to do. Working at Nike i learned how to price and process the merchandise. The management was great and so were the co-workers. They were very helpful when in need. There really were no hard parts to this job, everything was pretty simple.The most enjoyable part of the job was also meeting new people and working together as a team to complete the mission."
good,"Work days are mostly the same,  Co-workers were great to work with.  Hardest part of job was learning all the buildings on campus"
good,"It is a excellent working with SSIPl that to with NIKE Brand with excellent team and co ordination,Complete helpful and supporting team. wishing to change for Global exposure."
good,at times the store can be a circus very high volume of traffic.Managers are fun and care. you will never leave at your scheduled time
good,"Love this Job, People are great to work with, easy advancement with training, great benefits . The Hardest  part is around the Holidays with store hours being long, Other than that great company."
good,Nike was a wonderful experience. It was my part time during college. On a typical work day I would learn about new product launches mainly sneaker and apparel. I learned various customer service tactics an also I got a closer look at how nike actually does business. The work environment was comfortable but it didn't mean that we wouldn't get plenty done.
good,"Very fast growing company - highly recommend"
good,This store was one of the top ten biggest nike stores in the United States. There were a lot of employees and a ton of customers everyday. Working there is really worth while because of all the famous athletes and people that you personally get to assist in shopping. It was a great way of networking for personal goals. The hardest part of the job was getting to know everyone you worked with because of the numerous amount of people. The experience itself was great and made employees bring their A game everyday.
good,"Sales associate position requires working the sales floor and aiding any customer with product needs. Working environment is good and the employees are great. If really engaging with the consumer to identify their needs is what your looking for, this is the job for you."
good,I learned bout the different products that was in the store. Help the customer find what they are looking for. Also if the customer need to measure I would measure them.
good,"its nice environment to work in such aplace,u can learn more things about the customer service"
good,All the staff are very friendly and its a good envirmoment to work in.
good,"Changed this store in March 2013 from a factory to a clearance outlet. (Only two Nike Clearance Stores in TX) Harder work than factory, as I was informed, due to many more units to be sold; Mark downs, price checks, item inquires, etc. Loved the fast pace and competitive activities; everyone was to be part of the team. Had many wonderful store meetings where, as a team, we learned how to work together through our differences to make our store be the BEST. Each team member was appointed a specific section where their individual talents were best put to use. Management was great at first, strict but always asking if they could help or mentor to us, though so many new demands to meet was difficult. However after a few unsettling corporate visits, management turned over- thus a very unstable schedule, unreliable directions, and confusion skyrocketed."
good,The best part was coming in to work for a culturally global brand
good,"Pro's:"
good,"Assist customers in finding the best Nike product to fit their lifestyle. Ring customers up at register, work in stock room, restocking product, running tickets for co-workers, assisting multiple customers at a time."
good,"Overall I enjoyed working at Nike. People were great and even in the retail field, it was a rewarding place to work and I believe it is a solid company top to bottom."
good,"Nice Place to work. Lot of opportunities to learn, work and enjoy a life and work balanced organization."
good,Uma Empresa ótima de trabalhar oferece bastante oportunidade.
good,"1.) For the most part we are very busy."
good,"If you can make to the end of the first year, you are doing better than most. Make it to 3 and you have a good chance of making it to your sabbatical awarded on the 10th year."
good,vond het er heel aangenaam om te werken leuke collega en de dag ging goed vooruit je had afwisselende werk en je leerde er altijd iets bij
good,We worked out before we start working and everybody got alone. Have good team and supervisor and its worth working at
good,"The days are mostly busy, with so much to accomplish throughout the day. I've learned many skills in this work experience like team building, shipping/receiving and other key skills to help further my career. I have a solid rapport with my co-workers and management."
good,"I was the only support tech onsite so I had to do any and all IT work. The issue is that Nike has 2 different outsourced support (desktop and server) Since I was the only one there, I had to do both. I believe I was underpaid for the position, but it was a great work environment."
good,"A typical day at work includes Greeting, Engaging, Selling, and thanking the consumer for choosing our brand out of so many out there. I am a people person so the most enjoyable part of it was to interact with the people and their kids making that personal relationship so that they would feel comfortable coming back to the store. I learned how to delegate tasks and build plans around how much money we were projected to do. Controlling payroll tools while controlling the emotions of my team out on the sales floor. Learning how to teach each individual the ins and outs of the company so that they would learn it because not everyone learns the same way."
good,"Very flexible with schedule, very fast paced, fun, and plenty of tasks to do. Management isn't so great. I feel like they should take care of their employee's more."
good,"Работал в течении 3 месяцев летом и осенью, нужна была подработка. Из самых больших плюсов - коллектив, отзывчивые молодые парни и девушки, хорошее отношение к стажерам, всему что нужно научат и объяснят. Начальство отзывчивое , но требовательное, что в целом не раздражает и создает нормальную рабочую обстановку. Рабочий день стандартный для ритейла - всегда на ногах, но постоянно есть смена зон ответственности, поэтому скучать не приходится. По ЗП решает каждый сам, но меня 32+ в месяц устраивала. Платят вовремя. По графику все достаточно жестко, он устанавливается за месяц, пожелания учитываются, но сложно рассчитать все за столько времени. Планы и личные задачи есть, но они сильно не утомляют и не мешают работе. В целом работа трудоемкая и монотонная, но для начала карьеры вполне подходит."
good,"Le management participatif est un mode de collaboration très intéressante,cela permet d être impliqué avec sa hiérarchie à tout les niveaux."
good,"I love everything about Nike, and honestly would love to climb up the ladder but the management is so terrible that it makes working there almost annoying. Which should never be the way it just so happens that most of the management just do whatever they want and font really care about the full timers or part timers."
good,"At Nike, I assisted and provided support and advice to customers with any inquiries concerning footwear Clean up and organize footwear racks in the backroom. Kept footwear department organized and clean Set up and take down advertisements!"
good,"Productive and easy going day. Managment makes work easy, systems and rules are easy to follow. The energy is always welcoming and inspiring.Coworkers are always in a good mood."
good,Good atmosphere but management isn't the best fun place to work if you just work Keeping your area presentable is a huge part of the job. Make sure to always be smiling and presentable
good,"Everything was great . The experience, the process , the diversity and all. I love everything about it. The job was very simple and common sense & firm."
good,"Het is niet zomaar in een winkel werken, als je niet van hard werken houd is dit niks voor jou."
good,"I'd work for Nike again. it has a pretty good work environment. Has easy work, nothing to stressful. I Mean its hard work but easy at the same time. I think the hardest part about the job was standing up for 12 hours straight."
good,"I was a packer I packer out shoes sometimes I pick shoes also it a ok place to work,, I work on shelby dr it had a caffeine in it we had locks and security"
good,"A Typical Day at Nike was clocking in, coming with the gear that was needed for the job i would then go to my station and proceed to pack, hang ,box and ship clothing i also would print out the necessary paperwork needed. i learned how to process large transactions and ship and pack clothing and other things properly. Workplace culture was very hands on very hard on the back and feet lifting 50 or more pounds a day very challenging. i feel the hardest part of the job was standing for 12 or more hours a day and also very large orders i loved how loving everyone was at this job and how good the training was i also enjoyed the events they would host for employees and the pay/benefits."
good,"I loved how we were seen as family even if we were just seasonal employees. But to secure a permanent position you have to make sure to not be late, or call in, and sign up people for Nike plus. The plus side is you got a great discount and also at converse next door."
good,High paced and challenging work but very rewarding and fun. Very team oriented. Great advancement opportunities. Great in the community. Encouraging and open.
good,"Everything is cool however, some of the managers pick favorites, which can be a burden if; you want the development to move up in the company, or just gain knowledge to decide if you want to stay long term or not."
good,Loved working their was a temporary position that I will apply for again!! The working environment was splendid the trainers was amazing sharing company policies and information to help get you started!!
good,"El dia de trabajo es ameno, aprendi a trabajar en equipo, atender al cliente siempre bien predispuesto. La direccion y gerencia son muy exigentes pero se pueden lograr los objetivos. Lo que mas me gusta del trabajo es la venta"
good,Nike is a good place to work. The managers show they care about you. Nike definitely cares about the health and safety of its employees. Nike is also big on giving back to the community.
good,It was great for me I have a son who is in school and I worked 12 hour shifts on the weekends.my manager especially was the best around he understood it doesn’t take standing over your workers for them to get them to do their jobs.
good,I enjoy working here! every employee is pretty close to one another and we work as a team. Wearing that Nike Swoosh is such a privilege and I love working here.
good,"It was a simple transition because of my time at Fedex so most of it came naturally. If you are not willing to work 100%, this job is not for you. I enjoyed the managers as well as my coworkers and i found it easy to come to work everyday."
good,"The culture is fun and vibrant. Nike does everything out of Marketing and Management textbooks. Its a great learning experience. Pay is better than other retailers, and if you want to move up you will."
good,Working for Nike gave me the environment I had always hoped for but there's no true advancement. I always worked retail so I looked forward to working for Nike Lubbock but I didn't really enjoy it due to the management. I learned how to better provide customer service while also learning how to setup a store for the first ime.
good,Great place to work. If you're willing play the politics game if you want to advance within the store. Meaning go in as a clean slate and willing to learn and to be guided.
good,It is a fun place to work at with a relaxed atmosphere and an informal dress code.  Nike employees are given the liberty to work out at the Nike gym during work hours.
good,I loved working for Nike. It was a fun and interactive environment. Pay was fair for the area. I met a lot of people through this position and will remain friends with them for years to come.
good,"Nike was a great place to work. The managers were friendly, associates communicated very well, and the workplace environment was amazing. The discount associated with working here was very nice as well."
good,I learn how to correctly fold the clothes . The workplace was spaces but also sercured . Hardest part of the job is when u have a 150 piece of clothing and have to eithe fold them all or unfold and hang them
good,"Working at Nike is pretty laid-back, coworkers become family, managers are really chill and easy going. Working part-time under can be hard during months that are typically slower, business-wise. May get scheduled like 4 hours a week. Taking time off is pretty easy and switching shifts is easy as well."
good,"I would work with Nike again. People were fun,  The training was awesome, very interactive.  I made friends and we all has a great training.  I was sorry that they closed down chat"
good,"Great customer service, good benifits. Safe work environment. Healthy food menu and excellent work habits. High expectations for each employer and good customer feedback"
good,"During my time at Nike, I was accepted with open arms right from the start. my training was relaxed, yet thorough, and left with me an ample set of product knowledge necessary for the job."
good,"One of the best things about Nike was that if you're into sports, it doesnt feel like a job. Most people are on the same page and make you feel as comfortable as you can as you intend to help other people. Alongside with just the open door policy in which if anything is going on outside that you need to talk about then its also possible. If you love sports as much as I do it doesnt really feel like work."
good,Great place to work. Fun workplace environment. Great employee perks. Not much room for advancement in local stores. Employee training is very helpful and informative. Nike is great about recognizing employees for their contributions and accomplishments.
good,"Ottimo ambiente lavorativo."
good,"Nike e uma empresa excelente, Ótima com os funcionários"
good,Positive people trained properly come in on one accord yo fr goal accomplished. Management checks to see if anything is needed to help succeed far equipment. Things may get challenging time to time if product lines fail. Overall good work environment.
good,"My overall experience working with a great company was amazing.  it  was enjoyable experience, if love interacting with different people from all over the country."
good,"Clocking in, starting off with a fun activity, listing whole store goals and achievements and then meeting with you lead for your floor/stock/ visual for that day. Listing goals, tasks, initiatives to be done within the day, week or month. letting us know about campaigns, new items in store."
good,The atmosphere is fun and the managers are helpful when you don't know something. The store does operate as a team and it begins to feel like a family once you get to know everyone.
good,"Great place to work with. A typical day at work is getting everything cleaned up and prepared for the beginning of the day. it gets busy throughout the day, but with me working in Shipping and Receiving, our team would be able to process either apparel or shoes and sending them out to the floor."
good,The typical day at Nike is serving the customers while flourishing existing skills and newly acquired skills. I learned how to handle money efficiently and interact with hundreds of people in a fast pace environment. The culture in Nike is friendly and goal oriented. The goals are directed towards staff and customers. The hardest part of the job is being quick on your feet while helping thousands a people a day. The enjoyable part is everyone is there to work. Nike is about team work and taking the company where it needs to go while accomplishing the mission goal.
good,I enjoyed working for the company. Nike has very competitive pay and plenty of ways to advance in the company. Nike is also a fast paced and dedicated company where there's plenty of work to be done
good,The people and managers were fun to work with and pay is acceptable with great benefits. The managers there were also very understanding and flexible with shifts and vacation.
good,I enjoyed working for this company for the eight years i did. The pay was great and so were. Nike will help you grow to meet your goals as well as the company's goal. Nike will invest in you as much as you invest in them. The people are friendly and willing to help in anyway possible.
good,A typical day at Nike was always interesting. I've learned how to work with people with different type of ethnicity backgrounds. The biggest challenge at work was getting the sales. but it was all worth it once the guest left out of the establishment satisfied.
good,All the staff are fun and easy to get along with. Everyone is there to help each other and work together. There are a lot of social activities to get involved with and you get a great work life balance
good,"Great employees to work with, Fun enviroment. Hardest part of the job is due to the fact of location, we receive the hardest customers to deal with but we were trained how to calmly deal with any situation."
good,The enviroment at Nike was very high and welcoming the fellow employees where just like me a university student. Very friendly managers that helped yo with any problem that occured
good,"Ive only been hired at Nike for a month (Feb. 7,2018 is when i started)"
good,"This place is inspiring. The history that surround the logo itself is something that can be read, held, worn, and seen in everything that Nike represents today. Innovation and Strength. Great company."
good,"Excelente ambiente de trabajo, gran compañerismo y alianza con los miembros de la empresa"
good,"It was my first job there and I was excited to be there since I mainly have been wearing Nike's apparel and sneakers for most of my life. At first I thought it was going to be easy doing processing and stocking but as about a week has passed, it was really difficult as you have to be extremely fast on processing from apparel, sneakers and accessories and have to make sure that you were able to process your items on time or by at least a couple of minutes after the timer. Management was great when I was there as they gave me advice on everything and of course I wasn't able to keep the job but the guys there would welcome me back and I would love to join the team."
good,"Everyone there is a goal oriented individual who didn't mind working as a team. I would say that the motto of the business is teamwork. The mangers aren't just bosses to report to, they are team members there to help when needed."
good,I have working at NIKE full-time (More than 7 years). I enjoyed working around so many positive people.I learned so much about team work and  leadership.

good,"If you have the drive and love for the brand then this is the place for you . Awesome place to work. Company ativites, on site classes. I would recommend this play for any person who is loyal to this brand"
good,"Daily I would be either following up on current projects or current quality issues typically through email. It wasn't challenging, but it was EXTREMELY education. I got a crash course in how large-scale business works, and how to effectively navigate a matrix that at first was confusing, but every resource it at your fingertips to help you."
good,"I was working in this company for four years and I left it for comming to Australia. "
good,"It is an upbeat experience, very vibrant. Family oriented setting. Could be slow at times. Opportunities to be promoted high. Could be slow at times. Most managers are easy going."
good,Great place to start and move up in the company. Awesome managers and staff. Extremely motivating and willing to help. Beautiful area and very busy. Willing to train.
good,Working at Nike has been one of the best companies I've ever worked for. They really care about their associates. The brand is amazing and the staff is excellent.
good,"Helping a consumer with a missing package or placing a  new order documenting each call and checking the knowledge base to confirm it was handled properly. Making the consumer feel like we are on their side , like were family and always have their back if the consumers comes across any issue"
good,Nike is a great job for anyone who enjoys a fast placed team oriented job. There is always the chance to excel if you have the mindset to succeed and work hard. Management is very attentive and wants you to succeed. The discounts are great and you will soon find you closet packed full of Nike wear. There is potential for a lasting career at Nike Inc.
good,"Great place to work at, learned the culture of representing the brand. Very enthusiastic, family orientated, and self motivated employees that get the job done."
good,"Excellent people and facilities. Progressive ideation is welcomed and implementation of good ideas is fostered daily. If you are a self-starter who can pivot quickly in a team environment, NIKE is a good place for you."
good,"Me gusta ser organizado, cada día tener una pequeña platica con mis compañeros de trabajo para compartir que nos hace falta reforzar, también para celebrar las victorias."
good,"Le type de journée typique au Nike Factory Story de Plaisir pour un conseiller de vente est de gérer l'approvisionnement, faire en sorte que les rayons soit clean et présentable aux clients, conseiller et aider les clients dans leurs choix, pour faire en sorte d'augmenter le CA."
good,"You do not get a lot of hours, hours are about 15 a week and its hard to pick up shifts. However the environment at work is amazing! Everyone is so helpful. Most of the management is wonderful. Nike is very consumer based and are huge on their heritage. I generally love going to work but I am having a hard time breaking even each month because of the lack of hours."
good,"Nike is a great company to work for with many perks."
good,"The job is fairly easy in the sense that you know what you are talking about. Do not go into Nike thinking its going to be easy , if you are not a fan of sports."
good,"buen trato con el personal, es genial el compañerismo"
good,The employees love their job and everyone can have fun which makes the culture great! Benefits are great too. Given the opportunity I would go back to Nike.
good,"NikeTown NY is the optimal starting place for anyone interested in building a career with Nike or just looking for a job that compensates well, with a busy but always fun environment and staff."
good,Nike Retail offers a great opportunity to develop sales experience in a fast paced environment. Managers and coworkers are enjoyable people to work with and overall I had a great experience here.
good,"On a typical day at work I would be working mainly in the stock room pricing and labelling new stock to go out onto the shop floor. I learned  a lot about the quality of the brand's clothing and the different uses for different materials of clothing. The management was very friendly and understanding. It is a good place to gain experience of working in a team as you are in constant contact with other colleagues in the store through a earpiece system. The hardest part of the job was probably dealing with the odd customer, but mainly with theft within the store of the shop's stock. The most enjoyable part of the job was probably working with colleagues who would eventually become friends and seeing the brand new products as they came in as we would get to choose from the new products as this was required of us to wear them as our work clothing."
good,"Nike was a great temporary job for me.  I was not looking to make it my career, as I worked here while I was a full time college student as well.  They offer you raises, give you bonuses (based on your store's sales), they are flexible with your hours, you can request days off in advance.  Co-workers and management was very friendly and it was like a family.  "
good,"I really enjoy the working environment of Nike its really energetic and friendly people generally have a really great attitude and approachable presence. I would meet all kinds of awesome people from many different backgrounds, I've been able to make some great friendships there. I learned many great skills such as handling customer service situations and handling large cash register sales. Learning all departments and opening and closing store procedures. How to work with unit inventory processing, shipping and receiving."
good,Managers ensured that all employees had the skill-set to perform on the sales floor while making it a positive and enjoyable work environment
good,"Started working here just to make extra money and the discount. I've unexpectedly, found an extended family. The people there are pretty cool, fun, and brings so much personality to the work place. You can learn a lot about the business IF YOU'RE INTERESTED in doing so, flexible work schedule, and the pay isn't bad either. The hardest part of the job is being around some people that don't work as hard as you may."
good,"Very challenging and compelling work."
good,High-performing seller who increases profitability through innovative product section. Talented Customer Service Associate skilled at balancing customer needs and company demands. Effectively builds loyalty and long-term relationships with customers while achieving all individual sales goals.
good,Great place to work  fast pace and great product that sell themselves and great fan base or customers that love the product those that are knowledgeable
good,"We worked 9 hour days as salary manager. You had the autonomy to make decisions to run the business and were not micromanaged in any way. The turn over with high school associates was challenging at times, but a great place to work."
good,"I have nothing but positive things to say about this company! NIKE is all about their employees and the customers. The management team is awesome, and co-workers are awesome as well. We were all one big family. There wasn't any favoritism between management and hourly employees, everyone was treated equally. Hard work didn't go by unnoticed, and employees were always recognized for hard work."
good,Very entertaining place of work with great employees and customer interaction. Footwear and Apparel premium product at it's finest..Product was always KIng.
good,"Management is great and so are coworkers. you receive wonderful discounts, sometimes they cut your hours if you are part-time under, so have a good availability if you really need the money. pay is above new minimum wage."
good,"Working the Nike camps is a great experience for future coaches and learning how to manage a large group of kids. It helped me create a fun and yet efficient environment for kids to enjoy working hard. "
good,It is a great company to work for with good team members and team management. The work environment is amazing and the processes are good.
good,"A typical day at Nike consists of helping customers, keeping store neat and clean, and check customers out. This job has taught me great teamwork skills. The management was great and very motivating. I really enjoyed work with my co-workers. We all worked very well together. The hardest part of the job would probably be working with a product I wasn't passionate about. The most enjoyable part was definitely be working with a great staff and getting a great discount."
good,There are plenty of opportunities to grow within the company. You also get the chance to work with those who have started at the athlete level but over the years have moved into management positions.
good,it was my first job and i was described as best employee by my employer and best customer service provided. it was fun working there. i do cash there as well.
good,"Great place to work.  High energy, fun environment.  Competitive and balanced.  Fast paced.  Committed workforce, strong connection to sport in everything we do."
good,"Fun and competitive work environment with supportive management. Delivering results and aligning key business relationships and partnerships is how we win the day. Decent amount of red tape and politics, but this is expected of a big company, especially during start up phase."
good,"Great place to work for a part time job. Management team now has made a bit of a difference, so it's not that great like before.."
good,"A fun yet often times challenging place to work. Management was very supportive and willing to help with career advancements and product knowledge. Coworkers were generally upbeat and productive as well as very attentive towards customers. The hardest part of the job would be during our busier seasons, knowing the long list of tasks I wanted to complete but only having limited hours to complete them. The most enjoyable part of the job would have to be the friendships made with not only the coworkers but with the consumers as well."
good,"Working at Nike was a fun experience, a typical day consisted of helping the consumer find the right product that meet their specific needs/wants. Another one of my duties were making sure the store shelves were fully stocked and after store hours in the store were spent cleaning up and preparing the store for the next day. I learned a lot about shoes and shoe technology that I never thought I would need to know. I have no complaints about management at the store; they were approachable if you ever had an issue work related or personal. My co-workers were also great very friendly and enjoyable to work with. I guess the hardest part of the job was trying to meet the customers specific needs when it came to shoes and how they functioned and looked. sometimes the customers were very picky in what they wanted for shoes but regardless we had to meet the consumers needs as best we could. Coincidently the most enjoyable part the job was being able to fully satisfy the consumers needs perfectly, it made you feel accomplished knowing that you had a satisfied customer leaving the store after their purchase; and of course the store discounts weren't bad either."
good,"•	Organized shipment room for receiving of next day’s shipment."
good,i worked with Nike for almost 6 months .it was really nice. people were very nice specially my boss who was area manager for Nike James Cobus who supported me to learn more about my work.i did shipping and receiving there with RF scanner. i also operated desk there for two months my job was to lead forklift drivers and help them resolving their problems with tasks.

good,over all a great store to work with. its always fun and always has a great environment
good,I was not a full time with Nike. I was from some service base company and working for Client Nike but because of technical expertise and being a good team player I got chance to lead a team at Nike. Love to work at Nike being a full timer.
good,Management is great and the discounts that come along with being employed by NIKE is a plus.
good,"All my manager are great people always whiling to do the imposible to make us have a great day at work. Nike its a very, very busy store you always have something to do"
good,Loved working here! Learned something new everyday. Everyone was on the same team. Management was great. Coworkers became family. Hardest part of the job was not buying everything in the store. Loved representing the company as a whole. Only downside was the small raise you got after being there for 1 year.
good,"As am working in a Retail field the first thing that am doing once i reach the Store is to have a Floor walk in the Store to make sure everything is fine and where all changes need to be done. Once done then i am dividing the work among the Staffs so the Store is ready before it  opens for the customer's. Once ready with the floor then am contacting our buying team and management related things to the head Office."
good,I would highly recommend Nike to future employees. As a whole the company provides a  great  atmosphere and fun tean enviroment.
good,"The workplace was enjoyable to be a part of, whilst the management would still push productivity levels, keeping motivation high."

good,Nike is een goeie werkgever waar je veel kunt leren als je maar gemotiveerd bent.
good,I loved working for the company I only left because I relocated and at the time there wasn’t a comparable role for me near my home. If there was something close by I would reapply
good,"1/Know how to communicate with colleague. 2/Learn deeply about providing good service for customers. 3/Team is very significant for you. 4/Good communication skills will bring you good reputation and advantage. These are what I learned from this part-time job."
good,It was a good company to work for...the work atmosphere was good and everyone got a long until management changed and lost some employees due to the change.
good,"Most days start slow but quickly pick up near noon. There is a lot to learn when working with different people in each area of the store. Especially in marketing for the store and choosing what will be the key pieces the store will market to consumers visiting during a sales campaign. Hardest part of the job is combating with theft, which is not common, but inevitable when it comes to some of the product unfortunately. Most enjoyable part of the job is the environment because it is a very relaxed job though hard work is necessary to continue enjoying the day."
good,Nike has very specific core values that i was interested to learn. The work was not very hard but it did keep you on your toes. Managers were more than fair.
good,Buena empresa pero en crecimiento se basan más en tiempo que en aptitudes. En cuanto a prestaciones está súper
good,"The management is the only thing that needs worked on, and that would be considered a negative. You get paid 11 an hour and they provide with you shoes and clothing every couple months."

good,"In the Nike store in Barcelona, I was working for 6 years, with the luck that the group of workers were always the same people.

good,"Receiving merchandise, stocking shelves, merchandising, markdowns, customer service, visual displays, sales reporting, scheduling, hiring, training, store operation proceedures"
good,Nike was a fun environment to work with a friendly atmosphere. The fellow employees were nice and great to work with. I have learned time management skills and work ethic.

Mi trabajo consistía en atender a un gran flujo de gente, para cumplir con los KPI que nos daban en una previa reunión antes de comenzar el día laboral, nos enseñaron a trabajar con números y estadísticas para mejorar día a día, estuve a cargo del área de Footwear, lo mas difícil del trabajo fue aprender a liderar un equipo compuesto de 9 personas part-time. Lo que me encanto de esta empresa fue lo que siempre inculcaron del respeto hacia el compañero y jefatura, teníamos muchos beneficios, comedor limpio, computadores en buenos estados, buen uniforme para trabajar. buena disposición para ayudar cuando había algún problema de recurso humano, mucha transparencia, etc. El equipo de jefatura estaba compuesto por 6 personas las cuales siempre mostraron sus capacidades y competencias que tenían para estar a cargo. Muy buenas personas y buenos lideres."
good,My time there was a joy. The workday was exciting. I looked forward to coming in early knowing that the reports that I generated were to be used by each department. The challenges were invigorating.
good,"One year out of high school, I was blessed with a Nike retail associates position. At first, I really enjoyed going to work, the fellow employees, and manager's were constantly motivating and made work fun. The reason for my departure was simply because of the hours I was given on a weekly basis. Week by week, my hours dropped from 24 to just working one 4 hour shift during the week and not making enough money to support myself."
good,Great place to work. Easy if you know what to do. I love a fast paced job it lets my day go by as quick than i ever expected. nike is a highly recommended place to work.

good,"Nike is great, point blank period. The expectations are clearly communicated, resources are abundant, benefits are great, and the daily job is enjoyable.The only drawback, which is normal for retail, is the schedule. IF this job was 9 to 5 Monday through Friday I would never look for other opportunities."

good,Fast-paced and attention to detail is a must working in production. customer satisfaction is key. Typically spend the day trying to meet goal. It helps to have a great team in which everybody is focused on productivity numbers. Guaranteed to make at least 40 hours a week every week.
good,"- Maintaining a store environment that is a pleasant experience for customers by managing many employees simultaneously. Work begins fairly early in the morning, often before the retail location opens, and an 8- to 10-hour workday begins. Retail managers handle a wide variety of routine tasks, such as writing reports; supervising employees; managing cash; ordering stock; handling schedules, payroll, and marketing and promotional roll-outs; and securing the store upon closing. In addition, a retail manager can expect to deal with customer complaints, employee work delegation, staff shortages, equipment failures and other unexpected things that occur in a retail environment."
good,A typical day at work for me includes helping customers with size checks and offering them similar alternatives if we do not have the product they are looking for. Also I try to make it personal with every customer to find out why they are here and if they need suggestions on what shoe is best for what.

good,"Everyday you get set up with walkies, mobile devices, and sometimes a key depending on where your department is. it's slow but sometimes boring on weekdays."

good,"Pay is good, work is easy to learn and hrs are good. Most supervisors so far have been good. The benefits are great and so far compared to any other job I have had, this one beats them all. If you work part time, you work 5 hrs a night but they most of the time, almost every day ask me to stay over. So you have the option to stay for more hrs."
good,I enjoyed working at Nike. It was my first job I got and I think it gave me such an amazing opportunity with retail experience and just the company in general. I liked my coworkers and bonded with some and butted heads with others but still got the job done in the end. I learned to be myself and exute my personality to others while helping them and make sure every customer was satisfied.
good,"I loved working for such a high paced exciting company, Everyday was different and fun. Time of my life! The only baby gripe I have is that I ended up knowing how to do my job better than my managers did in situations just because I normally was in the  stock room by myself, there were times that if I had questions I was unsure who to ask. You also will run into problems getting hours around seasonal time when they hire 20+ new people to help out with the holidays or other busy times of the year."
good,"Great work-life balance, loved the employee discounts on merchandise. Hard to move up within the company. great job security"
good,As a sales associate I learned a great deal about quality customer service. Managers were extremely kind and really cared about their employers. Overall a great workplace environment.

good,"I came into Nike out of highschool and matured there as time went. My coworkers were very outgoing, and management were very helpful and caring. The benefits at Nike were great, from the giveaways, 401k match, and health insurance. I have meet many Nike professional athletes and artists during my duration at Nike. Some days were easy going and some required much work."
good,working at the nike store can bring some challenges. its a busy store so you will have to attend to customers and provide great customer service !!
good,"Me gusto estar en contacto con el publico, sin embargo no fue suficiente el salario para el horario pactado."
good,"Muy buena empresa, excelentes prestaciones, el ambiente laboral es bueno para el desarrollo del personal."
good,I enjoyed working at NIKE because there was such a team effort in making the customers feel comfortable in what they were selecting to buy.  I learned about the products with the management having team learning once a week before the store opened.

good,"Ta emot inkommande samtal samt mail. Orderregistrering, utfärda tullhandlingar vid leveranser och fakturering. Ha ansvar för vissa marknader som Finland, Norge och England. Även vara back up åt säljare med te x skriva offerter. Vara mässvärdinna vid utställningar. Hjälpa till i växel och med post. Lärt mig allt om kontorsjobb även få social kompentens. Jag har också lärt mig att jobba med både telefon och data samtidigt. Det var bra ledning med tydliga mål. Trevliga och hjälpsamma kollegor. Det svåraste var att ibland inte hinna med att besvara mail eller inte kunna ge bra service som sända reservdel vid kris hos företag. Det bästa var att få vara med vid kundbesök samt ha olika arbetsuppgifter. Det blir omväxlande och lärorikt."
good,"Retail is retail. You'll have the opportunity to fold clothes and organize shoes."

good,I love working at Nike. Although its a lot of walking and standing up it is a very productive job.
good,"Typical day consisted of premium customer service to anybody that walked through that door. Lead a team of individuals to fulfill daily tasks such as cleanliness of store, putting away merchandise, making sure they went on their breaks on time, organization of product and so forth. Hardest part was dealing with difficult customers at times but regardless i always kept a positive attitude. Most enjoyable part of my job was the interaction with customers and helping telling them about the technology of sneakers and nike product."
good,I was at work and a lady came in looking for some running gear at a great price.Well it was her lucky day because she had came in on one of our sale days. I gladly showed her all our clearance running gear and let he take a look at some of the nice things we had that day. After helping her find a few pieces she like she was happy with everything I helped her find. I learned that helping people can always be a great thing at the end of the day. Its a great feeling knowing that you just make someone happy.
good,"A typical day at work was just like any other day,had the same type of rotations and somedays things get hectic but we always found a way to overcome obstacles to get our daily tasks done. I learned a lot of things around the department because I didn't want to just do one thing all the time so i can help out different parts of the building if I was needed.  My co-workers have good communication with me at work, in terms of getting things done and we have a pretty good friendship. The hardest part of my job was getting off extra late. The most enjoyable part of the job was coming to work to see all my friends.  "
good,I worked with Nike as an intern. The best part about Nike is its culture. The culture is casual and lot of fun but at the same time dynamic and agressive and not compromising anywhere on the quality of work. The managment and co-workers are very supportive which makes you feel a part of team and the organization.
good,"Registro de horario,saludar a cada uno de mis compañeros colegas,una pequeña junta impartida por mis compañeros gerentes para evaluar nuestro desempeño,ver fortalezas,debilidades y en que debemos poner mas empeño y atención."
good,"I worked for Nike for about a year and a half and it was very fun to say the least. The management teams of both stores I worked in were great. The employee discount was awesome, and they supply you with your work attire. This job is great for college students, as they are really flexible with scheduling. This company is headed in the right direction and I would be glad to work there again!!!"

good,This job was about giving consumers the best experiance possiable while fulfiling daily tasks. I learned a lot about working as a team to complete projects as well as what a functional work enviorment  is. The hardest part of this job was that it was always changing but that might have been the thing i enjoyed most. It was a challege and it made the job entertaining.
good,"Aprendi a trabalhar em equipe, a melhor me organizar e a organizar planilhas, arquivos e etc."
good,when I got there they was impressed of the knowledge that I have of wear house and how fast caught on to the process of the work they had us doing.
good,A typical day at Nike is coming in at 6 am and checking inbounds for the new footwear that is coming in for the say. I would then proceed to check quantity of shoes and decided and plan what shoes to hash for the new shoes coming in that day. At 10 am we open the store and that's when we inter act with consumers and try to get them in the right shoes for them.  Management and co-workers are great people that are always willing to help. The hardest thing about my job is trying to plan for unexpected footwear that doesn't show up on the inbound comes in. The best thing about my job is working for Nike and helping consumers find the right shoe and putting a smile on the kids face when you find the perfect shoe for them.
good,Team meetings and daily goal setting. Management meetings and senior leadership meeting. Hourly view of department and how it  progressing to the daily goal.

good,"I had the good fortune of working with some true professionals and teams that I learned process improvement skills along with outside the box thinking and having the ability to apply those ideas."
good,"A typical day at work would include selling product, adding on to sales, and meeting daily goals. Management is always there to answer any questions right away. Co-workers are all my team mates. the hardest part of the job is that one customer that is out to get you for no particular reason, just remain calm if that happens. The most enjoyable part is the fun we have BBQ's, Road trips to WHQ, catering on special events."
good,"Great place to work. Too far from New England roots."
good,A typical day at work is fast paced.I learned the importance of diversity while working for this company. Management is always helpful. My co-workers were fun and great to be around.

good,It was a good place to work a lot of people the will help me get the work done right I have good hours the pay is okay a lot of Computer work on the daily
good,The break room was always a fun and relaxing area. Team members respect each other and space . There were lockers to secure your belongings. Area designated for food storage and drinks. We would occasionally have team building activities to bond and get to know each co worker better.
good,Great atmosphere and people great mgrs and benefits but the PAYMUST IMPROVE I was in shipping and print and apply I should have got a bigger raise did great job but my pay raise was only 23 cents that's why I quit
good,"Las atenciones por parte de la gerencia son muy buenas, son muy flexibles para estudiante, da muchas oportunidades de crecimiento y un buen ambiente de trabajo"
good,It was over all a good place to work. The work is pretty easy but long hours. You can start in less than a week you will like it. Food was provided for everyone to buy. Great environment.
good,I loved working for the company and everyone I worked with was great. I got the training when I needed it and the management team was extremely helpful. I went through a major life changing event during my time working there and I can say that working at Nike and the Team I was with was the only reason I’m here today. This was such a wonderful experience
good,It’s a very good job in general little to no complaints about this job I think that this job would work for anyone it does get slow after the holidays but it’s very manageable and they do work with you if you are a student college or high school
good,"Because as a Nike employee you work as a team sometimes you might have to stay later to finish as a team. The goal is to show Why Nike is the company it is , if you can’t support that, then it is not the company for you"
good,I enjoyed working at Nike because everyone was nice and loving. You got the hours you wanted and made very good money. Also all the mangers did their jobs at a great pace with lovely attitudes
good,"Empresa con grandes valores en su cultura, tanto en el trato con el cliente como el trato hacia el personal."
good,"Basically I try to connect with the consumers who comes in the store . What I learned from Nike is that, I'm not selling the product but help them get the right product they're looking for .  Management is great , they always make sure I'm okay first. Nike wants to promote how we can embrace different cultures. The hardest part about this job is cleaning up peoples mess that they make! People I work with are amazing , I have my own cool relationship with everyone and I learned a lot about different culture."
good,i worked in the inventory control office . the most enjoyable part of the job was that i got into the nike factory .my co workers were very nice. management was great . i learned alot of things inside that workplace.

good,A very friendly work environment where you can grow and also meet all types of different people from across the world.
good,"May 2013- August 2013 "
good,"Productive and safe place to work.Energetic and and solid about meeting company values. Treat all co-workers with fairness and respect. I've learned the morals of any company that the customers are always right, so we the employees work as a team to get the job done to get their product out in a timely manner. The most enjoyable part of the job is knowing that the team accomplished every thing correctly and the customers were satisfied with their product."
good,Work environment can be a bit dull and irritating mainly due to the lack of employee coverage. Fun place to work if you have fun people to work with. Great product though.
good,"Unlocking seamless access to products, services, and tools to make athletes better. As a Digital Brand Executive, I'm  in charge of building and maintaining relationships with our consumers leveraging all available digital connection points.  To be a Digital Brand Executive is to put relevant digital platforms at the center of all brand marketing activations, obsessing digital journey and consumers experience at nike.com across all categories."
good,The good thing about working for Nike is that it’s Nike. Basically you get access to all updated product rather if it’s the new Jordan’s or vapor mix. The bad thing about working where I work for Nike is the management. Management needs to be redone because people came in before quit people came in with me quit people came in after me quit all because of management
good,Looking for a desk representative job ao that i can serve customers and also be able to be a positive impact woth customers. Customer Satisfaction is the number one priority.
good,"Empresa dinâmica e agradável ambiente de trabalho, serviço bem distribúído, bom horário de refeição, mas peca um pouco na gerência."
good,Teaching girls how to play basketball. Overnight camp. Long hours gams all day
good,"Not an ideal place to work if you want to enjoy some weekends off. Some of the managers are rude, and just look to get people in trouble. Overall easy job."
good,"Great work environment and great people, just not enough for me to build a real sustainable life and maintain a home. The pay is good but minimal in the aspect of financing a family. The opportunity to move up is a slow process and after 4 years I realized I can put my efforts towards another opportunity that put me in position to be in management."
good,As a part time athlete I’m treated like I’m full time. I’m also a college student and they do not really have an availability that allows a balanced schedule. My weekends are never spent with my free time I am always there for the entire day.
good,"Hardest part was lifts the pallets that could b 20 to 30 peices at a min of 75lbs"
good,Good place to work for shoe lovers and athletes and retail experts. Nice co workers just need very flexible schedule. Not many hrs though. Would work again part time
good,My first supervisor was very fair and cool. She didn't let anybody get away with anything. My second supervisor was a total jerk and flirt showed favoritism and fired me when I got pregnant
good,great place to work working flexible hours coaches set schedule and work with you to achieve sales success. love the opportunity to advance products to all youth in colorado
good,the managers were very unprofessional and the store was very in organized and lost when it came to management went through different managers every 2 months it would've been a better experience if management were better.
good,"Nike is a great company to work for and, depending on which store you work in, you will see love it. However, advancing can be difficult, depending on the store. Its easier to grow in smaller, slower stores. Management, especially in larger stores, exhibit favoritism, making advancement pretty difficult. However, the company itself is a good one to work for."
good,Nike is Nike you get free apparel twice a year and the bonus is nice. Alot of different personalities that can create issues but the onsite cafateria is awesome
good,"I like working for Nike and knowing there was job security. I felt there was always a team effort and environment."
good,i picked shoes off the line put them in boxes label them and shipped them.
good,Exciting environment and loved the people I had the opportunity to interact with but management is just terrible. During training they hammer on things that end up not being relevant in the actual job in regards to performance reviews and how they actually want you to do things. They insist that you harass the customers constantly by saying hi and introducing yourself or asking if they need help every time they come into your section no matter how many times they’ve been in your section already. The coach that I was assigned to was never present in the store and then had the audacity to try to tell me that I wasn’t talking to people when I was and other coaches had told me about how great I was with the customers and even got multiple shoutouts from customers and other coaches. They wonder why they get the negative feedback about the shopping experience that do but to me it’s clear as day. Nothing will change there until the management is revamped.
good,"You will learn a lot about the industry and how to work with different personalities, etc. Performance driven company so no room for error! Great first job."
good,"Nike is a fun place to work and atmosphere but in riverhead the employees run the store,and the management is poor. You want no life work at Nike. You will have No free time. Hours are long. Store is full of drama"
good,"La tienda es genial,el ambiente bastante bueno,el producto que ofrecemos es fantástico."
good,My overall experience was great I learned as much as I could in the short period of time.I would love the opportunity to work as a permanent employee for a more stable job and for the benefits
good,"not good management, she was very hard to deal with and was very inconsistent with scheduling, also didn't flex well with school schedules or other jobs."
good,"Management could use better training, and treat nike as a company with employees as humans versus micro-managing and running the store as a business versus a dictatorship"
good,"Fue un mal momento de administración en la tienda de temuco, pero todo bien en general con la empresa"
good,"A typical day at work consists on hustle, no time for resting rather than break and lunch. Job environment is very friendly, coworkers are cool. Unfortunately management is lacking of horizon as they stress employees right before visit to evaluate are to happen."
good,"Uma empresa muito boa para se trabalhar, gerente muito capacitado aprendi muito com ele e com meus colegas, tanto sobre processos administrativos quanto em gestão de pessoas. Porém por ser uma empresa de varejo não tem campo para meu crescimento que é área administrativa."
good,Worked there in the security field...very interesting I learned a lot of things...the staff was awesome..I logged trucks in and out checked bags in and out...etc.
good,The most interesting and enjoable part of the job is we meet different people everyday and getting know how give them good service and having good raport is something great...
good,It is a nice environment for any who is willing to welcome challenge and competition. Working there give the opportunity to be smart and result oriented.
good,"While working at Nike, I gained the skills of time management, balancing registers, multi tasking, working well with clients and customers, meeting deadlines and goals, as well as advertising products, apparel, and shoes. Serve as a product knowledge resource for consumers and entry-level associates. Seek educational opportunities to develop advanced level or specialized knowledge about selling, all products and culture, sales and service techniques"
good,It was definitely a fun job to work at for young college students like myself but i felt that my personal life was getting in the way of me doing my job effectively because i was not focused on the job. I knew the pay rate wasn't what i wanted it to be so i wasn't as focused as i should have been. I know the easier part of the job was talking to customers and getting a chance to really show my personality to other people and the hardest part would have to be knowing all the different shoes.
good,"I get in and take care of my duties with no complaints. I've learned how to check and seal packages and how to ship them off. Management is good. My co- workers are great, easy to work with.There's nothing hard about the job. The fun part is meeting new people with positive attitudes."
good,"o trabalho era normal , tem que cumprir com a função , aprendia noções de como e funcional um par de tênis esportivo , a gerencia era boa mas faltava dialogo entre nos , a equipe era boa não tinha o que reclamar , o acesso  chega rápido no trabalho , a parte difícil era a falta de dialogo com a gerencia"
good,If I can I’ll go back in a heartbeat The staff the people and the environment all made it feel like home even though I spend most of my time there I wasn’t complaining because I was surrounded with love.
good,"Excellent discounts, Fun, Fast place to work. Always something to do. Must be a self starter. Meet different people everyday that comes and visit Nike."
good,"Greet customers"
good,"I am currently a footwear athlete at Nike, i started this job because, i had a love for the company and I always kept a shoe collection throughout my younger years. But, now i think its time i move on and, i start my career. My typical day is the same, we keep the product filled and neat for customer satisfaction. We make sure they are available for a wide range of consumers at all times."
good,"I was a seasonal Worker at Nike. The work environment was great seeing how I was a college student working there. Not really a ""career"" but more of a ""job"""
good,Helping customers find products and promoting the sale is a typical day. Hopping on and off the cash register to help out is always needed. I learned to work in a fast paced environment and multitasking while still providing great customer service.
good,"i like nikes, i live for nikes, i buy nikes, i rock nikes, i worked at nikes, nikes rock very comfortable nikes. i left nike, the inventor wasn't even name nike."
good,Empresa onde se trabalha com muito dinamismo e agrado.
good,"The factory jobs were hard, they were either hot or extremely cold, it depends on the season you work there. But the people, they were truly down to earth, the other coworkers, made work feel less like a stress but more like a job that I wanted to go to everyday."
good,"Great workplace needs to improve in leadership rolls. It is difficult when they have a lot of turnover in certain stores.However, if they focus on leadership roles and building their teams people will be able to advance in the company allowing for stability."
good,"Uma boa empresa,com bons benéficos e ótimos profissionais exceto a gerente que cometia muitos erros com a loja e seus funcionários..."
good,"Sem duvida , ainda estaria trabalhando na mesma se não fossem as crises que surgiram ao longo desses últimos anos."
good,"Enjoyed working for this company a lot. They really try to apply the professional edge to retail. Unfortunately it is not commission, so the income is weak, but if you have the heart for the job, product, and team you work with, you'll be easily satisfied."
good,"Okay place to work, they will give anyone a chance but overall it is grueling and high stress, not for the faint of heart.  I worked here 3 years and had to work nearly all holidays.  "
good,Nike store is stepping stone for any individual who wants an introduction in the working place and is also a fun place to work.
good,"Daily meeting with management.  "
good,"you are always busy but there it is almost impossible for advancement. I was there for 4 years and couldn't get out of the sales associate position. too much politics so I got out before it got worse. Great pay for the most part, benefits and product"
good,"My review is the job is very good because I was able to deal with all kinds of people from all walks of life.  I learned a lot from communicating, socializing, sales and customer service.  My co-workers are really helpful and we are a big team that leads to a very good sales achievement. The hardest part of the job was during sale time we're we had to work longer hours and sometimes overnight.  The most enjoyable part is the training where we get to play and learn at the same time and when we're able to deliver it in real customer service and selling."
good,"Nike is a great facility once you are hired permantely. There are great benefits with room to advance in the company. The company has a store that grants access to permanent  and Kelly temp employees. It also has great cafeteria food. The environment is usually calm, while working continously. The work is not hard, as long as everybody does their part. Nike is a great place with a great team."
good,"A typical day at Nike was fun, funny, and fast. We worked as a team that became family. We laugh and made numbers daily we folded, packed, seperated,cleaned, and lunch together. I will those was the best."
good,"Nice experience with nice people , it was very greatfull"
good,Everyone is passionate about the company and the brand. There is a team great spirit. I've enjoyed working there and i had nothing to complain about. Managers are great too
good,"It was a friendly work environment but, I was in a bad car accident on the way home. It was stressful and hard enough to loss my car and deal with medical injuries but I lost my job because no one submited my doctor notes I provided. It was a very stressful time. If only management took a little more care of the workers it would of been a better review but it wasn't as caring as I imagined Nike to be after the videos about what Nike stood for. But I guess that have to get you pumped to work for them."
good,"good working enviornment developed skills I can use in different places including new work places as well as outside communications, I would recommend"
good,The job was very easy. Nothing was hard about it. People was very nice. Very hands on. Hours was 8 to 10 hours. Very open for overtime great pay and great opportunity to move up
good,It was a productive work environment. I learned a lot from my peers and supervisors. Communication with customers and my colleagues was excellent for such a high pressure environment.
good,"Nike is  good okay to work. Good hours,decent pay, food onsite. After three to six months or longer if production and attendance is good you'll be able to have a chance to roll over"

good,"Hands down, the best company I have ever worked for. A very diverse and inclusive company and stands for great things. It’s one of the few companies that you would actually enjoy being a part of."
good,Please don’t fall for the hype or drink the orange Nike punch. You are still someone they can replace. Out of all the retail store I’ve worked you most definitely get the perks with pay and discounts. Probably the highest place I’ve been paid to look cool and be nice and fold clothes from time to time and handle money.
good,"Plenty of room to grow with company. Typical day of work you will constantly engage with diverse customers allowing you to adapt to different forms of communication to ensure each customers fun and memorable experience."

Management at Nike overall was strong and they helped me understand how to be a professional in a retail setting.

With Nike, I definitely learned that becoming a team with your co workers makes everything so much more enjoyable and productive. My management team was very supportive of every single employee, and they made everyone feel appreciated. I believe that that is what makes any company successful. The hardest part of the job, also being one of my weaknesses, was having a difficult time saying no. Whether it be another employee asking me to cover their shift, or informing a customer that we were out of stock in a certain product, I've always had a difficult time saying no.

The hardest part of the job I would say is on holiday weekends and the store gets so crowded and its hard to get product out fast. The most enjoyable part is knowing that there is so much technology about a shoe and what it all does."

My co-workers were all hard workers and valued their job just as much as I did. My supervisor always acknowledged our work and that kept us motivated. The hardest part of my job was having to quit due to the fact that it is only a full time position, and no part time was ever available when I started school again. The most enjoyable part of my job was learning to work with a team to maintain customer satisfaction, and learning how to stay calm and collective when under a large amount of pressure.  "
good,Worked as a sales associate interacting with customers on a daily basis. 
good,"Esperienza molto istruttiva con colleghi socievoli e disponibili."
good,"On a daily basis I come in to work I clock in, report to my floor, I check the clock to see the time I take my breaks and lunches, grab me a walkie and head to the floor. I assist in keeping the floor looking good, assisting the consumer with all their Nike sales needs. I match up outfits for the consumer, show the Nike sneakers that match the outfits, and help them out in the fitting room. I love my co-workers they make each day go by fast and we have a lot of fun with what we do. I would say the hardest part of my job is feeling like I do a great job at what I do and it goes unappreciated. No I do not need a reward for my work and dedication, however I should not be made to feel as though what I do is nothing special and that I can easily be replaced. I feel management just needs to see what we see, and what we do for the daily consumer, and not worry so much about the numbers, because those will come."

good,"Providing customer service at constant throughout the day while tasking to keep the floor and the warehouse stocked which includes processing items into inventory and out on the floor as needed.  Under previous management the store excelled at an excellent rate while still having awesome company morale. Under New management, morale is not at all time low due to mismanagement, insensitivity to tenured employees, unequal treatment, and unequal pay increases.  The co-workers and the brand are among the best perks of the job along with the satisfaction of finding out and providing the exact item or service the consumer wants."
good,"Very demanding fast paced retail job. You really have to go above and beyond as a seasonal from day 1 in order to be kept for fulltime.

good,"It was a fun place to work at. You were either put in four places. Cash register, apparel, footwear or back of house. Management were fair and great to work with. The main reason to work there was probably because of the Company itself. Nike."
good,"Throughout the day you will answer customers questions countlessly, help shoe fitting and restocking the front show room as well as back of house. A big thing we do is product breakdown in the morning as well as store cleanup at night."
good,Everyday you would sign in and be assigned to a section. With in your section you would help people find what they need and also try to get them to sign up for rewards. Got two 15 minute breaks and an hour for lunch.
good,Nike had a fun working environment and I loved the people I worked with. My favorite departments to work in were men's apparel and in the stock room. I learned to have a lot of patience when helping customers and how to manage my tasks at hand.
good,Life was good at Nike. Can't really complain. Casual dress code with lots of opportunities to explore life at Nike as an intern. I think it's a great company.
good,Na Nike nos sentimos valorizados e respeitados! Ótimos benefícios e muita aprendizagem no dia dia com a cultura da empresa. Muito obrigada pela oportunidade que tive dentro da empresa!
good,"Working at Nike was a fun & learning experience as far as things like; customer service, P.O.S. training, and how to react in situations within the workplace."
good,NIKE is a cool place to work the people are great mangement is ok it can depend on the day. Overall i you enjoy talking and interacting with people can talk sports come join NIKE
good,"- As long as work was done, office time was flexible."
good,Fast paced work environment with tons of tasks to get done in the work day. Friendly coworkers make it a fun environment to be in. Management of course has its flaws
good,Nike is great place. Fast pace and you will meet alot of good people. Alot of fun days at work and you will learn alot about the company. Also about the shoes and clothes
good,"I love working at Nike. I have made forever friends and lifelong memories while employed. I spend my days organizing clothes and shoes, working register, and assisting customers."
good,While at Nike i have learn many skills. i have met a lot of strong people and leaders that i will remember and left an in packed on my life.i do not think I've seen the last of them.
good,The managers were very flexible and helpful. Great working environment. Employees were almost like a family. Would very much recommend working there!!
good,"Die Arbeit verkauft sehr stressfrei. Unter den Kollegen herrscht ein mildes Klima. Das Management ist in der Regel immer sehr einsichtig und fair. Als Arbeiter sollte man das Produkt kennen, welches man verkauft."
good,"Begin work with a warm-up activity. "
good,Nike warehouse in Memphis Tn is more like a babysitting job for adults . Manangement is so unprofessional it’s unreal. Managers will ride your back until you get fed up
good,"Weekdays were usually slow and boring. Management was the greatest, and would always lend a helping hand. The only hard part of the job was trying to find shoes that were placed in the wrong boxes. The best part of working at Nike is making new friends who are just as passionate about the brand as you. One thing I don't like is that they keep hiring new part time athletes (sales associate), and got rid of the other part time workers even though some of them were always on task and lent a helping hand."
good,"Nike is my best job I have had and it is due to the people I work with. The managers and coworkers are all great people and they know how to have a good balance of fun in the workplace as well as hard work. Usually at the Pleasant Prairie outlet, I would always back stock the footwear that was processed throughout the day and in the Oshkosh location, I process and back stock shoes as well as take footwear and apparel out of the holding bins to refill the sales floor. The hardest part of the job is when the store gets packed full of people and sales go way up because that directly effects how much product we have to pull out of the bins to put on the floor. The most enjoyable part I'd say would be when the store is empty or has very few people in it because there is a lot of downtime and I can productively work through and process all of the product that has been shipped to us."
good,"AMAZING! GO WORK WITH A COMPANY THAT CARES! It was a very positive work environment that was team-oriented, goal driven, fun and productive. Nike has a great atmosphere but lacking the correct management at the grove location. Orlando is the best district the company has to offer!"
good,"•	Monitor stock movement and consider markdowns, promotions, price changes, clear outs"
good,"I worked at Nike for nearly nine years.  I started low on the totem pole, but had three promotions in my time there.  It's a beautiful office with good cubicle/office space and nice views."
good,"In this field...it's all about, ""who you know."" Make sure management write authentic notes in your ""PAR"", which any managers can write and put positive or negative comments of how they feel, but does not know who you really are. Great Brand, but some managers are poor in communicating. Network!"
good,"I really enjoyed working here when I first started, I like the company and I'm very knowledgeable about the product. Recently got 3 new managers and they are rude and 1 doesn't know what he is doing."
good,Is anlakini insana eğitimleriyle ve yönetici profesyonelligiyle aşılayabilen çok iyi bir Firma. Calisirken çalışmaktan zevk alıyorsun. Ayrılırken bile aklimin kaldığı bir yer. Ayrilmamin tek sebebi maaşlar. Nikeye yakışmayan bir maaş aliyordum. Maaşı düzeldiği taktirde kariyer planlamasını rahatlıkla yapabileceğin bir Firma.
good,Great first job. Had a lot of fun working with the team and being able to see all the different products and going to different locations and having the discount make it a dream job when your an athlete.
good,Nike was a relaxed environment and quick paced. Everyone is treated like family and work as a team. They give out bonus checks during the holiday season. I recommend this job.
good,"I personally love my co-workers and most managers at Nike. It’s a relaxed setting that can get hectic during busy times, but co-workers can help reduce the stress. You must work weekends, which can be a nuisance for college aged kids, but the $9.16 starting wage and great discounts are worth it (usually)."
good,Management back from 2010-2015 was great. awesome place to work for. i worked parttime so i didnt recieve benefits only discounts. flexible hours. especially if you were going to school
good,"It was an amazing first job I truly enjoyed working there and I would work there again, people there are awesome and caring and it’s like one big family!"
good,"Working at Nike was a great experience, it taught me a lot about sales and allowed me to get my foot int he door when it came down to makreting experience."
good,"Um dia na Nike é sempre muito corrido e com várias coisas para fazer ao mesmo tempo: Atender clientes, organizar o setor, fazer relatório de vendas, montar capacitação."
good,"Nike was one of the best jobs to date, working with the staff and customers was a great experience. There was a lot of support as well a typical day was easy going"
good,"Nike was a good place to spend a six month contract.  I worked in the finance group supporting technology.  Supported three cost centers, worked extensively with SAP and BW Query and Excel"
good,I was always working in a fun environment at the store.  Every day is different.  Great people work in that store and they are all well rounded business individuals.
good,"The perks were great and the coworkers were all awesome too. Management would tell me to do two completely opposite things very often leaving me to seek clarification and therefore less time to do my tasks. Somewhat lazy, but the majority of the managers are fantastic."
good,"Great company to work for, I learned several things at Nike in my 15 years there. But working in Inventory Control was the most exciting, because I got to work with custom service and learned so much regarding my company. I still call it my company because Nike is a family."
good,"Nike overall is a good company. Great benefits, cool work atmosphere. Some opportunities for advancement but not many. I would recommend nike for a potential employee who wanted to begin their Nike career."
good,"Working here was great, it was easy to get along with my coworkers. The job was always a smooth ride no matter what shift. It was a pleasure but management needs heavy work."
good,"Working at nike was hard work but worth it totally ,good pay, nice breaks , delicious food in the cafeteria, good supervisors and productive meetings good job would recommend"
good,Nike is a good job to have at the job we use Scan guns to put items were they needed to be me Also was fun using a object called the pallet jack. also when I was working I was never late.
good,Beautiful Campus to work and the benefits of discounted merchandise is great. The huge campus gives multiple opportunities to interact with others and the facilities are great for working out and staying active.
good,Muito boa a empresa ..e is treinamentos sao bem proveitosos
good,i really enjoyed working there but i wasn't always able to get there at my scheduled time. the co worker was friendly and i had a good boss to work for. but now im looking for that same kind of work again at other stores.i think i was pretty good at it.i liked being around people and helping them find things in the store.
good,I absolutely loved working for this company. when you have done the work you get paid for it. you would get a bonus for every piece you put out. it wasn't much but it added up
good,The work and the hours wasn't hard at all. The managers were all sweet. We had to 15 minutes and a 45 hour lunch break. Everybody was able to get along. The picking and packing wasn't hard at all just had to move on a steady paste
good,I loved making sales and helping customers find what they are looking for in a timely manner and leave with a smile on their face.
good,"Diverse and fun environment that allows you to be yourself and express your passion for sports.  Work hard but play hard, Nike allows you to have fun while at work but you sacrifice your work-life balance by working weekends and late nights."
good,NIKE is an amazing company to work at! I loved it there in regards to atmosphere and culture. They company really supports with the best interest of the employee and consumers who walk through the doors.
good,The people I work with all act as parts of a big team. Everyone always has each others' backs during work and personal interactions.
good,NIKE is a very nice place to work the employees dress code is very laid back all you do is dress up in nike sweats or shorts. but management sucks they are all lazy sit in the backroom and do nothing. you hardly see any of them and when you do they try to make you do things that would've took them two seconds to do when they walked past it the first ten times. most enjoyable part of the job is the employee discount and how they keep you up on the newest styles and make sure your uniform is up to par.
good,"I work overnight. Overnight is a lot in itself. When you come in you may be working with visual to get the floor set to customer standards when they shop in the day; You may be processing clothing that came in on the truck; Or processing footwear that cam in on the truck. We receive around 3,000 to 5,000 units Monday through Friday betweeen 10pm to 11pm. Tge most enjoyable part of the job is the support from Nike whether you are a runner, going to medical school, a vegan or a teacher. Nike supports you and pushes you to do amazing things with your talent or knowledge."
good,"En NIKE y en Decathlon, trabajé en atención al público. Al tener que compaginar el trabajo con mis estudios de Administración y Dirección de Empresas, trabajaba pocas horas, pero me llamó mucho la atención el sistema logístico y de almacenamiento, que siendo distinto en las 2 empresas, funcionaba como un reloj. Además de la atención al público, participaba en la formación del personal de la tienda, ya que además de ser del equipo inicial que abrió la tienda, casi todos los manuales venían en inglés y tenía que traducirlos. Conservo muy buenos recuerdos de las grandes personas que conocí allí y que continúan siendo mis amigos."
good,Very casual and fun atmosphere with co-workers who are all have a love for sports and passion for what they are selling. Great for students because they are part time jobs and are very flexible with your schedule.
good,"Nike was a great first job experience. I learned how to take responsibility and lead. I learned how to be vocal. I enjoyed being a part of the nike team, they taught me the value of hard work. My co workers were awesome, They helped on task that I didn't understand and got me to the point where I trained other employees. The hardest part of the job was just the learning curve as my first job with nike in the big store that it was, i just had to get used to the area."
good,"Very positive and supporting company. Helpful, caring and serious about it's people. Never a bad day for me. Great people."
good,"Lots of work to do and relative freedom to do it without lots of red tape. Everyone is motivated to push ahead and get things done, and most will help their peers."
good,"Great place to work and relax with peers."
good,Really great company and Brand to work for. However members of the DTC (Retail) are treated like little pawns and advancement is very hard to come by. Getting a job with corporate or the brand is the better way to go
good,"I got hired at Nike right before the store opened in Grand Rapids MI at the new Tanger Outlet Mall. It was such a cool experience opening a store together with what started as complete strangers, and ended up becoming a family in just a few short weeks. We got to watch the store come to life as we set out the clothing and equipment. Most of my co-workers were seniors in high school, some were married with children. Everyone came from different places around Grand Rapids and West Michigan as well."
good,"Great place to learn as a person. Customers always go first, but they always protect your right as an employee. I learned a lot about the products that Nike makes and what they do with the shoes that are recycled. The hardest part is dealing with rough customers."
good,great work environment and great benefits like discounts etc. Definitely recommend this job to other people looking to get into retail they do a great job of hiring from within into manager and full time positions and also pay for you to relocate until you find housing
good,a casual workplace with pretty good worker to worker relationship. mostly tight schedules but not excessively  stressful. employer worker relationship is very good.
good,I like working for the Nike company that I am at right now as well as the management team that are over our area at the company.
good,"An overall day at Nike would be very busy but very fun at the same time. Your day would start off with a morning, afternoon, or night cheer depending on your shift. The cheer gives you the motivation to work, goals for the day, and extra skills on how to perform your job better. I quickly learned that management was skilled in everything they did but not really attentive of their surroundings like they should've been. My co-workers were awesome, they created the perfect team to get every job done. The hardest part of the job was getting recognized for the hard work you did being that the managers weren't as attentive as they should be. The entire job was enjoyable. The break room was large with flat screen tvs and game systems as well at mac computers, 2 refrigerators, and vending machines. The cheers and shout outs over the intercom made working their exciting. The labor was very interesting, so overall the whole job was enjoyable."
good,"The Nike store would get very busy with customers, there wasn't much room for advancement though."
good,"the people was good and the mangers was too. hour lunch"
good,"habia que llegar puntual, la mayoría de los empleados eramos jovenes, entusiastas."
good,the staff was very helpful and always awaiting a challenge. very family oriented.
good,Nike is well establish company with great people and a popular brand that speaks for itself.
good,"A rotina diária era sempre tranquila."
good,"Nike Golf has started to make a name for itself. The work environment was fast paced and fun. Pay isn't that great, at all."
good,"The typical work day at Nike was ok! I learned a lot about shoes then I had know before. The management was not that great. My coworkers complained all the time about getting more hours. The hardest part about my job at Nike was dealing with irrate customers, and the short hours that they gave us."
good,Arbetsplats med fantastiska kollegor och skön stämning. Fick lära mig hantering av kassa samt god serviceattityd.
good,"I love this company hands down. The culture and intensity are amazing! Unfortunately, I met the worst manager in my work career here and could not deal with him long term. I hope they let him go so Nike can be a better place. "
good,My day was consist of reaching our goals and communicating with the manage on what we needed to get the job  done and where we stood on reaching our goals for that day. Most important making out customers happy by shipping their order full and out on time.
good,"Majority of the time it was fun to work there, I learned more about shoe technology, the management team was awesome."
good,"i loved working here, it was a remarkable job yet i wish it was not so far from where i was living i hated the drive plus hard to get to work when ice was on roads"
good,Nike is a great place to work. You see product that no one else gets to see before you and they care about there employees
good,"Nothing special about this, just basic entry level manufacturing.  Nice and friendly people to work with.  Not many opportunities for advancement and  pay is appropriate for an entry level position."
good,"The environment working at Nike was easily unmatched . It was a very fun lighthearted place to work and although very little , there was room to grow to larger positions . The main obstacle many people may face is the negative attitude of the managers there . A majority of the managers are not open to new ideas or considering an alternative to a problem rather than dismissing it ."
good,Everyone from managment to sales is warm and embracing. The Nike culture is very much alive in the people who work there. Everyone cooperations excpetionally to accomplish store goals as a unit.
good,This company is amazing! Unfortunately sometimes the wrong people get into management so please be aware of this. Other than that the company is the best in the world.
good,Hard labor work but good pay. Have it’s on restaurants and u take a 15 minute break and then a 45 min break. Tegu have different shifts and different locations
good,"A safe workplace for everyone. Managers care about employees. If there is an issue, they will try to work it out with you. Allow you to grow as an employee and to climb the ladder."
good,"From the beginning of my experience within the company, I have always felt included and treated respectfully as a member within the Nike family. Diversity is also extremely important to the company overall and for future success within it."
good,"un ambiente increíble para trabajar, socializar y aprender. los salarios no se adecuan tanto al mercado pero intentan comenzarlo con beneficios sobre la marca. "
good,"A typical day at work would involve day to day contact with consumers s or co-worker along with assisting people with sales and or checking out"
good,Great place to work. Overtime options. Fast paced. Plenty of opportunities to learn other aspects of the warehouse. Secure work environment. No cellphone use while working.
good,Fun and productive. it has the quality of becoming a very skilled individual. I really enjoyed the company of my peers and the benefits. Nike gave value to competitiveness and competition.
good,"NIKE’s Cote values are amazing! I love everything about NIKE. The foundation that the company was built on is an amazing story within itself. This was my very first retail job and I loved it! The only downside is the pay and management. The pay depends on your position, experience, & what minimum wage is at the time of hire. Management competency also depends on the location and store ."
good,"Fun workplace. Worked there for 4 years, got to know some great people. run with some excellent discipline and good amount of respect amongst the managers and employees"
good,"Productive and fun and very laid back and everybody was nice didn't mind helping people who needed help. Everybody got along wasn't an problems the breaks and lunch break was great. I love hanging the clothes the managers and the people were very caring, and i don't have any regrets about the job."
good,Out of all the retail places to work for I feel as though Nike is one of the best. The company cares about their employees and the environment although busy is upbeat and energetic.
good,Very team orientated we worked together a lot. There was competitions held so that we were encouraged to sell more in store. We had days strictly for team bonding where we played games and learned more about the company itself.
good,"NIKE has been an environment where they emphasize your development as an individual. Store 226 where I work at has the best group of individuals working together, we all compliment one another greatly! I can truly say we are more than just coworkers we are family! We having bonding events outside of work to create a better relationship and it shows come Saturday morning! Where some may look at us and think how does it all run so smoothly, but it’s because of the level of chemistry that was developed making us about to work as a collective to achieve our goals for that day!"
good,"While this job is very fast paced and sometimes stressful, it is very easy when compared to other call center work. The best culture and atmosphere I have been a part of."
good,"i learned how to deal with coworker, "
good,Nike is a great job if you looking for great pay. The work can be a little tied but if you used to fast pace you will like it.  I just kinda hated the overtime mandatory hours. Barely workers but alot of work to do in little time.
good,"Nike Store in Mega Mall Sharjah was a nice place to work there."
good,"it was fast paced but wonderful environment"
good,"The atmosphere of Nike was the best in my retail experience. It just wasn't something I could do forever. Some of the managers were great, some of the other managers not so much. Advancement was only available if you asked and if you were liked by management. The discount was good enough for me to consider going back for part-time until I found something more permanent."
good,Had a great experience working for nike cant complain!!! They offer an abundance of opportunity!! You get free clothes which is great to the lastest gear!
good,It was fun working with Nike Learned alot about sports. interacting with different types of clients. giving them information about product. try to convience them to buy more then one product
good,"Great atmosphere with a positive goal oriented mindset. Decent paced workflow with customers. Learned to deliver outstanding service, open ended-question, stockroom, Mobile scan check-out, merchandise and products, and how Nike first came to be with the original founders goal. Managers were amazing with an outgoing mindset, always there to help. Hardest part of the job at first was learning the products, however with more exposure and questions asked I caught on quick."
good,Quick place and fast worker . Great environment to work and good hours. Hardworking space and must get along with co workers. Nice job for younger crowd but suggested for older.
good,Great culture within the team at Nike Canada. One that will be a strong foundation for myself as o grow in my career and get to take on new teams and build a winning culture.
good,I worked for a short time during the summer before college. It was a good starting job to get money for college but with being an athlete in college it became difficult to work so I unfortunately had to leave. When I asked about working during the holiday seasons during school they stated I would have to reapply and go through the whole interview process again.
good,"Great learning environment , fast paced. People are highly passionate and enjoy working. There is a work life balance, but you must advocate for it. Nike rewards those that go above and beyond."
good,You have to kiss butt to move up. There is A LOT of favortism. The athletes were cool. Customers come from all over. Fast paced. Great place for teens early twenties.
good,"It’s great for your first job , If you’re a good problem solver then Nike is the place for you. If you want to become a detailed oriented person. Then Nike Co. is the place for you"
good,"It was a great pleasure to work for Nike, met and enjoyed working with a lot of people. The environment of the brand is truly awesome. The stories behind the product is amazing"
good,"The company stresses teamwork and cooperation, every role within the store is encouraged to work together to reach goals. The store's management also stressed that asking questions is vital to be a good team member."
good,a typical work day at nike wasnt always the same some days it would be a breeze we worked at a good peace not to fast and not to little but the days we didnt have work and had nothing else to do our floor manger would get mad if we would just stand around even ifwe had already cleaned our area.
good,Es una muy buena empresa y realmente se preocupa por sus empleados
good,Competitive work environment. Work culture is very good. Team leaders were very helpful and provided a better working environment. Every employee was treated with respect
good,Great place to work part timeHad a lot of fun there  meeting a lot of new people  my department was a great department to work in And for a shoe lover that is the job for you trust me
good,This job is very competitive however the people there are fun to work with. The hardest part of the job is meeting the criteria. I have learned a lot of history about the company which is fun to share with the customers.
good,"This was my first real job. As every company, they paint the picture that the company has a lot of room for growth but never explains the hardships and the loops they throw you for to get there. A lot of activities for big sporting events like All Star Weekend and Superbowl. Good experience, great atmosphere, but just a resume filler. If you're determined to grow, prepare to stay for 4+ years to see a change in opportunity."
good,"Nike overall was a fun workplace. The work environment was energetic and inviting, however the management was lacking. My only negative with Nike is that it did not provide flexibility for its workers with scheduling."
good,A typical day consists of greeting customers and assuring a best customer service experience for the customer. Every 6 months you get a pair of shoes and every 3 months you get a new uniform.
good,This is a great first job and easy training to learn how the company runs things. There is always something active to do to keep the store up to standard.
good,Otima empresa mas não tem plano de carreira. Quando eu estava em processo seletivo para entrar na empresa foram passadas algumas coisas referente a plano de carreira e oportunidades que não vejo na empresa.
good,"Era en Uruguay no hay posible comparación. Los salarios son bajos respecto a los de España aún cuando la cesta de la compra es tan alta o más que en España. Difícil entrar en esta materia,"
good,"I really enjoyed working for The Nike Foundation in Ethiopia. It was an invigorating, creative, collaborative project with some super smart, dedicated and professional people."
good,"Each day at Nike is awesome, you never know who you may meet in the process.  I learned a ton about retail!  I Loved interacting with consumers daily!"
good,well first of all it’s retail. And retail will be as good and as fun as you make it. All depending on how you interact with the customers. Working with fun and energetic people will help make this job even more enjoyable.
good,"Managers are really lazy then they get at you for not working hard, they recognize the wrong people sometimes, They say they work with ur availability however they really don't, they make your life schedule really difficult. A good thing is that the store is always switching around visually so it's fun to work there sometimes , 40% discount , the people you meet are really good."
good,"Foi uma experiência muito marcante, onde tive um grande aprendizado em diversas áreas."
good,Nike is great to work at. I just wish they paid more. Because being a college student working hard was stressful enough. Getting paid minimum wage just made everything more stressful because pay is bi weekly and it makes you live pay check to paycheck.
good,"Uma empresa de grande movimento e com uma rotatividade muito grande de pessoas e produtos diferentes. "
good,I really enjoyed my job. The time I spent there was fun & exciting. Sometimes things got hard bt it was nothing I couldn’t handle. They made sure everything & everyone was in order
good,Nike is a great company to work! Big on diversity and teamwork to achieve a goal for the store. Lots of young vibrant college students who come ready to work everyday. Vast array of knowledge for Nike history and retail product. Great opportunity for community service activities outside of the retail environment.
good,"Great Company to work for, great benefits discounts.Able to buy stocks at lower rates, can get promoted within company.great coworkers easy to learn your job."
good,"The management team is well put together and everyone acts as a team and not just a number. A typical day is rather fast paced, but everyone is always willing to help when needed. I'd say the hardest part of the job is keeping up with new policies that corporate likes to enforce. The easiest part, however, is meeting new people every day."
good,Muito boa Para trabalhar salário muito bom benefício bom
good,Have a good office environment. You call and receive calls from your territory customer base to inform them of programs and orders that have been place.
good,"When you first come in it seems like a lot of information, but it is really easy to get the hang of. It was always pretty busy so you will always have something to do. Everyone that works there is very passionate about it, so everyone employed is great to work with. Some managers are easier to get along with than others, and they would sometimes contradict each other on what the expectations were which made it confusing."
good,"- Agile Environment. fast paced and ever changing. "
good,"Typical day i could be a stock boy or a team memebr working with thousands of people a day. Learned how to stock new products ."
good,"Empresa ótima para trabalhar , trabalho excelentes"
good,"None to give ..seasonslhttps://instagram.com/p/BTY1fXPACca/"
good,"I typically receive shipment at work and get it ready for the floor. "
good,"Empresa com muitos benefícios, com chance de crescimento profissional e oportunidade de viagens."
good,a very fast paced sells environment that is full of opportunity and advancement. a company that has thrived for years that has great product to work with and learn about a well with a very diverse and welcoming team.
good,"Nike  really likes to create a fun and relaxed environment, if you work hard and take your own career into your own hands, you can succeed at nike. Be competitive and work hard and also you must be a very social person."
good,"工作環境好，且店長教導我很多作人的道理"
good,"Empresa muito boa com áreas de lazer para funcionários e sempre realizava eventos com seus empregados"
good,"Great company to work for , good people allot of communication and helping, good member service .a typical day is helping people find there sizes giving great hospitality and just enjoying what you love to  do especially if you enjoy the appearl and foot ware"
good,"When I started the management team was great. My co workers were all team players, we use to perform each department duties that are loyal we were to one another. The experience of the company is truly base on the management team."
good,"Nesta empresa todos os dias eram igual, não tinha diferença pois lá é Outlet então sempre é uma grande correria, eu aprende a ser mais ágil, focada, e foi uma experiencia diferente, a gerencia e bem comunicativa os colegas de trabalho muito prestativos, a parte mais difícil era quando algum cliente chegava para comprar estressado e a parte mais agradável era receber um elogio e conviver com as pessoas."
good,"Searching for parts and cycle inventory on a daily basis."
good,"when you do what you love, youll love what you do. very fun place to work. must be energetic and love to help. great team work and good pay for college students"
good,"Nike is een ware werk beleving. Wat een dynamiek en hierdoor krijgen werknemers een dosis extra energie. Werkzaam binnen het Europees distributiecentrum is een ervaring op zich. Groot, groter, groots..."
good,typical Day at work was good. co-workers are very easy to work with also had good team work.. very productive   Hardest part of the job was when the work became slow i like fast pace work something that keeps me busy
good,"Nike is an innovative, creative and posh company. It's fun, fast-paced environment makes a day in the life new and exciting each and every day. Meetings dictated how most days ran. As an Administrative Assistant for a Vice President I was in charge of his calendar, activities and lunches. I did most event planning, budgeting and scheduling. I booked catering, travel and venues for different off-site meetings and team gatherings. I helped create content and materials for meetings, workshops and trips."
good,Nike was an ok job your stocking or process items and doing store orders. Its was ok but managers became problem not enough countability for there own actions
good,More worried about taking care of the customers then employees. Decent PTO and holiday pay. Fun atmosphere to work in. I don't like how they set up new releases if customers want to buy them. Working at the mall its hard to stay within the 30 min lunch time frame but over all decent time frame. They are always working with kids to help them live an active lifestyle
good,"Campus is awesome!  It's a very collaborative and team oriented environment.  If you love sports, this is the place for you.  I enjoyed my experience there and would love to come back someday.  If only they are located locally."
good,"A typical day at work at Nike was putting on your name badge, a headset, and clocking in. That's the only repetitive thing you could count on. Each day was a different adventure. The only way you could count on knowing exactly where you were going to be was if you were hired on full-time for that position and even then you didn't know exactly what was in store for you that day. I learned that no task is ever to small, and even more training on a different point of sale system."

good,"A typical day at work at Nike Factory was, making sure the store was nice and neat as well as giving the best customer service you could. The co-workers and management really made it easy to go to work everyday, it was to a point I forgot it was work sometimes. I think learning more about the brand and shoes was probably the best part about working there besides the customers."

good,"My typical day involves working the cash register, sales floor, stock room, and fitting rooms.  I learned a lot in this job about retail.  I could basically do everything the manage the managers could do, but didn't have the title.  My co-works were awesome and there was no drama.  Management was always on top of things and that is why our store is the number one Nike store.  I loved doing my job because I did a lot of the merchandising and training the new hires."
good,"Nike was an amazing place to work. It is easy to sell the product because it is high quality. Great co-workers. Learned up-selling, cross-selling, and referring products."

good,"Mi trabajo generalmente era la venta,identificar la necesidad del cliente e incentivarlo para la compra de un producto,y siempre tratando de añadirle productos secundarios al principal.Aprendi a hacer dos cosas a la vez, por ej : mientras el cliente habla y yo realizo una escucha activa,a la vez estoy pensando cual es el producto que necesita y que tambien yo tengo disponible.Aprendi a identificar cada cliente,no se los puede atender a todos de la misma manera,hay que saber ""leer"" como el liente quiere o necesita que lo atiendan.Logre incorporar conocimientos administrativos,trabajo en equipo, y ser autosuficiente.La parte mas dificil del trabajo era cuando no habia mercaderia por un tiempo ya que por la importacion NIKE no podia entrar cosas al pais,habia que esforzarce mucho mas en la venta.Creo que me gusto todo lo que realice en esta empresa,la atencion al publico,la venta,el asesoramiento y la satisfaccion de brindarle una solucion al cliente"
good,Warehouse for Nike...Great Company only the employment was seasonal. Kept busy when we were working and great discount on products!
good,If you love to be around kids and coach the well privelaged this is a great opportunity.  You must have patience as many of the campers are there as a summer camp and not so much for learning about tennis or improving their game.
good,"The managers and co-workers do their best to train you on the knowledge of the products that nike sells. The managers make sure they follow up with associates and inform them of their progress and work performance. They also make work a fun place to be. We do these cheers before the store opens to get everyone up and going and before everyone goes home at night we do another cheer. The most work is done on a busy day when we have a ton of customers. Usually the busiest time are during holidays, back to school or when the store has a sale. Working here has also taught me how to be a leader. "

good,A typical day at nike was always fun and fast paced. Constant rush of customers and excitement. What I learned from nike is time management and more on leadership and how to become a manager. The hardest part of the job was to finally tell myself that I cannot make every customer happy. The most enjoyable part was working with everyone around me and always having my spirits uplifted no matter how bad the day was.
good,Great job for teenager. Good atmosphere. Got new sneakers/ uniform every 2-4 months. Hours vary. Working holidays and weekends are a must. Holiday season is the busy.
good,Era un buen empleo con buena capasitacion y excelente hambiente
good,overall had a lot of fun working here but I had to move on and get a job with better pay as advancement was only coming on a slim chance. I was prepping to be management for a while and the opportunity just never came.
good,To me Nike is a good company you and opportunity to learn several things like how to hang clothe and hiw to pick and pack and to label the boxes there are so many other things to learn their if you just put your minde to it and you move up to different positions

good,"Working for Nike is a very fun and nice setting. The environment is always happy and that makes a fun job even more fun. Even on the busiest days at Nike, we all find time for fun and laughs"
good,I loved working for the Nike Service Center in Orlando Florida.  I got to move around a lot and I loved the energy of the workers.  I got to see the behind the scenes process of how merchandise is prepared for retailers.  The hardest part about this job was trying to remember the location of inventory and the most enjoyable part was the environment and the people.

good,"The best part of Nike is the family that makes it Nike. The team is always upbeat and extremely energetic. It is a fast-paced environment and can get stressful when busy. However, that is when the team pulls together and communicates to get through the rush in a fast and fun way. The management team helped a lot put together fun ways to overcome obstacles we may face during the hours. We learned how to work together and communicate efficiently."
good,"I would assist a number of customers, taking preferences and desires based on consumer needs and do my best in matching it with our product."
good,"good for discounts, minimum wage job.  No one really liked their job, but the Nike culture was pretty big.  Gets crowded on the weekends, dead on the weekdays."
good,"Cultura bem esportiva, gosto de esportes e com isso me identifiquei bastante, a liberdade que tínhamos de estamos em áreas diferentes no dia dia era agradável, o mais difícil foi o não reconhecimento, a gerencia mudou muito quando houve a troca de gerente, aprendi logística e treinamento com tênis e roupas esportivas."
good,"Nike India Work culture is amazing and one of the best company to work with."
good,I only left because of the commute from home - couldn't relocate and there was no flexibility or remote access option for the role that I held. It wasn't sustainable.
good,"The discount was great. It would get busy during the weekends since it was an outlet store. Management was good, some were understanding about other aspects besides work. It was a must to have open availability during the weekends, which wasn't always okay with me. But overall it was a good place to work."
good,Friendly work environment great customer service ethos great product knowledge the only bad thing about the place was there was no room for growth to expand

good,"Nike is an exciting and dynamic place to work, full of dedicated people who believe strongly in the brand. It is a huge company with many moving parts that are in flux as their business model changes, and new digital tools are constantly introduced. Understanding these dynamics, and leveraging resources and contact across the company, is a big challenge."

good,Estuve muy a gusto trabajando para esta empresa. El trato de los superiores y de los compañeros de trabajo era inmejorable. Las condiciones de trabajo muy favorables.
good,"Fun workplace for retail but can be stressful at times, however if you have a love for the product you might enjoy the busy days. Very comfortable work uniforms."
good,"If it wasn't for the severe concussion I sustained, putting me out of work and school, I would still be working at Nike. The atmosphere is amazing and the atmosphere is exceptional. The only con is their lack of schedule flexibility."
good,"Fun job if you love the brand. Great customer experiences are shared, employees are friendly. More of a lead yourself kind of job, most managers prefer to demand rather than lead"
good,Nike is a great place to work with a supporting team starting from management all the way down to the part time level.  Our goal is to help educate consumers with the product at Nike in which will help them make a purchase that will best fit their needs.
good,"I loved my experience working in Nike retail. It was awesome to do while I was in school and a great job to lean on while I found a ""grown up"" job once I had graduated."
good,Working at Nike is a very rewarding and challenging experience. The retail experience one may get from working there is very rewarding. The most enjoyable part of the job would be the different people you meet on a daily basis.
good,"You will feel safe. Nike is a huge matrix so it all depends on where you land. Be prepared to advance slowly. There are a lot of hungry people there, so it is hard to stick out, but Nike allows you to work hard and play hard. They value contributors, if you are one, you will do well."

good,"Working In London for a top class company, allowed me to gain a lot of experience. I had to listen to customers about what the were looking for and match to their requirements. It provided a lot of designing work and sketches of trainer types with logos and symbols that met to their requirements. I had to be patient as well as having attitude to make the customers feel relaxed and happy to start the process of designing and producing a bespoke pair of Nike trainers. During my time working for the company I found one of the hardest tasks was making sure I met the needs of the public and the requirements set my the customer, however I did really enjoy designing trainers that were well suited to the customer as well as getting the experience of travelling in and out of London and mixing with a variety of cultures and different people."

good,Nike was a nice job. The environment was relaxed an there was always work to be done. They always had cake for birthdays an treated everyone fair. Overall it was a good experience.
good,"I was a contractor so my time was limited which wasn't fun. I loved the people, the environment, the opportunities and the experience. I have made life long friends at Nike and would definitely work there again. It is all about who you know so get tight with as many people as you can while you're in."
good,This is a job that is based on production you have to complete your job and it's hardly matter get boxes placed away for safety out of the way of others hanging and folding and boxing up items

good,Great company culture.  A lot of peaks. Great discount. Good stock plan and retirement plan.  Hard to move up in company.  Must have a mentor or somebody to vouch for your next promotion.  It's hard to get promoted of merit and results.

I learned how to provide good customer service,product knowledge,oracle system,administrative and more things that related with my job.

good,"Working at Nike Citadel Outlets has given me the most experience on working inside a hectic environment. I typical day at work consisted of the store making around $200,000 a day. Our location is prime for many tourists and so we see much more traffic than most nike outlet stores in Los Angeles. Management was open and available to all employees. They did not communicate with one another as well as i believe they should have, but overall they were upfront with how they wanted the store to look and prepared us for the busy days. Coworkers worked extremely well and were a team. They are what helped our store succeed the most because of the communication we had and connections we were able to build at work. The hardest part of the job was having it work around a consistent schedule especially being a college student. Most enjoyable part of this job is to be able to communicate with any coworker freely, knowing that we had a strong team and being confident in knowing that we would have a smooth close and be ready to open the store no problem the next day."
good,the hardest part the past that they were going its really fast. it will help you out lot and it you keep stuff on trak. keep you fit
good,"Nike has a fun, young, and energetic work environment. This can be a good and bad thing at the same time. Many of the athletes don't take the job seriously which makes it difficult to achieve goals sometimes. The good part is that it's always a good time when interacting with co-workers and customers. When it gets slow the time can drag on if you don't find a way to keep yourself busy. Overall it's a cool company and not a bad place to work."
good,"review about my job.My job was very competitive, daily target,lot of discipline,friendly environment"

good,"Ambiente laboral de excelencia "
good,"A very social communicative day. You interact with different people everyday. I've learned about the different technologies in shoes and apparel. I've learned customers service skills, finding customers exactly what they are looking for. You develop multitasking skills by managing your zone making sure its properly sized and filled for customers, but not taking to much for the customers themselves."
good,Nike in general is a good place to work at. They treat their employees at an elevated level to train each person to develop a lot of personal and professional skills.
good,Wonderful place to work. Compensation is great.  Coworkers are fun to work with.  Hardest part of the job is holidays when store is super busy.  Long hours during holidays.  Great discounts for shoes and clothing.  Management was ok.  Could have been much better.  Not horrible.
good,"Nikes a great place to work at! Super friendly, but a great amount of coworkers mean very little advancement opportunities get distributed about"
good,I was looking after customers and giving them all the information about our products while I was sure that our shop was always clean and tidy.
good,"Great Athletic inspired retail, athletes serving athletes, provides excellent consumer journeys and experience, running inspired community"
good,"Come in the office, discuss what project we are working on and talk strategy regarding what need to be done. After that we split into out teams and get to work. I learned about working better with a team or workers and how to work together to get things done in a timely manner. Management was great, they gave us instruction on what they wanted done and how they wanted it done and gave us the tools and flexibility to do it our way in their guidelines. The hardest part of the job was knowing that it was only a temporary job! I enjoyed the atmosphere, the ppl, and our surroundings! Nike was a great place!"

good,"My days are very busy building customer loyalty and delivering premium service. this includes receptionist, directing phone traffic, resolving customer issues, shipping, assisting phone cliental."
good,"Niketown London is the all that is Nike. The atmosphere is electric and the people are bubbly. The energy that flows through this store comes from all the people that work within it, as soon as you walk in you are met with enthusiasm and the freshest beats that are being played by London's top DJ's. The management team are constantly in view and leading their team from the front giving them guidance and coaching on the way. In the mornings there is a store huddle where the management team share all business and sports news and end off in an energizer for the team to get your heart pumping ready to start the day. The most difficult part of the role is our peak season sales as there is a lot of preparation that needs to go into it, ensuring that all prices are live in the systems is a feat on its own but overall not entirely impossible, making sure that all the decals are in the right place and all stock is correctly marked down. Just working for the brand is satisfaction on its own, you get to meet some of your favorite Athletes and Celebrities you only see on TV or in magazines."
good,"Working in the football department at Nike enabled me to learn more about the products that are on sale at Nike Football. With football being a passion of mine I embraced this and passed on the information I learnt to the customers. I learnt the importance of customer service and what it means to Nike. Being one of the biggest companies in the world, I learnt the great ethos that Nike have and how they are always trying to please their customers. This job also gave me the opportunity to use my coaching qualifications and experience by using the testing zone that was in store to test a customer in a pair of football boots that they are thinking about buying."
good,"A typical day at Nike consists of going to work, putting on our radio, and helping customers find what they need for athletics. I have learned a lot about the different types of running shoes and breathable shirts. The management were really fun to work with and they created a positive work environment. All the co-workers were fun to work with and since there were a lot of us, we always had help cleaning up fitting rooms and organizing the shelves. The hardest part of the job was knowing it was only seasonal but it was enjoyable to have a fun working environment."
good,"Sold different nike products to customers around the store."
good,"I really enjoyed working at the outlet. I went through a week long class learning about nike products, along with customer service tips. I also enjoyed moving into the Building, we arranged the entire store."
good,"Working at Nike is always eventful. Whether its through customer service or just chatting with a fellow employee, there is always an opportunity to broaden one's knowledge. The sporting goods field is just as adaptive as the technology field is, so it is good to learn something new about Nike everyday that you are there. What I enjoy most about working at Nike is seeing return customers and hearing praise of the item(s) that were purchased during their last visit."
good,Everything about this place was just awesome. If I could have made enough money here I would have never left.
good,"Within this seasonal position, I observe each and every Golf consumers rip of a swing through an evaluation based swing analysis involving club head optimization, flex loft, adjustability & proper club fitting.

good,"One of the greatest and most challenging times in my life. All my co-workers were cool and different from myself, different states and cities also just in a whole my co-workers became my family. I learned that the politics of life never effected my bosses or their judgement no matter the situation or time. I respect NIKE as a business and as a family."
good,"A hard working productive company. I learned to work at a fast pace. My co-workers are team players,"
good,"A empresa oferece treinamentos para capacitação de vendedores, mostrando o que o produto vendido oferece para o cliente, e motivação dos vendedores com premiações."
good,good job the people make it hard. but the benefits are great and the pay is ok.

good,I love working there. I work 8 hours 5 days but it is not permanent.
good,Nike is a wonderful place to start your career or continue with Nike as a next step.
good,"A typical day is arriving to a golf course, setting up the demo clubs , meet and greet new people! Talk golf, educate the customer of the pro's of Nike golf and how it can change their game!"
good,"A typical work day involves handling requests around the calendar for the VP and his Directors.  Assisting the VP and his Director’s with their monthly expense reports and any other correspondence they would need help with.  Workflow management; from ordering office supplies to Hardware and Software, moving employees, in charge of the sitting chart for 103 employees.  When new employees are hired I’m the contact person for their move; making sure they have their phones, computer and their workspace set-up. Keeping our budget on track meeting with the finance person once a month.  Continue updating the Org chart and Employee’s number with HR Team.  I also had to keep track of our Head Count list which was done through an excel spreadsheet, it showed the Director’s name and their category, each employee’s band level, Temp person, and open Head count."
good,"Clearing truck, and stocking floor making sure its full. Helping guest locate shoes and sports wear"
good,Working with people who share the same desire for fashion for the athletes and everyday people. Being the shipping and receiving supervisor I picked and chose what would sell and what was in style and season from a long log of merchandise by company
good,"Good job , nice place to be working as a younger person , I moved from this into educational choices, but as a young man this would suit. Management good , the perks of the job are great, if you get a good team then its easy to enjoy each day at  this type of job."
good,"I love working at Nike because of the knowledgeable sneaker heads and the great managerial staff. We work in a fast-paced work environment with a variety of cultures and diverse people who come through with the same passion we do: Shoes! I strive to be the best I can every day and it's made easy in an environment such as this. The best part of my job is knowing that I may have changed someone's lifestyle in a healthier, more energetic direction."
good,"muchas personas,paises distintos..!Como hablo ingles,era muy bueno!Tengo trato con gente!Me encanta as personas...!hacia de todo un poco..limpieza,arrumacion,ventas,.."
good,"Typical retail/sales associate position, large company that enjoys taking care of their employees. Great management and work environment."
good,"As a contract worker, you don't have the opportunity to have benefits. The job security or advancement is not possible for me, because I was only hired on for a certain amount of time. I knew this from the beginning. Other wise it is a great company to work for. I had a great team of people to work with."
good,great experience working in a sports driven atmosphere. alot of different people and personalities all with a common goal and interest.
good,'Everything you'd think it's like and no one ever wants to leave
good,"I inspected shoes returned by a consumer for defects. Should I determine the defect is a manufacturer flaw, I code the shoe for the type of defect and give the consumer credit. If the consumers flaw is due to normal wear or from some other element inflicted on the item then no credit is given and the item is coded, marked and shipped back to the consumer. I learned a lot of warehouse knowledge, specifically in the logistics and distribution departments. My management was sometimes weak and my co-workers were friendly but not highly motivated or work ethical type employees. The most difficult part of this job was the cultural shock for me. Coming from a mostly medical background with well educated and motivated bosses and co-workers, both the social and physical aspects of the warehouse job are quit different. Most enjoyable was getting to learn the inner workings and history of Nike. I have always been a fan of Nike apparel and shoes!"
good,"I had a great experience working at Nike, however, it was only a seasonal position. I am eagerly awaiting another opportunity where I can utilize my talents and strengths in an environment that may lead to possible growth within the organization and / or personally. I did learn a lot at my previous employment setting, and look forward to obtaining an experience where I can use my knowledge that I personally gained and progressively improve on."
good,"Nike ist ein cooler Arbeitgeber für Sportler, jedoch wird schlecht bezahlt."
good,"Best part of the company was the culture, continuous innovation and the athletes's passion to belong to the organization.  This made every leadership role that much easier to achieve business results."
good,"Una gran empresa para laborar, con mucho sentido con sus empleados."
good,"ambiente lavorativo stimolante e creativo. "
good,If you have  family and a full time job. I do not recommend Nike as a part time job. If you are a student or don't have a family then Nike is the place to be.
good,I applied to be a product tester and was accepted but have yet to receive products to test. It would be nice to get some sort of response from them as to why i have not heard from them. Communication could be better.
good,"Pour moi Nike reste l’un des meilleurs emplois que j’ai eu là chance d’avoir. "
good,"Nike outlet at Toronto Premium is an amazing place to work! The company offers great incentives, even better discounts, and  almost every location has a great team! It is worth noting, however, that if you are looking to stay past your three months or a seasonal position, you better know someone who is cool with the managers or else they won’t keep you, no matter how good you are most times   Overall amazing place to work. All of the employees were so cool and chill, we were like a family. It is a great environment for anyone to work at, especially if you can handle fast-paced, high volume stores!"
good,Nike cares about moving forward. Retail is still retail meaning sometimes the customers are a little rude and entitled. At the end of the day Nike the company is a great company to work for.
good,Very good place to work very nice employees beautiful facilities but management needs a little more work other than that it was a great work experience
good,its easy not so demanding like other stores. Work is divided evenly and its a rally fun and good environment to work in. The benefits are great and i love the company for what it stands for
good,"Worked with the company for over 11 years. Assisted in programs showed initiative always. Inventory/ Order pulling/"
good,"Very flexible with school schedules, great team environment . I like that you get to meet all types of people and get to move around different areas in the store."
good,"I learned a lot in a short amount of time at Nike. The management is very helpful and pushes you to be the best that you can achieve. A typical day is full of laughter"
good,"If you love sport and innovation you won’t find a better place focused on delivering those things to their consumer’s. "
good,Great place to work. Processing apparel is easy and requires attention to detail and fast pace. Athletes are able to change departments and can work directly with customers on the floor.
good,"De combinatie brand - business met sport (meestal voetbal in mijn geval) is uniek en voor lange tijd kunnen bijdragen aan de groei van dit merk, nationaal en internationaal is onvergetelijk"
good,"typical day included greeting/servicing customers on the sales floor, a few janitorial tasks to keep the store clean, unpacking shipments, mailing out product, taking inventory of the sales floor and stock room;"
good,Everyday I happily did a task or job outside my Sr. Admin Assistant job description. Admin Assistants at Nike do everything and are really the nucleus of each department. They should be recognized and get compensated for all the work that falls their way.
good,Overall it is a billion dollars company to work for and grow with. They are growing world wild every day. I wouldn’t mind being an Marketing consultant for Nike. That would be great!
good,Managers don't award hard worker employees. I was the best employee over 300 employees and never have manager position. Cut hours with low sales and excellent discount
good,busy work life. always moving never stopping unless on break or lunch. strict management and micromanaging. they will give you strikes for almost anything.
good,"Esprit d'équipe"
good,"Tofste bedrijf ooit!"
good,"Jornadas de mucho trabajo con buen ambiente. "
good,"it was fun, the leaders and co workers were very encouraging. I was taught a lot of skills such as customer service, sales tips. Also, I learned what to do when someone is stealing. practicing loss prevention."
good,I loved my time at Nike. Everyone was incredibly helpful when I started working there. It is definitely a company devoted to the brand so everyone loves Nike but if you do too than it's perfect. There are free gyms and workout classes which are always fantastic.
good,"Nike es una empresa dedicada al deporte, es una empresa organizada, con un gran compromiso en todas las áreas, empresa que cada dia va en crecimiento logrando tener a los mejores clientes, Atletas, jugadores, profesionales."
good,One preps themselves before their shift with the daily goals and forecast profit for the day. Then you greet and cater to the consumers with the variety of situations that they offer whether it be to purchase shoes and apparel or return and exchange. You want to leave the consumers with a lasting impression leaving them wanting to spend more and come back to the store.
good,"Always something new while working at nike. great product and they have the latest styles to chose from . benefits are a big plus as well, stock and heath coverage"
good,"Excelente lugar de trabajo, me permitía estudiar y trabajar"
good,alles goed geregeld. gaan goed met het personeel om
good,Had a great time working the holiday season at Niketown Beverly Hills am very sad that that location is closed now. Hopefully they open a new Niketown in SoCal sometime soon
good,"Working at Nike was fun and I met a lot of cool people there but dealing with the management was difficult. A lot of them had favorites, treated individuals differently and kept changing the requirements to continue to work there. Overall it was a good experience and there are pros and cons about every job especially in retail."
good,Staff and management were amazing and it was like a little family. Everyone is there to help you succeed. The atmosphere was never too stressful and an overall wonderful experience.
good,"great job to work at and a lot of room to move up with the company, its a good company to get a lot of customer service experience as well as sales experience"
good,I worked at Nike for a year and I loved it. All of the managers were really nice and cared about your opinion. I got along with all of the employees. It was a very professional work environment that was fun and enjoyable.
good,"Promotions are given to those who deserve it, hard work is praised yet favoritism in minimized. Working with Nike for the past few years was very enjoyable and the pay was excellent with chances of a raise."
good,"Discount is great, PTO is awesome, discount is amazing, and overall work environment is positive and upbeat. Downside is not too much growth unless you know someone higher and they vouch for you."
good,"Biggest sportswear brand in the world is also the best work environment! Enjoyed every minute of working there from the moment the store opened until it closed, could be a little monotonous at times and tasks were few and far between.  But the customer service and training provided is amazing!"
good,Great place but some favoritism. Not a whole lot of room for growth.  A lot of bad stuff goes on. Lazy workers are accepted and only attendance is paid attention to.
good,"For me the most engaging and interesting company to work for. Great brand with many perks like product discount, extensive sports facilities, fresh food at their canteen. "
good,"Environment is great and you get to meet many different people. The store can be very fast pace when it’s busy, and be prepared to help many people at a time when getting items from the stockroom. It’s very important to work together with your coworkers. Depending in the department that the managers have you in you work together with the other department to make sure the customer gets everything they need. You don’t always know all the information about something so you can ask your coworker and work together. I would work with Nike again!!"
good,"•	Worked with Store Managers to decipher key training needs most effective for the continued development for new and existing employees.  "
good,"Loved this job! I wish I could go back to work here but due to travel and family responsibilities, I can’t. Awesome company too work for. Highly recommend for a career path."
good,"Buen ambiente laboral, aprendes muchas cosas sobre la cultura nike y como se vive"
good,"Good company as a manufacturing industry, lot of experience poses, can learn more about life and jobs, great Brand's great working skills, early grouth based on performance"
good,Product knowledge and customer service focused. Must be able to work in a team setting. Fun work environment. Great opportunities in the company. Nike is community focused especially about kids being active.
good,Nike was a great place for me to learn the customer service field. The knowledge that I took from Nike helped me in my future jobs. It is a great place to work
good,ik vond het een toffe ervaring. ik heb kei leuke mensen ontmoet. het was heel aangenaam om daar te werken. maar het was heel ver voor me dus het was moeilijk om daar te geraken
good,"Nike is a really good job to work at. They offer community engagement events for their employees. The management staff is also really good, and do well with training."
good,"Trabalhei em uma franquia em BH, porém me sentia trabalhando para a Nike de Beaverton/EUA."
good,"Awesome place to work, solid benefits, fun culture, organization/process/structure aren't its strengths. Strong leadership. Very smart and talented individuals work here"
good,"Great place to work, after a certain amount you start seeing the benefits of working there they start you off with reasonable pay. I loved my hours I still had the rest of the day to enjoy myself and spend with my family. The team I worked with also felt like family."
good,"great place to learn and work in competitive environment, "
good,"A typical day at Nike was generally not so stressful, nor busy. It all depended on your shift and if we had any particular specials on sales. You are constantly assisting and interacting with consumers, and your coworkers."
good,"The place itself is a great place to work however, the management aren't exactly the greatest people to be in those positions. They don't like staff over buying products even though as an employee they give you a £200 in store spend every month. They also don't like staff engaging with bulk buyers which can result in being disciplined, but they're still paying customers and deserve the same treatment as all other customers."
good,Had fun at work with management and workers. The lunch and other breaks were at good times. The cafe had great food and great cooks. Safe place to work. Work hours and times were good.
good,"As a FT Digital Ops, my job is to train associates and connect with guests on a new level. I love talking and bringing smiles of joy to them. I love everything about Nike but feel limited because they're not open to new ideas or changes. The workplace culture is always top notch and management could be rotated out every year so there's no favoritism. My store manager always makes it fun for everyone and has no favorites, his mentality is ""as long as your working hard and doing your job that's all I can ask for."" Most enjoyable part of the job is talking with new customers and making sure they had the best experience, without customer service you have nothing. Worst part is management not giving me the opportunity to grow as an individual when I truly know I give it 110% each day I work. I have learned so much within the company and wish to stay with them forever but things change and it makes it hard to be with a company that talks behind my back and makes me looks bad. I've been with Nike nearly 2 years and have had opportunities to leave do to my awesome customer service I provide to various random guests that would be appreciated of my services. I stay with Nike since it's my home and like a second family for me."
good,I loved working at Nike. The atmosphere was very relaxed and friendly. I enjoyed my job and I felt I was trained very well for. My managers were very understanding and i'd love to go back
good,"the job security is not there but i did enjoy the time i was there management seemed a little un aware of things the job definitely was not hard at all, loved the fact we were able to take breaks."
good,Would recommended  to anyone who likes the retail environment. Fast paced with just enough downtime so you don’t get bored. Also guess with great management and career advancement.
good,"aprendí a ser mas rápida y trabajar bajo presión, realizar notas de credito, cobrar mas rapido atender muy bien al cliente trabajar en equipo"
good,"The management always considered the fact that university was my priority and my shifts where agreed upon before hand. "
good,"I'll go back to work there.its just it's hard to get hired in full time have to go thru the temp,which is fine but it will take you up to a year before you become fulltime"
good,Nike is a fantastic and innovative company that rewards success. Great work life balance with a family minded company culture. Cutting edge technology with a desire to be the best.
good,"Offering a lot learning opportunities in a casual, working environment"
good,My time of employment at Nike was very casual and very enjoyable.   Employee benefits for merchandise at the time were fantastic.  While promotion didn't benefit me I can say that there always seemed to be the opportunity for advancement if you were interested and worked hard enough.
good,Excelente espacio de trabajo con grandes comodidades
good,Working for the company is amazing in itself. It's team-oriented and sports filled enviroment. Higher management is the only thing wrong with certain stores. They dictate the overall mood and atmosphere of the store.
good,Nike was very understanding and accommodating towards their employees.  They allowed me a flexible work schedule and had a unique and interesting training period.
good,Hard worker/Fast-hands/Best Team-worker. The ability to learn fast and create space for my team members without putting them in any situation.plus i have multiple accomplishment during the years.
good,"Fast passed"
good,"Me destaquei no segundo mês de trabalho que ganhei o funcionário do mês e depois o funcionário do quarter. "
good,"Un empleo donde tu opinión es importante para la empresa, donde puedes crecer desacuerdo a tu desempeño, el ambiente es alentador y agradable, desarrollas habilidad para un buen trato al cliente así como los mismos compañeros. Lo que mas me gusto fue los incentivos por productividad que eran desde viajes dinero en efectivo o electrodomésticos."
good,i worked at nike woodbury 2014-2015.  It was an awesome place to work. Every one including the managers were DOPE. We had lots of fun and also got lots of work done w team work. It was my first real job and it taught me a lot. First place i worked that had such a motivating environment. As a team we always went above and beyond and exceeded our store goal. The store was always pretty busy especially during the holidays... sometimes it was stressful but we made the best out of it. I made a lot of good friends there that i still speak to and cant forget i had the latest sneakers and clothes.. GOOD quality!! Most of the managers transferred to NJ stores for other opportunities and most of the people i worked with left to go back to school and find higher paying jobs. I wil say i have been to the store recently and its not the same including the poor management But i will the job is good for teens in HS or young adults looking for a part time.
good,"Buena organización, buen ambiente de trabajo y compañerismo, aprendizaje diario sobre la marcam todos los productos, y mejor trato al cliente."
good,I thought working for Nike was very exciting and was well organized environment.  You learn about all different types of shoes and other products. I also learned alot from the consumers.
good,The company is very supportive and workers are eager to help everyone out especially the customers. Always push beyond their limits and making their customers happy.
good,"I love working for this company. The benefits are great. I had full health, vision and dental insurances. Also, I had stock options and 401k. I worked as a merchandiser in the store and was allowed to really own my zone. My reason for leaving was mainly due to no room for advancement in my current store. Nike is very competitive and it is hard to move up unless you are willing to move around. That being said, I ended up leaving my store and transferred to a Hurley store where I made a move up in positions as well."
good,Management was awesome and so was my entire crew as a whole. Work was actually enjoyable. It was always about movement and keeping it fresh. But the consumer always came first.
good,"I enjoyed working at Nike, however was let go due to my outside sporting commitments. "
good,"Empresa muito dinâmica e sólida, possuí muitos benefícios aos seus funcionários."
good,I loved my time at Nike and highly recommend it to anyone who is interested in the company. They have a great culture and fun employees who truly care about one another.
good,"Nothing to say negative, it was a positive experience and a means to get to an end. I was able strengthen my ability to manage individuals as well as enhance problem solving skills."
good,loved working there. The people are great. The freedom to manage your own schedule is refreshing and hands autonomy to employ and the focus on personal development is encouraging for long term career ambitions.
good,"aile sıcaklığında çalışma ortamı, arkadaş canlısı, hem öğretici hem eğlenceli çalışma arkadaşları"
good,Great place to work. Would love to work for this company again but as a higher position other than a seasonal athlete. I broke my ankle at the time I was working here and the staff was great about making compromises and allowing me to still work in the back to do inventory to keep my income.
good,"Teamwork opzich heel belangrijk. Goed betaald, vooral nachtpost was ideaal voor mij. Ging heel graag werken."
good,"GREAT place to work and to begin your retail career. I would recommend to anyone, for sure. The discounts are great and the people were awesome!!!!!!!"
good,"Very supportive supervisor, got a chance to peek inside different function of the team. Everyone is dedicated to their job and love it."
good,I had an amazing time while working at Nike. In just a few short months I gained a lot of valuable experience in sales. I can gladly say I was able to improve my communication skills and overall confidence. The managers were all great and super friendly. They are always willing to help you and love to see you succeed. Great working environment!
good,Nike is a company where they want you to grow with them. They want to to climb the ladder and go where ever you want in the company. This is a company that actually cares about you and what your dreams are. They also make sure the give back to the communities around their stores.
good,Constantly providing product knowledge to customers. Always working as a team. Friendly competitions like running challenges. Always adapting and improving ourselves to give the customers what they want.
good,Always innovative and moving forward with technology and growing trends. Keeps up to date with the market and consumer needs in products and services.
good,"Adquiri muitas experiência como operadora de caixa, e no atendimento à clientes. Também em organização do nosso local de trabalho, etc."
good,"A typical day working at Nike includes helping customers on the sales floor, specifically using knowledge of the Nike products to help them meet their needs. Responsibilities also include working the cash register. "
good,"great way to work on customer service and get one out of their comfort zone. you meet a great group of people who eventually become like family to one another if you work often and get to know them. The environment is safe and fun but you have to know when to buckle down do what you need to get done in order to meet the store goals in sales, percentages, etc."
good,"This was my favorite job that I've had, the team is mostly very fun young adults! The environment is just like a sports team, they cheer all the time, before every shift you'll cheer and get updated on the sales of the day. The worst part is a few unpaid meetings at 6am"
good,"The company is wonderful to grow with the stock options they offer, constantly busy means it's a plus"
good,"Una experiencia que me ayudo positivamente "
good,"Overall, Nike is an amazing and fun place to work. The management is very welcoming and lots of training is provided. A highly recommended place to work."
good,an easy place to work. Great working culture management great motivator's along with working with my Army Reserve Schedule and training. Learned all aspects and positions.
good,I enjoyed my time working for Nike. I mainly did so as a art time job over the summer. It gave me good experience in the sales industry. I got to work in the stock room to learn about inventory management. The staff was very welcoming and demanding at the same time.
good,"Nike is a good company to work for. it allows you to grow."
good,This was an amazing experience and a great company to work for. I had a blast learning new skills an talking to consumers about product lines. It was a fast pace environment at times.
good,I worked at Nike for four years during my last two years of high school and the first two years of my undergraduate. I thoroughly enjoyed my experience at Nike as it provided a wonderful work environment and the ability to learn the basics as a salesmen working with a diverse clientele.
good,"A typical day at Nike was competitive"
good,"Very good Learning platform with fun and healthy environment as a plus. Very good with training to advance skills. Managers of varying levels of skills, some much better than others. Advancement was possible and encouraged. product sale and marketing regulations are very important to internal functioning."
good,"Ambiente agradável, uma empresa com espírito jovem e despojado, onde a diversidade é respeitada e vivenciada. Ótimas oportunidades desenvolvimento pessoal e profissional."
good,"I stayed in the back the whole time, I rarely ever was in the front and interacting with customers. I did tell them I wanted to be interactive but they never trained me to be in the front from the time I started to the time I left."
good,"Enjoyed the opportunities and workout place environment given at the Nike Factory level.  It is a very diverse work place, which I enjoyed very much. Fun company to work for."
good,It was amazing and co workers were awesome also. I loved going in to work. But customers were rude at times which sucked. The discounts were great and sometimes there was awesome product.
good,"Strong emphasis on teamwork, participation in activities and general health of employees and customers alike. Management was hard working and likable which made it easy to work hard as an employee."
good,Very engaging and rewarding work culture. Immediately felt like I was with family during every shift instead of co-workers. Provided a great work-life balance that included socializing with fellow employees outside of work.
good,"Me gustó trabajar en Nike, ya que me ayudaron con el horario de trabajo para yo poder estudiar y hacer ambas cosas son ningún problema."
good,"I love the company, but the store I work at is kind of disorganized and I could reccommend better ways to run things. All the workers are kind and respectful, but the higher ranked employees like to use there ranking over lower people"
good,"The Nike culture and lifestyle is truly an amazing experience. The first thing I learned as a leader was to ""Listen to the voice of the athlete"" which has stuck with me since day one. The work is collaborative and you never know who will have the next great idea."
good,Being on your feet 12 hours a day. Walking and moving keeping you energized. Placing orders and listening to a headset to help you place your orders correctly.
good,"Amazing coaching staff, and great environment to work in. I work with during the overnight team, receive a delivery daily. Process new units throughout each night."
good,A empresa é super agradável e lhe dá suporte para aprendizado .
good,Personally this is a great company to work for. There are benefits and opportunity everywhere! Definitely need to have the flexible hours in order to move up to a management position. Your main job would be not only to grow on the digital journey that NIKE promotes but also be diligent when holding up the standards for the company as far as presentation of the products and cleaning up.
good,Excellent place to work for Nike company. Management can be a bit taxing depending on who you work for. Good thing is management changes often and company has a great culture.
good,"A typical day at work was fun, I loved going to work! When it was busy it was a fast pace. I learned better communication skills and how to be more outgoing. The management is great for the most part! They are very understanding."
good,"Sales Associate "
good,"While the organization is tremendous to work with and the people are both competitive and competent, the organization is in a stage of ""finding it's footing"".  It will get back to the pole position in the industry but there will be growing pains along the way."
good,"Apesar do horário e a escala serem pontos difíceis na hora de conciliar com a vida pessoal, era um ótimo local de se trabalhar e se tivesse a chance voltaria com certeza. Aprendi muita coisa e tive uma ótima experiência trabalhando na Nike."
good,"Sin duda muy contenta con mi puesto en la empresa, el trato de los coach, la ayuda recibida en cualquier momento cuando estaba en mis comienzos, no sólo éramos un grupo de trabajo sino un equipo que buscaba llegar a los objetivos y siempre pensando en conjunto."
good,"There has to be some sort of balance between work and personal life. In general, having that sense of balance will improve job satisfaction among employees because they will feel that they’re not overlooking the other areas of their lives that are, if not more, important to them than work."
good,"Empresa muito boa de se trabalhar, a cultura que é pregada, é linda, porém, as pessoas que são escolhidas para gerenciar, não são as mais preparadas e deixam a desejar em desenvolvimento, no qual a empresa presa bastante. Mas no quesito Empresa, está de parabéns, umas das melhores que já trabalhei. Investe realmente no desenvolvimento de pessoal."
good,"I met some of the best people on this team. I still have many as friends and would not have the same positive feelings towards Nike without working on this team."
good,"Teamwork opzich heel belangrijk. Goed betaald, vooral nachtpost was ideaal voor mij. Ging heel graag werken"
good,"Coming to the new night shift I was able to create my own culture.  we promote a family atmosphere and help each other to succeed as a team."
good,"With almost 16 years working with Nike, I felt it to be an amazing opportunity throughout my 3 jobs."
good,"The job changes up as you never know which part of the store you'll be working at that day, could be in the back of house going through and pricing inventory, or the sales floor doing customer service."
good,"This company is one of the best to work for. The only Con is you have no work life balance. Also Nike doesn't seem to understand their customers and locations. I learned a ton in my Seven years with Nike, it has allowed me to see different viewpoints on a lot of different issues. Employees are GREAT!!! but often times not given the amount of credit."
good,"Great work experience, but cuts hours a lot. Hired on seasonally, was kept on as a permanent athlete. Fun to work here, but not good if you have rent to pay or a car note and are not a full timer or Head coach."
good,"Success means working hard and stepping outside your comfort zone, Nike encourages all employees to develop deep expertise while expanding employees into new experiences."
good,"every day from morning to night I will work I learned everything in the work area I want to work in a Nike store. I like to sell this brand"
good,This is a fun place to work and the people that you get meet is awesome. the discounts that you get once you're a team member is unheard of. I wish I could still get the discount.
good,Horrible manager. She got rid of me when the Sr VP wanted to meet with me and showed interest in my work efforts. She was the interim person in a role that I might have been considered for.  Sad reality of being in the right job with the wrong boss.
good,"There is never a typical day, every day is slightly different. Emails are constant, sometimes too much red tape since the Brand is constantly trying to make sure it's presented in the best light possible. Everyone is pretty passionate about their respective roles and you will work with a lot of intelligent people."
good,"Nike is a enjoyable atmosphere to work in and the discounts are nice; however, the pay rate is not good and the raises are poor. After working for over a year I have received only one raise of about a quarter."
good,Nike was one of those jobs that I really enjoyed because it helped me know the product that I was so used to wearing and the atmosphere was great to work in. Made allot of life long friends from working there.
good,Nike was a relaxing nice place to work. Friendly people nice environment. Very flexible hours understanding managers/leads. Get to meet different cultures.
good,"There were many different competitions we had throughout my time a nike we had races , who could do the most pushups , who could sell the most items in a day it was a very fun experience I recommend others to work there because I enjoyed my time there."
good,"Besides the lack of benefits for being a contractor, everything else was a great experience at Nike. I was able to learn a lot!"
good,Au début quand on ne connait personne ces difficile de s'adapter mais quand on apprend a connaitre tout le monde tout ce passe bien
good,Un coaching avait lieu tout les matin sur les objectifs de la journée se qui permettait au personnelles d’être plus motivé et impliqué dans la vie de l'entreprise et un bonne communication interne
good,"Everyday was always something new. Interesting work, fast paced, learned a lot. Excellent team. Good organizational skills. Differential between contractors and FTEs. (eg FTE's had access to the Employee store and contractors got access a couple of times a year)"
good,"Nike was a great place to work at since I enjoy running and other sports. It was fun to be a part of the design and production of Nike apparel. Being on contract was decent for me, but some may not be able to handle the lack of job security. "
good,I worked as a stockroom athlete and i love it i would always have something to do no matter what size the shipment came in. Very fast paced. Fun while spending long shifts there.
good,Couldnt have asked for a better place to work as a 17yr/old.  It was so fun and very rewarding.  Met so many great people. Made lifetime friendships and very professional networks/references.

A very interesting workplace with a lot to learn in. The management at times wasn't the best but that's to be expected from time to time. Everyone I worked with were decent people with their own set of goals and reasons for working there. I enjoyed most of the co-workers but as in most places you have those that would rather goof off or just simply not work. That made some days much longer then others as well as a bit stressful for those who did work. The hardest part of any job is connecting with the co-workers so that the effort is a team effort. In retail there are some who enjoy their work and some who don't which leads to a dysfunctional team and most times this is the case in retail. I so enjoyed learning the different shoes, apparel, and equipment. I enjoyed the team of co-workers I had the pleasure of working with and most of the management team. It is overall a good place to work especially if your athletically inclined."

Our management is good they make sure we stay awake and alive.They also check up on us time to time to make sure we are doing what we have to do. My co-workers are good employees to work with. They are very helpful with helping you do something if you dont know how to do it just yet. The hardest part of the job is when im at the cashier dealing with a customer that is doing a return. The reason is because we ask for there id to put into our system and at they wouldnt want to give it to us.

good,"Working at a place like Nike made me feel at home, enjoyed every part of it because I have a familiarity with sports and apparel. I definitely made some friends along the way so that is always good, and you almost treat them like your second family.  I would recommend working at Nike because it was an amazing experience and I know people my age would enjoy the culture and the time spent working in that type of environment."
good,"I enjoyed working here at Nike, after a while things began to change and I realized I couldn't grow how I wanted to here. That is why I ended up going to look for a better work opportunity."
good,"They look so look after all their staff, and the uniform allowance is generous. The progression is difficult and often you are overlooked for a potential job role that would suit you due to your age."
good,"I worked weekends there that was the only down fall. Company was very good to work for benefits wise, they weren’t as lenient for the schedule and I had kids and needed a weekday schedule due to babysitting that they couldn’t accommodate. So I ended up leaving for that reason."

good,Fast paced work environment which teaches employees real world sales techniques and values to live by. very fun company to work for with a lot of room for advancement.
good,When I was working at Nike I was working on the sales floor as well as at the cash register. This was great to practice my skills of engaging with customers to make their shopping experience fun and easy. The most enjoyable part of the job was the people I worked with and the hardest part of the job was closing at night because we had to make sure everything looked great for the next day. I really liked all of my managers while I worked there.

The managers are well trained with years of experience, and any question I ever had was not only answered but I was trained so I didn't have to ask the question again. Not only is the Nike store in Leesburg knowledgable, but also a friendly environment to work and shop at."
good,company with excellent work environment. The work style is very free and informal. the workplace feels like second home. The Mangers are friendly and understanding.
good,"Working on my feet for 9 hour a day, and being able to interact with consumers greatly enabled me to grow my customer service skills and ability to handle high paced environments around me. From having to stock new product, help consumers find the right product they're looking for, and being able to work the cash register at a high pace, the need to be flexible was greatly instilled. While having multiple managers, I was able to have to perform multiple tasks within a given time, and be able to work with a group of people, all with different views on how to perform the task given. While the hardest part of the job was having to deal with people from all demographics needing different items, it was also the most enjoyable. Being able to interact and learn about all different people greatly helped my social skills, and ability to relate to people from all kinds of demographics."
good,A fun fast paced environment that you will have fun at. Working with the best type of people that they hired was great. Alot of those people I still talk to today.
good,The work environment is a very positive and precise experience. The job resembles a sports team with great coaches and supportive teammates. Everyone plays their role and every day you win.
good,Loved it there.  My team was awesome as well as my coach . If I could have worked after I got out of hospital I would have went straight back to work but I had to reapply
good,Nike really does care about it's customers! That is what impresses me. It was a great place. I recommend going there to work. It really is fun. They pay you on time.

good,I thought management did a great job of being transparent with their team and always provided thorough training on any new updates. I felt like my time there everyone became very close to each other and it felt like a home.

good,"great job doing events and photo shoots also working along with celebrities, buzzing atmosphere and positive environment to be around also to learn new things within the brand."
good,It’s a great workplace for anyone ages 18-30 anything older it’s still fun but it’s more of a kiddish  environment.  Great discount and sales if you have kids you will love it.

I thoroughly enjoy every aspect of the teamwork that is portrayed.  I am very passionate about the brand and love representing it every chance I get."
good,"At Nike Factory stores your coworkers are seen as teammates and can also become close friends. The management team works very well when everyone is on the same page. There is no commission but sales athletes are encouraged to make the consumer experience memorable and pleasant. The hardest part of the job is dealing with customer complaints and returned shoes with blown air units. Overall, it is very easy to be successful working there as long as you make it clear to the management team what your career goals are and you are on task during your shifts."
good,"Working at Nike Boston has been my best career experience so far.  The pay, benefits, and culture are very good within Nike as their employees are one of their top focuses besides their consumers.  Moving from a retail store into a corporate career has been very challenging as Nike's corporate careers are very competitive."
good,"Working as an intern at Nike World Head Quarters was a unique experience in the fact that there were so many different functions for each of the 200 (about) inters."
good,"Had a great time working here and met a lot of good people. There’s always a few people lined up as soon as the store opens most mornings, but the store operates like a usual popular clothing/shoe store."
good,"The pay and hours were awful, management expects you to have 36 available work hours per week while only scheduling you 20-25 hours per week. The management did a great job in creating a fun environment that distracted you from how poor the pay was."
good,"Ótimo ambiente de trabalho, pessoas qualificadas e sempre pronta pra te ajudar."
good,"Trabaje en nike brand experience. El ambiente era agradable, como empresa respondian y respetaban todo lo que era dias de estudio, vacaciones, licencias y demás. "
good,Nike was a lot of fun for the time I worked there. They really take the time and train you well on product so you know what to say when talking to customers. It’s also interesting seeing some of the different technologies used in their products
good,Perfecta escuela de aprendizaje para la vida laboral
good,"A good place to work with nice people; however, not much opportunity for upward advancement of women. I stayed for six months and then resigned in favor of a private law firm. In-house legal is totally different than private law firms."
good,"I loved working for Nike. I would have loved to stay there longer but the pay was not that well. Working in the stores as an ""Athlete"" was enjoyable but like any other retail store."
good,"Management cares about your success, you have the opportunity to learn about the company and what they offer to their customers, fast-paced environment."
good,"I learned to adjust from different culture and personality. The top management always do things that the employee will excel in the job, and so much fun dealing with customer and co-employees."
good,I enjoyed my time at Nike. The environment was fast-paced and always had opportunities to grow and learn. The culture allowed for personal with different backgrounds to succeed.
good,Aprendi frases que vou levar para vida toda. Aprendi a trabalhar em equipe. Nunca me arrependerei por ter feito parte da empresa.
good,The better you are the more they rely on you. you get to do other peoples work. some fast pace machines and some slow pace machines. you'll have to put up with rude people as nike tends to wait a few months before letting them go.
good,"La empresa no es mala, mala es la gente que está en puestos que no les corresponden, sin tener una idea del trabajo que realizan solo porque conocen a alguien obtienen esos puestos. 😞"
good,I loved it just hard to get promoted. You come into the store and help people shop. I learned so much about the different types of shoes and even clothes.
good,Not the average workplace. There is a great balance of work and personal time off. A lot of spoiled customers who would like discounts or refunds on items that were overworn.
good,The company was a great place to work management needs more improvement far as a matter of respect and far as bending the rules a lot of times I worked there and didn’t feel appreciated but overall I made the best of it made some amazing people in the mist of being apart of the Nike elite team
good,Loved the Job and all it did for my career to date. But the work load was a lot at the age I up tainted the position. No days of for months and never had time yo enjoy life or family.
good,"The morning meeting introduces employees to what's new with the company and products, keeping us up-to-date with what is happening. A typical day proves easy because the products generally sell themselves. The biggest worry was to add on products and match them with clothes or shoes to drive larger sales. This company has taught me reach my highest potential, for there were always opportunities to move up in the company. Communication is the key as well, whether it be co-workers or customers. This company helped me to expand my communication skills, for you meet various personalities daily and deal with them whether you agree with their perspectives or not. Tolerance and patience grows with you as well for retail teaches you that the ""customer is always right,"" regardless of the situation. But at the end of the day, you have your discount to shop your stress away, which I feel, Nike is generous about. One of the best companies I have ever worked for."
good,I would recommend Nike to anyone. The job and atmosphere itself is very welcoming and sweet. You are treated as family. Although if you work through contract they still manage to treat everyone as equal and it is highly respected. If granted the opportunity/ chance I would return in the future.
good,"My days were always good at Nike, easy shipments made the day go by fast. Would recommend people to work for them if they are seeking employment. Also great shifts"
good,"During my time at Nike i was able to get involved in a number of different positions. from Sales to Customer Operations and service, I was exposed to a number of challenges and was able to adapt to meet and go above and beyond the demands of the business when required. The culture is incredibly fast paced and everyone works astonishingly hard which is generally rewarded by Nike with experiences."
good,Excellent workplace to learn and having fun.  Decent respected work atmosphere. Senior Management encourages in taking initiatives and independent work culture to achieve organizational goals.
good,"I a typical work day is helping customers, running registers , recieving product and placing it on rack to be visually presented. The work place is a very good and relaxed feeling management is good and always there to help out"
good,I truly enjoyed the focus on sales associates working as a team to get things done. It made even the most mundane things enjoyable. Another great aspect of working for Nike was how well I got along with the staff. They were all so friendly and I'm still friends with some of them today.
good,"Working for Nike, I have been able to start out a little slower. My manager is awesome, in general; He is very understanding that I have been out of the workforce for a year. I make it a priority to show up everyday; even if I must leave early (which doesn't happen regularly). I stay busy either researching information, learning something new, or on the tasks I am given to complete. "
good,"It is a great, fun, flexible place to work at. You get your uniform paid for and you get tons of discounts to clothing and shoes as well. Management is very helpful and they are willing to work with your schedule."
good,The job was not difficult and everything was self explanatory. It is a job that fits and adjust to your schedule with advancement in jobs. I liked it.
good,"While employed with Nike I learned many things that I still carry with me today. Respect, and how to treat others being a big thing there. I was with Nike for 6 years and loved every minute. It was an amazing place to work part time while I was raising my small child."
good,"• A great place to learn about the sporting world from the eyes of a company that rules with technology and innovation. "
good,If I could do it over again I will still be at Nike. Awesome company. I enjoyed the management staff. I love the people I worked with. I love that management was there for me when my granddad died.

good,"The Nike Factory Store is a great place to work at. The Nike culture and bond between the workers is very admirable and everyone feels like a family. The store is very busy on weekends, but slow during the weekdays, leaving the weekends a little stressful, and the weekdays boring. Everyone works every weekend usually unless requested off. You are sometimes there for hours after closing time to help clean up when other people don't do their part throughout their shift. The job does give a lot of benefits and a great discount."
good,awesome and energetic work environment lots of fun activities for consumers which employees get to interact and there are monthly rewards for those outstanding individuals every month.
good,"Nike is an amazing company that teaches a lot to its co workers about their products, culture and how to better oneself through its products. The work atmosphere is welcoming, friendly and enjoyable to be a part of."

good,"i’m proud to be apart of the Nike athlete team. It brings a wide variety of skills into play. A typical day at work usually deals with handling boxes of shipments that come in, that we then have to process."
good,"empresa responsable"
good,"Muy buen ambiente con los compañeros"
good,All of the managers are wonderful and make sure that each employee is taken care. Each manager will take the time to get to know the employees on a personal level.
good,I learned the fast pace of changing of sales and priorities of the job. A typical day consists of either refilling multiple items on the floor or changing displays as well. Communicating with the customers is a pleasant break from working to maintain a attractive sales floor and making sure it fits company guidelines
good,"Paid very well for a 16 year old’s first job, lots of free clothes/shoes, discounts, and cool place to work. Had a great time working there and made some friends that I’m still in touch with today."
good,Main job is to help customers - might be asked to do some side jobs such as cleaning and putting out for merchandise on the sales floor. Learned more about the Nike company and the operations that sales associates process through in order to create a great shopping experience for customers.

good,"Great Company and you get a 40% discount on all Nike Products."
good,I have really enjoyed my time at Nike it was a really fun and cool place to work. The managers are very friendly yet the do push to get the best out of you. However the best part of the job are your fellow co workers. For the most part they are all students at the local college who are also very friendly the over all Nike culture turns the team into one big family.
good,"Everyone at Nike is amazing! Everyone says hi when you walk in that door. everyone comes in ready to work and be active. although you are on your feet your whole shift, you should be able to get used to it after the second week. the time goes by fast when you are kept busy."
good,this job was great it has what every young athlete craves and that is competition within the work place to try and be the best team player you can be. it has great benefits with the discounts that they offer their employees but wht I didn't like was that the hours were never stable hours.
good,they offer great lessons in retail and customer service standards and have a job advancement program in place but its minimal and vague to new comers I wish it were a more clear program as I would wish to advance within the company
good,I could not think of a better place to recommend for anyone to work it is a family oriented environment and has very good benefits I think that if a person likes an upbeat job this for you
good,I worked here while i was studying and i really enjoyed my time. It was a big store with many different departments which catered for all customers. Management were friendly good and understanding towards my needs.
good,"I've been working for Nike for a year and 8 months. If you work hard, they'll treat you right. Recent new management has changed hours for a lot of employees, barely giving us one shift per week. Other than that, the discount is amazing, and the environment is very fun. Time flies when you go in! Management has to learn to be fair with all employees when it comes to hours."
good,"Empresa fantástica para se trabalhar com cerca de 80 colaboradores, com ambiente muito bom, quando o ambiente é bom o trabalho corre bem, trabalhamos sempre em equipa para o sucesso da loja em causa."

NIKE wants you to perform your best every day.  NIKE also wants to improve our planet by reducing waste and investing in renewable energy."
good,"I took the first shift at Nike from 6AM to 4PM. It was a tough job physically, but very rewarding overall. There were tons of opportunities to advance, and to  attain more hours. The pay relied on the efficiency and production of the individual, so hard work literally paid off. It was a good experience for me to meet and work with other employees instead of mainly customers at my previous retail job. The managers were mostly very helpful. The environment was expected: fast-paced, demanding, and sometimes unforgiving if regulations of the warehouse aren't followed. I honestly enjoyed the physical payoff of the job. Having walked constantly for nearly ten hours a day, I became much more healthy physically."
good,"Kick butt daily in your job, be passionate about sports and the athlete, be a great, positive teammate and the rest will take care of itself.  Nike is a marathon, not a sprint.  It's easy to become impatient and to start comparing yourself to others.  Don't fall into the trap."
good,If you are a naturally competitive person you will love working there. You must have a strong moral compass and be open minded to all kinds of people and ideas otherwise you will not make it. I learned more about being and becoming successful in my first 6 months there than in all my years prior.
good,"Working Environment Very High Volume! "

good,Good with work if it’s your only job .. it’s a great place but when you have to work two jobs it’s not really flexible on the schedule. Unless you’ve been there a while.

good,"As a manager, was a great store in regards to benefits and discounts, the day to day team are great and super high performing. Nike also provides training and further progression within their ranks!"
good,Would never leave unless something very significant came along. It is very competetive but there are plenty of options for advancing. Work life balance was incredable

good,"Great work environment, really positive management. I loved being busy and being able to learn in this workplace. The company is great about showing love to the little guys."
good,Working at nike is usually a good day because of the energy it brings and I've learned a great amount of knowledge as far as customer servicing people. The hardest part of the day was not being able to fully help out a customer because of our inventory and most enjoyable part was our morning or afternoon huddles we would have in the middle of the store to motivate the group and store give off more energy

good,"It was a great place to work and I loved the atmosphere. I only left to pursue opportunities that would benefit my life a little more such as, the drive from where I live now and where I did before."
good,"The company of Nike is a very passionate brand. From my experience, management and everyone else as well seem to be very enthusiastic about the brand passion and really do shower that on all their employees as well. It makes the environment feel like more than just a workplace, it makes it feel like you are apart of something a whole lot bigger and exciting. With daily cheers, great co-workers, friendly environment, big atmosphere with tons of people, wide range of culture within the employees. The most enjoyable part about the job is simply the team itself. You will meet tons of different people who are just great and always create a better work day for each other just by being around. Outside the store, many and many events are arranged to from basketball nights, to Nike store fleet tournaments as well! Fun environment, great and popular brand, great people, can't go wrong here."

good,"Four different shifts in a day so depends on what your shifted for, Learned the value of Nike as a brand and company. Management was cool at time but when it came to hitting monthly marks became not people friendly. Was always like a competition so that could be a good or bad thing depending owns asking. The hardest part of the day was night shifts to clean up after the store had been destroyed on weekends because of weekend sales. The most enjoyable part of the job was seeing customers happy with your knowledge of the brand and shoe technology."
good,"typical work day but in some stores the management needs to be reevaluated. i learned a lot as far as work out ethics, how to assist customers with a different approach, and how to be healthy. Really a great job especially if you are into what's trending."

All employees are super proud of the brand and this radiates throughout all exchanges.

Because I am sort of a ""sneaker head"" i loved being around all the different varieties of shoes. The team members at Nike are wonderful ! Always full of energy and always available when you need them. Some of the time it was difficult to be able to help some of the out of town/foreign consumers that did not speak any English at all, but was always able to get the job done through non-verbal communication."
good,"Formar parte del equipo de trabajo de NIKE, fue una experiencia única. Era un excelente equipo de trabajo, estable, dinámico y divertido. Lo que mas me gusto fue el ambiente laboral. lo que menos me agrado fue la situación económica por la que atravesaba el país lo que perjudicaba las ventas."
good,I got to the set at 6am. A full hour before they needed people there. I was the first in line to sign in for my day. I was then told to walk to a tent area for suitable wardrobe in the commercial. I would dress as a construction worker for the background. Myself and three other extras would work together in the background to not only have fun but act as we were told for the director.
good,"Nike was easily my favorite job out of all the jobs that I had previously worked at. I got the job through my brother getting me and interview and then just meeting/exceeding everything they asked of me as an employee. Whether it was product knowledge, helping customers or helping out in the back when asked I did just about everything there and I enjoyed it all. The reason I left though was after about 8-9 months with the company we got new management and they also stopped letting part time employees work over 25 hours (which you could do if you picked up people's shifts which I did quite often) and I began to not enjoying coming to work anymore. A lot of the people that I built friendships with had left prior to myself and it just wasn't the same."

good,I really enjoys working there. Everybody was so nice it was literally the best job i had as a high school student. They worked with my school schedule very well.
good,Very friendly work environment. A lot of opportunities to advance and progress within the company. Catered to the customers' needs and strived for success on the daily
good,"I loved working here and would definitely work here again if I could. My managers were all amazing, and I loved my teammates. There were always so many opportunities to advance and learn. Overall, my favorite job I've worked yet."
good,Working for the company is a surprise everyday. The mission statement for the company is designed around people and athletes. They take care of their employees and treat everyone fairly.
good,Great place to work. Managers are awesome. Great hours during busy season. It’s a fun environment and my co workers are the best!!! The pay is really good for retail.
good,"Loved working for Nike such a huge company they truly make you feel so important, and that you get to play a part in the company. They are a company that shows you what a team player is"
good,"Fast paced working environment were multitasking was a necessity. My position was in the stockroom were I was in charge of looking for any and all products needed by either the costumer or my coworkers for salesfloor replenishment.  Disregarding 1-2 of the managers, management typically ran a smooth operation throughout the day.  Hardest part of the job was dealing with typically understaffed days during the weekend and have to deal with technology that often did not work properly which would heavily delay/drop sales.  Most enjoyable part included working with highly energetic individuals who provided a fun working environment."
good,Enjoyed the employees along with working here. Will go back if I get a chance.  Some of the managers are really awesome there they work with your school schedule
good,"A day of work at Nike is at an average pace if not a little bit more busy. Helping customers find what they need while making sure they have an excellent experience was the goal working at Nike. Working at Nike i realized that when you apply your own skills with the principals of your workplace you can be successful. Also the culture at Nike is much more unique, versatile and expressive than other companies which makes the workplace fun. The hardest part of the job to me would be finding a comfortable pair of sneakers for a customer that has extremely specific requests. What makes the hard part of the job worth it, is when you find exactly what your customer is looking for. After you've helped them as well as given your advice about the shoe they've selected and purchased. It makes you feel accomplished as an athlete for the company."
good,"Fue una gran experiencia, además de para aprender, para convivir en el ambiente de trabajo."
good,Worked here during college enjoyed it and the discount. Hours were sometimes not enough but often could pick up hours from coworkers. very busy outlet mall will keep you very busy
good,"I worked for two years as a sports shop salesman, highlighting my responsibility, enthusiasm, teamwork and willingness to learn new things. sometimes the work was hard, but you need patience."
good,"The job itself was no problem it was just that certain permanent employees made me feel uncomfortable at times.By me going through a temporary services it like they don't treat you the same as a permanent employee at all.Of course,management did and that was one of main reason for leaving."
good,"I loved working at Nike. It was a place where you came, got your work done and kicked butt at the same time. I really enjoyed working for a sport company. The culture there was always inviting and it was a hard decision to leave.I decided that I wanted to move to New York and this was the reason I left the company."
good,"This job was amazing and Nike really makes you feel like family. The gratis and discounts are awesome, but they have very few full time employees, so there are no benefits unless you're lucky enough to have a position open."
good,Like i start off by saying nike is a nice place to work if you like their products . Everyone thereis usually is easy to get alone with . They make work very fun ! I love it .
good,The trainings and meetings with product knowledge was most helpful. Building relationships with my coworkers and most managers was a great experience.
good,"South Chicago Nike Factory store is not a good work environment. Management lies and is manipulative and hold good employees back. I was promoted three times within a year but was graded unsatisfactory work performance by a manager who ""didn't like my demeanor"". I would recommend Nike to anyone but the location in South Chicago needs a culture shift and all out staff swap."
good,The best  part about the job is seeing all the new things nike is creating and getting to know so many new people as co-workers and customers. This is easily the best place to work!
good,Enjoyed working here. Friendly staff. Offered 401k! Great discounts for employees. Learned a lot about Nike products. Decent hours. Black Friday was fun.
good,"Empresa jovem e com espírito inovador, tem em seus pilares o esporte  e dá muitas oportunidades a ques é da área comercial."
good,"Mas que ser un trabajo, es una familia y el trabajo en equipo fluye de manera natural gracias a eso."
good,For someone who loves sports and the apparel that goes with it this is a great place to work. You must love the Nike brand because it will feed into the rest of your life. I enjoyed working here and would totally go back as a part time employee.

good,"loved working there, was a great summer job, flexible hours and managers always willing to help out with scheduling conflicts. Fellow employees were nice."
good,"In het materialen team was een goede team spirit om het werk gedaan te krijgen. De werkzaamheden waren afwisselend, met voldoende ruimte voor ontwikkeling en interessant. Leuk bedrijf, maar moeilijk binnen te komen en onzekerheid over je contractsduur."
good,I loved working here I got this job while in high school and always looked forward to going to work because it was a fun and great learning environment I would work here again if I had too.
good,"Best job ever, management was incredible and very protective over their staff. They were friends then bosses. I loved the people I worked with here, it was awesome."
good,Worked during holidays and summer break as a college student. Great opportunity for growth and leadership. Learned to interact with all type of consumers. Good work environment and a lot of positivity while a work.
good,"Nike is awesome for learning how to be cross trained for different departments and they really do operate as a team. They take care of their employees, when I had family and health issues and couldn't qualify for FMLA my managers took the time to get me set up with HR and Nike had a leave program of its own to help me. The managers just genuinely do care for everyone who works there and check in on how everyone is doing at their job but also in their personal lives."
good,"Non structured, flexible schedule.  Fun, competitive, sport culture.  Team environment."
good,im dreaming to join in the best company which is i can share my knowledge and experience.I want a better future and a better career and to be happy for my work and colleagues.Money is not important the most important is happiness and help and support each other.
good,Great company to work for. Lots of areas to work in . Multiple options for advancement. Open door policy allows you to express yourself without being criticized. Benefits and perks are amazing.
good,"'s Morgens kwam je aan en werd je vriendelijk begroet door iedereen, ook buiten. Het was zeker moeilijk om alles aan te leren maar zelfs bij fouten komen ze je heel vriendelijk aanspreken en maken ze ook zeker dat hoe het begrijpt en achteraf wel weet hoe het moet."
good,"I loved my job at Nike! Unfortunately I had to move, and quit. If given another chance to work at Nike, I would gladly except! I love the work environment! Even though I was with a temp service, the full time Nike employees were really helpful in teaching me what I needed to know!"
good,"The company is a very supportive and enjoyable place to work, however wages should be higher for the amount of work. Overall it is a great company with little negatives aspects."
good,"I loved working at Nike, everyone communicated with each other and all worked as a team. Our volunteer events were always fun to attend, we would help kids and play with them for a full 8 hours. The workplace is constantly busy and it’s always a different array of challenges that I enjoy to experience!"
good,Management was great when I worked there. There was always an opportunity (if you wanted it) to learn more and do more. There were lots of team building activities and I enjoyed going to work.
good,"Great place to work if u enjoy the brand as well as helping other people. Sometimes very relaxed environment, but can also get very busy as well. Nice employees as well as consumers."
good,Working at nike was some of the best years of my life. The team was amazing the work was easy and fun while just doing what i really wanted to do which was help people find what they need i couldnt have asked for much more then that.

good,"great place to start off at & with possible advancement, my building very laid back, not hot but cool and they played music...the radio. my team is like family, looked out for one another i assumed all areas was like that...i would recommend nike to anyone"
good,Leuke job leuke sfeer voor te werken en ook warm eten en korting in de winkel bij nike
good,"Loved almost every minute at the Swoosh. The culture was about sport and lifestyle. You lived the brand from the meeting room to the recreation programs. You worked hard, you pushed boundaries, innovation was demanded in everything. I earned my PHD in Marketing at Nike."
good,the fast and quick work place and the team work of working for Kelly Services at NIKE IHM. I would NOT have quit if the night shift had not messed with my life schedule.
good,Working at Nike had its plus’s for me originally just because I loved the brand but the more time I spent there working with employees and helping customers made me grow to really appreciate the culture .
good,"Working at Nike taught me a lot about teamwork. Nike also taught me how to accept everyone for who they are with their slogan “everyone is an athlete” which teaches employees to be non judgmental. The management is amazing and very understanding, they will work with you through your problems even if the problem doesn’t conflict with work. I feel I’ve never worked for a better company than NIKE."
good,"I loved working at Nike. It is a great working environment, and management makes the place function so smoothly. its fast paced but very fun. plus you meet some really great people."
good,"Wonderful work location to learn new things."
good,"very fun people to be around, make the time you are at work worth while. Active management , Always their for the customers and employees when in need. I would definetly recommend the Job"
good,"Typical day was orientated towards helping the customers and maintaining the store, as well as helping to stock and clean the store. Managers were always willing to help you learn more and advance, also help give a day off if you're a student and needed it."
good,A typical day at work is a fast work pace and busy day helping give the best customer service as possible. What i enjoy most about the job is the teamwork and diversity. Nike also tries to give back to the community as well and ive never worked for a company that strongly stands behind that message.
good,"fun great place to work, supportive management, great product, great staff, hours can be long but normally kept busy and productive to pass the time much quicker"
good,this job requires a lot of know-how. you have to be able to set goals for yourself and work towards them in order to accomplish the level of advancement your seeking. some times you may get looked over but you are looked at and that is a huge start within this company. the benefits are cool. the discounts are great. if you stick to your job you will go far in this company and it will last as long as you stay out of trouble.
good,"Workplace culture is fun and exciting."
good,"In the factory I packaged active wear clothes, shoes, and golf equipment. I also sorted clothing and shoes so that they would match the packaging and did order pickup."
good,"Love what you do with ppl and products . Fun pll to learn with, new cloths and shoes every 6 months. Crazy discount and benefits for school, health and more"
good,Very enjoyable place to work and serve the customer base. Management is very helpful when you are just starting out and they recognize talent and hard work on the job. Your hard work and effort goes noticed and can provide you with room for advancement in the workplace. Co-workers are helpful as well and you are not asked to do anything out of your expectations
good,"Typical day at work would be to receive and call out to Nike stores to assist with technical issues that would occur withing the four walls of the store."
good,"Great company to start your career,,,,, great incentives.   Great discounts.... Alot to learn however great culture and very respectable management team"
good,Overall my favorite aspect at Nike was the teamwork! Each team member addresses you as such. They engaged me from the beginning and were eager to get to know me. They never hesitated to offer advice when needed and congratulated you as well. The discounts were beyond amazing as an employee and if given the opportunity I wouldn't hesitate to go back.

good,Türkiye'de çalışılabilecek en iyi ortama sahip şirketlerden biri
good,"Es una empresa increible con muchisimas cosas buenas, y muy buenos empleados."
good,"The NIKE culture is amazing.  It was wonderful being a productive part of this outstanding and thriving company.  I had the greatest co-workers and supervisors.  I was the Administrative Asst to NIKE's Tax Director and supported  12 other Tax Department staff.  Heavy phones, computer and filing.  Worked closely with NIKE's Legal Department.  Would love to go back there but such a long drive from West Linn in rush hour traffic."
good,This was a lovely place to work and I really wished I could've stayed here longer. Everyone was so kind and management really tried to make the items easy to understand. The hardest part of the job for me was trying to keep the shoes all in place. I think shoes are the worst place to work in but everywhere is wonderful.
good,"Une entreprise qui donne de bon défi à relever,ambiance très agréable au sein de l'équipe qui donne envie de se surpasser."
good,great place to work with excellent management. and the employees were had great working skills with each other as far as team work. great breaks and 1 hour lunch.

good,Workplace culture was healthy and interactive and allowed employees to bring their a game and be unafraid of their identity. Management was keen on communication and transparency which created a healthy and strong environment for employees to work in.
good,"i love working for nike i have met many great people the managers are awesome yet sometimes play favorites, its hard to move up in the company, the discount is amazing tho 30% off in stores plus anything else in the store thats already discounted and 40-50% off online. if you like shoes ans clothes this is the job for you."
good,"Upbeat, high-energy, and enjoyable company to work for! I learned many things with Nike: basic skills for cashiering, stockroom planning, inventory, packaging, aesthetics, schematics of displaying products, presentation, announcements, cross-training, and opportunity to become a manager."
good,"good work life balance, excellent benefits and culture.  challenging yet rewarding.  Worked with some of the smartest people I've ever met.  I became LEAN certified and excellent with excel, SAP, WMS and analytics and problem solving"
good,"I love working at nike, the hours are very flexible and managements the best. other than that the discounts you get when you work for nike is un believable. co workers are exciting, there's always something new everyday,"
good,"Fantastico prodotto con continue formazioni."
good,Nike is very laid back and comfortable. management is very understanding and friendly. staff members and friendly and laid back as well. I would recommend anyone to work at Nike.
good,"I grew up idolizing Nike and Adidas and it was my dream to work at one of those companies, If you were or are a competitive athlete, the cultural fit is perfect. It is the closest corporate experience I've felt to being on a team (and I was only a contractor)."
good,"Empresa com um forte trabalho de equipe, conhecida mundialmente como uma das maiores marcas esportivas do mundo e com ótimo desenvolvimento de carreira"
good,"Nike has an excellent company and culture. Its company is one of the best ones I have worked for. The management team and other employees were great with direction, guidance organization. Working at a Nike Team was an amazing experience."

good,"A NIKE é uma ótima empresa para trabalhar."
good,I had a very fulfilling 20 year career at Nike and would highly recommend the company to anyone. I developed many lifelong personal and professional relationships that I value greatly.
good,"At Nike Chicago it is a fun place to work, highly productive with great team of leaders. You learn teamwork and leadership skills. You always have something to do either in front of house in selling the Nike product or back of house making sure all product is out and stockrooms clean and ready. Everyday at the Nike store is something new. With a group of young adults full of energy."
good,"Everyone is friendly and very welcoming, when there is things that are not going well with your work status there is personal meetings to help you stay on the right track. A typical day at work consists of customer servicing, processing, filling the floor and ringing up customers. The hardest park of the job is when multiple managers are not on the same page and give you different orders at once can be frustrating. The most enjoyable part of the job is meeting a variety of people."
good,"On a typical day of work you will find yourself working on a particular production line for the day. there may be change overs or machine breakdowns that may send you to other lines while Leads find a permanent spot for you for the rest of the shift. There are a plethora of places to improve your experience in the manufacturing work place such as machine inspection, machine operation, quality of parts inspection. This job helps develop and eye for overall performance and quality if you struggle in those ares as well as learning how to keep pace in a sometimes fast paced environment. the hardest part about the job is just making sure you are returning from breaks accordingly in my opinion as machine operation and quality control are not exactly things you can be bad at given you are trained properly. What I like most about working for Nike Air MI would have to be the benefits and overall safety mentality that is presented throughout the factory. Most employees demonstrate an affinity for some type of sport or staying in shape through exercising etc."
good,"Mi experiencia en Nike fue muy grata, me gusto mucho trabajar en nike de mega plaza, mis compañeros eran muy amables, los jefes son estrictos pero amables y saben como tratas a su vendedores, pude tener la oportunidad de ser sub jefa unos 15 días por vacaciones de mi jefe, me ofrecieron esa oportunidad y confiaron en mi persona, fue la mejor experiencia de trabajo que obtuve y siempre hubo compañerismo y apoyo mutuo, ademas del respeto."

good,"Nike is my first job and I couldn't have had a better one! A typical day at work starts off with a game to get us all motivated before we open the store and work with customers to ensure they get what they are after. It also consists of getting new styles out, making sure units are full, standards are completed to a good standard, customers are satisfied and everyone is feeling content. "
good,"Work there it is great. Great management, great people. it was well worth it. great benefit, and what a learning experience, it is great. and a lot of cool things happen there."
good,I loved working at Nike when I was there. I wish they had been more flexible with hours and understanding about being in school. The discounts are great that you receive while you work there.
good,Working at Nike was fantastic. The management at Nike is always pumping up associates to do their jobs right and have fun while doing it. The associates working at Nike also play a big role in working at the company and having fun as a team. I would recommend working at Nike to most people.
good,I really enjoyed the chance to grow and take in a lot of knowledge from such a great company. The company gave you a chance to look at different options through out the company to see what may best fit your need to excel at the highest level.
good,"dynamic environment with flexibility and an open culture. positive attitude and a just do it mentality. Work hard, play hard."
good,I enjoyed working for Nike as they recommended all employees to work as team players and support each other. Hours was flexible and workable around school hours.
good,"Great culture, good people for the most part, although there are often issues with management having inappropriate relationships with part-time employees/athletes as well as managers buying shoes in bulk to resell them, but preaching for employees to do otherwise."
good,"fun workplace, fun co workers, fun managers. nice benefits of working there and good balancing of the hours. really nice place to work at, good exprience."

good,We enjoy selling our latest edition shoes wen i was working at nike zone many people are shoe lovers.... the most enjoyable part is when you see ur customer satisfied with the product that u sell to them.
good,"A typical day at work includes focusing on customer service then cleaning up after customers."
good,A fantastic experience that I will take with me where ever direction I decide to go in my career. Very lively environment with fantastic benefits and I learnt a lot from the people around me.
good,"The work environment is great, the managers provide a positive environment. The athlete's all have the same mindset to get the win and celebrate the victory, whether that means to help the consumers with whatever they came into the store for, or whether we could help them with a .com sale."
good,No other company gives the lifestyle and status like Nike Inc. Working with and meeting like minded athletes and individuals who strive accomplish greatness. There was never a dull day at Nike. Everyday was a new adventure with amazing people!
good,Very fun doing acting and being able to be apart of a big national commerical is something ill never forget. It was definitely the most fun job ive ever done.
good,"Ideale Work-life balance, sehr gute Kollegen, Weiterbildungsmoeglichkeiten etc. "
good,It's a fun and upbeat place to work but if there is a bad leadership team it is quite a stressing and not enjoyable place to work. I would still suggest working here if you love the brand but definitely try to have a clear head
good,really great environment; represents what the company values and stands for. Overall great hours and great management team. Great uniforms and very youthful management team.
good,This internship allowed me to work from home off of the documents that were shared with me. I was required to call and email coaches across the country to ask them to inform their players about the camps in their area. The director who was my mentor during this internship was very helpful and specific about what needed to be done and by when. The flexible house allowed me to work when it was most convenient for me.
good,"El salario es muy bajo lo cual no me agrado, pero de ahi en mas es bueno"
good,"worked here back in my early 20's, was such a fun place to work. Management was great, you had to work but you were praised for hard work."
good,"Nike was the best job i ever had. It didn't feel like work. It was very up beat and fast pace. Time use to fly by, the staff were amazing and they even gave us free merchandise."
good,Being the reason why the store looks the way it does. I am a merchandiser and knowing that people like outfits that i put together are a plus. The hardest part of my job was having to sacrifice coaching to move up into a manager position.
good,"Great work life balance and exceptional org culture."
good,"Excellent job for beginners, a fun work environment You get one full hour for lunch and two fifteen minute breaks. You had flexible work hours..Plenty of over time if wanted."
good,"This was my first job and I loved it at first. When the new owner came they wanted us to work 7 days a week. But the thing is 12 hours a day, and they hurted my life."
good,"I used to think I hated retail but after working at Nike, I realized how much my mindset changed. I work part-time and I simply love it. The brand has such rich history and you begin to feel like you are apart of a family. I actually enjoy going to work."
good,"We respond to all calls from vehicle jumps to responding to medical emergency within the campus. We monitoring our alarm systems and fire system 24 hours a day. Writing investigating and incident reports daily, from over the phone interviews to on the field interview. What I love about the job is that over the years I am able to use my commutation skills to enforce Nike policy and procedures. Scenarios change daily on the job so you have to be able to adjust."
good,"Typical day at work was generally 10 hours long with an hour long break and opportunity to participate in fitness or morale based activity that was heavily sports-oriented.  I learned a tremendous amount about Nike corporate culture and how to navigate in a multi-discipline influenced environment that required approval from many different stakeholders at once.  Management was supportive for the most part, but the structure made it difficult to move up in some cases and extremely easy in others.  It's a very ""right place at the right time"" type of promotion situation meaning if you impress the right people at the right time, trying or not, you can move up easily and quickly, but that's not always based on how hard you try to impress.  Morale of the story is to just do your work as best as you can and don't become overly focused on impressing for advancement."
good,"Working for them was the most unique experience that I have ever had.  I learned about how sports products were designed, manufactured, promoted, and sold.  I learned about who the athletes were that used the products, both when on their job and off of their job.  I saw and even said hello to professional athletes on almost a daily basis.  I was sent to sports events all across the country and given access to meet the teams at those events.  I only left there because I was given the opportunity to own a sports store independent from the company."
good,I enjoyed working at Nike because of the fast paced environment and positive work place. I typical day included assisting customers with their decisions and questions. I also worked the register which was really fun and I learned a lot.
good,"Working at Nike is truly a great experience for anyone who has been apart of a sports team. I say this because anyone who has played a sport has more than likely used at least one Nike product. At Nike they encourage you to use this unique experience and provide your own expertise to it making it a very diverse workplace. I've worked with college level athletes of all sports, and seen many notable figures in the sports world come into the store."
good,"great place to work. flexible hours. pay aligns with work you're expected of. night shifts, especially on weekends can be overwhelming, especially when you're closing every weekend. FREE GEAR and GREAT EMPLOYEE DISCOUNT"
good,"Uma das melhores empresas em que trabalhei, esta é uma empresa dinâmica, que me ofereceu experiência em novas áreas."
good,"Working for NIKE on the daily consisted of greeting guests, suggesting products, inventory, organizing products, answering phone calls. I learned how to organize and work effectively for long periods of time while remaining calm and focused. The management was very understanding and encouraging. The hardest part of that job was dealing with difficult guests and the most enjoyable part of the job was the comradery of the staff and the fast passed environment."
good,"I was made to feel a part of the team from my first day on, and we all supported each other while focused on high-productivity and high-quality.  Great environment and work-life balance."
good,Productively work place and environment job is very easy work at a fast pace everything is very well organized. Work as a team to get product where it needs to be.
good,Nike is an inspiring company that champions product and innovation. The world's greatest athletes are at the heart of the inspiration that drives everyone's daily activities.  They and everyone else around you make you want to be better.  It is a highly competitive environment but one where the rewards in terms of seeing your work on the biggest stages are endless.
good,"i really enjoyed working here it made me better as a person as well as an employee."

good,"Local bom para trabalhar, com uma boa instrução, com treinamentos e disciplina para incentivar os funcionários. Tinham uma ótima técnica de pontos por cada qualificação que os clientes davam para os funcionarios."
good,Typical day of work consists of working with shipping and recieving on what new shoes we have recieved and then planning the positions on the shelves they will go in. i also size and straighten the shelves. i customer service by helping people find the correct shoe for there specific needs. i also cash out customers using a cash register and a hand held mobile card machine.
good,Grazie al lavoro che ho ottenuto in Nike ho avuto la possibilità di esprimermi come team member dello store in cui lavoravo e come atleta. é un luogo lavorativo stimolante che ti invita a dare sempre il massimo.
good,Thoroughly enjoyable experience. Those within the office were very welcoming and professional. The offices are incredible and help in further motivating each individual to do their best. If you work hard the company will certainly look after you.
good,Nike was a fun place to work and the atmosphere was amazing but I would say its more of a job for a high-schooler who doesn't need many hours.
good,"A typical day at work was opening duties, keeping my area clean and working with customers to provide them the Nike experience.

Nike stores are more like museums that anything, anyone who dares to step foot in such a bright environment would enter a classroom. Workers, including myself, are filled with knowledge and current events that help welcome each consumer and keep them coming back. Along with customer service, I am in charge of every service the Nike store offers. Services included Panting Hemming, Bra Fitting, Fitness Concierge, Nike Training Club, and Women's Brand Educator. My co-workers are motivational humans, ranging from professional college athletes to personal trainers who all have one goal: to motivate.

good,I am a Nike Brand fanatic. I am passionate about Nike's product which makes my job easy because I believe in what I am selling and I am very knowledgeable about what I am selling. Being able to work in basketball shorts and sneakers is a definite plus. Management is not the strongest nor most consistent but there is still a sense of rapport amongst the staff. Dealing with theft really irks me but there are few greater rewards than a truly satisfied customer. Especially one leaving the store with something they might not even have known existed!
good,"Nike was a great place to work,I loved it. I unloaded and loaded trucks and moved pallets in the distribution centers. Learned alot from my boss and co-workers. Only thing was that I was laid off durring large scale lay off and I don' t think they understood how much that effected my family."

The hardest part of the job was explaing to the customers why our prices were so high. Nike is made with the best material so it is more than other sport clothing. My co-workers, for the most part, were young energetic students like myself so working with them was enjoyable. The most enjoyable part of the job was recieving our staff dress and shoes to wear.

good,Coming to work everyday was an adventure. I especially enjoyed every month having to change the theme of the stores environment depending on the season. There was never a dull moment and I like always having something to do. The people I worked with were such a joy it was hard to acknowledge that I haven't known them my whole life. The managers created a warm atmosphere but were fair and impartial when it came to rewards and punishments. The hardest part of the job was having to tell them that I would be looking for another job since their was no room for advancement in my current position.
good,Great company to work for. Flexible hours and room for advancement.
good,I learned to become a better manager. Typical day of work was always a challenge and thats what i loved the most. Hardest part was trying to get team members to be persistent.

The 30 years sport franchise built a long strory for their company culture, and every staff here can tell you a story relate to its footwear history. The job in NIKE I worked was very complicated, I was hired as Design Consultant in NIKEiD team. However, my background was related to sport marketing and the public relations, the manager changed my main job a little bit which related to retail marketing. I made NIKEiD Beijing Studio promotion plans and collected the customers' stories dairly, and report those to the director of NIKEiD Retail-Own Department. The co-workers here were very helpful and friendly, I also made a lots friends. The benefit of NIKE was awosome, you can take any brand new products with 40% discounts and you were always invited to talk with the big boss in your department. Communicate easily with the management level staff was very helpful for your promotion."

good,"Nike has a beautiful campus that cuts off from the world and makes the workplace feel peaceful beautiful. It was unlike any job experience that I had ever encountered before. The people there work hard, but play hard too and the company values their employees and rewards them for their hard work. I enjoyed being able to wear Nike attire and footwear everyday instead of the corporate suiting or at times uncomfortable office attire. The work life balance is of this, Family first, work second. (within reason and not to be taken advantage of as with any company). Nike runs their company as all companies should, putting the athletes, consumers, and employees first and it shows in their workers longevity's with the companies and the upbeat attitudes around campus. Every moment for me on campus was a proud one. I instantly made friends and was welcomed and treated as a member of the Nike family from day one even though I was only a contract employee and my time would at some point end. It's no wonder it is the largest sports brand in the world. They ""just do it"" right."

good,"Nike for an experience for me. I learnt about different athletics and their clothing , and how Nike got started. Some of clothes and shoes they sold were from Jordon. We had meetings to learn about different things Nike sold and how to.process them in . So we can take them to the floor."
good,I worked as a seasonal athlete and i would have to say this was the easiest job ive worked but i recommend getting good nike shoes to wear since you're going to be standing most of your shift. Everybody around me were very helpful and they really care about numbers and making sure that you're doing your best to help customers and getting them to sign up for a nike membership(free). Since i was seasonal i only worked in Apparel and one thing is it always gets messy especially if you have a lot of customers coming in. Since i could work anytime my schedule was different i could be working 3pm-11pm today and tomorrow id be working 5am-2pm so i would say work-life balance was okay for me since i don't have much going in my life.
good,"Everyday I walk into my job it’s always a happy mood with every employee. Most of my managers are easy to talk to and help with anything I need. "
good,Everything was good at Nike i just wish that i was full time cause the temps wasn't guaranteed their hours and it seem like we had to fight to get hours.

They are always on employers not for the fun of it but to show us the steps to being successful and are disciplined. There is not hard part of the job. It's a very laid back company to work for. The only thing that is challenging would be inventory. I love everything about Nike !! It's where I have always wanted to work since I was in middle school."

good,"Teamwork was the number  one lesson i learned working here, they were strict on no cellphones, which i liked. They were strict on sexual harassment as well. Everyone came in and just did their job. The hardest part of the job had to be around the holidays because everyone would be making orders and its just box after box, but we're all in it together so we'd give each other high fives and tell each other to keep it up."

good,"Es muy padre el ambiente y se viven experiencias buenas al conocer la empresa, la prestaciones son buenas lo único malo es que no te contrata la empresa directamente hasta después de cierto tiempo hay veces que tarda mucho tiempo y eso no es muy bueno por que no tienes al 100 % las prestaciones"
good,"Nike Boston does a great job at creating a team environment. It was a fast paced environment, with a lot of customer interactions. The culture of Nike Boston is great, with great people to work with."
good,While working at Nike I learned a lot about the company. During training they teach you about product they teach you about how Nike was started they teach you everything and anything about the company that will help you be a great sales associate
good,Process and inbox stuff so we can deliver them to the complaint store! Really easy but super  repetitive . Usually for younger people. Very nice place other than that
good,"Buen ambiente de trabajo , horarios accesibles, prestaciones y descuentos."
good,every day was exciting. we got to see all the Nike products. we were in a lovely environment the people were nice. the bosses were too. we had to move all the plant you were never in the same place and that gave you more to do.
good,the atmosphere when I clock-in instantly put me into a good mood. Coworkers and managers were easy to get along with. Training was on the job but easy to catch on to.
good,Nike was a relaxed place to work. There was plenty of opportunity to advance if you were qualified and performed your job well. Nike salaries for Maintenance Techs was below industry average. Management was attempting to rectify that situation when I left.
good,"Nike was my favorite job, there is always something to learn and the consumers were fun. I always had fun going into work and I enjoyed the people I worked with. I miss it."
good,"- smart managers that give great advice"
good,"J'ai beaucoup aimé les 2 mois passé chez NIKE FACTORY, les collègues sont agréable ainsi que les hommes dans la réserve,"
good,It was my pleasure to be apart of such a great company and surrounded my employees with great personality and attitudes for the work environment ; everyone seem to got along just fine
good,"good place to work, but unfortunately contract jobs are volatile as whole projects could end without notice."
good,A nice work environment with great opportunities. I got chances to grow as a leader at Nike and I think it has definitely inspired my role as a floor leader at Target.
good,"Within Nike, there are so many opportunities for advancements and opportunities to explore a different field. The competition is high but the atmosphere is excellent"
good,"-Nike VN is one of the best of work environment, where the work and life balance, employees have a scense of commitment, enjoy learning new things and it's the dedication of the employees at all levels that makes the business goal always successful"
good,"For me this was just a job for the summer, Nike atmosphere is great you can just feel everyone's enthusiasm and passion for the company. Daily tasks were pretty simple like putting away clothes and restocking as well as having product knowledge."
good,Nike hires many great people and I was able to create many meaningful relationships with my coworkers. Nike makes sure to recognize hard work and encourages team bonding.
good,"For me this was just a job for the summer, nike atmosphere is great you can just feel everyones enthusiasm and passion for the company. Daily tasks were pretty simple like putting away clothes and restocking as well as having product knowledge."
good,"I honestly like everything about NIKE , just the pay is too low . Wouldnt recommend it if you dont live 10 min from it . Other than that commute is horrible !"
good,"A typical day at Nike is easy and if you're not socially awkward, very fun. The only thing I really learned was processing new items by making sure they're priced properly, hung and ready to hit the floor. Other than that, it's the same as any clothing retail store. The managers there are great! Even though you have the ones who take their job a tad bit too serious, they all mean well and only want the store and their employees to do great. There really isn't anything hard about the job, they train you for each department. But they are all fairly easy to run. And even if you have any questions, the managers are always willing to help. The most enjoyable part of my job probably was working with my coworkers and having a small contest on who can sign up the most customers for that hour, or working at the register."
good,"Working at Nike was a great experience. 8h a day, dealing with people all day long, learning about shoes and their technology was satisfying. Quiet times were the hardest part of my shifts."
good,It was a productive experience in which I have learnt a lot and got a variety of benefits my workplace in addition to the advantages in my private life. It was a fun workplace with extraordinary management.
good,"Daily Sales goal meetings with manager before shift begins"
good,Just have to do what your supposed to be doing at the time and be on time for work everyday and volunteer when needed to and make good connections with everyone there
good,"Loved talking about sports, the brand and culture. I wished for more opportunities for advancement but management was happy not to grow more than they already have. Again, great place to work."
good,Also Nike have give aways for their employees as well as discounts. Bonuses and other incentives are giving when you are able to keep production. I really loved working for them and will honestly recommend them to anyone that wants a job and want to move up in a company that is ready to help you go further in your career choices. They also help with college if you are serious about furthering your education. There is nothing that I can say other than working for them was a wonderful and outstanding opportunity. Their logo just do it is also something about them that I love. I hope this will help anyone that is interested in employment with them.
good,"Teamwork is a culture, a nice environment, and good management team. Retail is not offered a balance between life/work but still, I recommend it to work"
good,Loved working at Nike!  My Management team was amazing.  The discounts were great.  Very positive work environment.  I did not like the schedule.  I worked all kinds of crazy shifts.

good,"love the environment at the store, met amazing people along the way, and as you move up there are many community opportunities you can get involved in"
good,Working in Shipping and receiving at Nike and as a sales associate was enjoyable. The job was not too difficult and the employee discount was one of the best benefits that Nike had to offer for their part-time employees.
good,I loved it just wanted more hours and they always sent people home it wasn’t enough work so people had to go home often and they kept the same people most of the time
good,I have learned that if you do not listen to your surroundings and incorporate the thoughts ideas and feelings of coworkers then team success will be stagnant.
good,"Great company to work for and adheres closely to company culture and mission statement. "
good,I would definitely work there again if I were in search of a warehouse job. The environment is very familiar and feels like a fun community. I would do it all over again.
good,"empresa solida e de muita qualidade, tinha flexibilidade para estudar , folgas negociadas ."
good,"Parte mais agradável de trabalhar quando se estar"
good,"Me gustaba mucho trabajar ahí por el ambiente que se genera, por supuesto que todo depende del liderazgo del Gerente de Tienda."
good,"During my time working with Nike as an order picker, working the night shift was very fun because of the people and the energy that everyone bring with them. Everyone works very safe and things are very productive."
good,"Working at Nike has been an amazing opportunity just by seeing customers happy when they leave out the doors of nike with the correct gears. Inviting the customers in by signing the customers up with an App called ""Nike Plus"" makes it more exciting only because their being more involved with what nike has to offer."
good,made alot of friends and learned alot of communication skills that i was able to use in future endeavors in life.  gained alot of team and family oriented work values as well
good,NIKE provides an environment conducive to applying ourself and growing in your talents. I found leadership to be fully engaged in helping each team member find the best in themselves.
good,"Really nice people from management to regulars"
good,"The best job I had easily. A typical day in my role is stepping into the office and check my email within 1st hour. Ensure daily schedule for the day is uploaded and that daily schedule for at least 1 week in advance is done. 2 to 4 hours spent being Manager on Duty for sales floor. Setup schedule for new hire training if applicable or setup interviews and who is conducting them. Several other tasks to be completed as they appear sporadically (supply order, morning meetings, 1 on 1 follow ups, etc.) Learned every aspect of retail management, my experience allows me to be able to step into any retail management  role with full confidence. Management is trained to identify talent at every level and be a mentor to push team members to higher position. Very inclusive work culture that allows people to express themselves. The hardest part of the job was to be able to manage the high volume of staff and volume of consumers while keeping a high level customer experience at all times. The most enjoyable part of the job is seeing the people of around the world and variety of interests with the love for the brand."
good,Muy agradecida con toda la formación y ambiente laboral recibido. Un gran equipo.
good,"Pick pack and ship product in a timely manner"
good,"The job I have at Nike is amazing.  I come to work and everyone lives the brand.  I've worked for fortune 100 companies before, but never have I had the ""live the brand"" as I do here.  Management treats people with respect."
good,"showing up to work at nike didn't feel like work honestly , you had your serious moments because at the end of the day you wanted to reach quota but nike basically sales itself and all you have to do is put the icing on the cake. very fun oriented place to work and the staff makes your job that much easier"
good,Great work environment. Management was awesome. Learned how to communicate with customers on a daily basis. The culture of excellence was displayed daily at the store .
good,Nike was such a fun company to work for.   I regret that I don’t work for them anymore.  The only downside was occasionally a customer would blow up on you like it was your fault that you didn’t have their shoe size or whatever.  But overall a great company and the discounts were awesome!
good,"Being a college student, this was a great place to work while still pursuing school. Great environment and culture. Always looked forward to coming into work and having the swoosh on my chest"
good,"I really enjoy working there and my co-works are very helpful. My manager really try to help with any issues I may have."
good,"At Nike there is a culture you can notice from one day of working there. The company is full of hard-working, driven individuals that approach their jobs with the work ethic of a professional athlete. There are multiple gym facilities and fields on campus and employees are encouraged to take time out of their workdays to use the facilities and get active."
good,I was one of the first to be hired at Nike Factory Store i had so much fun and love meeting new people my experience has made me confident and valued alot more things in life
good,"Empresa com ambiente agradável. Possui segurança, Cozinha e área de descanso aos funcionários."
good,"The manager was a hard worker so that was understandable, But the supervisors where really rude and annoying for no reason the picky type of people, and everything had to go their way."
good,"LOVE my job there. Don't expect to advance unless others leave but DO expect to have fun, work hard and become a family. No benefits to anyone under full time but they ARE really flexible and understanding. One of the greatest jobs i have ever had."
good,"good hours, great culture, fun and exciting, low stress except for holidays and big shopping weekends. flexible hours, free clothing and shoes, and family discounts."
good,"For a typical day at Nike, it is a blast. Managers are really nice and always willing to extend a helping hand if needed. I learned a lot about perfecting exceptional customer service, nike product, how to be less anxious when approaching people, and how to be my best self. Around the workplace people are always smiling, interacting and giving advice to one another; there is a perfect balance of work and having fun. Although I usually feel like an outsider most of the time, I cannot deny that Nike is where I feel like my most chatty self. The hardest part of the job is when you first start. Learning to use to checkout registers and the mobiles is where I struggled most. Aside from that, there is usually a not so nice customer here and there (but that's everywhere you go really). The most enjoyable part of the job is entering into work in such a positive atmosphere. Even if I'm feeling a little upset or under the weather, I always leave a little more happier than I did when I came in."
good,"Fun, fast paced, great coworkers, amazing discounts, good scheduling and hours, sufficient training, room to gain leadership experience, nice breaks, lovely location"

good,"Working at Nike took a lot of skills that I had to learn over the course of working for the company. One of the biggest parts of the job was knowing everything you could about products, how they are used, and who to recommend the products to. The staff as a whole was a really great team to work for. The managers were also easy to talk to if a problem came up, and they were very flexible with everyone's schedule knowing that a lot of us were/are in college. I really enjoyed working for the company, being able to help a customer find exactly what they need and knowing that all of the product knowledge that I have about Nike I can pass on to the customer so they know all about a product and how it will help them."
good,"amazing experience glad to have met all the athletes during my stay, the consumers are also great. So many trials and activities for consumers to have the ultimate Nike + experience"

good,This company is a growing blossom. The staff is profession and helpful. Also there're by they business.They take care of there workers and will do whatever it take to secure there workers.
good,"The hardest and the most interesting thing starts from the beginning when you have to learn all the brands and different products that you have in the store. Learning all the sections and each and every item on it. After little time I managed to learn our products and easily to explain to the customers. One more interesting experience was to work in multicultural environment.My daily routine at work was preparing items before opening, refilling, merchandising. When the store opens it door you have to be sure to acknowledge all the customers and help in their needs."
good,"Incredible resources, competitive culture and plenty of good folks trying to do good work. The only downside is that its a massive global organization."
good,"In one word, fantastic place to and client to work for. Very nice campus, relaxed work culture, no stress at all unless you want to take some lol..except the It rains all the time."

good,Me fue muy fácil a adaptarme muy bien al.trabajo ya q.ubo muy buen compañerismo y dinámica los.tratos iban muy bie.
good,The job is awesome. We get discounts after our 90 days are up. It's fun when we don't have a lot of work. But we be very busy and we know when the shoes come out . Nike is awesome job but the only thing they need to do is up the pay. But it's a good job and great benefits.

good,"Great environment and culture, Nike perks, best sports brand in the world.Food is expensive and mediocre, location is bad unless you like the suburbs, and deep reporting structure and matrixed organization can't get out of it's own way sometimes."
good,Working at NIke has you learn all aspects of the store even at the lowest position so you can always know what is going on. The store is full of great workers and consumers that create an atmosphere that is always upbeat and ready to work.

good,"Nike was definitely a great place to work. A fun and safe environment to work in. The staff is excellent. The locations are great, convenient areas, surrounded by many other attractions. Overall great place!"
good,"I love working at Nike. The culture there is team oriented and for the most part work colleagues are nice. Employees get s 30% discount that can also be used in conjunction with sales. You get a free pair of Nikes, two pairs of shorts and two t shirts for staff dress. Lunch is one hour long for those working a full shift. The management makes an effort to acknowledge people who stand out and are putting in a good effort. There is no pressure to sell the product because Nike sells itself. As a sale associate, you are there to help the customer find the perfect Nike product and give them a fantastic experience. The hardest part of the job is working on days there is a big sale. It gets very busy and customers can sometimes be very demanding and messy. The most enjoyable part of the job is the camaraderie among the staff."
good,"A typical day at work you would provide customer service,"
good,I enjoyed my experiences here very much.  The Nike culture is one of enthusiasm and encouragement.  I loved my colleagues and worked in a very positive atmosphere.
good,"a normal day of work is pretty easy. my responsibilities and duties included, picking order tickets and then process and pack them out to the buyer. simple work"
good,Nike is a great workplace if you're quick on your feet and and love their products. Employees get great discounts in store and online. The management is very helpful and understanding.
good,"From delivery at 8.00am to shutdown at 9pm on a weekday, there was always something to be done, to be cleaned, to be organised or binned. Shop floor would fill up quick on weekends and staff would have to be alert at all times and on the ball. Thefts would occur due to the sheer number of people of lack of staff. management was friendly and caring, focusing on how employees can develop themselves in the work life, and personal life."
good,"I don't want to do this but Nike is a great place to work, not the greatest hours, but simple tasks and customer engagement is always simple and enjoyable."
good,"working at Nike can be fun, specially when you have a good team and you management helps you succeed. it can be hard to move up but the opportunities are out there you just have to look for them. the hardest part is just dealing with difficult customers specially during the holidays when the store gets crazy but overall, Nike is a great company to work for."
good,"Uma experiência inesquecível , ótima gestão, bons treinamentos , apoio e incentivo nunca faltaram!"
good,"A typical day working a The Nike Factory was a busy day in day out, you have to be very productive and fast pace as well as goal orientated working here, also being able to work well with others. Moreover, I have learned so much working here, when I first started working here I know absolutely nothing about retail but I caught on pretty fast learning how to work the cash register as well as the mobile register, the learning how to work the sale floor such as providing customer service and making share the sales floor is clean as well as the locker room/fitting room. Now, working overnight wasn't much of a difference from working day shift except for the lack of customer to services, but it does include processing apparel and footwear and getting the sale floor ready for them next day. management wasn't so bad could have been a lot more organized but they were pretty much hands on at times. the culture of the store was very diverse and laid back very active and sports related. the hardest part of my job would probably be the fact of pleasing customer needs and want as well as the manager. lastly, what made my job so fun would definitely be my co-workers and just the Nike team, in general, they make you feel like your apart of this family that's away from your own family regardless if you go through disagree or you all get along, your still apart of the company the strive toward innovating people's lives by getting up and being active throughout their everyday lives."
good,"At first, i was on the sales floor. I worked mostly on the sportswear section with helping customers figure out what shoes to get. Thats pretty much my basic duty, help out customers, tell them about the products, learn about the products and just greet them as they came in.It was  a very relaxed atmosphere. They were kind of strict about how you have  to be standing the whole time, you couldn't really go on your phone or anything and they gave you 15 minutes break for every 5 hours shift, so that was good.There were different levels of managers, but there was always one manger on each floor, so you always had a floor supervisor in case you have a question or want to take a break or something."
good,"Working at Nike was great. They would give u the opportunity to work in other areas which allowed u to do something new and different such as boxing different balls, folding and tagging clothes, storing and picking different shapes and sizes of boxes."

good,A typical work day for me includes hands on interactions with customers to ensure that they are receiving the premium service and finding everything that they came to the store for. This has enabled to me to learn excellent people skills and the ability to work with customers in order to work out any conflicts that may have arisen.
good,"Una gran experiencia, grandes prestaciones, y buen ambiente"
good,"Empresa muito organizada, que cuida de seus funcionários, muito focada em resultados, sem exploração, enfim, uma família."

good,"A typical day at work would consist of taking in the truck, keeping the stock room organized and making sure the daily tasks are preformed correctly and efficiency. I've learned how to be a leader, how to manage my time wisely, and how to be a team player from working at Nike. The management was mediocre as there wasn't as much communication as there should be to make sure everyone was doing their jobs correctly. The culture at Nike was great. I love coming into work because I have met so many great people and have made some of my closest friends there. The hardest part of my job is making base pay and having to be responsible for a lot of work. The most enjoyable part of my job is working with people that I have great  relationships with and working for a top tier brand."
good,"cutting edge company unlike any other. Incredible culture daily, makes you excited to be there. Work/life balance was the only con, there's a lot of long hours and late nights. You'll work every weekend"
good,its a great company to grow wit. i learned so much from it being my first job. only thing bad i can say is the management wasnt how expected for such a large company.

Management here was fair, though some managers showed a little favoritism, things were usually balanced. My co-workers is what made the job really fun. Everyone had the same interests and got along so well, most of my friends now are from work mainly, it was an inviting atmosphere. One of the harder parts of the job was when you stayed in a department long enough, you tend to lose skill and general know how in others. Sometimes I would get moved to the floor for a day or a week, it just varied and it was never constant, so I had to stay on top of product knowledge myself out of the work place to make sure I can do the best job possible. The most enjoyable part was that I got to work for Nike, such a well known and respected brand. I was privileged to be able to work and own many items such as apparel, footwear and gear.

good,"A typical work day would be coming into the store, and picking up a store refill checklist in order re-stock the floor. Than once product is stocked I would resume my job title as a footwear specialist into my department. In my department I would aid consumers with product knowledge implementing the best effort for the personal needs and health concern interest with the product. Management is based off a department manager in every section of the store. (Footwear) broke up between kids, woman, and mien's along with the same division in apparel and two managers for shipping and receiving. Co workers always provide a great environment because of the dress code, and atmosphere being so lax, and interest in Nike's leading technology is east to get captivated in. The hardest part of the job is the pay. It would be like for the job function and hours to receive a better compensation. The most enjoyable part of the job is the discounts of course within all Nike, Inc affiliates.

Some stores have a few people who feel entitled because they’ve been there longer than you, so they treat you differently but otherwise everyone is mostly nice. I didn’t focus on those who made me feel like an outsider bc there were a lot of team members who made you feel like you should be there."
good,Working for Nike was most definitely fun and challenging at the same time. New challenges every day and we made sure we did our best in order to solve them. A typical day at work for me would be making sure I keep the till area clean and welcoming. I learned how to deal with customers much better after my 3 months work with Nike. Management were very cool and I couldnt ask for any better. The hardest part of the job was standing for long hours and dealing with customers. Most enjoyable part of the job was the balance I had with banter and working hard.
good,Working with Nike is fun and comes with great discounts. I wouldn't recommend this job to someone if they aren't quick on there feet. I really enjoyed working with Nike and wish I could have continued working with them while in college.
good,You are surrounded by a highly respected and diverse team of creatives focused on producing unique content. Nike has done a good job of keeping the work place relaxed and fast-pace at the same time. I would love to transition from a freelance videographer/photographer to an on staff employee.

good,"Crescimento , oportunidade de aprendizado .dinamismo"
good,This was a great place to nail down important customer service skills as well as introduce great leadership opportunities. It was a face paced environment but it makes the job more rewarding and enjoyable.
good,Hours can be long on your feet but I definitely enjoy the workplace and employees. I learned a lot that can be applied to other retail stores. The workplace was fairly busy everyday especially the weekends. The hardest part of the job is opening the store you get there at 7AM and the store doesn't open until 10AM. The most enjoyable part is helping the customers.
good,Every morning we would come together as a team & talk about our sales through the week . We all would motivate each other to reach our sales goal . We would all come together and prep the store before we open and when we're busy there's always someone on stand by . I loved the energy .

good,Stay focused on the task at hand. Yeah it's a good thing for you to work on the shift that fits in your criteria. The opportunity to be a part of the family is doing well in your world. They're willing / determined to get you as much knowledge of any department that you are seeking to be a part of. Pick season is not the only way to get extra hours. Once you have learned ( Mastered) your department and get the hang of another department. You can work in both departments. When one is done with the work for that day
good,"deze job was in shiften."

good,"Nike is a pretty good place to work overall! Depending on the type of store you work at it's usually pretty chill, and it's pretty decent pay for retail work. Management (coaches) have been great at both stores I've worked at. They're usually pretty laid back and let you have fun at work, which is always a plus! It's not a difficult job by any means."
good,Excellent work environment. The management is amazing. It is a very supportive work place. Such a great atmosphere. I like how erybody works together to make it a better place to work.

good,"Simply the best company / employer I've worked for. "
good,"Overall this company is great , I learned the importance of customer care and team work. A typical day for me at Nike was, clock in have a team huddle do dome stretch exercise, then go to your station.  The atmosphere was family based everyone looked out for one another and held each other accountable for all actions that didn't follow the work guidelines. Our management team was fair and consistent and willing to work with you if your personal life happen will employed. the Hardest part of the job was working seven days straight with no off days. The most enjoyable part of the job was the Nike give away every six months."
good,"Working at Nike was an enjoyable experience because I was able to meet many great people and learn a lot of helpful skills.  A typical day at work consisted of; greeting customers and helping them find what they need, restocking merchandise, organizing clothing and shoes, cleaning the store and helping out in the back of the store.  The management team were all very kind, understanding and helpful people.  The workplace was a good environment with kind people, always organized and clean.  The hardest part of the job was cleaning the store on very busy days, so that the store always looked organized to the customers.

good,"A typical day at nike would be coming in everyday for team meets, being there on time and ready to start the exercise for the day with all other working recipients. I learned time- management , i learned the word TEAM' team is always the vital part of the company ,you can be a person with a billion dollar idea, but the factor that decides if its potential is going to be fully reached depends on the team. As far as nike management they are going to make sure you push for greatness.They have great leadership is in place, managers take time to get to know their employees and care. The workplace culture it is rapidly changing from the way we communicate and collaborate.This culture is centered on creativity and innovation to provide products that suit current consumer preferences. The hardest part of the job was trying to maintain the production.The Most enjoyable part of the job was the work over all having to make sure all of your  products where hang correctly and more.,"
good,"Working at NIKE, there was never a dull moment. The atmosphere is charged with this sports energy that turns even the most unenthusiastic sports person into a fan. It's all bout teamwork in everything you do."
good,Nike is a great place to work at and a great opportunity to be able to manage a team in this company.  We strive in having a great team work ethic and have the confidence to be able to communicate efficiently with each other through mentoring and development.  Management teams work the same way and have much more communication to be able to pass on the right work ethic to our employees.

good,"I spent many years in the Nike environment, growing with the company while advancing my career from an Individual Contributor to C-level Executive positions. My tenure afforded me multiple opportunities to work abroad, providing exposure and experience in multiple geographies, functions and categories. Nike is the world's most dynamic brand, and the culture remains true to the founder's mission to Make Athletes Better through Innovative Product and unparalleled consumer connectivity. I revere my time at Nike and the boundless opportunities to work with such an amazing group of talented colleagues, teams, managers, mentors and friends."
good,"i like working nike and its good place to work, the benifit is nice, the wokrers are great. They have good days off and they pay good, plus it not far from where i live."
good,The only downside to this job is if you have a hard time staying on your feet for long periods of time. I was just telling my girlfriend that when I worked there I was in the best shape of my life. I regularly walked 20 miles on my shifts that were 12 hours. So if your feet hurt you may not want to apply here just to be honest.  Every thing else was really great. Their breakroom spoiled me with the salad bar and hot bar and pizza bar. Very relaxed stress free place to work. All my bosses were cool. I was learning how to train other associates to do their jobs. I got a bit nervous having to train employees I never met. But this was helping instill a new confidence in me that would also give me a new assertiveness. I like being pushed by my boss Corey. He expected highly of his team and we gave it to him.  I also really enjoyed working in packing and shipping. I think I may try to re-apply there.
good,Everyone is very supportive and wants to help you succeed. It was a great experience and the work was interesting. They are flexible and accommodating.
good,It was a fun-filled place to work. I was happy to come to work. There was FIFA tournaments on the PS4 in the break room. We got awesome discount deals. It was filled with fun coworkers too.

The benefits are great, the pay is great, work was kind of stressful at times but you’ll make the best of it, it kind of comes with a job (stress).  Management was a plus for me. They help you grow with the company. Overall working at NIKE feels more like family it is a great company to work for."
good,"I have taken 6 months doing internship in Nike, in Event Market. My daily job is to plan proper outfits for various purpose to adapt different occasions and events. Also I have participated in Shanghai 2017 Marathon, and 2018 New products launch."

good,"Nike took a lot of time focusing on training. They literally focus on making an athlete, and making the employee know the brand. In the morning you would have a team meeting, where they will brief you about the daily goals, and they will keep you and your team updated throughout the day. I enjoyed my time at Nike!"
good,When working at Nike I thought I wasn’t gone like it then I start working everyday getting the feeling of it and fell in love with the job.I was a picker.Picking shoes off the shelves putting in boxes.The job was laid back and a good place to work. I tried to do as much overtime as i can their. I’m a hard worker so ima get the job done to move to the next level.

good,Te la pasabas muy bien ya que se convivía con todos en todo momento
good,"Uma empresa que oferece diversas oportunidades de crescimento, sabe preparar bem cada funcionário com uma gestão maravilhosa."
good,"The people at this store make it feel like home, and every morning we start our day off with our huddle. One of the best feelings is knowing you're a part of such an ambitious, motivational  and positive filled company. Most days go by pretty quickly. You've gotta love the brand to work here, everyone here is all about Nike. It's a super welcoming environment and I always loved hearing the feedback from consumers who loved their experiences at Nike."

good,"I work as a cashier , no complaints , a lot of customers ask for coupons which Nike doesn't have any.other than being a Nike Plus member which provides you with special coupons such as birthday,friends & family and returns on how you paid."
good,Nike is one of the best places I’ve ever worked. The team acts like a real family and everyone is looking out for each other. They have a great training program so you know all of the tech for each product before you even hit the sales floor. They’re really big on trying to promote within the company and will even set up a plan to help you become a better athlete. I had a Part-Time Over position which included paid vacation which is really nice.
good,Nike is great place to work. I really enjoyed my time working there. Sadly I had to leave because of a shift change. Overall its a safe and fun place to work.
good,Great workplace culture where everyone is interested in sports and love to help customers find the perfect item for their occasion. Amazing management who do their best to help with any accommodations that may be needed. Unrivaled employee discount that helps being a customer of the brand extremely easy.
good,"I love working at this job . I love my colleagues and the customers. This job focuses on selling the product and having good customer service, making sure you are bringing your a game ."
good,"It is an experience itself, enjoy. I believe everyone should go take the opportunity to work in retail especially a fast paced environment like Nike. Great teachers!"

good,"It was fun, I loved my schedule and my co workers. It was never a dull day and it was always work to be done. There was always plenty of people around and management ws the best.

good,Nike is a great place to work.  First class operation in the way that they treat their employees and more importantly their clients.  Great atmosphere and fun place to work.
good,"When I started, it was part time (15 hours +/-)  on top of my other job. After 6 months of working both jobs, I took a look at the bigger picture: I liked my other job, but I LOVE working at Nike. Along with that, Nike was offering more hours, better pay, better benefits, and a wonderful work atmosphere. There is a lot to learn at first, but once you get trained and comfortable with your job and duties it’s awesome. We work as a team, it wouldn’t work any other way! Everyone is so awesome and helpful to one another, including managers! Managers are beyond insightful and fair to everyone. They are not afraid to come help you, answer any question, talk to you privately (for ANY reason), lead you in the right direction, refer you to all of Nike’s wonderful recourses for employees, and just teach and spread the endless amount of knowledge there is about our company and products. I work for one of the most recognized, trusted, and quality companies on the world. I went from looking at it as my part time retail job to my future. While I may not be in a Nike retail store for the rest of my life, I will be seeking employment within’ corporate &/or internationally. I couldn’t be treated better if they tried. I love my job."
good,"I was an independent contractor who has worked on two marketing tours for NIKE; the last was from Atlanta-Miami; they gave me extra drive time and if tired was given any opportunity to stay in upscale hotel; they seemed extra attentive being a woman then male workers and managers. "
good,Nice employees and managers are nice. Its an easy job you get good bonuses. I was on a 8 hour contract and did 32 hours a week so shifts are very fair.
good,The workplace culture was awesome because we were taught to be team oriented which is something I really enjoyed to do with such a great staff. The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to work for such a major company.
good,The manager was very sweet &  generous . Some of the co workers where very messy but they do know how to work together. The lead was rude & Unprofessional. She would write you up only if she was upset with her boyfriend
good,Working at Nike as an amazing experience for me! Every part of my experience working there was so much fun and memorable. The culture and environment was completely different from anything I had ever experienced at work before. I grew great friendships and learned so much from working there and I will forever be grateful for the experience.
good,"Uma empresa com muitos processos de notas, ou seja, tinha muito trabalho a ser feito, desta forma pude aprender procedimentos, network etc. O gerente na época foi um profissional excelente que contribuiu muito para meu aprendizado como toda a equipe. No desempenho das atividades felizmente tinha ao meu redor profissionais generosos para ensinar, sempre com muita ética e respeito. A maior parte do tempo estava fora da minha zona de conforto o que foi bom para meu amadurecimento profissional, mas por outro lado tive que errar para fazer o certo, foi minha primeira experiência subpressão. Entretanto no geral amava a convivência, o estilo da empresa, a missão e meu trabalho."
good,A fantastic introduction into the sports world. An amazing company to for . A great overall experience that offered exceptional growth opportunities. My day often included opportunities to work with very talented people . Upper management understood what was needed to run stores smoothly.
good,"I was working for a year. The typical day in FCB was help the costumer to find the best thing. First of all, we have differents types of products and diferents qualities we need to explain to the costumers. Also i was working as a chasier and printing the names in the t-shirts."
good,NIKE is a great job for those with an enthusiasm who is always on their toes. It helps individuals develop communication skills as well as extensive knowledge and history that most people are unaware of.
good,"Really reliable coworkers and team players. Brand new store in Torrance. Always a joy to work for the brand. Everyone looked at as an equal, and all held accountable."
good,"It was an excellent environment to work in. Nike gave me the opportunity to build and excel on current expertise. "
good,"This store requires athletes to have patience and an understanding for multiple cultures as more than 50% of consumers are from other countries. There are set expectations that are needed to be met everyday, including marketing apps, communicating online sales, and give the consumer a full journey to meet their needs."
good,"The dynamic at the factory stores, at least at the one I worked at, was always very supportive and made retail the easiest its ever been for me. I really think it was the management dynamic that made it easy rather than anything else."
good,"Empresa com oportunidade de crescimento,estabilidade,equipe unida.A gerência sempre pronta para resolver os problemas da equipe."
good,I love working at Nike. The team atmosphere is great. Everyone is so friendly and always willing to help. Eight hour shifts at max. Love the fast pace and high energy. Strongly support equality and diversity. I would definitely recommend working for this company. It started out as just my weekend job and now I want to build a career with this company.
good,"Everyday is different here at Nike. My day would consist of a department huddle (plan for the day and prioritizing tasks), a managers and leads huddle (discuss who team captain is for each hour), check emails and action anything concerning me. "
good,"It's a very an egalitarian structure. "
good,This is my part time job love working at Nike ive been working there for 5 yrs we are like family . The best part of Nike is that if you cant work your shift maybe u can ask one of your co workers for them to take your shift as long as your shift is covered and it's approved  by management then it's ok . And of course the discount is awesome . Management is very understanding . And we like to help the Boys and Girls Club and Big Brothers and Big Sisters foundations.

good,a typical day at nike is like any other regular retail place. i learned alot about nike as a company how they make their products and what they use to make their product.
good,its was fun and enjoyable. ill recommend this place for anyperson looking for a job. I worked at nike back in my country Nigeria and it was worth getting the extra penny.
good,empresa conceituada no mercado comercial. profissionais qualificados para mercado
good,I loved working at Nike when I was in high school. It was definitely the best job I've had. The managers were great and really helped you succeed. It was such a fun environment and I love the company as a whole. I would definitely recommend.
good,Nike really helped me grow and sharpened my customer service skills. This was also my first retail job and I absolutely loved it. Great management too

good,The managers are great and there are many opportunities to move up in the company if you let then know that your goals consist of that. You also get to work for one of the best brands in the world.
good,Nike is a wonderful place to work and grow as an employee. The company well managed and always puts their employees first. Day to day can get boring at times but the everyone always has a great attitude and is always willing to help no matter what.
good,"This is a great place to work if you are a young vibrant creative person. I get to work on different stuff everyday, I love the variety. I like being part of the ""community"", my coworkers are like a little family. If you are looking for a great community to work in, this is the place."

good,"I love creating and combining art with fashion in graphics and campaign shootings. In this way, I did a series of illustration for Luca Finotti Studio’s Nike Lab project by Photoshop and for my personal collections."
good,"Nike is a great place to work at, they take you in and make you feel at home from day 1. For the most part if you're someone who loves sports and fashion Nike is a great choice for yourself, because thats all you'll be discussing day in and day out. Not only that,  but being apart of the culture of nike is the best part. Having the opportunity to speak about new shoes and the latest nike inventions is awesome! Management was extremely friendly, genuine, and cool at the location I was at."
good,Nike was my very first job and I felt like I had a second family the moment I was training.  This company values hard work but making sure it is fun while you do it.
good,I worked as a cashier and I loved it. I was able to dress super comfy for work and meet a lot of nice people. The holidays were crazy but that was expected in retail. I enjoyed my time working here only left because a schedule conflict and higher pay because I was only a part time cashier and no full time positions were available at the time. I would say the only downside was sometimes management has their favorites of would get more hours or more flexibility  for changing shifts.
good,"A good brand to work for, great in work benefits and a strong team ethic. Senior management are on the whole approachable and helpful. The only major difficulties i have found are based around people not procedures, too many opinions and too many cooks spoiling the broth, especially in areas involving visual presentation."
good,"Nike is a great company to work for.  The company treat everyone like family, offer plenty of work hours and advancement.  The most enjoyable part seeing the different innovation someone created.  The workplace is clean, fun, and full of energy."

good,"Great company to work for with a great work environment. I loved working for this company only left due to some personal things. I would love to get back in with Nike because I enjoyed my time and job there so much. Great benefits, great people, and great work environment."
good,"Muy buen trabajo, la gente empatiza y hace que sea mas dinamico. El sueldo es correcto y proporcional a las horas trabajadas."

good,"will allow you to grow as much as you are willing."
good,Hands down best job i have had. Great work environment. (Depending on management) always something new to do. Great benefits. Opportunities to volunteer in the community.
good,Worked at Nike for over 15 years and have to say it was best company in town. They treat employees like we were all family. Had access to employee discounts. Good benefits. Friendly people work there. CEO does not look down his nose at people.
good,"Nike is always innovating and has a very passionate staff. My favorite part about this company is the emphasis on training and product knowledge. They are very competitive when it comes to pay in the retail field and have great benefits. They have a great reputation, and with that comes increased expectations. If you are to advance, you have to keep improving on yourself at all times. There is no room for plateauing. As they say, there is no finish line."
good,"Empresa excelente q tive a honra de trabalhar,pois é um ambiente muito agradável e harmonioso,q recolhesse o funcionário e lê capacita para um futuro promissor."
good,"Empresa excelente, dinâmica."
good,This was my first job ever in the work force. They are the best company to work for in my opinion. They value you has an employee and as a person. Just don't be late and everything will be good. Its not a hard job either. One of the easiest jobs i have ever had.

good,One of the best places I've worked for. Always fun and always learning something new. Managers are nice and completely understanding of any inconvenience you may have on a day to day.
good,"A typical day at work was pretty much wonderful because from the time you clock into work you're surrounded by energy by your coworkers and management. Nike had a competitive culture, most likely because everyone in the store were all athletes so we all pushed each other to do better and honestly to me that's the most enjoyable part of the job because I myself love competition."
good,love the Nike life. Great hours great co workers excellent management! Best job the environment is amazing great teamwork and super modivational.
good,"A typical day here consisted of me greeting consumers and helping them find what they are looking for. I learned how to talk with people from all around the world which really helped me break out of my ""shy sell"". The management is very understanding and energetic. The hardest part of the job was watching out for people who wanted to steal. The most enjoyable part of the job was when I got to meet new people."
good,Spent most my working life at this company and can honestly say I have never ever felt more valued. Outstanding company to work for....
good,"I absolutely loved working at Nike. The atmosphere when you enter the store isn't like 'work', it's more like you are competing with a team. That was a huge aspect of working at Nike, it wasn't just a company and a store full of coworkers, it was a store full of teammates and family. It was okay to joke around and laugh and still easy to keep on task and fulfill all of your responsibilities. The one negative was there was alot of call offs and the people who would constantly call off never seemed to be held accountable."
good,"Loved every minute of it working with my co-athletes  ,when your surrounded by a team who all knows their task when on the clock it makes the whole shift go by much smoother without no complications or distress while at work . the only hardest part of the job was when our teammates would call out leaving our night crew 2 man short which sometimes added a extra 15-20mins each task due to the less amount of hands and legs we had. Other then that the managers were cool except for one he was very rude and non respectable to the athletes of Nike !"

I learned a good amount  of cooking and customer service, also kitchen skills. Hardest part of the job was closing because it was only two people doing 20 different  things at one time. The enjoyable part of the job was cooking and being able to talk to all the customers."
good,One of the best companies for which I have had the opportunity to work. I was fortunate to work on a very closely knit team all working hard for the same accomplishments and goals. Great work life balance; everyone works hard and works very collaboratively and well together. The management is great with communication and I also enjoyed the fact the TA management team is involved but lets people do their work and are not micro-managers. One area which could be improved upon is sharing candidates and giving them exposure to as many opportunities within the company. Some of the processes are not very efficient.
good,"Nike has been one of the best companies i've ever worked for. The management team were great at keeping work professional but having fun at the same time.  I really enjoyed everyone i've worked with from human resources on down.  Everyone maintained positive attitudes and displayed great teamwork throughout the store.  The hardest part of the job was that it was a retail job, so some holidays were missed at home, but coming to work was similar to being with family at work."
good,Working for Nike has to have been on my most enjoyable work experiences. It has allowed me to work in an environment I can easily relate to. Me being an athlete and surrounding myself with other athletes makes my job much easier to drive sales.

In our morning huddles we would talk about our sells from yesterday compared to the previous year and set a sales goal for the day, that should be last years goal. After huddle everyone goes to their floor and then doors are open to the consumers. At Nike I learned to be very interactive with the customers and try to learn things about them that will make the customer service go up. The management team was great to get along with, they were all so helpful and are very great leaders. I met some very nice co-workers and fact they were great too. The hardest part about this job was staying focus because there are many things going on at this place. The most enjoyable part about this job was being able to join clubs ran by Nike and be come a pacer coach for the public and actually get paid for it."

Nike Town London has costumers from all over the world, which allows the Athlete to get to know different cultures and get to know amazing people at the same time. Working for Nike can be challenging as daily targets need to be reached, however as you fall into the same work pattern day to day it can get boring at times.

good,"Nike cares about their people and really mean it when they say ""there is no ceiling"". I never thought I would become a manager within the company and they've helped me grow so much over the past 2 years. The co-workers are full of life and really make the job enjoyable!

good,"Nike has the best company that I have worked for for the last 4 years. the typical work day at Nike is to come in and began to be productive. From working with reconcilation or being a team lead, Nike is a easy yet complex job that you will enjoy. Management is on their job helping with our work, with the employees and show us guidance for our daily goals and yearly quota. The hardest part is dealing with employees that do not want to do any work. I enjoy our benefits that we recieve like giveaways, bonus checks, PTO, employee stock purchases."

The hardest part of the job is all the information needed to help the consumers find what they need based on what they're looking for and they specific type of footwear or apperal needed to fit their lifestyle. Once you learn everything thouh its extremely easy and fun.

good,I enjoyed doing the work my manager and supervisor was always sweet to me along with the other employees I always came to work on t ik me never was late
good,I have a good day at work and once I go in the building I blow up the balls and put it in the container. We have to each a certain volume for the day to complete our task. It is a very hard demanding type of job and it really brings out the best in you.

The management didn't always agree on the same things but were overall great people;le to work with. I learned how shoes were designed, organization, and how to divert tough situations. I mainly worked in the women's apparel department where I would help customers, promote the Nike app, help with the fitting rooms, and organize the product."
good,The managers at this Nike are all very kind. They assist the workers when they need help and ensure every worker is properly trained. Workers are protected well when it comes to rude customers and other uncomfortable experiences they may encounter.

good,"Es una empresa muy grande y sobre todo mucho respeto a su personal, excelente ambiente laboral."
good,I would assort boxes of shoes coming in. I worked on the stock team so I would work in the back of the store. We would open up the shipment of shoes that would come in the mornings usually. Then process them to be able to sell them at our store. If any team member needed a pair of shoes that a customer was looking for we would be the ones to get them. I learned how to manage my time because we had to process a certain amount of shoes within a certain time which was the hardest part about the job and the most enjoyable was just interacting with the people there.

good,They are nice workers they also have an reasonable pay rate for the work we do I would love to work for Nike again it's a laid back place with reasonable people

good,There was a lot learn from working at Nike. The diversity amongst different sections played a key role in everyday work. The networking with different managers helped elevated the different material handlers needs.
good,"I work for NIKE is because I love sports and the brand. The most important thing for a salesman to sell a product is that you actually have a understanding of all of the products, so that you can recommend the product to specific customers. I have been using NIKE products for 15 years from footwear or apparels, so I am really familiar about NIKE. I enjoy to work here because I love to talk to people who also love sports, just like me, I can make friends there, although it is fast paced, I enjoy it and want to fulfill my career here."

The management team was also great, friendly and understanding with everything. It was a very fast pace job that kept me on my toes, it was always something to do. The hardest part of the job i would say was learning to balance my time. I say balance your time because you would pretty much have to sell the shoe or clothing to the customer without taking up a lot of time due to other costumers waiting for your assistance."
good,"A typical day at work would include saying greeting everyone before clocking in, catching up on what has been going on. Management would be cool and humorous before assigning you your task for the day. Nike was really just an amazing family/business first oriented workplace."

good,Nike is a top company to work for even at one of the lower end jobs at the company. Working part time in retail was not as bad as other retailers make it out to be.
good,"They’re very strict on time and attendance. But overall a really fun store. An amazing team to be apart of.  So many events within the store and they choose who can be apart of what but you have to make sure you’re time and attendance is good. Same goes to wanting to grow within the company it’ll probably be the only reason they won’t allow you to do neither, it’s very easy to climb up. All you have to do is show interest the store even has mentors, they can guide you and give you pointers. For the time and attendance they give you multiple chances to fix it but after 3 Written strikes you’re on probation for about a year and after that it’s really hard to fix. Nike is all about innovative and equality. A truly amazing company."

During training, they also taught me how to distribute and organize the bins. Went over theft and what should we do as an employee and etc.The managers also do their part well too and always have a solution toward problems that us retail sellers can't solve at times."

good,Great Job! Great opportunities within the company to move up and work in a ton of different locations. Great connections throughout the teams you work with on a daily basis.
good,"I went from a temporary employee, driving a forklift, to a full-time senior lead, running a department, in less than 3 years. The company is what you make it. You have great benefits, a good work life balance, and room for advancement for those that are willing to do what it takes to get there. I'm currently applying for management jobs, and have been turned down a couple of times, but I won't be discouraged or stop until I get there. This is a great company to work for."

good,"I liked this job. The only thing was that the other temporary associates that worked there had a tendency to group up in clicks and hide from doing their jobs which it seemed like there was a lot of firings because of this, thus making it a high turnover rate. I used a scan gun to pick tickets and do restocking. I also used a computer to do packing. It was really an easy job."
good,"Uma empresa de grande porte oferece muitos benefícios e tem um ambiente de trabalho organizado, descontraído, qualidade para os clientes."
good,Everybody in my department is close and we branch out and connect with other people from other departments. Different type of vibe when managers are around. If the pay was better I'd stay.

The workplace culture was very chill and laid back. Every employee at Nike was friendly to me and very hard working. The hardest part of the job would have to be dealing with the difficult customers and to not be able to catch those who were stealing Nike products out the store. The most enjoyable part of the job would have to be when I see customers happy when they get what they are looking for and leave with a smile on their faces."

Everyone I worked with were decent people with their own set of goals and reasons for working there. I enjoyed most of the co-workers but as in most places you have those that would rather goof off or just simply not work. That made some days much longer then others as well as a bit stressful for those who did work. The hardest part of any job is connecting with the co-workers so that the effort is a team effort. In retail there are some who enjoy their work and some who don't which leads to a dysfunctional team and most times this is the case in retail. I so enjoyed learning the different shoes, apparel, and equipment. I enjoyed the team of co-workers I had the pleasure of working with and most of the management team.

I think of it as selling a minor version of a car when I explain to the customer the best features and technologies of the shoe. The hardest part of the job is detecting shoplifters. I always stay focused on each customer but sadly most of the shoplifting done is internally.  I thoroughly enjoy working with my co-workers everyday I work there. Since I've been working there I have gained so much useful knowledge to help sell and they continue to train me everyday.

good,This job taught me the meaning of hard work. The hot summer days spent on back of trucks taking out boxes and storing them for the sales associate was not easy at all. A day at Nike required both physical and mental strength because of the heat. The managers were great. They took care of us by providing plenty of water and frozen treats to keep cool and gave us breaks after a big truck was received. I learned to stock and organize at this job. The people I worked with were phenomenal.

During my time working for Nike I have learned the value and importance of serving each and every customer, different things that it takes to run a business, and leadership tools. Management and my co-workers are all fun and hardworking individuals dedicated to making sure our customers get everything they want and need. The hardest part of the job is always going to be balancing your time between a large amount of customers and having to watch out for those that are looking to steal, but we manage to do so and protect our product. While there are some hard parts to the job there are a lot more enjoyable parts. Such as "

good,"everyone respect each other, hard working environment.  The employees all worked as a team "
good,"Daily at the Nike Factory Store assisting customers is a number 1 priority. Keeping the store neat, clean and organized as the day passes by is key to store presentation and keeping it appealing to the customers eye. Sometimes the store is at it's highest volume and it's hard to keep up with or you have rude customers, ect, but overall it's an easy going job. I learned all the ins and outs of the retail life and business management along with Nike History and how it applies to the everyday life of a Nike Associate. Managers are awesome which is rare according to things I've heard from other people who work at other places. They do their best to work with you around school, another job, or other things. Their positive and hyped attitudes always give the day a good spin. Coworkers are easy to be friends with and fun to be around at the job and outside of the job, it's like having a second family. They are all easy going and super friendly. Overall we are a team and a family and work together to make the best of every day at work and get the job done. Hardest part of the job would be keeping up with product knowledge because Nike always has something new coming out and we like to help meet the customers needs as best as we can. The most enjoyable part is staff dress, you basically go to work in the most comfortable clothing ever! Along with the work environment, it's one of the best jobs anyone could have!"
good,"Best company, professional, balanced, driven."
good,"A place where employees stay in roll for a while, becoming a stronger team."
good,"I can recall an incident at work where I hyperventilated and my coworkers lended out a helping hand. Without panicking, they sought help from our supervisor, Nicole, and stood by my side until a nurse who worked at the company in case of emergency, came to solve my problem. Management provided quality help and were open and undestanding to each employee. If someone needed some time off for personal reasonings, coworkers would negotiate with one another and work in place of another, and the managers work some things out. Also, in the case that a worker did not have money for food or maybe they have forgotten their lunch box at home, one of the overall managers or a supervisor from one's department would lend out a few bucks for a bite to eat. What I learned most was time management. I also learned the importance of diversity. To me diversity is a mixture of different backgrounds, ethnicities and customs working together. There were not any hard parts to working for this company because I am a fast learner. I enjoyed meeting new people and building my experiences working in different departments at Nike."
good,A fun work environment and great advancement opportunities.

good,"A typical day at work for me is clocking into work and bringing ""NIKE to life."" Working daily with our consumer is something I love to do, and giving them the best product knowledge and NIKE experience they could remember. My co-workers and management are the best and we all have great relationships. Hardest part of my job is seeking on how I can better myself not only as an employee, but as a person as well saying that I'll be employed within NIKE for four years in September."
