rating,review
bad,"Closed our plant even though it was profiting 2 million dollars a month. This particular location had been on business for 150 "
bad,i never got the right training. people were lazy. i would not recommend to any one working at westrock. id rather work for government. this was by far the worst job experience i have ever done and i need to delete from my resume asap!
bad,You would only receive one week of training and then put to work. The trainers do you not help you they try to set you up for failure. If they do not like you you won’t have a job and they will tell you that
bad,"Great job but the management and employees make your life miserable if they don’t deem you one of them ,and hr ignores any complaints that are filed.."
bad,Terrible place to work no days off money great but no life.swing swift management didn't care.wasnt able to get a day off.they don't care what you are going through
bad,"I was a forklift operator, worked hard everyday. Was let go because I got hit by a car while on my lift and the company blamed me for it. West rock claims they have your back but they will throw you under the bus if you make a mistake. Don’t try to take a day off they hate it even if you need to go to the doctor or get in a wreck. If your human and make mistakes and your just trying to scratch out a living I’d look somewhere else. Or good luck I guess."
bad,"Westrock lake Mary Florida is the worst place I have worked for in years, the Management their do not help the drivers, they are only there to harass the drivers and look for any little thing to write you up or call you and harass you over the phone rushing you to get back that they have other deliveries for you but when you get they send you home because they dont want to pay overtime."
bad,If you want no work balance job this is the place for you. You get paid pretty good but work like a you know what. You will work at least six days a week if not seven. Management very poor. Talk to you any kind of way at work knowing you cant say anything out the way or its your job. They show favoritism. Make their own rules. Poor training then talk to you any kind of way when the machine stop. Its paper people. It can rip out at any time. No team morale. Hot   in the summer. Cold  in the winter. If you want to work like a you know what this is the place for you.
bad,Job assignments are given according to friendship. Company rules are broken to help certain people. Promises made during the interview are not kept once hired.
bad,Management totally sucks   Don’t care about you. Don’t know what they are doing   No body there cares about. Management is only worried about their self
bad,"Mandatory overtime, management was lacking, lots of meetings, trained to do everything so they could throw you around like a rag doll but didn't compensate the way they say they will when they hire you"
bad,Having worked for this company in a sales role in Pennsylvania and now Florida I can tell you this company does not offer any support to sales reps.  Especially if you do no have a college degree.
bad,Didn't even give me a chance..to work a full week before they said i wasn't good enough..HR is really bad there.I applied for one position and the moved me to another
bad,"Management is horrible, will make you work like a dog for your probation period, and tell you great job the whole time. Then when your probation time is almost up your fired for no reason except for the one they just make up out of thin air."
bad,It’s a horrible place to work wouldn’t recommend no one works there management is bad everything is bad pay is bad no bonuses no raises nothing would not work there
bad,"Only ethnic gets to advance to lead last 4 people to advance into leader ship or training were of ethnic groups even thought their is several whites with 3x the experience and seniority applying for position they were over looked, managements will say all is ok to your face, then turn on you"
bad,"Horrible management Period! Under paid! Work 12hrs a day Even on Saturday.  And if your of a different skin color,You can not advance. Good ole boy network."
bad,"It’s only about the numbers, people don’t not matter. Managers attitude bad don’t know anything about the business. More like slavery working for these people . No ones happy working there !!!"
bad,The absolute worst place I've ever work. They ask too much of some employees and not enough from others. Want you to do operator work and not get paid for it
bad,Trash place to work don’t go there unless u enjoy being a slave. U will never see your family and u will want to eventually quit like everyone else. They have u work saturdays while everyone else in management is out golfing and fishing
bad,"They don’t care about anything else but numbers ! Management is disrespectful, they mess with your pay , long hours , if you have a family, think twice ."
bad,I would not recommend this company to anyone. They do not explain the job requirements to anyone. They just throw you out there and tell at you if you cannot get it right.
bad,"Management doesn’t know what they’re doing. It’s very hard to stay focused when management has no clue how to run the place. Ridiculous to say the least. I wouldn’t recommend this place to anyone , ever!"
bad,"I'll keep it simple they micromanage, show favoritism, hold you back from advancing if you're a good worker and lie right to your face on a daily basis. If you want to raise a family and have a decent career, keep it moving and don't make the mistake of applying here. In the year I've been here, I've seen numerous people who have been with the company for years get fired for points one of whom was dealing with the loss of her husband. They even give you points for serious health reasons that may cause you having to be carried out by the ambulance."
bad,Management is terrible here unless your one of the guys.  The third shift shipping manager sits in the office and does nothing all night long and once the plant manager comes in he rushes to make it look like he was working.
bad,I have been working here for 4 months. There is no advancement in my position. They don’t want to hire full time because they would have to pay me more. You have no life other than work. Not a good place if you have a family.
bad,I would not recommend work there to anybody.. You can tell they have favorites and nobody is treated equally or fairly. Long days and over working 60 hours a week and working 6 days a week.. Point system is out of this world.. Points are giving for things you cant help.. They are not about there employees they are all about getting there work out... Very stressful and not a honest place to work
bad,Very low pay in comparison to region and work around the area. Area is well known for oil field or plant life and the pay being offered to operators was way to low and the training was not well for the very closed off culture they had.
bad,"Poor management and supervision, low pay rate for the job your required to do, not much job security and not much chance to move up in the company at all"
bad,"I was conned into this job. Since I have been working there for over 6 months now. It's truly is a prison. No recognition, it's pulling teeth to get time off, the pay does not compare to the amount of work and juggling one is asked to do. They ding you for all things so you truly don't know if you are coming or going. Retaliation and discrimination in the work place."
bad,"No work/life balance, random schedule for mandatory work hours, no room for advancement.  The company is not suited if you have a family and will interfere with weekend plans."
bad,"Poor management , alot of favoritism among supervisors towards some employess and others not so much but hey its not what you know it's who you know , it's a factory job at the end of the day dead end job no place for advancement unless you kiss a** and even then it's who's a** you kiss as well ."
bad,I got fired 4 having to use my inhaler. Because i have asthma. But there are others there that have asthma. An they get to keep there job. They will fire you over a cut on your finger or anything they think has to be reported. Mine didn't need to be reported. But the boss said he had to report me having to use my inhaler. So i got fired the next day!
bad,Westrock dragged my reputation through the mud and spit it out I was working hard came back from breaks early only used restroom when on breaks and they let me go due to lack of performance. I do not recommend this job I was looking to start a life from this but instead it through me down a deeper well. I hope you read before hiring thought they were nice at first too but they don't care about their workers I'm not sure they even care about their customers. Don't make the mistake I did thanks for reading my experience.
bad,Under value their employees.  under paid and stressful environment. poor management. bad training and poor management. Would not recommend anyone to work at Westrock
bad,Wish I would have found a way out of that job soon the in light being spireas slow paced low pay Access is the temp agency that hired me for West rock would not do it again
bad,"Health care is awful. "
bad,i had a car accident the whole time during my recovery they told me my position was still open they didn't replace me however once the doctor released me back to work they told me i no longer have employment with them
bad,When I applied here I was told I would be paid $17.35 this was back in June. After I was hired I was told the starting pay was actually 11.25 but after 90 days I would receive a raise and be paid 17.35. When I tell you that was the hardest I’ve ever worked for the least amount I’ve ever been paid. It’s no joke hard labor. Minimum breaks and overtime at will.  Working there is not a career move.
bad,Management is horrible machines out of date and management sets unrealistic expectations for orders. One shift is responsible for all other shifts including mistakes and clean up. Been scheduled for overtime for over 5 months while other shifts are working normal hours
bad,Managers don’t care about you only the computer and about the money in their pocket. They only what is best for them and not the employees. They will make you feel awful about yourself and the job you are doing.
bad,"would not recommend working here. overworked, poor training, no communication, computers and headsets outdated, equipment doesn't work. only positive thing about this place is nothing, absolutely nothing. company needs to modernize and replace some of the management and supervisor staff"
bad,"management is very unprofessional, a very hard company to work for it is fast pace work. long hours, the pay is not to bad. it is a safe work place. and clean"
bad,"Your work and efforts will never be valued. This is the best place to feel unappreciated. As far as promotion, it will never happen. The best thing to do is kiss the ring and look for another job."
bad,"Management makes it not work the time at all, they do not know how to task properly, they lack motivation, terrible at advancements. Not work the pay due to management"
bad,Only number driven company only was concerned about production. I spent many hours away from family. I spent all Holidays away form family. No work life balance.
bad,"Once we had a change of management, literally everyone ended up quitting. Management is terrible and corporate wont seem to do anything about it. It's a tiny facility that attempts to run like a massive facility. Thousands of tons of material come in each day and is expected to be processed and go out that same day. The work load is excessive and the overtime is never ending. If you're unable to keep up with the work or management constantly riding you, you'll be written up and get a ""talking to."" Thats until you eventually quit."
bad,They suck the don't even allow you to get sick they give points for everything you do and you loose your job after seven in each year it's a place that makes you feel like you can't have time with your family
bad,"Very unprofessional work place and management. Never received a paycheck and was given wrong information during orientation. And they dont give badge numbers or punch cards to new employees. Their HR is horrible and annoying. I've been working here for about a month and still haven't received a paycheck after the second week like how every company should. Saying sorry can only go on for so long, for most people live paycheck to paycheck. It's so sad when an employee has to quit due to the lack of management and not the work. I had to leave because from the start till now, I had no trust with any of the management."
bad,"I've applied to be a machine operator clear back in February 2018. I had a group interview and was told I would hear back by Friday. I had to call them only to get a generic answer ""we went with another candidate."" I've applied 3 more times since. Human Resource has been very hostile and non cooperative. This is in Rogers, Arkansas. I feel as though they need new management or at least tell people why they are not a fit instead of wasting their time."
bad,"The process to be hired is not good you take a test for an hour then you get an interview then your waiting it takes 3 hours it’s like orientation you should be paid. I’ve seen people get to this point 3 hours in the get called back then get walked out, then when you get started your a slave never get to leave."
bad,I got sick and put in the hospital for 3 day with in my 90 probation period and they let me go even with me having a doctors note. They don't care about the health of there employees.
bad,Terrible place to work. The operators and management are awful. That's maybe the worst place ever. I'd kill myself before working there again.  Military personnel and people that have been in prison work there.  It's slow boring. I mean they make cereal boxes how exciting can that really be. No communication by management or operators they are incompetent.
bad,Worst company ever!!! Everyone is unprofessional and everyone talks about everyone!!! Very very very low pay!!!! No room for advancement!!! No room for anything!!!
bad,The overall atmosphere at the Patchogue location is horrible. Customer service manager is very inexperienced and plays favorites to people who have worked for her for over 20years. The work loads are completely un balanced and management does not care. I have never experienced a worse communication or lack there of with production and customer service dept. do yourself a favor and run the other way!!!!
bad,"This place sucks the life out of you !      Forced 16 hour shifts ,  had vacation but was not allowed to take it !   You have a different superviser every year because no one stays ..  zero days off"
bad,westrock put in a mandatory overtime list every Thursday for Saturday. I worked mandatory Saturday every week for the whole 4 months I was there. Management was awful.
bad,It's a very stressful place to work.  Pay is fair but work environment is horrible.  You may work about 60 hours a week and it is not a family orient workplace.
bad,I would not recommend this work place to anyone. this was the worst job I have ever worked. Management was sorry and fellow employees were not out to help you. The turnover rate unreal due to the way this place is run.
bad,company started great but slid until it merged. good treatment until original CEO retired and company grew. went fro mom & pop type atmosphere to 24/7.
bad,"In all when I started, we worked 7 days a week and had 0 life outside work which I was fine with. Then after the merge, little overtime, poor planning, team leaders had favorites and would over look lots of poor safety decisions and refused to go by the standard they upheld to you. Would tell you in meetings that there was a busy work week and then would only work 4 days sometimes 3. Ask to why you get the run around. They lost contracts and blamed it on the employees performance."
bad,"I do not wish to comment on a typical day, my overall experience, management, company culture, the most difficult aspect of the job or the most enjoyable aspect of the job."
bad,i do not wish to say anything else. Leaderships is pitiful and they do not know what they are doing. They preach empower all employees but it is more of a dictaorship.
bad,OK place to work at first.  Division was sold and then WestRock totally abandoned everybody.  We are still owed vacation pay from time worked.  Company motto - empty words and broken promises.  Multiple claims against them with government to recover unpaid vacation pay.
bad,"dont care about their employees, no way would i recommended anyone to go to work there it is a terrible place to work wouldnt wish that place on my worst enemy,"
bad,They did me wrong i got fired for self defense a guy followed me to my car after work and wanted to fight and i defended my self. Ad they fired me i got done so wrong there.
bad,"nothing good to say about it ,they work way to much they don't care about life an work no notice about working the weekend ever until last min don't care about there employees"
bad,"Claim culture of safety yet no one follows the most basic safety policies, pay is mediocre at best, no work life balance, worn out equipment, no parts, tons of jerry rigging, nothing works automatically as it should because they allowed contractors to do poor work, wont get ahead unless your brown"
bad,"This place is horrible place to work, upper management treats the employees like property. There thoughts are that everyone can be replaced but them. You will never see your family and you will never see management on the weekends while you struggle and sweat. Employees are not give enough time to train or learn the machines before you are responsible for the production #'s"
bad,"If you just want to work when you want to work and not have residual income, this company is for you. I didnt like having to come in to work and sign my name and if there is enough work available then I can work for the day. If not enough work i have to go right back home. extremely inconvenient."
bad,"supervisor speaks to disrespectfull and yells, management treats you horrible. They work you 12 hours a day 6 to 7 days a week than treat u bad. its a bad buddy system there."
bad,Most horrible company I ever worked for treat employees horrible yell and cuss u union is a joke and salary peopke in the office think there department manager i dont t even see how the company stays afloat then when corporate monkeys come down and want to know what is wrong they leave
bad,"I work for westrock now,the management doesn't care about the people just numbers. Some are ok but most are awful. They want you to live there as if you don't have a life,if you complain then you are a target. I would not recommend this job to anyone period."
bad,"NO training whatsoever. But you will be held responsible and blamed for every little thing. Horrible, toxic management that promotes a negative culture resulting in low morale. My last paycheck was also messed up and was forced to pay some money back due to WestRock's error. Worst place ever. Don't waste your time. No room for advancement and horrible management."
bad,"Previously was SP Fiber Tech before being purchased by WestRock Company. This was a great place to work until it shut down. Co-workers were friendly, courteous and helpful with training on machines I was unfamiliar with. Nice work environment with overtime and call time compensation pay."
bad,Terrible treatment from corporate. Closed us down with no remorse and no care what so ever. Would not recommend this company to anyone
bad,Worst place to work ever. You get treated badly. Favoritism is a constant downfall. You can't get any advancement. Plant manager doesn't have a clue on how to run the facility. Autologic supervisor is the worst imaginable person to work for. Don't look for advancement without taking a different shift.
bad,"Found this job at a job fair. I interviewed for one job but was told to get my foot in the door,I would be doing something else So, I did. Pay was good with shift differential and allot of overtime. Training well that's another story... Seems as usual everyone has their own way of working and ways to get the never ending line of pallets down to shipping. Needless to say with the shipping supervisor yelling at you.. while your busting your butt."
bad,"unless you like a negative workplace and people that work against you instead of with you then I would say; stay clear of this place of employment.  they will not train you decently and will work you long hours, call you stupid and idiot etc.... so all in all, it was not good for my soul.  the pay is good but you will regret going there.  trust me!"
bad,Absolutely horrible place. Supervisor threatened to fire employees everyday! Harassed many employees as well. When the issue was brought up to the union and management they did nothing. Filed a grievance and during the meeting the manager and union hall rep were discussing where to get lunch!!! Was wrongfully terminated with no paper work to myself or the union hall which is required. As i was leaving the meeting the HR manager from a different location asked if there were going to be any legal repercussions. This is not the first time i have heard of this happening and they refuse to do anything about it. Unbelievable!
bad,I did like working there but I did not like the fact you don't know if you are working or not you sign a paper sit and wait for them to call your name if not you go home so I finally got tired of that so I quit and went back to school to get my ged
bad,"You can't go out to your car at breaks and you a subjected to thousands of rules and regulations. You have to walk a fine white line at this under nine dollars an hour low paying job. They will put you on a third or second shift with little advance notice! The constant threats from former employees that where cheated and tricked out of unemployment benefits makes this a dangerous environment! Don't waste your time with this one. RUN,RUN,RUN and never look back!"
bad,"All the company cares about is money! They could care less about the employees! Sr management team isn't worth a pot to spit in! I had problems with an employee and when I went to report them, they didn't do anything! They told me that if I didn't like it I could quit! I was treated like a piece of dirt on a floor-mat and that is putting it nicely! I would not recommend anyone to apply for this company because they like lie to you directly to your face and then stab you in the back!"
bad,"This company, by far, was the worst company I have worked for.  The office environment was down right toxic, everyone was out for themselves and they were more than willing to lie about their coworkers to get what they wanted.  Everyone thought their position was the more important than anyone else's.  This led to no one working together to form a team.  The management style was unskilled at its best and psychological torture at its worst.  I would never recommend this company to anyone."
bad,"This is an awful company, no life work tons of hours have no family life or personal life.  They work you until you have no life and with not so much as a thank you, it is just expected."
bad,Poor culture with bad leadership both locally and at the corporate headquarters. Daily work environment brutal with backstabbing and lies the norm.
bad,"Nothing fun about working here, Very harsh environment. Not treated well at all."
bad,The most enjoyable part of the job for me was when I would complete my tasks for the day. I would know that I came and did what had to be done.
bad,poor place to work management are just like the rest!! closed lunches.
bad,No job security at all. Management was rude. Safety procedures weren't always followed. Just not run officiant enough.
bad,"The company preaches a culture of respect, but that is not the case. Since the Smurfit acquisition, there has been a battle between the old RockTenn way and the old Smurfit way. Neither way is winning or producing a good work place environment. Benefits are terrible. they only offer one High Deductible plan. You have to wait two months before your eligible for benefits, including 401k. They only give you two weeks vacation, regardless of how many years of work experience. By far, the worst place I have ever worked."
bad,"Sucks HARD MANAGEMENT I MEAN, What They call it. Threat you like a dog, Tell you if don't like it . Maybe you Don't Belong Here."
bad,"i learned alot about management at rock tenn. but due to horrible management in uper levels the place was a nightmare also.  its great place to grow but you have to work under unethical, selfish, demeaning people...."
bad,terrible terrible  management communication skills no training program.
bad,"at rock tenn you never knew when you was going to work you had to show up an hr early just to find out if you was goin to be put on a line n if you didnt get put on a line you was sent home, you was lucky to get  8-16 hrs a week at times"
bad,rocktenn bc (NewWest)company -renegs on concession agreement due to legal language loophole-Each employee gave up 5 grand a year during rough patch concession on agreement of it returning at end of contract july 1 2012.union went to management who said forget it.currently looking for short contract with little paychange.
bad,"There isn’t room for advancement and working outside your job scope isn’t smiled upon. HR Spinner dictates everything that happens within the Yakima plant, which can be very conflicting when the “customer is always right.”"
bad,"Westrock does not care about their Canadian employees. This US centric company is all about the bottom line and has no compassion for staff who worked for the company for years. After being laid off they promised to place people in jobs but when several of the team called HR in Mississauga Ontario the HR department did not even have the decency to reply. "
bad,Horrible experience at Westrock. Management is the worse I’ve ever experienced. Favoritism runs rampant here. They expect certain employees to work like dogs and obey all the rules while certain people go to lunch 10 mins early and take 12 bathroom breaks per day. AND MANAGEMENT IS AWARE IF THIS!
bad,"I will say this for Westrock finishing department...if you aren't a member of the ""clique"" or give them any flack you can hang it up. It doesn't matter how well of a worker you are at all. They have people in no air condition lifting cases of 50+ lbs for 12 hours with minimal breaks. The saddest thing is people that come in and learn the job very well are then kept from advancing to new postions. Always get the excuse of oh well we really need you back here until we hire more people. Then the new people come in and slack off and before you know it.....promotion.....all the good leads are gone quit and left for better jobs. Management is a joke. Even when you go to talk to them about things it is overlooked. Managers talking about employees to other employees, leads making fun of employees to management, too many problems with gossip and lies. Some employees will make up things to try and get you fired if they don't like you or if they feel threatened by you. I have never seen a place operate like this. No other incentives than what any other plant does, company moral is terrible, even if you are lucky enough to get a promotion its a guarantee you will be stuck in your same position until they hire someone else to do your job. Ive seen them fire people based on another employee say so but then get in a desperation mode and beg them to come back. People get fired for getting hurt on the job although they will blame it on other reasons. Lots of favoritism, jobs that grown men cant handle women are in there doing and never any appreciation whatsoever. All they worry about is quantity"
bad,They care more of false info than actually facts. HR isn’t there to help people. It’s there to make your job harder. The longer you been there the more of a favorite you are.
bad,"Would give zero starsif I could.Mandatory overtime,no work-life balance.Micormanaged constantly.Production numbers must be met no matter what the consequences.Worst placed I have ever worked in 40+ years."
bad,The best part of the job was the union most of the time.
bad,Dont work here. No family life. They expect you give up your life for them. Cant trust management. Long hours plus weekends. They didn't tell you this at interview.  Always looking to point the finger at someone
bad,No  Family life home life no time to do anything that you enjoyed but work they will  Fire you if you try to leave through the day No considerations for the employees your opinion does not count They will ask for it but then they if it's good they will take credit for it if not you will not hear about it.
bad,"Craft workers are treated poorly, overworked and asked to work in conditions not fit for the civilized world. Union plant with advancement where it shouldn't be. Stay away!"
bad,"Um emprego de cultura "
bad,"If ur part of the group ur fine if not ur screwed, union sucks ur better off without them when they r actually there, dont get hurt or saftey guy becomes a poor dr nd likely to make worse"
bad,"Debbie Myler is a horrible boss. I lived 45 minutes from work and in the winter she would tell me I needed to stay in town to make sure I could get to work in the morning. She does not allow any talking among employees, music in your work area, breaks, use of sick days......etc. She is a miserable human, that should never have been allowed to ""manage"" people."
bad,Do not work here! This is a terrible place! Your only allowed a lunch break and no other breaks. The management are terrible cursing in front of new hires and just nasty all the way around. They do not know how to treat people there. The overtime is out of hand you cannot plan anything because your always there.
bad,J'ai travaillé là pour 6 mois et c'était une expérience absolument désagréable. Environnement bourré de négativité. Aucune emphatie envers les travailleurs. Je déconseille fortement.
bad,"This is by far the worst place I have ever worked, the union runs the place and their is no accountability for the union members, equipment is abused and little time or money  is given for its proper maintenance, plant runs around the clock 5-6 days a week. Everything is micro managed at the Corporate level on a minute by minute basis, when equipment goes down Corporate knows about it and calls to find out why it is not running, no reason for downtime is accepted. Maintenance is understaffed and the Maintenance Manager is overburdened.  There are  no less than 5 meetings per day, reporting on progress or in staff meetings, unlike other departments the Maintenance Manager has no supervisors or Leads and fills these rolls also, Base Salary is low for position and the annual Bonus is only 1-2% Target is 5% but the goal is unattainable and designed that way. Raises are equally laughable. Place is a revolving door for Maintenance Managers and they only last about 2-3 years on average. Plant was built in the 50’s, the fire suppression system is out of date and out compliance with current NFPA code, plant has roof leaks over high voltage panels and has for years, sewage system is just a bunch of septic tanks as the company is to cheap to tie into city sewage, plant is full of “encapsulated “ and “Un-encapsulated “ asbestos. Noxious Fumes/ smoke from the waxing process permeate  the production floor and Maintenance shop and offices. You have no autonomy as a Manager, no real authority to change things and are held accountable for things you have no control over and are a scapegoat for"
bad,"everything about this job site is hard hot work, and management will make it miserable for everyone on the floor.    It is really hard to explain, cause there is a lot of issues; but suffice it to say, it mainly created by management."
bad,"While I enjoyed working with my team, the over all management style beyond my manager was petty and vindictive. They talked a good game about corporate culture and work life balance, but when you tried to integrate concepts into your work life you were shot down. "
bad,Management is favored overall and does not listen to employees if you have seniority then you have job security or if you know someone they talk safety and do something completely different same goes with all other aspects of the work place
bad,"Did not provide what was told to me upon hiring.  Work schedule was put to 6 days a week and poor management.  Goes by hearsay instead of knowing what workers are capable of doing.  More concerned over the bottom line.  Supervisors cannot do their jobs."
bad,Pays good management treats you like poorly  work 6 days a week work 8 to 12 hrs a day one day a week you get to spent with family and friends would not recommend working here to anyone unless you like being there all the time
bad,This company is so messed up management has no clue what there doing they talk about safety but you can barely drive in the warehouse stuff piled on top of each other no direction back stabing is the culture .inventory is a mess
bad,Worked there for many years. As soon as Westrock bought the mill they closed the mill down with in 3 months. I worked shift work most of the time and really enjoyed my job in the chip handling dept. What was really nice was working 4 days on and 4 days off. 12 hour days but 4 days made it worth it. There were 4-5 other companies that owned the mill with in my years of employment.
bad,"Although I never had any trouble at this particular job, the management always screamed and belittled many employees on a daily basis. This was difficult because I had to work with these very same people"
bad,"By far the worst place I've ever worked , 12 hr days and no balance for home life, you get punished for even going to a rx or dentist apt !"
bad,"While there could be potential with this company, the management ruins nearly every good aspect of being employed here.  Horrible working conditions, and trust me you will never do anything good enough or fast enough.  Managers should be down right ashamed of themselves for treating employees like they do.  I would not wish this job on my worst enemy, however if working your life away and being treated like a slave are your thing then feel free."
bad,Horrible place to work.they don't care about your family life no leadership one of the worst jobs that I have ever had
bad,Not a  good company to work for the management is terrible no leadership at all
bad,"Management is a mess, they do not care about any employee below the level of director.  Employees from different business unit are horrible about working together which has a huge impact on their business from employee satisfaction all the way to the bottom line on their income statement."
bad,"I learned what it means to live in an ""At Will"" employment state."
bad,"Upper management is cut throat from the general manager to the area Superintendants , you can’t trust anyone there even H.R is horrible,everyone is afraid to speak up for fear of being fired."
bad,"First off they have this weird segregation thing going with there temps (more temps then actual full time employees working daily) which in turn makes the temps hate the full timers. Personally the way they treat them I don't blame them, summer times there falling out left and right due heat exhaustion. Pay is that of a third world child laboring sweat shop."
bad,There was no room for growth. This was a factory job with an outdated mindset. Very little consideration for the people. There was no true leadership or training. The leaders there were unprepared to review or lead another leader. A lot of room for growth.
bad,No family life  always working management pushes safety but it’s really about production numbers management needs help managing us employees good job to work if you don’t have a family
bad,"#1) Everyday will be walking into a bee hive.#2) If you're not from Charles city, VA. Or a close affiliate then you won't succeed. You will be bullied, harrased and ultimately fired or quit. It's a friend's and family program. #3) If You dare go the chain of command then you will be fired. Virginia is a right to work state.#3)  Westrock will not fully train you and expect you to know EVERYTHING that.even your ss"
bad,I have never worked for a company that mistreated its employees using vile language and threatening remarks regarding job security. The culture was the worst I have ever been associated with.
bad,Management dan acton is a horrible boss at the holland location beware he will stab anyone in the back to be able to make himself look good I had to quit because of his lack of experience managing and dealing with employees beware of this if you looking Into westrock holland horrible place to work
bad,"If you are new to this company, you will have 5 days off per year.  Total.  That's sick time, vacation, sick kids, everything.  They have a point system that gives demerits for being late (yes, there's a time clock) and unplanned time off.  Forced overtime during busy season."
bad,"Pay's good but the hours are not at all flexible, you don't really get trained well and management is subpar. Superiors like to yell a lot if you don't understand how to do the job right away."
bad,This job was weird. My position started as an Downstacker which paid pretty good because they have a hard time keeping people for that position. Regardless of how many mistakes the people on the machine make you will take full blame for everything. Even if you notify a supervisor. There was people there 20 and 30 years. And i was making more or very close to there paynin my 6 months. That's the weird part
bad,They have a point system that don’t make no sense you miss one day you get two points you miss a Friday Saturday or Sunday you get three points doctors appointment you get points if you go to the emergency room you get points so you can’t get sick or have doctor appointment and it’s a10 point system they can’t keep no one.
bad,"They dont pay enough for all you have to endure.  They make you work 8-12 hrs for 6 days a week.  They dont tell you if your replacement doesnt show up or calls out you have to stay extra 4 hrs until the next shift comes in. It's hot; there is no ac in the building so if it's in the 90s outside please believe it's in the 100s because of the machines and there only fans circulating hot air.  They have a union, but what is it really for if they're not benefiting the workers working conditions.  You dont get vacation or sick days until a year and if you call out because you sick you run the risk of being fired."
bad,Under value their employees. under paid and stressful environment. Very poor management. No training and poor management. Would not recommend anyone to work at Westrock.unless you love working in a very stressful situation.
bad,I've worked for westrock for 15 years and I was promised so many advancements in moving up in the chain of command and every time was lied to I have been physically abused at this job and was told to just keep my mouth shut and Let It Go the people that I work with management are terrible they're lazy they lie and they never want people to move up in the company I have been asked to do things at this place to make it a better place but then other managers /supervisors won't allow any of my ideas to ever happen my advice find a different job westrock in Plymouth Indiana is terrible
bad,"Supervisors suck, none of them have ever touched a machine in the plant but insist on telling you how to operate yours, communication, forget about it, senyority, forget about it, loyalty, forget about it, advancement, forget about it, if you want to work there, forget about it apply at McDonald's better chance of having a career. Worst place i have ever worked."
bad,A female coworker wasn't getting her breaks like she's entitled to. she had a heart attack and had to get a pacemaker put in. when she came back from short term disability they put her on the transfer cart which is the hardest and most physical job there. it was said if she couldn't do it to leave because she was a liability to the company. they are cruel have no sympathy for disabled employees that they Probably contributed to the cause of her life changing event!
bad,"1 week paid vacation after you've been with the company for a year, but they will reject every vacation request you but in. You will work 6 days a week every week. The 6th day is mandatory overtime. The normal work week is 41 hours per week, but you usually end up working 49-53. When someone does get to use vacation the other two shifts have to work 12 hour shifts to make up for that person being gone. If you're late even one or two minutes it will count against you. There was a guy who was late by 3 minutes in his first 90 days and they fired him right then and there. You are not allowed to leave during lunches and you only have 30 minutes. There are no sick days and 1 personal day per year."
bad,"Come in go to your machine find out what is running keep it going."
bad,"Worse place you will ever work. It's like what you say or do will be held against you for as long as you work at Conover Westrock.  Back stabbers in shipping Dept. And can't trust any Manager, or supervisor"
bad,Mismanagement. Playing favorites or you are out. 60+ hours a week. MUST work 45 out 52 weekends in a year or you are fired. Toxic environment with co workers envious all the time.
bad,"I've never worked at anyplace like RockTenn and the culture shock was immediate.  Managers will blame employees for their own mistakes if it will save their jobs.  Rules are often times not written down so manager's can claim they never said to do those things.  "
bad,"It should be criminal, very upset that you hire individuals knowing there are handicaps and you allow your workers and Supervisors to be judgmental, cruel and permit bullying and allow them to influence continuing employment."
bad,Its union but they dont do anything for you. The management can careless about the employees and what they do for the company when someone calls off its mandatory to cover their shift so its  like no notice what so ever way to many meeting if you cant make it to a meeting they point you for it
bad,The Management is terrible. They cater to men more then they do women. the union is a terrible one to be in. it is a waste of money. they make you work long hours for not alot of pay. I would never recommend this place to anyone
bad,Bad management at the St.louis location. LOW pay and want you to work 5 times as hard... I don't mind working hard but I need to get paid decent for it.
bad,"Despite excellent sales with Westrock, I found they could not perform. Packaging quality was inconsistent, as were deliveries and fulfillment of the order. Commission structure is bait and switch. Management does not support employees."
bad,"The management, at the time I was there, changed constantly.  All the people who truly cared were let go and those that were awful at people skills were left to further kill the morale of the teams.  There were layoffs and then a merger.  A lot of people were forced to leave or retire.  I resigned because the environment was stressful and there was never no clear idea of what our purpose was.  I don't regret leaving and I think I may have extended my life by leaving."
bad,I learned that this plant cares nothing about you. You give 125% they want 150%. you have to train people that don't care about the job. It's very hot in summer and freezing in winter. Not a good place to work.
bad,"This was not a good place for me as a long term contractor. I stayed two years thinking that I would be converted to permanent hire. Thus, I wasted 2 years of my career chasing a company that was not interested in hiring me long term. I can never get that time back."
bad,"When you work maintenance your day may be perventive Maintenance or new install of machines or electrical systems  or at  any time a complete productions break down I try to learn sdpomthing new everyday.   Each place is differant on what they want or what is expeded of you; it is up to each employee to try to work with and cooperate with others. "
bad,"First off I wouldn't want any of my children or family to have to work for a place like this. This place is so unappreciative of their employees. Management preaches safety but make no mistake about it numbers and productivity are all that matters. If you value holidays, weekends, or time with your family then this is not the place for you at all. Management is a total joke, Human Resources is a total joke. This plant badly needs union representation. Fellow boxmakers beware!! I would write a lot more but I need sleep, my 12hr shift starts soon."
bad,"Company(El Paso) preaches values and culture of a place that resembles paradise but is a total opposite of paradise.  Management is lazy and pushes all work to personnel below, mainly supervisors.  You will earn your money at this company.  Work/Family balance is very poor.  Always working long hours, 12 hour shifts, and Saturdays with no concern for how employees feel.  When want to discuss with human resources any issues, personnel never available and like politicians, drive the subject away until it is not relevant anymore. Corporate personnel might be unaware of practices at this location and therefore do nothing to resolve the management issues taking place.    Bottom line is this location(El Paso) can be compared to the days when slavery was legal."
bad,Let's see where should I start. When you first get there they make you sit on a room and watch a bunch of pointless safety videos.Then they throw you on a machine and expect you to perform at the level of someone who's been doing it for years and if you can't keep up they will fire you I repeat FIRE YOU. So if you get in don't think you got a permanent job because they can fire you at any time during your 60 probationary period.The management is THE WORSE I've ever worked with in my entire life.While you busting your but in the heat you have a supervisor who knows nothing about the department he's supervisor yelling and screaming at you and they won't hesitate to use profanity.Dont bother complaining to hr or the plant manager because the encourage the managers to do this.There is NO WORK LIFE BALANCE.So if you wanna work here your home life will suffer.The only good thing is if you have no life or family you can make some decent money with the overtime but that's about it.Hands down the WORST place I have ever work.I do not recommend I quit and will never return.
bad,"Avoid at all cost!  hard work, they don't allow time for you to learn your job, expect you to know everything after the first time shown. money is ok but not worth it, general attitude for everybody working there is poor,  and not very helpful.  preach safety but want turn around time done in 15 min or less,  nothing enjoyable about this job!"
bad,"Tremendous amount of stress, C suite managers are difficult to understand. Too many changes to culture or direction of the month."
bad,"At RockTenn you work 10 hour days 6 days a week for little pay. Upper management is a joke and doesn't understand anything that goes on, on the production floor."
bad,"read title explains all. Shipping manager makes life miserable on all. Be-little's, insults employees and uses profanity towards employees on a regular basis. Covers up her own many mistakes by blaming shipping employees for her faults. She's really clueless on how the dept should work"
bad,"I worked at WestRock in Lanett, Al for a few years on Leadership team. Out of 22 yrs of production this place was by far the worst experience. Miss the HR team from 2013 -14.... They cared!"
bad,"Disney world this ain't. There is absolutely no joy in this job. We use to have a good safety record, not anymore. Safety and quality are given lip service and not really mentioned until we have an accident or a customer complaint. You have no job security. Management is nonexistent, until they dream up some new way of making your job even more difficult."
bad,Greedy company.. only thing they think about is money.. You work 70 to 80 hours a week when we’re short handed which is 90% of the time.. You got to be hungry to work here!!
bad,"This place has great benefits, great pay but management is horrible. The point/attendance policy is horrible. HR is a joke. Favoritism definitely exists there and they change and make up rules as they go. Don’t waste your time"
bad,"Terrible management, long hours, expect you to work from clock in to clock out, no room for advancement. Terrible place to work. The moral is horrible, everybody is out for everybody’s job."
bad,Worst job I’ve ever had. Yet the highest paying. the GM here is a tyrant. He fires people when he gets mad and doesn’t care what anybody thinks about it. The plant manager is ran over by the GM. This place is trash and management sucks  DO NOT WORK HERE! I REPEAT RUN!
bad,"Management sucks. Operators are lazy and dont want to help. They cant keep people because the people that have been there 20 something years are rude and don't want to train people. Management is hands off. They say they care, but if you don't have seniority they don't."
bad,Unless you like flying under the radar doing the minimal amount of work and never progressing this job is not for you. If you are a rockstar who wants to rise through the ranks STAY AWAY!
bad,I enjoyed working at Westrock my only complaint is management and the supervisor patrick.. they have their favorites they will save from trouble everyone else the moment you get in trouble your terminated. Patrick I can’t stand the supervisor cause he’s not understanding at all theres a lot of ppl that come from different backgrounds and different jobs before you come out to WestRock especially temps but he expects you to know everything instantly when your trying to figure the place out
bad,"Management has great talent for hiring lazy people. If you care about your work, don't come work here! You will be so annoyed, frustrated, and stressed out. People sleep on top of the machines on the night shift and even standing up, it's incredible! Take 1 hour breaks when it should be 10 min or 20 min. While a couple of others are forced to do all the work. Management hide in the office.  Employees have no accountability.  It truly is the worst of the worse. It's union. You will be forced to work yourself to death here. OT is mandatory and often. They preach about how we need to spend time with family but they make us work almost every Saturday and often times 12 hour days. Again,  this place is incredible.  They desperately need a big change in management."
bad,No balance of work time and time off. If you are salary they expect you there 6 days a week and work fill ins all the time. I was not happy there. If you don’t like it than leave is the moto
bad,"Plant Management is disconnected and supports  double standards, Union and management are always at odds. "
bad,"Union plant yet not a single person knows anything about the union. I’ve been paying money to the union for years to get nothing in return. We had an arbitration and they didn’t have a lawyer, they solved it over dinner with the employee getting what he wanted and the company also getting what they wanted which screws the rest of the people down the road.  The favoritism management shows is beyond believable.  To get ahead it’s about who you know and how much you are willing to kiss up to management. Management doesn’t care about your family time and almost every weekend is worked.  High turn over rate people come and go. Management won’t report safety violations when it is management that is the one breaking them but when it comes to an employee they drop the hammer. I’ve seen people get fired just cause they don’t like you. But they keep drug addicts who point out. This place is a good last resort stepping stone for people that want to get a good job."
bad,"Lots of turnover and forced to work long hours and days off, because of very poor management, contstant shift alignments, and forced overtime at last minute unable to plan any family time on days you are suppose to be off ,but never off. They have quick silver 1 week training and expected to know how to do job even though you don't  and they pressure you to sign off on training packet just to cover the company. The management is very poor and controls the Union so they do whatever they want to do to employees including violating all the rules of signed contract. The convinced the Union to sign a 10 year contract which basically allows the company to violate the contract terms of agreement with no resistance.he one who file grievances against company for such things as violating contract or point out unsafe working conditions are simply gotten rid of . This place is very fast past and unsafe to work at.he 1st year with the company they had 13 near missed and 3 recordable injuries, and the 2nd year they had 15 near misses and 4 recordable injury in certain time frame to warrant OSHA to investigate, but company very good at paperwork coverup to always blame it on employees. The turnover is also so bad that you have trainee employees training trainee employees, and management just laughs and justifys turnover as people problem not there fault."
bad,"Your work long hours......looooong hours. Managements don't have a clue what they are doing. No personal life outside work, very little family time. Good job with a single person with no responsibilities. Benefits are not that good but pay is decent....especially with all the overtime. They don't really care about their workers here."
bad,"Very Hostile work environment,  No team work. Poor Management. Constantly harassed by coworkers and supervisor. I would never  recommend this job. Much Happier to have moved on."
bad,work was fasted pace and the more u did the more they wanted and wouldnt make each employe do there fair share every employe had there own rules when it came to management
bad,"Not a good place to work overall, the turnover rate is high. Work is super boring and repetitive, 12 hrs of standing. 3 days you work equals to no life. Not worth trying!"
bad,"I started as a temp, worked my way up to supervisor on 2nd shift. Turnover rate was out of control, work environment was toxic all due to plant manager."
bad,"The company WestRock as a whole is a good company (Corporate, HR, etc.) However, the site/plant management (where I actually worked)...smh..is not a reflection of the company. "
bad,As someone stated before from this Mebane North Carolina location this place it's just full of adults that spend their time talking about other people. They are a bunch  of bullies. The managers just try to fit in with the employees but don't do much managing. I was fired because I didn't allow a machine operator to talk to me like a child. I kept to myself didn't bother anyone now I'm out of a job with bills but they don't care.
bad,I wouldn’t recommend working there because the hours are terrible and you always have to watch over your shoulder from a few people and management is always looking to fire for no reason.
bad,"Working 7 days a week, mostly 12 hour ahifts for months on end. No balance between work and personal life. Forced overtime a lot of the time on holidays. Incompetent managers."
bad,"I was hired as a database developer for the Recycling division.  After being there for only 2 month, the manager that hired me was fired after 10 years of service.  IT in the Recycling division did not follow normal IT procedures.  There were no formal documentation, source code control or requirements.  The requirements were given by email and always stress the urgency for it.  Once you complete the requirement and contact the business to test then there were no urgency.  They will test your program months or weeks later.  Half the time they will forget what they ask for.  The company follows a Good Ol Boy system where kissing the right person's behind will get you ahead.  I would not recommend this company unless you plan to have no life and desire to be cut throat.  I was given good review when I started and within month they stated all non factual negative criticism about my work ethics."
bad,"What can I say, supervisors would have favorites and allow them to run amok while constantly say its your fault for all the issues they cause. "
bad,Horrible place to work. Upper management is in way over their heads. They have no clue how to run a plant efficiently. There are too many chiefs and not enough Indians.
bad,Westrock has Good benefits but the management is not trustworthy. WestRock is changing for the worst. Very disorganized and no communication at all!!!
bad,First let me say working with this company is not a back breaking job. An it could really be a great company to work for if the right people was running it.  But it is worse than every job i have had rolled into one. They fire people more than any company ive every seen. Workers are afraid to say or do anything in FEAR of lossing there jobs. Its a prison!!!!!An shipping is the worst department to work. Everything they screw up at the main plant we have to fix. The send labels for us to put on pallets an lots of others things. If we forget to do these things you can be fired for one mistake. An if they give you another chance they give you 6month probation. You cant make any mistakes for 6MONTHS!!!!!! As soon as they hire you the clock starts to see how fast they can fire you. Workers that have been there 25-30 yrs walked out like they are nothing for a mistake. The supervisor are the worst. The want  to know what you feel or think so they can do the opposite of what you want. They put inexperienced workers in positions that have not one day of experience. An force the workers with years of experience to do it there way. Corporate  gives a survey every year to see what the works think. Even though nobody has to put there names on the survey the employees are afraid to tell the truth. An if they told the truth would corporate really see it??? Alot of workers would just mail theres to be safe. Workers thought mangement would know there handwriting. Conover got a bad review once or twice. An they gave everybody a raise. Huss money!!!!  It would get better for about 3 months. Then
bad,"Typical day at work would consist of me closing 80 to 100 loads a day communicating with management in team meetings, contacting suppliers and setting up their orders and manage their accounts. I did learn how to adapt and work under tremendous amounts of pressure as well as Citrix Cietrade, JD Edwards software. The hardest part of my job was securing reliable, inexpensive  transportation for suppliers to move their product. The most enjoyable part of the job were my co-workers."
bad,"Management is sneaky and underhanded, and gets worse the higher up the chain you go. Morals are nonexistent. Expect to sell your soul in order to get preferential treatment. No work/life balance. Pay is good but something has to be in order to keep the employees from leaving. Core beliefs are a joke, especially ""trust and respect""."
bad,"Long hours. No breaks on certain jobs. Unethical management: make rules up as they go. Have some great employees, but they are not allowed.to have any input or say about jobs that they perform daily. Have no quality guidelines. Production is priority over safety at all times."
bad,"Rock Tenn seems like a great company from the outside, as well as when you first start your employment. The longer you are there though. The more you find it to be an environment of unsafe practices and run to failure by management. It is more of a culture of hiding safety and operational concerns. That production takes precedence over all else, no matter what the cost is. Both HR and management do their jobs at the opposite end of what their job titles are defined as.Leaving you with an ""you vs. them"" mentality. If you see a job opening with this company. You are better off to move along to something else."
bad,"I was judged by my appearance.  Despite my hard work, my excellent numbers, and great peer reviews, I was still terminated due to ""poor performance"".  I know that's wrong.  It's because I spoke up for myself when the GM told me I don't do my job.  I have the physical prove that I worked to my best ability.  I helped everyone with the paperwork, computer work, and still ran my own lines.  You will only get ahead if you're a man that can dedicate more than 90 hours a week to this company.  Single mothers that only offer 74 hours a week don't have a chance."
bad,"This was a great place to work as Smurfit-Stone, but after being bought, went down hill fast. We are a smaller plant, an afterthought. Constantly have trouble with paychecks, missing hours, didnt take out insurance, took double out for insurance,etc."
bad,"Used to be a good company, but they acquired a company twice their size and had lots of trouble integrating it. That company had been in bankruptcy, and many of the management from that company took over high level positions in RockTenn. Needless to say, the failed policies carried over. What was once a friendly place to work became a hotbed of rivalries and positioning."
bad,"Long days, minimal break time, with no notice one what you work until the last minute.  Work life balance is horrible, it's all work no life.  Money is the only positive to the job but considering what all you have to put up with, I don't believe it's worth it."
bad,"In my interview I was told ""it was a chance for over time"". This truned into mandatory 12 hours shifts on a rotating 1st and 2nd shift(3am-3pm for a week, 3pm-3am the next). And when voicing my option about this was told ""well you're here now so you either want the job or not""!!oh I could go on about management but to save time.....just dont work here if you want to have a family life at all"
bad,Management is horrible at Fort Worth location they do not care about your work life balance don’t recommend working there if you have a family because you will work 6 days a week every week and one holiday off
bad,"Worked with maintenance on the daily basis. Learned leadership skills. Hardest thing about the job, lack of  Communication .  Positive Had 2 great coworkers."
bad,Working at Westrock made me realize that there is bullying in the work place. Several of the women when I first started would come to me and make comments about other women that worked their and how they didn't fit. When I became friends with the woman that they did not like I was ousted from the group. I then descovered that anytime I did something instead of a co-worker bringing it to me it was turned into my boss. I did not get much training as some ot the other employees did.  It has been the worse place that I have ever worked.
bad,Good opportunity to make money.  Cutting 260 jobs starting in January after only buying the company less than a year ago.  Poorly managed company with no care for hourly employees.
bad,All the supervisor are snakes.  they have kids in charge.the lazy people get more lazy and they ran all the good people off.lazy shipping office people
bad,"Company only looks for ways to make money. Nothing to help out the employees. The reason most stay is for the pay, which is good. Bosses will always cover themselves, and never back the employees under them. Lots of drama, employees are always cutting each other's throats. I'm so blessed that I had to leave. Never thought life could be this good not working there."
bad,Factory work is often a non-glorified employment option and for good reason. WestRock will pay you a decent wage but their treatment of staff is subpar.
bad,"It could be a very nice place to work if it were not for bad management and the way people treat you. The co -workers speak down to you and have no tact."
bad,"Poor management, claims to focus on safety which sacrifices production and they will get mad for the trade off. Do not give warning just fire you! Work here only if its your last resort"
bad,"They need to fire some supervisors at WestRock of Bowling Green (formally known as KapStone). They are very easily tempered. New Hires are treated as if they know how to do the job proficiently already. A lot of yelling involved. New Hires feel pressured at all times because they aren't shown properly how to do the job efficiently. Supervisor watches youtube and/or sports videos while on the job. I thought it was because it was just a new job and I didn't know how to go about all of it, but no was there for a good 3 months and I couldn't handle the anxiety it was causing me. Hours were very inconsistent. When you get hired you are told one thing then do something else once you are working. They tell you 8 hour shifts but you work until 1 am or 3 am in the morning. They talk about safety being the number #1 thing in the factory, but hide incidents to go a whole year without reporting it to reward people for it. If things would have changed when WestRock came in I would have kept going with the job, but honestly there is a reason why they pay you well. If you can tolerate the supervisor then by all means apply."
bad,"Overtime is sometimes 6-7 days a week. You get blamed for stuff that isnt your fault. If you don’t hit rate you get talked to, and if you do well they say they wish you had done better. Pay kind of sucks unless you can get into one of the higher positions but then hours suck."
bad,"WestRock is a growing and profitable company but because of it's acquisitions is constantly eliminating positions to create synergies, which leaves little opportunity for advancement.  Those that do advance must have investment banking experience rather than operational experience.  The pay is good, but the hours are long with lots of nights and weekends."
bad,"Mandated overtime, regardless of pre-existing plans or obligations. Definitely a union shop environment when I worked there. If you didn't want to join the union, you would experience adverse behavior from the union crowd. Management wouldn't do anything about it. A bunch of feckless cowards in management."
bad,"Run at all cost, management would not back you up and they would not appreciate all the work done. The staff is cut to the bone and they keep adding new systems with out getting more help."
bad,"decent breaks. worked with machines that required a lot of maintenance. people there were nice. management wasn't that good, although my boss was very nice."
bad,"I work maintenance at westrock hopewell. We have had more than 10 people quit or turn in two week notices in the last month. That should tell you something. The company has a horrible safety record. People get hurt all the time because the company preaches safety but they don't practice what they preach. They put production over safety every time. They treat their maintenance employees like property. They treat us like they own us. It could be 3 minutes before you are scheduled to get off and they will call you and tell you to stay for ""coverage"" and make you stay for a 16 hour shift for absolutely no reason. Your family will be calling wondering where you are and you are literally sitting in a chair doing nothing but your manager won't let you leave without threat of a write up or attendance point. Every single time you walk through the gate you have no clue if you are working 8 hours or 16. One guy in operations had to work 36 hours straight with no break because he had no relief. The mill consistently operates with the bare minimum, and it shows. They have tried to eliminate the use of contractors which means maintenance is now doing construction around the mill and preventative work is no longer being done. Which is increasing downtime and causing more work in the long run. The roof had several pieces fall down at the electric shop so they put up a scaffold to guard us from falling debris instead of fixing the roof. There are support beams so rusted you can see through them in the lime kiln area so they just put some caution tape around the sagging parts of catwalk. This"
bad,Not a great plant to work at if you are a maintenance person.  Expect to work here only for a couple years due to the fact that the Plant Superintendent is a self-centered know it all.  He will take credit for your work and will lie about almost everything.  Projects are giving to you but you are not allowed any time with the machines to work on them.
bad,"There is scarce little room for advancement and each year the company is taking benefits away.  It would be much more successful if the management treated employees as the assets they are instead of liabilities.  Selection of managers is odd.  They keep or promote the people with the poorest ethical standards.  When they do promote in the management area, they usually hire friends of current management.  They rule by threats and intimidation."
bad,Hardest part of this job was trying to stay focused and continuing working while all other employees took advantage of smoke breaks and were lazy. Management wants to learn what our problem are and why their not progressing in better quality going out but don't really want to hear what's really going on doesn't deal with issues that affect the job.
bad,"Never get time off! Very unorganized, dirty, management is worth less, employees are rude! A lot of drama! Machines are old and run like carp! Very poor work enviorment! Always running like a dog. The supervisors are pervs! Tech's can't Ever fix anything they blame it on u!  This place is horrible to work for. People steal lunches tools what ever you let lay around they will take. Take my advice it's not worth the stress on Your family or body! If pay sucks after all UR taxes are taking out."
bad,"not a nice place to work.  poorly run poorly maintained."
bad,Management is horrible. Schedule is horrible. Safety is a joke. Work when you are told to work. Could work 16 and 12 hour days for more than a month without a day off.
bad,12 hour workdays  in hot humid environment                                            have had many different supervisors  the management  is constantly changing supervisors  from plant to plant shift to shift                                                                 Hardest part of job is dealing with long hours   6 days a week            Best part of job co-workers   The job itself is challenging to get everything lined up to keep production going smoothly
bad,not a good company did not care to much for there employees always wanting more for less co-workers were great management was the down fall of our shop hardest part of my job was putting up with management
bad,Westrock is very sad place to work. I have seen women cry over westrock managment scolding them like a dog. Everyone is on pins and needles at the Portland oregon westrock. The company will throw you under a bus any chance they have so be careful and trust no one. Just do your job and keep to yourself and you will be ok. other then that not a bad company to work for.
bad,Plant was bought by westrock and within a year was shutting down a machine. Mind bogglingly decided to put the two products on the machines struggling to run it. Cutting workforce down to skeleton crews to try and make it work. Almost as if to try to run the plant into the ground. Westrock took a mill just a year out from making production records and employee bonuses to a mil sputtering to get by. A terrible company.
bad,"such a negative environment and most horrible job I have ever had due to the work ethics and bad management and overall just bad vicious attitudes.  everyone that works there complains and runs the place down before the day has even begun!  no respect for each other or management and the same goes for how the management treats their employees.  terrible!  it will lure you in because the pay is good but in truth I should never have stayed there as long as I did.  Really I just should not have taken the job in the first place …. everyone there will tell you that they hate it there but they stay anyway because the money and benefits are pretty good. "
bad,"I wouldn’t work for westrock ever again. No true supervision no direction. Just keep working no real maintenance, machines are completely worn  down. They only fix  them just enough to keep running boxes."
bad,"I have worked here 6 years and they told us for all 6 years they would give us a better shift pattern, but they still have not. On top of that you will be working on average 650-750+ hours of overtime a year. That coupled with the terrible southern swing shift pattern, you will have no life outside of work. So if you hate your wife, kids, family, & friends, you will probably like this place just fine."
bad,If you want to make boxes for 30+ years then this is the job for you. Very political and not for me. Very simple work. At times can be very hot and dry due to paper facility.
bad,"I worked there for 10 months never missed a day,  never received any points for bad work and was fired by my manager for lack of integrity.  Westrock is a joke and if someone doesn't like you personally no matter how good or hard you work they fire you for made up reasons"
bad,"I personally wouldn't get a application for someone that's looking for a job because the environment is too stressful and messy . Plus the pay is the lowest in the Edwardsville, I'll. Area Management don't show support for the workers"
bad,"Talking to management (plant manager) about workplace issues was like talking to a brick wall. "
bad,I was employed for 7 months and worked overtime on a regular basis to help the company when orders were behind. Unfortunately when I had a major medical issue I was not only suspended for not being present at work but I was unable to return because I didn’t have a letter from a doctor stating I could return to full duties. The reason I couldn’t obtain that letter was because a doctor never gave me a letter to not go to work I just was in unbearable pain and called out multiple times. The company refused to allow me back to work without said letter and I lost my job.
bad,No training but expected to do the job you were assigned. Unattainable production goals set by GM. GM micromanages the entire plant. GM not trustworthy..Could be good place to work with right management.Union is a non factor at this plant. Union works with management against employees. Good ol boy mentality. No job/family time balance. Just work until we say otherwise mentality.
bad,My Experience working here was very uncomfortable. I was put in a position over a lot of older man and was very much resented for it. The older men were very inappropriate and when they were confronted about it retaliated with work accusations. The Company was under investigation and a lot of employees were let go because of this.
bad,7+ straight days of 12 to 16 hour days. You can't plan anything in your life except to work. Management is horrible and is concerned about nothing but production numbers.
bad,"This company is the epitome of a ""Good Ol' Boy"" network. The company hierarchy is totally devoid of diversity! I felt like I was in an IT VERSION of the movie ""The Help""."
bad,"Great pay but thats about the only good thing that can be said.. constant 12 hr days, no respect for your personal life. 5 mins from end of shift supervisor will randomly notify you that you have to stay 4 more hours.  Its a constant ""we need more out of you"" or ""dont complain about the hours thats why we pay you good"". Cant ever make life plans. Absolute worse job ive ever had! Im far from lazy and enjoy working and doing a good job but RockTenn has sucked the life out of me until I'm a walking Zombie. "
bad,Work you to death want you to basically live there. Treat you terrible if you don’t agree with that falousify call you a liar if you hurt yourself at work want to deter you from going to the doctors. Then terminate you when you do
bad,"Made a lot of money, because your always at work maybe that's why my wife was having an affair with a guy at her job so now I have plenty of time to be at work and I have a lot of toys too at with"
bad,"The job itself is actually fun & it gets you energized for the whole day because you have to be in by 6am , when 12pm hits the clock you gone feel ready to finish the day ."
bad,"WestRock at my Location is the the good ole boy network on Steriods.  If you Hunt, fish or are related to some one in management  you will go far. They turn a blind eye to work place harassment and treat suck up employees like Gold.  They also have no concept of work life balance,  management doesnt believe you should have a life outside work."
bad,"Management does not care about you as an employee at all. They care about covering themselves and that is it. Immediate supervisor was a good person but that was as far as it went. The point system is beyond help. You get 7 points, period, if you are sick, you still get pointed. There is absolutely NO incentive program at all. They say saftey is #1, but if your machine breaks and it cant be properly fixed, but can be made to run, you can bet you will be running it. The pay is good, hours are at least 10 per day and 8 on weekends. Very stressful and not much chance for advancement or family time. Apply at your own risk!"
bad,"Upper management was a joke. None were even qualified to be in the positions that they were in. HR used to be there to help the employees out, but not here. I wouldn’t recommend working here unless you don’t have any alternative."
bad,Worked for Westrock for a few months after being employed through Kelly Services. Job started off great but after awhile they kept telling me I was going to advance to news position and it would never come through. So I started looking for a job that would advance me for the work I did.
bad,"Lots of good workers , very few in management.Horrible schedule and forced overtime.Lots of improvement to equipment but just don’t want to treat people right.Bad work life balance."
bad,You can bend over backwards to help this company and they won't do 1 thing to help you. They are all about themselves. They give u 1 day off with your family. And switch your shift whenever they need weather it works for you or not.
bad,The company was fine but management was less then helpful failing certain job tasks with new workers and the equipment was outdated causing jams in the machines
bad,"There was plenty of work to be done, but not a lot of direction. It was ok until they acquired another company who wanted to change everything. Promises were made, but no follow through. You can’t clock in more than 1 minute late or 1 minute early. No option to take care of basic medical needs. Lots of drama, playing favorites, some managers love to micro manage. Don’t bother taking medical leave, because they make it so stressful for you to return & only let certain people return on light duty. Location is following Rex location in closing this fall."
bad,Overall it would probably be a good place for many people to work. It just was not for me.
bad,"• Inspect and examine printed products for print clarity, color accuracy,"
bad,They do not care about employees and give you 2 weeks paid vacation upon hire which they expect you to utilize for appointments etc. if you call in sick you are pointed and they are a 12 point system then termination.
bad,"cutting specialist for 8 months helped operator of cutting putting in tooling for next gave operator his breaks and lunch then went for flat packer and worked  on that for 2 months took stacks of boxes that had been cut on machine and put 0n another pallet checked for bad quality of the whole box and got samples for QC. inspecting for box was fpr the color,printing,and folds,scores"
bad,"Fired b4 my one year was up because I accrued 3 points by missing a total of 3 days. The employee handbook states that 7 points is required before possible termination. I was subsequently fired and given no warning whatsoever. Needless to say this marred an overall good experience. This facility is all about being ""world class"" yet they are far from it. Between breakdowns and all the older employees generally getting away with murder it can be hectic and frustrating."
bad,They say they care but they don’t. For making billions in revenue each year you sure think they’d be able to get a paycheck right. Management asks you to do work that’s not in your job scope and don’t care about trade lines. They say they encourage all to help in safety but unless you’re buddy-buddy with them you’ll never amount to anything. There is absolutely no growth opportunities!
bad,"The Union makes this a decent job, but the management is terrible. Poor leadership skills and a horrible atmosphere to work in make this job worth it only for the pay and benefits."
bad,The company is horrible and it won't be better until they change management and supervisors. Not a good place to work but a good place to make money..
bad,I still don't have a review for this company the manage is not the the greatest. There are simply way to many chiefs and not enough Indians the left hand never now's what the left hand is doing. Alot of the stuff we do has to be done again.
bad,Try to make machines and equipment run fast as they can sure you can do that if the machines and equipment weren't junk and out of date one idiot thinks he is the only one that operate one of these piece of junks no wonder quaility is so bad just send it out it looks good on paper need to get new equipment and probably could run better
bad,"Unload trucks test quality of paper"
bad,"The management was constantly changing things, even when things were going smoothly.  They considered it ""stirring the pot""."
bad,"at the workplace i learned how to work continuously and finish it within the given time period, make friends, etc. the hard part was to remain standing for eight hours except the break time."
bad,"Winston-Salem, NC location."
bad,"I worked ten years here and because I would not brown nose I would be passed over for raises even though my performace was above standard. 48% oee comapny standard my personal oee was 54% on six month average. Applied for supervisor position and even though I was more qualified the position was given to a good friend the department managers. Management constantly dropped the ball on safety and release schedules. The rules where constantly being bent for supervisors and managers buddies. The whole plant runs off the buddy system and they are proud of it. Good ol' Rock-Tenn of Joplin, MO. I would not recommend this company to my worst enemy to work at."
bad,i've worked there for over 18 yrs. lots of knowledge . yet need to be a certain religion/ politic party to survive ! i got over 70k  4 wrongful dismiss
bad,Just not a good place over work you and the older employees don’t like new hires and they dnt wanna give you any breaks but want you to work 12+ hours just not a place that you would be happy working at.
bad,"WestRock, era una empresa con un liderazgo ejemplar, buen ambiente de trabajo y enfocado a resultados, una vez que se contrato a un ignorante y analfabeta en un puesto clave (Gerente de Planta) todo empeoro, el ambiente laboral se torno hostil, ya no se podia confiar en nadie y ya no se reconocian los logros alcanzados con el esfuerzo diario para lograr las metas establecidas."
bad,"This company is a nightmare, I only worked 3 days before I ran! Throws a red flag when dr that gives you a physical tells you they do several physicals a week because of the turnover. At first they seem absolutely great. That’s only during orientation. Then you get the real story. I was extremely mislead on my job role...To top it off folks after I left it’s been a run around to receive my paycheck. That I’m still waiting to receive. Learn from your mistakes or take my advice"
bad,"Very disorganized with long hours on feet 12+ and 60+ week. Pay is very low and benefits are the worst I have ever had. You pay 100+ a week and the only way it covers you is if you meet your deductible of $1,300 if not than you are gonna pay out of pocket like WTH! and no sick days. Plant looks like a mess full of dust and not just light dust. LOADS of dust to get in your system to make you sick or hack through most of your shift. Everything was a lie when it came to moving up and if they do end up promoting you, you gotta convince them to up your pay to that position. This is the single most worst company I have ever worked for. Watch out for this one."
bad,"I wouldn’t recommend ANYONE to work at westrock. Very rude and disrespectful  management.  They talk down to you like your trash, don’t help and get mad when you ask for help. Very toxic & hateful place."
bad,"I got hired for day shift. and all of the sudden they wanna switch everybodys hours. people have a life and kids. not everybody can keep changing up there schedule. matter of fact i would of stayed there if my hours stayed DAY SHIFT. When we had the walk thru of the building , management NEVER TOLD ME that my schedule would rotate ."
bad,The lack of engagement and knowledge of the management staff is high.  The actual 'managers' choose to delegate their roles to employees rather than do them as they should. The employees (as they have no management experience) make decisions based on their personal agendas rather than the companies best interest.
bad,I honestly would never recommend this company to anyone for anything. There are too many things to say that its not worth the explanation. Fulfill 150 char min.
bad,U have to have a back up bc u don't never know if u going to have a job bc they will lay u off but my boss we was all abt hard work. West Rock just lay off a lot of people
bad,"I left this company after being called back to work for my previous employer. Six months after leaving this job, this facility shut down due to financial reasons."
bad,need a little improvement on management. okay security. working area is a bit sketchy. air conditioned well. lovey workers. just need more work on management
bad,loved the job just got bought out by rocktenn and after that it was deemed best to shut the plant down and divide the machines among the other plants owned. offered no one jobs but luckily got a severance package from union.
bad,Worst place in history to work. They keep getting bought out for the fact they can't keep help. Wouldn't work here if I had to. 72 hr weeks for months on end. I forgot where I lived after awhile.
bad,"No work,life balance at all. You work every Saturday no matter how well you produce during the week. Upper managenent only preaches machine speed above all else. Not safety or quality which should be first."
bad,A melhor empresa que ja trabalhei infelismente fechou a unidade aqui em barueri sp
bad,"Corporation and thinks of it's employees like a number.  No incentive to work the way they want you too, always buying companies up and adding more on everybody and not hiring any help."
bad,Worst place I've ever work for. 2 years after I left they still owe me back pay. Never got my raise or my earned vacation time paid. HR person is lazy and clueless on her position. Dekalb location is nothing but a joke.
bad,This was a warehouse job. Very underpaid for the work you are responsible to do. Extreme heat.
bad,Overall review shows company can't provide a job security.
bad,"Daily duties were as follows: Maintaining a safe work enviroment, Ensuring quality for all customers, meeting production goals, scheduling, contact with employees, keeping waste to minimum, and ensuring orders were delivered on time. I learned some basic 5s and Six Sigma principles. I enjoyed the fast paced production enviroment and interacting with people."
bad,"Rock Tenn is a good place to work. Friendly people in every department. Any questions, ask anyone. Every day is a new experience, and learning is also daily. Not a ho-hum day. Many incentives ranging from a ""bingo"" game to additional training via conference. Many large customers to please, which makes it a challenge to do the BEST!"
bad,Currently laying off 260 people and shutting down a perfectly good running machine for no explainable reason.  I don't see the mill running for no more than 5 years.
bad,"Start with  tool box which the supervisor is always late to. head to machine, set up or continue running the order. work safely. assist the machine operator on what he needs to complete the order. if you dont know what to do then you better figure it out because you have no help. the most enjoyable part of the job is pay day."
bad,"always high pressure and demeaning, toxic place."
bad,It was ok. It was ok job .but you trust anyone there. It pays ok. The job is not hard. There is no work and life balance. The benefits are ok. It better than nothing
bad,Lots of favoritism and bad Union bad hours and always overworked no family life and bat management no good benefits always working weekends and a sell-out union
bad,"There's a lack of communication, there's a total lack of respect, there's no room for advancement because of leadership, there's a high turn around rate, it's almost impossible to get a raise for a job duty that you know how to perform, the only positive thing to take away from the plant is the new general manager."
bad,Great if you know someone there and are white. if your not dont even apply. People will talk bad behind about you behind your back over the smallest things and expect Confederate flags.
bad,Unprofessional. Constant unrealistic. expectations. O ly want employees with criminal records and the turn over is crazy.. The fact they have a union makes it hard to get ahead.
bad,It is not a very good place to work the management likes to play favorites they have a double standard for certain ethenticitys they favor temps more then employees all in all it’s a sucky place to work but it’s ok as a stepping stone to something better comes along
bad,"Your typical day is busy. No standing around. No stopping until break time, you have a quota to achieve. Get pulled in office if seen talking to others."
bad,I worked at WestRock for about a year. During that year I learned a lot about the manufacturing industry that was very interesting. However the drama I dealt with took away from my experience. Very cliquey place to work. If you’re not like them you won’t fit in. One of my co workers tried getting me fired multiple times and was non successful but created a hostile work environment for me in the meantime. My direct manager was also a nightmare to deal with. I don’t suggest WestRock to anyone to work at unless they settled the drama since then. HR was the nicest people you could ever meet though. After I left they helped me with unanswered questions and during my time there they helped me with my problems.
bad,"The company is a GOOD company to work for. This just would not be my first choice, because I prefer a smaller company to work for. the jobjob is very repetitive. I need more of a challenge"
bad,"Very little support given by company leadership once you are promoted.  No regional or corporate support."
bad,It was a job but there were hardly any raises and you worked long hours with little pay and horrible insurance. If you need a job its a place to go if you are young
bad,Competitive on pre-print and high volume orders.  Poor local leadership.
bad,"Rock Tenn is a company that has no regard to there employees. Long days, no family time."
bad,"There's a saying....people leave there job due to the management, not the job itself.  Management does NOT care about you, they do not communicate with you at all, and then they turn around and expect you to read there mind.  If you are new, you are disposable. They do not care about your safety even when they say things are and will get fixed. Same issues are still present and conveyor lines are still broken after many work orders and years of waiting.  You are posted for 60+ hours a week and many times don't know if you're working a weekend until noon on a Friday."
bad,Management at westrock doesn't care if you have a life outside of westrock their main goal is to keep you working for as long as possible no exception if you can't do that you'll be telling lies and eventually terminated at times you will be forced to work 12-hour shifts without any warning he will be told this mandatory to do so so if you have no life westrock is a job for you
bad,Union sucks MAHRT still lets people do what they want. Waiver by not qualifying to the next job. Won't allow someone to medical waiver. Management will not listen unsafe working conditions at MAHRT mill
bad,"Many individuals who have been with the company for over 20 years are allowed poor attitudes and lazy work commitments.  This can also be applied to many of the managers at this facility."
bad,"way below average pay"
bad,The Richmond Plant was the epitome of nepotism and good old boy network.  This is a horrible place to work as a maintenance worker if you are not white.  If you work more than 16 hours in a day they will pay you straight time if you do not exceed 40 hours.  This is not a world class maintenance facility and they need to clean out that good old boy system before they lose a lot of customers.  I wish they bring in a corporate auditor and clean that plant up ASAP.
bad,"Not family friendly-- must be dedicated to work. No advancement. Sub par management, unprofessional demeanor in workplace. Would not recommend for the average jo to work there. Only thing enjoyable  about the job was the pay."
bad,Contract work with staffing agency. I enjoyed some of the people that i work with. However they had under went massive changes within the company & Mg
bad,"5 day a week planned work schedule turns into 80+ hours every week. No home life and they absolutely don't care about you or your personal life. I would never recommend this job to a family person. Single and looking to do nothing but work, go for it. Rock Tenn/WestRock is a good place to be from."
bad,"Westrock wasn't the best workplace ever, but it wasn't the worst. The people stands around snickering at you instead of trying to help the new people the judges them for not knowing how to do something"
bad,"N/A, no comment.  Each individual would have to experience this work environment for themselves and make their own determination."
bad,"I worked in maintenance. Military culture. Not a friendly place to work. Very very strict. The company culture cares more for the company and machinery than they do about its people. Was extremely disappointed with the position and my seniors who were suppose tt support me, instead, stabbed me in the back. A wolf in sheep's clothing. Be warned"
bad,I did not have a positive experience working for this company. The atmosphere was very negative and did not work well with my positive attitude.
bad,Pay is good. Lots of hours. lots of overtime hours. tends to get shut down frequtently though.  The general manager that was over the plant i was at had already shut down 2 other plants.
bad,"my typical day at work was horrible. smelling trash &  picking and recycling trash all day wasnt the best. the co-worker was horrible the bosses was horrible, the hardest part of the job was trying not to smell things and throw up, the enjoyable part of the job was that i got a check every weak."
bad,"Rock Tenn was a great job until they got a new GM. Our hours were cut and we were asked to complete more work with less pay. Most of the other line leaders were very ""clicky"" and it was like working in a highschool. you could definitely tell its a new company and I bet P&G pulls their contract soon."
bad,"12 hours a day 6 an 7 days aweek, they wont you live there. The work environment is very poor they wont you to put the company above your family."
bad,"As a Supervisor at Rock-Tenn for nearly 5 years I experienced so many lows that were avoidable. Plant managers there have a god complex. They do not care about their employees. Personally my position grew too much for one person to handle. I was set up to fail and was fired because I could not handle the enormous amount of work. Not once did the plant manager come to see what I needed and had asked for. Only negatives."
bad,"A grind"
bad,"RockTenn is disorganized, unsafe, with less the desirable leadership. Paper work gets lost frequently, and anything administrative takes days if not weeks to finish. The warehouse is dangerous considering that safety equipment is seldom used and extremely difficult to locate, on top of coworkers zooming past at full speed on fork lifts, and on top of that faulty equipment. Lastly the leadership has no idea what happens on the floor, or with the employees."
bad,"24/7/365 operation that worked a rotating 12 hour shift (6 to 6). The organization grew from a family owned paper mill to be owned by the 2nd largest paper maker in North America. The technicians are highly trained professionals working in a highly automated, state-of -the-art manufacturing facility. Responsibilities included the managing of a 36 person shift that operated 3 paper machines and a waste treatment facility. This included being responsible for technician and site safety, product quality, production goals, shift costs and technician training."
bad,bad place to work. decent pay but thats it. Poor management. Poor union.
bad,Mill will always have its ups and downs however there is a lot of managers that are not trouble shooters but finger pointers and actually do more harm to the environment rather than trying to keep it motivated and high spirited.
bad,Mostly a number not a name.Always watching on cameras waiting for employees to make mistakes.Lots of safety talk but no action until an injury occurs.
bad,"They are never happy with what you get done. The production goals get raised up every day. The equipment is always broken, so production is low, so we work overtime with broken equipment that does not run properly. They won't fix the machines properly only short term fixes. Everyone works excessive overtime and they go through people like crazy because of all of the overtime."
bad,"The location I worked at, silsbee tx, has an extremely high turnover rate for a reason.  Potential employees are outright lied to about working conditions during the interview.  There are no lunch breaks unless there is additional crew available on shift who know your job, which 90% of the time, is not the case.  Anyone who isn't a ""good ole boy"" need not apply as co-workers management alike will ostracize you the point of hating entering the building."
bad,"Cliquish groups that if you were new, you were left out of activities and felt unwanted.  Also impacted job performance reviews, favorites got passes when others did not.  This was just for the Transportation department, but I would NOT recommend"
bad,"Pay is decent, everything else needs improvement. Lots of mandatory overtime, average between 60-80 hours every week. Work every Saturday, and don't get time off for holidays that we are promised. Management doesn't seem to care and they make goals for production that just aren't obtainable then blame those of us on the floor when we dont achieve these goals. Don't work here unless you really need the money"
bad,"I worked here and have to say I definitely have never been so stressed and more overwhelmed with anything in my entire life. The lack of training and direction is what lead me to leave this company. I had literally 1000s of tasks dropped in my lap and was then tsk tsk’d when I didn’t finish everything perfectly. The lack of employees upstairs leads to unnecessary work for production teams. Highly mismanaged, and rude people to work with. Wouldn’t wish this place on my worst enemy."
bad,Just a bad place to work everyone’s stressed out supervisors are rude and will fire new hires for no reason you get 2 10 min breaks and one 15 for lunch but nobody follows it
bad,"It is a very poor management type of Company, with a very poor concern for your safety. The areas for you to rest are extremely unsanitary. Communication in between department is below average. When advice about a problem, they will turn around and blame issues on someone else."
bad,I've worked over 25 years in my life; never had problems till I worked here. You work with everybody from gang members to transgenders. Que sera sera.
bad,Westrock dragged my reputation through the mud and spit it out I was working hard came back from breaks early only used restroom when on breaks and they let me go due to lack of performance. I do not recommend this job I was looking to start a life from this but instead it through me down a deeper well. I hope you read before hiring thought they were nice at first too but they don't care about their workers I'm not sure they even care about their customers. Don't make the mistake I did thanks for reading my experience.
bad,"The Clinton plant used to be a fun and productive place to work. But management has made so many changes without input from the people doing the work, that an employee spends more time doing paperwork and trying to figure out the rules then actually doing the work. Pay has not kept up other plants in the area, making it hard to stay, and hard to find good new employees.  Every contract management take away more of the few remaining perks."
bad,The hours worked did not allow for a good work life balance as the scheduled rotated weekly.  The environment required you to work in the outside climate regardless of the elements.
bad,"Upper management is into to the day to day processes too much to improve employee relations. Too many hours, not enough employees to handle the peaks in the seasonal work."
bad,Culture was not the best match for me personally and what I desired in a company. Post merger the company and business plans changed and out paths drifted apart.
bad,It's a very unorganized place but it is a paycheck. Always drama and the rock Tenn employees stick their noses up at the temp workers. It's always arguing or somebody crying about another person not doing their job.
bad,"Rock Tenn is not the best job but it pays okay. Most days some workers don't want to work as hard,or as much as everyone else. The supervisor was humble and funny a times."
bad,Westrock  there is no room for advancement the GM doesn't recognize the work his employees do a bad company to work for. This company really needs help.
bad,Job starts 5 minutes early and doesn't end until all daily tasks are completed even if having to stay over.. On going training of people and improvements are the most rewarding part of the day.
bad,"Company could have been run a lot better the management did not make the job any better to advance production, a lot of employee conflicts took place due to the ""First come  first served"" mind-set of the work aera."
bad,Good for only temporary employment.No advancement opportunities offered at this time.Good workers and good communication
bad,"The hours are there no doubt in that its just the pay wasn't really worth the hours you put in. Machine operators are on there cell phones all the time letting the machine run on pure blind luck ""if it runs it runs"" while lower end people like myself get stuck cleaning the mess the machine makes. When I had a problem I could never find the supervisor it's pretty much your on your own."
bad,El salario es poco ya que te hacen muchos rebajes y no llevan un control de las horas trabajadas. Trabajas mucho y no te lo reconocen. No hay premios.
bad,"I am looking for another job at the moment but I would discourage anyone with a family of working here because it's mandatory 6-7 days a week. I have worked here for 5 years and everyday it gets worse! The management is highly inappropriate with the way they deal with situations and the language they choose to use. There is no respect and they care little for opinion! There is also way to much drama that is never taken care of properly because the management is Horrible. The job is easy and the pay isn't bad but you work a lot because they never have the machines operating properly and can't ever seem to fix them.  On another note I make as much as someone that has been there a year because they decided to up the pay but only up people's pay that weren't getting the new pay rate, so all my raises were for nothing. The raises suck also and they give everyone across the board 3% of what you make, that means it matters nothing if you are a bad worker or a good one because we all get the same raise!"
bad,coworkers fun and helpful people. Management not helpful or supportive to the workers. Loyalty is not promoted.
bad,"Typical day: Either bored out of your skull with nothing to do, or crazy busy. Shift work sucks, unless of course you enjoy that type of work."
bad,"WestRock purchased my previous company and the merger process was considerably painful and unorganized. From my short time spent with the company, I felt quite unnoticed, unheard, under appreciated, and completely pushed around causing a very uneasy working environment."
bad,The company as a whole may be good but once they purchased the Charleston mill it began a quick decline resulting in poor morale and people who intended on retiring are now quitting in droves. Middle management is not prepared for their roles and upper management has an attitude of only creating a new environment with not a single care about the employees. Stay far away from the Charleston mill.
bad,Slow paced environment.  Lack of leadership and organization.  Employees are miserable.  Claim safety is the number 1 priority but ignore  ways and suggestions of how to improve.
bad,they will work you to death and fire you for dying on the job. I was treated like a number rarely given any form of breaks during my shift. unrealistic expectations for the crews. won't work for them again
bad,"Management will preach one thing and then act just the opposite.If you speak out about an issue then you are the bad guy.Its a ""shoot the messenger"" mentality"
bad,Worked 5 ten hr. days and then 2 eights on weekend. It is a seasonal business. Not a good place for family/work balance. High turnover. Pay was ok for around here. Health Insurance was not that great. There are better places to work out there. Just have to look.
bad,You start off pretty nice and normal. You get used to the machine and know how to do everything and do your job pretty well. Suddenly your manager tells you they found something wrong and accuse you of doing it and you need to count sheets so they know it's not you. So you do what they ask and they will blame you. They will give you harsh treatment because of the color of your skin. Please dont come here!
bad,Worked my butt off for this place. A lot of days no breaks. I had a demanding position. One of the most over worked under paid positions in the company. There was no room for error with everything you had going on. lost my job because of this because of mistakes that were made sure to running around like a chicken with my head cut off. The manager over my diameter didn't care. Could tell you more about computers than the actual job.
bad,No good for the work that is done. The company only needs people for their advancement. Not for the employess to advance on their careers. The comoany used employess till they couldn't use any more
bad,"If you are someone who likes to plan for success and be prepared for disaster, BEWARE. This place only reacts to disaster."
bad,"expectation is everything for the company. local management does not feel that tenured employees are valuable. culture is good 'ol boy"
bad,"Poor, poor management! A bunch of old ladys and particular "
bad,"There isn't a short way of stating how bad Westrock Lanett, Al. is. From top management, to Leads, to employees bulling, harassment  and lies. Tears being bought upon many faces. Cut downs and disrespect making front of and picking on people. Special treatment for some employees. Causing stink to get others fired. Favoritism of employees making them not having to do the job as others are required. "
bad,"I worked at WestRock Mississauga for two years. The overall experience was horrible, management does not listen to employees on subject matter that they have no idea about. The actual employees besides management is great but they work every one like slaves."
bad,"I like a lot of the hourly employees I work with.. We work together for the most part. Now as for the salary members.."
bad,Can you take responsibility for what they do as a company or as management don't give the right training people need to operate machines they overwork you they also pick and choose who are their favorites not people that do their job correctly when was passion
bad,Communication is terrible. No work life balance to speak of. You never know what you will be working for a shift from week to week they have know problem just switching your shift around without letting you know till the schedule comes out of Friday. Expected to do the work of 2 people most days.
bad,you be hired as a temp with lots of promises and let go when production slows down and goes back to 8 hour shifts. Westrock ajax has not hired one temp since becoming westrock in july 2015
bad,production goals are unachievable for the most part. favoritism by management is commonplace. poor scheduling results in a lot of unnecessary overtime.
bad,7 day rotating swing shifts make it impossible to have a proper sleep patter and be able to have any life outside of work. you have no scheduled breaks so learn to eat on the fly the cooperation only cares about the cooperate dollar.
bad,"Mgmt. out of control, needs a union. self managed work force is what they tell you when hired, then you find out you have no say in anything. HR. dept. is the most inhumane I have ever worked with. Lied to all of us the whole time I was there. Benefits taken away almost yearly. Paid good, but it will wreck family life. Sorry, but honest."
bad,Management doesn't really care about employees; just want to make money.  Not really a team environment even though that's what I was told when hired.
bad,"Wellness program offered to reduce employee cost. Compensation is fair. Management is very close to eachother. A pretty ""clicky"" work environment."
bad,"I don't have many nice things to say about the company except the pay and the benefits are decent. There are some great people working there, but the management team is simply awful."
bad,This company go Too big too fast. Everyone's afraid to make decision. An the communication is beyond horrible. More concerned with buying and merging then running what they already have.
bad,"Lots of capabilities at several facilities around the country.  One of the largest in the packaging industry.  Very focused on 6 Sigma, Salesforce.com, etc."
bad,the pay is pretty good but not a good job for a family person. they require a lot of over time and as many as 15 12 hour days worked straight.
bad,Ultimately you are graded and rated on the quality of product you produce for your Customers.
bad,I worked for RockTenn 12 hr night shift for 13 years. I was a glue line operator with a production record on my machines that was either #1 or #2 in the plant. I had NO negative job performance evaluations nor any customer complaints. A complaint was filed against me that upon reworking the job we discovered evidence that the customer was at fault not us. The customer rejected this because of numerous other quality  complaints that year from all across the spectrum claiming a loss of faith in our facilities management and it's ability to maintain its contractual obligation to customer satisfaction thru quality. The customer demanded that management do something to show they were commited to quality. Their answer to appease the customer was to trump up a perseption of me of questionable quality ethics and fire me. Management had always said quality first but had always made desisions to run questionable quality products with the hope of being able to slip it by the customers notice. This resulted in a culture in management where they were more interested in getting product out the door and less interested in customer satisfaction. They work 12 hr shifts. They do not give sick leave or excuse absence from work unless FMLA is approved by a third party company that only management can deal with. They only give 4 days a year of vacation and that can only be taken subject to approval. Every poor management decision is blamed on the production personell. It is a company that has grown to fast in recent years and is headed for a serious down fall soon. They do pay very good but the
bad,"RockTenn once was a great place to work. But a few years ago, it hired a new HR manager that has everyone working in constant dispondency and disquietness. There is a lack of human dignity toward workers and most of the best workers are leaving. The atmosphere is offensive and everyone is unhappy."
bad,This job requires the ability to work in an extremely hot environment. Hourly workers are great but mangement is lacking. They expect your life to revolve around them.
bad,"At Westrock its very fast paced, stressful, managers don't care how hard you work. They just want to do things right and the "
bad,"Variety of tasks to perform, yet the department was usually understaffed.  Opportunities to advance in various departments, relaxed dress code. Online learning available."
bad,Guys on floor attitude was distasteful toward upper management. Pay was good but disregard the idea of a life or to make plans. If you need a job for it. You want anything additional. Be weary!
bad,"Very stressful, management was poor  was put with fighting and people not wanting to do their jobs. was having some people that you could get along with. How things where packaged and the way the had to be stacked."
bad,"be prepared to work 6 days a week most of the summer, if your relief calls in you have to stay an additional 8 hours, mandatory OT, machinens break or quit running daily and need maintenance to come work on them."
bad,Worked for WRK for quite some time and management was so laid back to the point of almost being disconnected. There was no career goals in place for advancement. The VOLUME of work required to process within the timeline is a vicious cycle of being on a hamster wheel. The pay for the role is GROSSLY off the mark compared to other companies in the area!! Management is not real manages; just bullies!
bad,I would not recommend this place to anyone. They treat the line workers like slave for only $8 a hour. They get rid of people that show care about the job.
bad,Great pay and as much overtime as you want overall it was great place to work and has a very friendly environment but the management was horrible with a lot of decisions
bad,This was the sorriest place i ever work for.They treat you like you are still in school.The people are back stabbers.I would not recommend anyone to work here.They need to fire all management.
bad,They closed the plant even though it was profitable to save a buck.  We hit all of our goals and now we have to find a new job after 30 years.  They care more about making an extra dollar than there employees.
bad,"WestRock, as a whole is a good company with a significant market presence. The company grows its market share through acquisition, but fails to invest in infrastructure of older plants. Regional management is under tremendous pressure to meet production quotas, but given very little support in order to accomplish this. Old, tired equipment is pushed beyond its capability and employees operating the equipment are held responsible. Employees are asked to maintain a high level of plant cleanliness in a production facility that was shoe-horned into a World War II warehouse building that quite literally hasn't had any upgrades since the 1950's."
bad,Because of the mean workplace clique at Westrock it cause the company to have a mean hostile work environment.  The SAD part is that Management and HR promotes this type of culture.  The overall toxicity of the place is just plain gross.
bad,Very Long hours usually 12.5 hour days you will be forced to work overtime. There re a few great employees that make it a decent place to be. Low level management is horrid
bad,Poor management. They do not follow through with plans. All employees are rated together. If one person does something wrong; they do not address the issue with that person but include ALL employees. Good employees are treated just like the less efficient ones.  If you do not go along with the managements ideas or voice your opinion about an idea; they say you are being negative. Not much chance for advancement.  There is a BIG difference between the office staff/management and the production floor.  This is the first place I have ever worked that management/ office staff think they are better than the production employees. Different rules apply to that side of the wall
bad,"The job itself isn't too bad, standard plant job. High heat, consistent work, repetitive. The union side is fine, the company and local management is poor and doesn't care about you as a person or your family. Work first, work always. Good money."
bad,"There are multiple facilities and the standards, policies, and rules for one facility do not transfer well over to others.  The production facility has secure entrances and key card entries while other facilities are left completely unsafe for employees.  They expect the second hand facilities to stick to all of the rules of the high end production facility for starters."
bad,"Will doom this company.  Everything is cost based at the expense of employee development. The culture is driven out of Atlanta and the management there is interested in operating as if they are solely a north American based company, not a global one."
bad,"Part of a failed Division no longer in existence.  Market had been shrinking for many years and Division was losing money consistently."
bad,"Although the Management was nice and communicated well, the stress level was extremely high. But I was able to learn how to use a clamp Forklift. thank you."
bad,This is a fast paced production facility shipping 100 million sqft each month. We are currently shorthanded and have been working 12/hr days since January. There is a great turnover at this facility which is impacting our quality.
bad,I personally was ok working here even though it was swing shift and after a while it becomes stressful because your body can't adjust and your always tired and have little family time.
bad,"The culture is very weird. There is no true training plan, communication structure of comradery. Everyday is a robotic function of changing your tail and passing the buck. They aren't flexible on scheduling and regardless of who gives the ""ok"" be careful bexause somehow someway it will come back to bite you and not them."
bad,"I have never worked for a more inconsistent company before in my life. I have spent just a little under 3 years unsure of which shift and what my 12 hour schedule will be for the next week because of an under staffed crew and ""high demand"" for the product.  Anytime you would bring up an issue with safety, production, your schedule, or anything that creates an upset condition the only reply you hear from the leadership is ""its part of it"" and thats typically the end of the conversation.be prepared to work 6 days a week with very little family time. We have a union but it is fairly weak and doesnt do the employee much benefit as far as protecting their rights via contract"
bad,This mill has a lot of issues. They have a lot of great people working for them but they do not have the management backing to make the changes needed. I enjoyed my time but I was happy to leave.
bad,RockTenn was a hard place to work...when they change systems they give you a drop dead date and expect you to stick to it no matter what. If there are system issues and you need time there is no wiggle room. When it fails you are hung out to dry.
bad,I really like working at west rock but got layed off after a month working there. But I was working threw a staffing place but everything I had to do at west work was very easy.
bad,"Pay is very good.  Home/work balance is not there at all.  You can be getting ready to leave and end up having to work 4 over.  If you're maintenance, you will most likely be working 7 days."
bad,"Made a lot of friends there.  Made up mostly of a bunch of college kids so there was a lot of clowning around to go with the work, which was hard when things were rolling.  Burned to death in the summer in 140 degree trailers and froze to death in winter."
bad,"Worked for this company for 11 years as a padlock er operater. When they purchased 2 robot arms, I was fired, stating I made a bad barcode. This company is a "" good Ole boys"" company and treats associates like they were puppets on their string. Seen supervisors that had been there for 20 plus years get demoted simply because they were aging and wanted them to quit. Management sucks. If you are not willing to brown nose, you will not succeed at this company."
bad,"Manager a team of 7 load planners who execute tenders for both inbound and outbound freightr (approx 900K shipments per year)"
bad,"Getting lines ready for production, read daily sheet for product. Doing beginning and end counts. rework products that didn't go thru. Manage lines of 13 to 18 people."
bad,(MFG Manager) created a culture and environment filled with unethical practices and unsafe situations. He was a left over from Smurfit Stone Container. In May of 2013 RockTenn upper management terminated him which is a turn in the right direction.
bad,A typical day at work was showing up hoping to be needed to work for the day and cleaning up around the factories.  Management was rarely seen throughout the day.
bad,"Fast pace, always changing, work envoirment fun and relaxing."
bad,it was a cut throat place to work with no communication its a job i wish i would never had taking
bad,The job has gotten more difficult to preform with the new temp service. The pay does not reflect the job. Many confrontational temp service workers. They are unwilling to preform their duties.
bad,"Workers were great for most part except for the typical back stabbing that a few are always gonna do.The upper management is an absolute joke,The top man is a liar,sleeps with employs matter of fact his wife left him because he was found out,oh and the ethics line they have to report such offences they are investigated by his own secretary who is as useless as he is."
bad,"Management is horrible 6 day work weeks, and a lot of 12 hour shifts on occasions..They need to have 4 shifts to be able to run 24-7 like their trying to get out of 6 days...Employee moral is very low. They pay very well but you're to tired to enjoy with 1 day off...I worked there 17 years and 11 months, management has made it a very miserable place to work..."
bad,"terrible management communication skills! No training and the employees on the floor that have been there for years offer no help. Management tends to overlook what's going on. After 6 weeks on the job I finally called it quits because it was not getting any better. "
bad,"Was hard to be a woman in printing for 19 years it was A night mare almost daily I worked harder then half men in the dept but never was credited been laid of called back two times could run the press just as the men did I was good trouble shooting problems but never good enough for management after the third lay off I finally had the choice to get out I did good money bad management       "
bad,"WestRock overall is a good company and advancement from within is preferred. They invest heavily in their employees skills and expanding their abilities however, the work life balance is not there."
bad,very poor relations between management and hourly. not flexible hours. very strict on some people and very relaxed on others. very unpredictable work schedule.
bad,"They will work everyone 72 hours a week and expect it week after week. They will work you 4/6 Saturdays, and the union can not do any thing to stop them. Management was promoted by a friend of a friend all the way up, machines were old and beaten. Maintenance was poor, facility upkeep was poor, working conditions were poor, the culture was horrid and unsafe, yet they claim to be ""safe"""
bad,Westrock is a stressful atmosphere. Good money but very stressful. The culture is very down. The management doesnt take advice well. the workers are very cool and fun. Too many hours. They dont value family time.        .                                                                           .
bad,"This is a company that will tell you one thing and demand another.  When joining this company it was like a breath of fresh air I thought the work life balance and flexibility to work from home was wonderful.  Thought they cared for their employees and their wellbeing.  Though after a few months of working their and being lied to by a few ""face"" people for the company stating they were relocating departments back to headquarters things quickly changed.  You could not get a straight answer from anyone in the company nor who you could trust or depend on for support.  You quickly realized you were on your own and had to fend for yourself because at that point the company was for themselves and so was a majority the management and upper management staff."
bad,Been here this 17 yrs and have seen them come and go... It use to be a fun place to work until management and the company being sold made it hard ...I just do my best and work safe and look out for others.. it's time for a change... I look forward to hearing from you
bad,"High worker expectations for unreliable equipment operations.  High paced manual labor with very little training/assistance on a regular basis.  Employee general attitude is ""keep up or get out.""  Paper cuts daily.  Ink....ink everywhere.  Pay can be worth it depending on the crew you work with and union benefits were nice.  Oh, forced overtime was abundant."
bad,"Company has good pay/benefits, but not a lot of diversity or equality for all employees. Management doesn't listen to the union and the union doesn't take immediate action when needed."
bad,It's a paycheck is all I can say you don't get to have a life outside of work because someone is all ways quitting or calling out and your stuck on 12hrs most of the year
bad,Rock-Tenn is slow kind of unorganized not much work easy days. people some but not all are rude and very disrespectful. I learned that sometimes in life you will have to suck up your pride to take care of the important things.
bad,"Good Company overshadowed by bad management. Operations Supervisor and Warehouse Manager are overbearing and make a good job bad with micromanagement, bad people skills, undereducated in thier roles, and disrespectful nature make this tandem bad for business. Employees have complained to upper-management but it falls on deaf ears even though the plant is suffering profit-wise, and with employee morale. "
bad,"Basically you work hard.... Average run of the mill ""sweatshop""... Hardwork and average pay...I worked on a sheeter. I started as a temp for three months, went permanent and spend three months on nights. Then maybe ved to permanently to dayshift. High turnover of people is a huge issue too."
bad,"RockTenn was a decent company to work for, for a short period of time. On the production floor you were promoted (or held back) based on a time and hierarchy system that was outdated. Some people that were capable of moving up quickly, were held back by the system. Management believes if you aren't moving up, you aren't of value. There is some favoritism, but at the end of the day, even though there are a few managers who care about you as a person, the business is built to treat you as a laborer, nothing more."
bad,"Most of the Smurfit-Stone folks in place at the time RockTenn bought us out are gone.  And not by choice.  They came in with the idea that they were able to buy us because the rank-and-file employees were doing there jobs wrong.  The old Smurfit-Stone management team, the guys who actually did things wrong got $100 million to leave.  The rest of us got the shaft."
bad,"I never worked at any company with as bad a work environment as Rock-Tenn's!  Several times I was asked by management what I thought was the cause of the mechanic shop's bad atmosphere (EVERYONE knew how the mechanics were stabbing each other in the back) - I have to specify 'mechanics' because, incredibly, despite them earning very good money (FAR better than the machine operators), they were all disgruntled, miserable people. Vying to be 'top mechanic', they didn't respect the lead mechanic, would sabotage his efforts and talk behind his back.  No information was shared (for instance second shift would have no idea of problems encountered by first shift). Mechanics were even stealing other mechanics tools!!  The lead mechanic didn't help matters because he would give all the 'important' jobs to two workers who deemed themselves 'the A team', even though they were nothing special (other than being there longer): they pressured him to maintain their 'special relationship' by the unspoken threat of leaving him unsupported when they would be needed most: with the big jobs that they had done together previously, basically locking themselves into a permanent preferential status! Noone was smart enough to see this for what it was, a gang mentality.  The plant manager NEVER came into the work area so he only heard the opinions of the supervisors, some of whom were real 'haters' and who certain mechanics had learned to deviously manipulate. At first I didn't understand all this but eventually I realized that MANAGEMENT itself was to blame, advocating a turn-in-your-coworker policy:"
bad,"I was required to work long hours, no less than 8 hours per day and many 12 hour days. Training was sub par, management had very little compassion for the employees. Some co-workers were pleasant to work with and some were completely oblivious to other workers."
bad,"Trop de changement de management à l'interne avec des gens qui n'ont pas rapport à l'industrie. Vieux équipements de production, les défaillances sont nombreuses et le budget de réparation pas à la hauteur des ambitions de l'entreprise."
bad,"standard Americanized company where employees are numbers. The company never felt stable the entire time I was there, even after we came out of chapter 11 and were very profitable."
bad,When I started at Rock-Tenn Conway it was not only a great place to work but the management really cared about the people. In the nearly 13 years I was with the company it has grown exponentially and with it has come a high degree of corporate mentality in the leadership. The company stopped promoting from within and started hiring from outside into management. Decision making in plant management is one of self survival and not at all based on right and wrong. My fellow co-workers for the most part were great people. The pay and benefits are good. The best part of the job was that it allowed me financial security to give my family the quality of life I feel they deserve. The worst part of the job was seeing management do wrong to good people at times and being powerless to stop it or change their minds.
bad,Management team just runs in circles with no real clue as to where they are going or how to get there.
bad,Management is terrible key on paper orders.  No planning and scheduling. Preach safety but don’t follow though with it.  Supervisor change over is regular. Salary jobs to demanding for the pay.  Have hour personnel doing management work cause management being hired are kids.
bad,"Favoritism,  horrible Union,  lazy workers with zero respect for the company.  Terrible culture.  Certain rules only apply to certain people.  Not a good work/home life balance due to the scheduling."
bad,"Long hours 6 and 7 days a week , maintenance works all holidays. Upper management just riding time out and pushing employees till they can go to another company and make more money. "
bad,"Don’t trust management, watch your back, do not recommend to anybody. Would never refer for anybody or anything to ever work there. You get chewed out for clocking in 13 minutes early, but can stay 2 hours over no problem, go figure."
bad,"If you like working 6 days a week 12 hours a day being treated like a dog this place is for you."
bad,If you into the buddy system than this is your place.  Not what you know but who. Not any printing knowledge in the management.  Allowing new operators to control department
bad,The worse printing company I worked for! You lived at that place no time for famous friends. To many mandatory overtime days. Some coworkers were cool others had attitudes
bad,"Was not given clear instructions by management as to my role, then critiqued harshly when I did not fulfill expectations. My boss was very passive aggressive and narcissistic, and was more concerned with her own career than guiding or helping those under her in any meaningful way."
bad,"I worked for WestRock for over 30 years and they treated me and every other employee I knew as if we were expendable numbers. I don't know why I expected at least an acknowledgement from management that I was retiring, when I received nothing more than a final paycheck. I would not recommend anyone start a career at this company. It changed ownership multiple times while I was there, and the management only ever got worse. My department received a Christmas ham every year as a ""bonus"". The fact that it was a pork product speaks to the lack of diversity and culture of upper management and the region we live in. Not all religions eat pork-- in 2018, for a company of 10000 employees, it feels tone-deaf to the outside world. I'm glad I'll never have to set foot on their premises ever again."
bad,"warehouse manger sucks, if you have a problem she don't want to deal with it she would rather you take care of it even if it is with a co worker she picks her favorites and they do no wrong 1st shift does no wrong and the other 2 shifts don't do any thing she don't hold anyone accountable for their actions the only time she wants to act like a manger is when she gets in hot water "
bad,westrock works too many hours 9-10 hour days plus sat and sundays. you have no life outside of there. you are too tired to do anything. the benefits are good. the hourly pay is ok but they raised us all to the same amount doesnt matter how long you worked there. then gave us small raises to seperate us.  the management has no idea what to do and how to do it. they are far behind on all the jobs and then work you to death to make up for it
bad,Typical day is very demanding and challenging. Usually no operational organization which leaves the employees to suffer. The left hand does not communicate to the right hand at this organization.
bad,very stressful place to work. Good pay for area but horrible hours and schedule if you are on night shift.  Some real jerks work here. High stress. Heartless place.
bad,"Process questions were taken as challenges, not a collaborative atmosphere. Incestuous industry, industry experience trumped everything, if you didn't have 20 years in the industry they didn't want to hear your ideas."
bad,Plant was ran by a tyrant who did not seem to care about the workers on the floor. Union president was also working with management instead of the union brothers and sisters
bad,Westrock pays decent for the area but with the stress and union conflicts it doesn't pay to work there. You work long hours to not have a choice on what shift you work or how many hours you work.
bad,"The company as a whole is not too bad. The other employees were easy to work with. I didn't mind the job at all, but the company did not care about their employees, only the business. Also, union was not very strong and therefore we often worked without a contract."
bad,"When hired I was informed that the job is 8 hours a day Monday through Friday occasionally working a weekend. After having worked for this company, I learned that you have to work until the next shift decides to come relieve you from your post (which is not always 8 hours) and you occasionally received a weekend off. Only certain individuals are held accountable for their actions. Example: Some employees can come to work late every single day and no one says anything to them about it. On the other hand another employee shows up late to work on occasions with proof that they could not avoid doing so and be reprimanded for it."
bad,"Westrock is a decent place to work, though it has some quality issues with its products that create situations where last minute schedule changes interfere with work life balance. Need a little improvement on management.All I can say you don't get to have a life outside of work because someone is all ways quitting or calling out and you're stuck on 12hr shift."
bad,A fast moving environment where the line lead constantly push the employees to worker faster in a really loud and hot work place. It a really tiring and physical demanding job.
bad,This is a terrible company to work for.  No steady work. They lay u off all the time. Then when they lay u off they say it's your responsibilty to call once every 3 months. Which I think is unfair. I mean if you lay off a employee shouldn't the company call you back when they need you? I think it's a poor excuse to fire some one. If you have a family to feed this may not be the company to work for.
bad,Management changes frequently but overall ok to work. Hours a are reasonable. Product assembly can be tideous but overall personalities are great on second shift
bad,"Good atmosphere for workers,but could have better benefits as far as health insurance.Would be better place to work if they had three shifts instead of two.Overtime was a plus as well"
bad,It's a job. Maintenance tech. Required overtime. To much for me. The job is good. Is challenging. It's just all of the required overtime and a required to work weekends sometimes c for weeks in a row.
bad,"I showed up 30 minutes early to every shift I was scheduled for. Stayed over when needed. Came in early when needed. Never had an issue with a single foreman I worked under, until my final week when I was working under a trainer, and the foreman took her word over mine, because they were ""friends"". got suspended the next day and terminated a week later without an official reason. They also wont let me back on site to collect my personal belongings."
bad,"Typical work day- 12 hour shifts standing on cement all day.  Every day you come in you try and run the most production you possibly can while ensuring a high standard of quality and safety while doing so."
bad,"ran machine, help other when needed.  Did not learn to much.  Management was not that great.  To many lazy people and the manager would turn the blind eye.  Got along with most of the employees, but to help one to many time."
bad,"The part of this job that I enjoyed the most was the planning, scheduling and successful execution of a well devised plan. The hardest part of the job was the constant break in of work that was a result of a mill that had not been tended to properly for many years."
bad,The setups were way to repetitive. Skills that were acquired through other means weren't appreciated. The salaries were low and very difficult to advance.
bad,"If you are fresh out of college looking for a steady check this is the job for you! "
bad,"Work environment limited heating and air conditioner"
bad,"the plant will shutdown and leave you stranded, there is rally no team work, and their is no training what so ever for new hires"
bad,"They work the dog  out you you. they even have a quote that it GOD first, then rocktenn and then your family comes last"
bad,ROCKTENN is a company that has a great benefits package. That is really the best part about this company. I feel management could be alot better more people friendly and understanding. The 6 years i have been employed with them i have learned alot about the profession. Advancement with company is not great the opportunities are little to none.
bad,"RockTenn works long hours and is currently going through a restructing process. They will be closing my plant on April 7, 2012"
bad,There’s no set schedule 12 hour shifts all the time  management favors certain people they also are short staffed and very little sick time and vacation time
bad,The office and design team culture was the best experience in my design history. The constituents of the design location contributed a diverse range of resources in a supportive environment.
bad,"Sorry Management "
bad,The management team is racist and they lack the knowledge of being a supervisor.i hate their is no job opportunities at that place and it's a place where you have to know someone to advance
bad,I have been working here as a temp through a temp agency for three years and can't get hired on full time. The type of job I perform and the duties I complete daily are not worth the pay.
bad,the tax department had to pull together information necessary to complete their tasks.  Systems should have been put in place to make the necessary information easily accessible.
bad,"West rock would bot let you advance further. They put bids up for jobs and if only one person applied, they would not pick that one person most times. They short your checks all the time. Office person fights with you and switches what days pay days fall on . When they short youoney, it takes over a month to get that money back most times"
bad,"Worked for company for more than 3 decades. Tried to transfer/move to 5 other locations so I could continue to work for WRK, but none needed my services. Left and went to work where they care about their employees. Even talked with CEO, said he would follow up with me, Four months and still haven’t heard from him. Not paid for vacation and promised things, that they didn’t do. You would think they cared more."
bad,"For an 8 hour shift you get no lunch. It's hard labor, which I wouldn't mind if the people were nice, I got a lunch break, or I was getting paid more."
bad,"Factory work. Quality is #1important item, then Production then safety. Company preaches about safety being the #1 priority but if you ask anyone who works there they will say otherwise."
bad,A typical work week there is at least 6 days and sometimes 7. Management does not care about you or your family it is all about the bottom line. The plant is not tempature controlled and will get in an excess of 120 degrees in the summer.
bad,"I have seen so many people come and go in 9 years its insane, for a good paying job they have lots of turnover, mainly due to terminations. Every new manager fires everyone below them. 9 managers in 9 years. I was hiding in a closet."
bad,"This company is growing and learning. They are at minumum 20 years behind leading industries. At the Conover plant they are just starting ""Performance Excellence"" There's no excuse for a company this big to just now realize the positive influences that this training can bring. I was dissapointed in the fact that the years of training I had from another company was of no value. They said ""We start everyone at $12 per hour."
bad,"Empresa tem tudo e muito mais pra ser um das melhores na região, mas deixa a desejar com colaborador."
bad,"At Westrock, it is very hot environment. If someone calls off, you have to cover for them with no notice. Pay is ok, but working 12 hour days, 5 days a week can get to you."
bad,Poor communication and lack of training is an on going culture within this company. No work consistency its constantly guessing what you need to be doing and when.
bad,"WestRock senior management is more interested in saying yes to their clients, no matter how unreasonable the request, then paying attention to the career growth and well-being of their employees.  Understaffed and overworked are the two guarantees at WestRock."
bad,The company has a poor point system. Some of upper management are not too friendly. The work environment is not comfortable. The pay is good. 12 hour days are not for me
bad,"The job itself was an awesome experience. They reward you for great work, IF they like you. You can be the best at what you do but it wouldn't matter if at least one of the managers disapproves of you. A few employees are racist and sexist. They will under pay you if you are not aware of circumstances."
bad,The company was very stressful to work for. Too many people in management. We never knew when we were working or not. Last minute overtime at the end of the day. Too many managers and too many people in charge telling different things to do and different ways of doing it
bad,Be ready to work in cold and hot conditions. Greta pay and overtime pay. They push you to work as hard as you can and always want more and more out of you. Great pay with great overtime.
bad,Good jobs just long days.......Decent money! Hot Hot Hot all the time!!!! Benefits are expensive but what ain't these days!
bad,They will hire ANYONE this is a first come first serve job.  they also do have any type of benefits for employees.  wouldn't recommend working here unless nothing else is available
bad,"Pros"
bad,Major national accounts to maintain workflow. Limited opportunity for advancement within
bad,One of the things I enjoy most is learning something new everyday. I get to work with my hands mostly everyday which somedays are challenging. I think the hardest is being focused and trying to learn every detail of the machine as much as possible.
bad,"This company requires mandatory overtime six days a week, twelve hour shifts after 30 day probation period, has a good union but physically exhausting"
bad,its ok if you are just starting off in life its basically a starter job as long as you stay to yourself u will be ok aand just do your job you hay be hired on perm
bad,"the day consists of ordering supplies and tracking packages from a requisition to a purchase order.  followup on parts and supplies as where they may be, and making sure they get received in the system"
good,Loved my job. Employees managed through third party. Very Poorly.  Superiors passed responsibility down the line. Affected end result. On site employee opinion and input ignored.
good,The management make the job horrible because if you not part of the good old boy system your life and reputation will get destroy. I must say that not everyone is bad just certain managements group.
good,"It was a very fast paced environment. Orientation on the line was 15-20 min, and was expected to know everything. rushing to get work done. Sometimes the belts stop working on the line and was sent home."
good,"Expectation is 12 - 16 hours per day 7 days a week with no extra compensation."
good,do not recommend working for rock tenn most enjoyable part of job was leaving for the day. there was no structure to a work day or management
good,It was a job. Not much of an opportunity for advancement as they do a lot of external hiring. Pay not that great for the work done or time on job.
good,Not a good place too work very stressful not good job security very poor help and very poor management they don’t help just poor help all around and they just don’t help
good,Not too much to really say. Worked a lot of overtime from the summer of 2013 to the early spring of 2015. There was a lot of 7 day work weeks.........
good,It was a very quick paced work environment. It was very business like and professional. Nice people very hardworking & personable. But not really a career job for me.
good,The job is kind of easy. The people that work there is very messy. The supervisor has there pick and chooses. The job can be very stressful. If you have kids this is not a place to work at. You won't have time to do nothing that you need to do.
good,"it was a great work,i had left from there for baxter. i really miss working in the co-workers and challenges. enjoyed going to work everyday."
good,The daily routine was good because we got to switch around working in a different machine everyday.  I loved working with my co- workers they are such good people. I really enjoyed working there because the day would go fast.
good,Was good work poor management really enjoyed the work up until the end good work experience learned a lot of thing over and and had a good time while I was their
good,"This company talks a lot about safety and protecting their employees. Several forklifts were being operated without horns, broken lights and horrible leaks. Some machines were with broken buttons, parts and were bypassed by an object to keep machines going to complete customer orders."
good,"Great place to work."
good,"It’s hot and fast paced work place "
good,"Excellent workers, but emphasis on production numbers create a hostile environment. Employees spend too much time worried about getting in trouble, i.e afraid to go use the bathroom. Supervisors are not to be found, unless to cover their behinds. Cliques have developed between department and refuse to help each other."
good,"A typical day I would print off reports, scan them to emails, and give them to the GM. As well as entering deliveries and orders into the system. Answering phones and directing their calls. Handling the switch board as well as emails and 2nd phone. Management was pretty good to an extent. There were a few that should not be in the position of management. My co-workers and customers were the main light of my day. I enjoyed them and they're very helpful. The hardest part would definitely be the differences of opinions in certain situations. The most enjoyable part of my day was helping my fellow co-workers."
good,A typical work for me was coming in at 8 a.m. get a cup of coffee and log into my computer and pay invoices or get together reports til lunch time. Then after about an hour lunch I would go back to my desk and work on the same thing til 5.
good,"Co encourages lying, back stabbing, chauvinistic, games"
good,change safety all the time. they will put a person on 12 hour shift for as long as they want.
good,"Management is poor"
good,"Plant closed after years of hard work. Fast pace, warehouse was totally remodeled just before closing plant.  Hundreds of great workers were displaced."
good,"A empresa possui ótimos benefícios, entretanto o ambiente é extremamente pesado."
good,It's a good place for temporary work but it's not a good place for long term. There are really no good benefits and it's just not a really good place that you can actually make a career out of
good,I know someone that got fired for asking my supervisor a hypothetical question on if I was late or missed work due to a fender bender within they first 90 days.
good,Too many chiefs in the office. Plant manager refuses to hold individuals accountable for the way they treat others. Plant is hot in summer. Poor use of money.
good,You get paid ok. You are required to work up to 16 hr days with no lunch no breaks . You get vacation days but work with no days off for months at a time. losing your days off in the summer every year.
good,"Would be a great place to work, (Westrock-Bridgeview) if they weren't so content with the ""revolving door"" culture they have going on there. Upper management is out of touch when it comes to workers having families and lives outside of work. Working 6days, 12 hour shifts is pretty common there, and finding relief can be almost impossible! Can go MONTHS on that schedule. Floor ""supervisors"" are the biggest joke there! (Excludes a few) No sense of leadership, quick to rip you a new one for any small mistake, but never take blame for their mishaps. They have no real sense of what it's like dealing with people, and have the attitude that we should be grateful to have a job there. They are never really on the floor, and come out of office every 2hours to sign off on their floor sign in sheet, then disappear when for another 2 hours. Don't you dare call them on the radio if something goes wrong, they hate that! For a job that depends on quality, they will not achieve that until they end that culture that everyone can be replaced. Too many new people to train, too many mistakes to be made. I miss the job and the people, but management makes it impossible to work there. "
good,Some managers are really involved in their dept's but most are not. Communication here sucks and everything is a secret. Moral seems to always be low.
good,Long hours.  No life.  7pm until 7am plus overtime.   Little management support.  No sitting.   Short breaks.  Benefits were not great
good,"A typical day for me consisted of spotting rail cars finding a supervisor to see which car recive what kind of baled material which could consist of newspaper,occ,magazines,ppe,etc...while weighing every bale I guess doing this everyday was ok everything else sucks no team players pay was horrible 10 cent raise every year supervisors we're fair it's just workers ran the plant telling bosses what they ain't gone do the place just wasn't organized I guess looking back now we got paid what we were worth"
good,"Its a great job some times the leads can make your day a little rough for the most part its great. setting up next jobs, trouble shooting, quality inspecting co workers are some of the best team players ,copy changes are hard some times I really enjoy sending out great product and making our numbers."
good,good coworkers  some of the management should not be their  the hardest part of the job is working shift work. always getting laid off
good,Little opportunity for advancement and a work/life imbalance.  Most workers quit within 6 months.  No rewards for good work.
good,"Having the changes to sho what a harder worker and line leader I am, showing respect for my workers and meeting new people"
good,"Ehhh, I worked at westrock, formally Rocktenn, for years exactly. It was a DECENT experience. Management was trash as far as getting things fixed. The pay was good BUT, if someone on your machine from anothetr shift goes on vacation, quits or gets injured, you are stuck on overtime. More money is good but with the added stress of the job, you eventually end up tired and wanting it to be over, no matter how much cash you are making. The attendance system sucks very very very bad. You only get 7 points so DO NOT GET SICK ( sounds crazy right? ). If you call off that is 2 points. If you call off SICK with a doctor's note then you can take up to three days off and only get 1 point. The only thing that made the job bearable was the employees."
good,"I started working at westrock when they were originally named Rocktenn.  I would not recommend this company unless you are only looking for something temporary or just don't care about being taken advantage of. Management had meetings all day, and yet still had the worst turnover rate I've ever seen at a company. A lot of favoritism and empty promises were experienced while working at this company. You worked your butt off for lousy pay, and little recognition. They are extremely hardcore into safety to the point that they completely dummy proof processes to make your job a million times harder, but yet won't fork out more money to compensate for that. The amount of money they spent on food daily for employees, they could have gave everybody a $5 raise and it still couldn't match that amount. Shipping and Receiving was like 2678567 jobs in one, it was a joke. Give them an inch, they will take a mile. I could write a book, but if you're looking for modern day slavery, look no further as you have found just that. My boss was hot & cool, and that's about the only good thing I can say about this place. Pce"
good,"When I started, the facility was new. In a hurry to get up and running, they just put anyone in positions regardless of qualifications or experience. My supervisor was in the food industry and landed a $50,000+ supervisor position with absolutely no experience if that tells you anything. We went through 4 General Managers in 2 1/2 years. They only seem to want to promote the laziest and most unprofessional people. Most “promotions” usually turned into a “lateral” move so that they could give you more responsibility without the pay raise."
good,WestRock is a decent place to work. People in the warehouse are generally nice. Cooperate got involved and new leadership was brought in. Horrible. February 17 to March 20.
good,"Too much results oriented with short term approach.  Too many changes in managements don't allow to create a good stable environment, not well planned strategic changes"
good,The work culture was very miserable. It was very hard to understand the job duties assigned to you. I could have stayed but i have made a lot of mistakes with them.
good,fast paced zero down time  weekend work days for if they would let you off  70 hour weeks were normal  management  gave little to know support  work could be fun on some days but most times it was at best stressful  the hardest part was getting parts
good,"The job itself is not hard, a little dedication, time and effort and the job comes to you ! It’s teamwork and team building ! Production workers are the heart of the plant good and bad people just like anywhere ! Great job . Management needs improvement but than again so does the production side. It’s all about Team concept and safety !"
good,"I don't feel or think this is an good place for employment because of the way they do things such as if you need to miss a day due to court, dr app or other reasons you have to come back the following days and wait for an open slot on a line because once you miss a day you lose your spot on the assembly line."
good,"When things go wrong they don't fire the person who is directly responsible, they hold on to long term managers and get rid of the one doing the hard work for them."
good,"Westrock at the beginning when I first started was an ok place to work. As the years progressed, things changed, people changed and the company changed."
good,to my knowledge this place isnt one of the best places to work. some times things may be great and other they are quick to take advantages of you and sort your hours
good,If you like to work a lot of hours and get paid a nice wage. This is the place for you. The pay is great. Lots of OT. Very easy to make up.
good,"Posting an overload of co-pays, ins. payments, time management. Management more into their friends and laughing about their gym fumbles. Co-workers easy to get along with. No help, lots of OT every Saturday. I enjoyed posting payments."
good,"Too many hours and if your not liked, will not get anywhere"
good,"A typical day at Rock Tenn was to do a lot of heavy lifting, learned how to operate different machines, management was okay never really had to deal with anyone, coworkers I got along with but a lot of them were not very nice, Having to lift heavy things was the hardest part of my job and run fork truck lifting big rolls of paper off the trucks."
good,"The quiz essential epitome of a “Good Ol’ Boy Network"". The company’s hierarchy is lily white. There isn’t a single minority in the upper echelons of management not one person of Asian, Latino, African American, Native American, or Indian decent."
good,"The company over works their employee's with every chance they can.  Everyday is the same thing, making cardboard at the fastest rate possible.  I don't believe the company cares about the employee's safety over the product(which i find very troubling). Some parts of management truly care about the employees, business, and the product. My co-workers there were awesome for the most part and really cared for one another.  The heat in the summer, coldness in the winter, and the speeds that are expected are the true tough parts of this plant."
good,Great place to work - HR department needs some improvements
good,Não se importam com sua vida fora da empresa. Você tem sempre que estar a disposição deles.
good,"I would work there again just another position. And maybe a different boss too. Some people are not to bad to work with. "
good,"don't say no if they want to relocate or transfer you into a new position/role. they change managers every 2-4 months. They are not a teachable company, they expect you to know more than the managers."
good,"Management is a joke, absolutely horrible planning that makes your life hard at work, screw you, and your plans, and your family cause guess what? Your working saturdays on 12s, rotating every single week for some stupid reason, 72 hours a week just so you can watch the lazy people in the office get catering 4-5 times a week while us the workers, get cater maybe 2 to 3 times a year and get it shoved in our face"
good,"Initially the work environment was positive and productive.  After a couple months, it was evident they lacked professionalism, were not supportive of employees, and they don't care about the employee."
good,10 minute break 3 times every 2 hours was horrible. You couldnt even walk to the break room and heat up your food in time to eat it. Very hot conditions
good,"This was my first factory job so i learned allot from here, to run a jumbo flexo, forklift, and rf scanner. The culture was with allot of men who been there for years and had a real production flow with great communications. One of the hardest parts were a 2-4 hour hold over if your next shift spot doesn't come in."
good,"Relieve your co worker, and take over running the machine. How to make cardboard, and how to make starch,and check the finish product. Managers help out when needed. Workplace could get tense at times. The hardest part of the job is getting ready to go home, and five minutes til, getting a call stating that your relief is not coming in, so you have to stay over 4 more hours. The pay rate and co workers."
good,Management was horrible and the job wasnt the easiest. Once you learn your job it wasnt too bad but operators could make your day a bad one since their only worries about their production numbers. Therefore they will run the machine fast. Hard job to do but it taught me alot.
good,Never got the assessments acutely because we went threw so many managers also expected a lot just did pay or appreciate it. Excessive hours and almost no appreciation but a non paid day of if you work 3 Saturday’s in a row😒
good,"I learned a lot a this company, as far as how to properly operate a corrugate machine effectively. The benefit package is decent. The management needs to be trained on how to properly manage team."
good,you will work 6 days a week 12 hours a day forget about your friends and family good place to work if you only want a pay check. will fire you in a heartbeat for the least little thing. don't miss any time they have a very strict point system. very high turnover rate. they will push you to your limit.
good,"Westrock is a up and growing manufacturing facility that has the potential to be a great competitor to the lithographic packaging industry however the lack of team work, knowledge sharing and commitment to safety and quality will have a negative impact on its ability to be a competitive resource. Also without respect, integrity, manufacturing excellence and compliance to the strict guidelines set in place by (SQF), (FSMA), (OSHA) and (SOP) procedures management will continue to struggle operate efficiently."
good,"it was good for the money, very loud and fast paced, was good as a full time summer job as the pay was very good. can be easy and very relaxed at times"
good,I ran a crew of 10-20 workers train and motivate them to build and pack displays. Focusing on quality and meeting production quota. Doing all the paperwork and making sure it was correct.
good,This company was highly competitive long hours some week ends had a noisy hot dusty environment but the pay was good  the stressed strict adherence to safety that was good practice  how ever the job was rewarding although I was there temporarily.
good,"Unidade de Blumenau possui uma dificuldade cultural gerado pela coordenação muito antiga e ligada a tradições tendo dificuldade de mudar o método de gestão independente da forma que é solicitada a matriz. Internamente e divulgado e reforçado o sentimento da unidade ser a melhor e não dividir as boas praticas para com as outras unidades, também há quase nenhum método para garantir os resultados. Dentro da unidade há instituido um ""panela"" de funcionários que regeitam mudanças e pessoas que não se encaixem no que acham determinado, gerando um boicote proposital com o intuito de expulsar os novos funcionários."
good,the mandatory overtime was not fare but it is because this is a union work place the pay was good and the chances for keep going forward were really good but work security is not one of the qualities that this place have
good,"Typical work days consist of hot conditions, fast paced lines, lot of stress, the management there is by far the worst I have ever encountered they believe in here says over proven facts"
good,A decent environment with in a clean working facility. A regular day includes performing make-readys and keeping up with the required paperwork .Alot of mechanical was required. The new safety guards and sensors made some task difficult at times.
good,get paid good money but they work you to death year after year. no time off work work work. work harder faster no time off. 12 hours day 6 7 days a week
good,The management was very unprofessional. At least twice a day I would see an employee get cursed out and talked down to. On one occasion I actually watched the manger flick off an employee.
good,I started from entry level job to become a operator in 3 years. I enjoyed working there and the benefits are great. Great team members and management staff are fair
good,"Quite honestly this is no different than any other factory job,it was exactly what I expected,That's not necessarily a bad thing if you like sweating in a poorly ventilated warehouse."
good,The work there is very hard very physically demanding . The scheduling of the orders is constantly changing witch makes for a frustrating environment with little or no communication between management and employee and when mistakes are made the employee gets the blame . training is a unorganized joke !
good,"A typical work day was spent ""putting out fires"""
good,"No work life balance. Unpaid overtime expected of all salary employees. Extra projects mean time spent at home trying to finish them. Weekend work is scheduled and required."
good,"-manage 30-50 projects during different stages of development: ideation, production, distribution"
good,"work hours 8-12 hrs a day 6 days a week"
good,"Worked in two or three person teams. Operated multiple printing presses. "
good,"Company culture is not great. Do the job, get in get paid and get out. Long hours both at the office and remote. Decent salary. Too many acquisitions over the years."
good,Focus on safety and training. Culture of respect is fostered. Attention to doing the right thing. Fast pace detail oriented work. Quality checks and cleanliness is a must.
good,This place over works and pushes you too much. I hardly take a break at times and I'm always leaving for home feeling like I don't want to come back. It's always understaffed. Always.
good,Worked long nights for 3 years. No time for family. From working at temple inland from 1999-2012 I have been driven to succeed as a well rounded operator on all types of rotary flexos as well as die cutters.
good,Its a good place to work. Just wish they were more organized when it comes to having what you need to do the job. Also wish they would hiring more people on 2nd and 3rd shift to help those shifts out.
good,"While working here for 5 years, every year there was a new supervisor. They took all bonus and employee appreciations away. Management could not run a single machine with accuracy to be successful."
good,"I worked there for about a year and the money was amazing but the hours were not flexible and the coworkers were rude and unfriendly. There is no scheduled breaks in fact some days you don’t even get one, and it’s mandatory for you to stay if anyone from another shift calls in regardless of your personal schedule."
good,"Hard work, hot and humid conditions, long hours, greedy management taking benefits for higher profits. ""Wal-Mart of the paper industry"" hourly pay is decent but not keeping up with cost of living"
good,This was a summer position and was my first job out of high school.  This job gave me insight about manufacturing and the fast pace you must be able to keep up with.
good,They care about the people who work for them. They treat people like trash. HR doesn't do what a HR is supposed to do. They dont want you to put family problems first.
good,There is no life to work Balance what so ever. Its all about the company . Very understaffed and it isn't getting any better. When you work 42 weekends out of 52 it gets old very Quick
good,"Having a point system limits time with family.working moist of the time with very little time to rest or take care of your personal business."
good,"great work place , great benefits, good pay. smooth day. recommend 1 or 2nd shift, great people to work with. no sick days, and its taking along time for the union contract"
good,Be ready for mandatory 6 day work week and some 12 hour shifts. The pay is OK but benefits are terrible.   The benefits are terrible i hope you don't get sick or have health issues.
good,"In the time I was there, we very seldom got a complete 40 hours. Especial, the last 2 years. As a Maintenance Tech 1, a typical day consisted of; doing PMs and answering line calls if and when the machines needed to be fixed to keep the line running. Also, maintain the facility which consisted checking and repairing AC units, pluming, and electrical."
good,"Merchandising displays is contract fulfillment and staffed with mostly temporaries, which requires flexible employees due to variation in schedule. Benefits could be better, especially health insurance. Relaxed and casual production environment,"
good,"WestRock is a growing company through mergers and acquisitions, but they do not plan.  Teams find out at the last minute about a company suddenly being acquired and have no time to plan for transition so it means that constantly you must work 50+ hours per week to accommodate the crazy change.  The leadership team in the is mediocre...some good, some not so good.  "
good,temp work. its gets very hot . easy work .alot of lifting. managment was good.weekend work was based off orders. clean place to work.t good pay.training was excellent.
good,"Great knowlegable folks.  Bumpy road with merger. Middle management left in the dark on changes and unable to inform field of necessary changes.  Ie: pricing changes, new contacts for sampling, mock ups etc..."
good,"No family time work long hours (12hrs Monday to Saturday) with no overtime"
good,"Work long 12hr days Monday to Saturday."
good,This is a good and enjoyable workplace the only downfall is there is not room to move up. They work with you very well and teaching you how to do you job.
good,WestRock is a packaging company. I did a lot on hands on work there like cutting corrugate and folding boxes for displays. My mentor was very helpful and taught me a lot.
good,Overall work isn't bad. Quality of your family life at this plant is unsatisfactory. Good pay due to the union. Good benefits. Unfair holdover language and attendance policy.
good,Enjoyed working with everyone during my employment. Great team environment with everyone eager to help to get the work done. Everyone pitched in during month-end for customer billing.
good,"WestRock Company is an okay company to work for as the office environment is stable.  There's a high turnover as a result of many recent acquisitions, but overall the work life balance is nice."
good,"Empresa excelente para adquirir experiência, porém não há plano de carreira."
good,I enjoyed working by my self running the slitter and driving the forklifts. Learned to set up machine and read print outs. The supervisor was a good guy to work for.
good,"Safety is priority one."
good,"I would start my day signing in and grabbing my work helmet, ear pierce, cloves and sleeves, and other tools. I would check in what kind of rolls of paper we need, and wait for the forklift driver to come in to bring the paper. Once brought I would then prepare the giant roll to be put into the machine so it can used to make corrugated paper. I would also start to clean up paper and derby on my side at the end of my shift. My co-workers were nice, but very hard to hear instructions from because of the loud noises, even with hearing instructions through my ear pierce. It was also very difficult to thread the paper through the machine, which is what I had the most difficult time with while working. Half-way through my work eight hour work shift I would have a thirty minute lunch break. At the end of my day I would clean up my end, and sign-out for the day."
good,"Union and management is making it difficult to have  a team work."
good,Very fast paced work environment.  I am the only maintenance tech on 2nd shift for the last three years and I am on call 24/7.  I have been called in over 30 times so far this year.
good,it was a good job that taught me how to deal with the public. my supervisor did very well in training me. the hardest part of the job was having to dealn with the families at time of death.
good,Rock Tenn (design branch) has great people within the company but it isn't for everyone. Its a great starter job but not where you wanna stay. Theres not much room for advancement. Where you come in is pretty much where you stay. I had a co-worker who came in 2 years before me and hadn't received any type of advancement in position or pay. I quickly was turned off by that and started lacking interest. Not to mention there isn't much room for creativity because the accounts never wanna pay more for detailed designs.
good,"Developed and ensured that the estimation process is standardized, accurate, and consistent across geographies and customers"
good,"1. Day starts at 6:00 AM"
good,"alot of unhappy people there,the atmosphere is terrible,the company did reward us with free lunches when we broke production records and safety records. Rocktenn bought the previous co.about a year and a half ago we have been without a contract. We are on strike as of june 3 13. I'm unsure what going to happen,hoping for the best."
good,"Lot's of areas for advancement, lot's of work.  The most enjoyable part of the job was working with a great team.  It is a hectic environment, and will keep you on your toes."
good,"From the time I arrived in the morning, safty meetings was first. Rest of day filling orders for our customers, even when we had unexpected circumstances arrive."
good,"Unorganized, Questionable managment, and lack of supervision"
good,just a job no room for advancement from within. you go to work they make up th hours as i suites them and poort point system policy
good,Continually multitasking to meet customer expectations and needs and working with supply chain to make it happen; I've learned how to better work with other departments to better service the customers needs; management is continually trying to make improvements;
good,"Too many Chiefs not enough Indians. Nobody will listen to Good ideas? It's pathetic really bad.Not appreciated for all you do, terrible management, people steal your lunches yeah it's a regular thing lol don't leave your lunch in the fridge it will get stolen"
good,"Empresa que esta sofrendo varias mudanças ( para melhor) devido a padronização vinda da central nos EUA, undiade de SC possui uma cultura atrasada com relação a processos colaborativos, tendo um serio sentimento de ser especial e rivalidade para com outras unidades e funcionários de outros estados."
good,"people I worked with knew what they were doing, were smart and professional. Work could have been more challenging and management had a limited view of my potential."
good,Good benefits and competitive salary.  I did not like working in the open atmosphere where you had to write performance evaluations in the open where everyone can see.
good,In order to get in the position I had to work 23 hour days to show interest in the position. Also learned a lot of information about CNC machine and about building new things
good,"Do not work here, no real management, no family life, great benefits ok pay, Hours waned and waned, but overtime was almost always a given. Maybe in other cities Westrock is good the monroe branch wasn't obviously the plant closed"
good,It's a great place to work when fully staffed.  Hiring process takes a long while.  Hours are many.  Its a great place for a single person with no family.
good,"I worked at the N. Broadway facility for a little over a year. Hard work especially in the summer. There was no real training period. They bring you in and for the 1st 12 hours the employees yell at you how they do the work and then proceed to roll their eyes when you don't get it fast enough. Got promoted while employed there and learned a lot from the individuals at the warehouse who took pride in their jobs. As for the other employees, if they weren't drunk or high or whatever then it could be a decent place to work. Couple be a loutlike high school at times. They weren't very big on cleanliness only cleaning the fridge and ice machine in the breakroom randomly or when they saw bugs and cleaning three warehouse only when inspections were coming up, super dusty, needed allergy medicine year round. Management is terrible. There was a lot of favoritism and nepotism. HR is essentially a chair, you'll only see her in meetings and she moves slow to get anything else done. Overall i helped accomplish goals within the company and a few personal ones while leading how to operate machines and troubleshoot them as well but I wouldn't go back unless I became the CEO and was appraising the company to sell it."
good,"Accountability is enforced more than reciprocated. Consistency should be key in any company, however, in most departments, there is room for much improvement. The benefits are excellent, but the room for growth lacks."
good,"It's a union job so everything is based on your date of hire/employee number. Major disconnect between the workers on the floor and the people in the office. One good example is they kinda give a little talk on workplace shootings and how one of the managers worked where one happened not to long ago. They tell us how they want to keep us all safe but anyone can walk onto the manufacturing floor at anytime. Now the offices are all locked up and require a key card to enter, from outside and the manufacturing floor. The other thing that is just kinda gross is that they make a lot of food boxes and I seen some for medical supplies and hardly anyone washes their hands after using the toilet. Others just spit all over the work place and some others constantly eat tree nuts while working. Which is a big no-no because of allergies. There are definitely worse jobs though."
good,As the title states. If you aren’t liked by management (Supervisor on up) or don’t agree with everything management says then management enjoys playing head games with hourly employees. The company ALWAYS says safety is of the upmost importance unless a machine is broken down or an order is late going out then it’s “do what you have to do” to get the order out or machine running.
good,"You will work your butt off in hot or freezing temps."
good,"The work is easy, for a fast paced company. The colleagues are lazy and the leadership is knowledgeable on quality and the machine but lacks people skills and honesty. This is the perfect job for someone trying to make money and not have much of a life."
good,"Not a bad place to work, much more laid back than a typical paper mill.  Management fails to communicate sufficiently with each other or hourly folks.  Several managers struggle with their jobs and are unable to be interested advancement of their direct reports."
good,"It's been 11 1/2 years since I worked here, but when I did it was okay. There was hardly any chance for advancement then. I got lucky and got a quality job, then went to Baxter."
good,"Loading and unloading trailers. Help taking corrugated paper of conveyors onto pallets to racks or staging area. Loading corrugated paper on conveyors for machines to cut, color or glue."
good,To start the pay isn’t to bad but there’s only a 24hr notice if your working your weekend on top of lots of mandatory 12hr days also many holidays get worked due to company needs which to are with short notice. The other downside is you only get one week vacation after your first year until your third year then you finally get two weeks woohoo so and that with the long hours every week say bye bye to family life but hey atleast you’ll be able to pay for them to have fun just not with you. They even put up pics of your family throughout the plant bc that’s the only way you’ll see them.
good,"Lots of people have been around for a long time.  Small town mentality so get in good with the ""old timers"".  Hard work but enjoyable if you can get into the groove.  Some really good people here."
good,Hours were not compatible with my life as a father and management was poor. Management was not consistent in dealing with all employees fairly.  There was no opportunity for advancement.
good,"Very fast paced, customer first type job.  Pay is quite well, however, you won't have time to spend it since you're there 6 days a week between 8-12 hours a day.  If the next shift calls off, be prepared to work an extra 4 hours regardless if you have plans for after work or not. Some management is quite understanding, but there are a few that couldn't sneeze a good idea if they read it off a suggestion form. Place is extremely hot inside due to terrible ventilation coupled with a corrugation machine that kicks off very hot steamed paper. As a new hire that doesn't have a bid job (the place is union), you can and will be subjected to bounce shifts sometimes every week. If you don't mind any of the above, and can handle the stressful, hot work environment, the pay is good."
good,A great place to work as long as you enjoy face paced work with minimal direction. Title advancement is often achieved but advancement with pay may not.
good,Management was more concerned with the politics on the floor then they were with maintaining the machinery and upholding a good relationship with the union and its workers.
good,"Supervisor in place could not and did not help in anyway, frustrating hours and our customer Colgate was late with order and dis-organized creating a confusing and frustrating work environment."
good,I ran test and continuously did quality checks thru out shift. The company often offered food during meetings. They also have a nive family appreciation day
good,"We get out list of jobs that have to be out and a time frame it needs to be done. Its a very nice place to work all the staff are very welcoming, The best part of the days is when i get to help out sorting the machine for the next job"
good,"Management has there favorites and there the ones"
good,Good place to work with good people. Benefits are good. Union shop with decent management. Safe and clean place to work with all of the overtime options one could want
good,"This review is only for the plant I worked in, and any criticisms may or may not apply to other locations."
good,"I won't say that working for Westrock isn't for anyone, however it will take a person who has no interest in ever having a life. Their primary policy is cut heads and work longer hours."
good,"Management is horrible, favoritism is outrageous. Coworkers are iffy. Management overlooks mistakes and turns their cheeks the other way to avoid paperwork. False assumptions are daily accusations."
good,"Ok place to work and a good work life balance "
good,WestRock had a steady work pace that consisted of being on your feet and keeping up with manufacturing demands.I learned a lot about the merchandising display industry from start of the product production all the way to final product. For the most part the management was good until I changed jobs to maintenance. when I started progressing in the job as a black man who is hard working and driven for success I started getting a lot backlash from other employees of maintenance but mainly from the management. i was volunteering for safety director and giving the weekly news to other employees of maintenance just before I was unjustly fired but because North Carolina is an at will state there was no contest to the exact reasoning of my departure. The hardest part of the job was losing the job because I work hard (my opinion). The most enjoyable parts were being apart of team to accomplish small or large goals or task.
good,"is a good working place but it needs some improvements on the way they manage the place overall is not bat. they will let you learn new job positions if you are willing to learn, many people quit for the hours the 12 hour schedule."
good,"The corporate structure at Westrock is very good, benefits are good."
good,"It is much too hot because the machines are steam powered, and the overtime is mandatory and plentiful.The pay is not great enough for the work demanded."
good,Co-workers are the best part of the day. I learned a lot in the quality field. Management has needs a lot of improvement. The hardest part of the job is dealing with the chaos of management.
good,"Difficult place to work for someone with a family. Pay and benefits were outstanding, however I basically lived there. I was scheduled 7 days per week on weekly rotating swing shifts."
good,"I oversee the reliability engineers at the Westpoint facility. Build KIP's to track our progress I the reliability of the assets. I would with the General manager, Operations Manager, Maintenance Manager and Department Superintendents to accomplish daily production goals. My typical day involves 11-12 hours and weekends."
good,"I came in on the startup at this company, was the best material handler hired and one of the major reasons for getting the company up and running. Was asked to come in on an early shift before start up of the first shift and setup, doing the work of 2 people. Was offered a supervisory position but had to decline because my hours would interfere with my schooling. When it came time for pay raises I received the lowest of all employees to my and everybody else's surprise. Won't speculate or speak on why I was ""shafted"" so to speak but It was just not the place for me."
good,"Decent place to work as long as you work on the off shifts (2nd/3rd). Very number oriented and not a great place for career advancement. Seek employment elsewhere if you are looking to advance. This is a lean environment with potential for becoming even more lean. "
good,This place has many ups and downs. The pay was great but gave no time for family or social life. worked extra OT hours. 3rd shift doing mostly 10-12 hours for months at a time 6 days a week.
good,I would set the machine up for the order at hand. check for quality and run product. make sure packers and feeders were doing as they should.
good,"Productive place to work, very safe environment. I have learned how to work with and fix a head on a signode machine. Management is always there to help when needed. My co-workers are very helpful, and attentive. The hardest part of my job is when units get stuck together from being backed up from the main lines. I find it extremely hard separating units once the pads are stuck under eachother especially large units such as Dart, and Tristate. The best part of my day is being able to complete orders before i depart for the rest of my day."
good,"Pay not equal to my workload. long hours."
good,"set up for customer order, very physical hard work stress to me deadlines."
good,"Warehouse athmosphere. very hot in summer, cold in winter. Very strict dress code, hard to dress comfortably. Great team of people to work for and work with,but everyone stays stressed out due to customer demands. Long hours and mandatory overtime. The workforce consists of temporary workers, so you don't work with the same people every day. Other than break, you spend the whole shift on your feet."
good,This company is very cut and dry. There is no room for advancement. You're basically stuck in one spot for life.
good,Management could use improvement.  Company's job culture is important to Senior Management.  Most management are new to the company.
good,"Most of the people there were great to work with, I understand you will always run across difficult people to deal with.  The management liked to come in and shake things up when, in my opinion, things were going well.  When that happened, jobs were lost and I saw alot of good workers let go for reasons I was unsure of. The hardest part of the job was when you were given a duty to perform that you were unable to do alone or not sure how to do and had trouble finding someone to help. Most of the time the employees were helpful and freindly."
good,"Everyday you learn something different, what the customers want as far as the quality of the boxes and what they do not want. My co-workers we work as a team to get the job done, and while we are at work we enjoy each others presence. The hardest part of my job is when there is a lot of waste is going through the machine, it can be hectic sometimes. And the enjoyable part of my job is that I love working and making corrugated boxes while I'm making my money."
good,Very productive operation. During my time at RockTenn I have been involved in more AC/DC motors and extremly large gearbox/motor driven units than in the past. We operator on a very small scale of people. Being in maintenance I am on call everyday. The majority of my co-worker (operators) are limited in there ability to support any production break down issues that my occur. Alot of time is spent supporting our crew. The hardest part of the job to me is due to the limited amout of people and the demands that are required its hard to focus your attention on details sometimes like you would like. The most enjoyable part of my job has to be the rewards when you see a co-worker starting to improve in area's that you had a part of training.
good,A fast paste working under the sun all day. My co-workers are reliable.
good,"Just work and mind your business. Don’t talk or you’ll be sucked in to the gossiping atmosphere. The only people you need to be friends with are the operators, team leaders, and managers. They’ll help you get promoted. Pay usually starts a $13/hr and goes up to $14/hr. And it’s very hard to get promoted unless you’re a friend of the higher ups."
good,"Fast pace constant work"
good,"Westrock is a company in which they don't care about their employees, you're just a number, they also don't manage things in an intelligent manner, jobs are typically pretty simple, and straight forward when hourly associates have control, when salary gets involved things go down hill fast, salary talks down to you and treat you poorly"
good,"Your manager's lack of integrity and biased opinions about you can supersede your true contribution, value adding and dedication to the customers and company."
good,To many weekends. Poorly managed by corporate.  Poorly managed by sales department and consistently overbooking machines.  Overall not a good work life balance
good,"Overall a decent place to work. However, there are much that can be done to make it a better place to work. In turn, less turnover and happier employees. Many are seeking better employment for the pay as well as their life."
good,"Stackers are paid less. They do the most general labor compared to other positions. Doing good gets you noticed but little mistakes can get you in trouble. Management is changing since there’s a new GM in the plant. The Production manager goes out on the floor and has that attitude where  you can tell is fake by acting like you matter. Since there’s new management, rules are changing so don’t let the PM see you standing around for just a few seconds because you’ll automatically get in trouble. Instead, act as if you’ve been busy at all times during your shift. Best advice I can give to anyone planning to work in the Tulare, CA area. “Work relaxed during the night but when morning comes around, act as if you’ve been working the best so the mangers arriving in the morning don’t think you’re lazy.” A thing I did learned from working in this area was the “put up with the work and shut up,” saying. As a stacker you will do a lot and get little to no credit out of it. You will see employees doing things they’re not supposed to be doing. Don’t advise the supervisors because remember. You’re a new hire and your co-workers have been there longer. So in the end your opinion doesn’t matter because you can be replaced easily. "
good,"It's a good job but too much favoritism among those who have been here awhile. management is helpful , but if you aren't experienced in the job the other members will treat you poorly with or without management around"
good,I enjoy the people I work with. It’s definitly a family. The job can be stressful at time but others it’s very relaxed. Some if the bosses are easy to work for but a couple are impossible. Most are good and easy.
good,They want you to work safe and make quality product at a fast pace but they ignore safety issues at times and dont really pay attention to their employees as to how their ideas can make a more safe and productive work environment and then managment always trying to blame someone else when things dont go right
good,"The job demands a lot, breaks suck 10 & 20 minutes, definitely not enough time for the work the ppl are subjected too. Supv are petty and show favoritism. They pay well...but ask yourself twice if its worth the stress and headache."
good,"People are great, but a lot of overtime  forget to spend the week end with your family, the work is sometimes hard , we work six days a week most of time."
good,"The accounting department is largely segmented. Working for this company is fun and relaxing. If you have goals to move up, it will be a little hard.  Other than that, if you don't like working a lot, this is the company for you!"
good,Great friendly environment to work around with great benefits i would recommend this job to anyone.I had a wonderful experience working for Westrock company.
good,WestRock was a cool place to work. The coworkers were very friendly and management was very nice. The company provided pizza parties per shift for the employees doing great work. It's family friendly.
good,"Ok place to work, too many migrant workers, below average pay, good benefits, medical dental, lots of overtime in summer, annual raises dont keep up with cost of living increases."
good,You'll learn a lot and make excellent money. Good team environment as your fellow co-workers will be your best support. Many opportunities for training.
good,"Fair pay and good benefits, A lot of changes, high turnover from production to management. Room for advancement if you are open to relocate, Most of the associates are good people."
good,Hard manual labor. Co-workers are mostly nice and breaks are fair. It is a good job to keep you physically active but only for so long before it becomes harmful.
good,sometimes you feel like your set up for failure expecting one man to do way more than he should with out help. they should manage the positions a little differently basically if your on a machine its tough if your not its a great job
good,"The job can be fun if you get put on the right line ... the hours are iffy... the drive is not worth the pay if you don't live close to Iowa city. It is a good job "
good,"Unable to provide the information you are asking for and prefer to keep it confidential."
good,"You will work 45-55 hour weeks mandatory you wont have a life outside this job, if working is your life this is the position for you. Pay is definantly on the lower end for all the work they expect to be completed without error "
good,"the job could be rewarding at times and then it could very difficult to dreal with at times, due in large part to supervisor that do not have the proper people skills to get thru to some workers."
good,"Westrock is a decent place to work, though it has some quality issuses with its products that creates situations where last minute schedule changes interfere with work life balance. "
good,Could be a great place to work. Long days and  never know whats going until the last minute. I've learned a lot about corrugated boxes. People  there are scared to train others for fear of being replaced
good,"The people are great there. I enjoy the employees and temps that I work with. The people that I have met and worked with are nice, friendly and courteous."
good,"The pay is good if you can work past the bad conditions. It is a very hot environment and union based. Supervisors have ""favorites"", and it shows. Working 6 days a week sometimes 12 hours a day."
good,"I wouldn't say that this job isn't for anyone, but working at Rocktenn/Westrock requires a special kind of person who has no interest in a personal life."
good,"Es una buena empresa para iniciar una vida laboral, pero no tanto como para quedarse"
good,"Enjoyed working here overall"
good,"Once you have a job, just show up to work and you'll be good to go! This job is high pace so it is important to be ready for the day when you walk in to work."
good,Great company to work for  great benefits........ But horrible  supervisors and upper management they dont care about you or your family all they care about is numbers.....a lot of favoritism....if management like you then your good if not they won't even talk to you.....they preach about safety been #1 its not to them production is over safety....
good,"Decent company to work for, needs management improvemnt, no AC, long hours. Behind 10 years u=with technology. Work is not hard at all, just aggravating at times."
good,"Rock Tenn's pay and benefits offered for the job are satisfactory, but management is not good. The management team yells and cusses at their employees on a daily basis and the work conditions are horrible. The employees work 12 hour days 6 days a week and during the summer, the plant is at least 150 degrees with no fans available to help with the heat. Employees have had heat stroke because of the conditions. Opportunities for advancement are not available either. Several times I was promised supervisor opportunities but this never happened."
good,"RockTenn now known as WestRock provides plenty of challenging projects (which is great) without much consideration for work-life balance of the employees (which is highly unfortunate). Great for workaholics. That said, even the best achievers do not get recognized or appreciated and there is little to no career advancement within the company."
good,"operate a dozier  or other heavy machinery in a sometime unsafe situation."
good,"You work swing shifts, sometimes with no days off for months on end. If you are looking to make money and not do much else with your time, this isn't a bad place to work. The management is nice and understanding for the most part. This is a union job, advancement only comes with time served."
good,Pay is okay job isn't too hard. Management is annoying and causes problems that are blamed on operators. Upper management is out of touch it's an alright job
good,"When this place was called Rex Packaging it was a great place to work. It was sold to Cenveo 9 years ago and has went down hill ever since, WestRock bought us in January of this year and is now closing the plant.  WestRock as a company may be great to work for but from what I've seen so far, I'm not impressed."
good,"days start off slow, but they usually pick up after the first hour. If they had better temps in there it would go a whole lot smoother on the line."
good,A typical day for me would be servicing over 30 plus suppliers making sure they're shipments have been delivered. I have learned a lot about the recycling industry as well as rates for different shipments. My co-workers and management are okay. It is usually a friendly environment. The hardest part of my job is handling issues that I didn't create. The most enjoyable part of my job is the interaction with my co-workers and suppliers.
good,Start of day safety walk check for all safety hazards before shift start. Expecting Lift equipment before operations and loading unloading merchandise also into racks.
good,There is no typical day at work. Routine work is completed around dealing with production and process issues. Some late nights and work on weekends is expected in order to get the plant up and running or simply to meet paperwork deadlines.
good,"It is the definition of micromanagement. There have been so many people hired and fired in the past year, that its just sad. The team is very kind and willing to help."
good,"I worked there for 7 and a half years, Started on 3rd shift and made it to 2nd shift. No matter how hard i tried i could not get to first shift. I was one of the most flexible workers that they had. Worked 10-14 hours a day operating 10 different machines whenever they needed me to . The pay was nice but i would have rather been able to spend time with my newborn baby and wife. I tried talking with management about taking a pay cut or replacing some people who got terminated on first but they would never promote me."
good,"A typical work day consisted of me maintaining good housekeeping in both Shipping and Wood Yard departments. Some tasks included sweeping, shoveling wood, moving heavy objects and organizing items."
good,I worked on the Paper Machine.  Most days weren't too bad.  The company merged twice in 10 years.  The last merger shut us down even though our mill made a lot of money for the company.
good,"This is the highest paying job I have ever had but is all consuming the way they set up the shift swings and being on call at all times when you are off.It is also very hard physically and very stressful mentally.They aren't giving the money away and you pay a steep price to earn it.I have enjoyed my co-workers and learned a great deal from them and management in the paper business, but when our department was split I found there was no longer the team work necessary to accomplish the company goals to the level previously due to friction between the two departments."
good,Good benefits decent pay but very boring an repetitive. You work almost every day. Lack in management an trust. Only third or second shift available.
good,"Rock-Tenn is a good company to work for it has its pros and cons like every work place does the management is all right the co-workers all seem to get along pretty well together the work is not hard just constant... it beats being board at work though. Over all I would say its a good job with exceptional standards towards safety, product quality, and production."
good,Good place to learn the paper making trade and lots of room for moving up to different jobs. Good pay. Co workers are helpful. Hard though to manage a normal life with working 12 hour swing shifts.
good,"If you are looking for a job to make a lot of money this is it, but don't expect to move anywhere in the company because there are a lot of backstabbers to make sure you don't succeed.  Some co-workers make it fun but others try to make sure you dont make it.  Some of the people in management should not be there because they abuse their power to see you fail and to put you in uncircumstantial positions. Best part of the job is the money, everything/everybody else is not worth it."
good,Great bonus structure for Managers and above.  Bonuses paid out in November  Long hours in corporate environment and high stress levels.  Job security for high-performers but the company does not shy away terminating average and below performers.
good,Very productive and fun workplace with great diversity and opportunity for learning and development.
good,A work day consist of consistent lifting and stacking. The work day is supposed to be 8 hours but can run longer if you are needed.
good,Pay is good but they don't treat there employee very good. management needs to treat the employee with respect.
good,"good advancement, always challenging work days which give you the feel of satisfaction."
good,"i was a single mother at the time working late shifts,my children at home alone, Rock-Tenn management would not allow me to move to a day shift, so i went to another job that would"
good,"RockTenn is a large corrugated company with good benefits and a good culture. This facility is a safe work environment, but the supervision is weak, and the management is inexperienced in the niche business, making it hard to improve the plant over all, however slow but steady progress is being made. I have learned the importance of respect in leadership and talent management. The hardest part of the job is getting ready for all the meetings. The most enjoyable part is improving a process or piece of equipment and seeing the results in better or higher quality productivity. The thing I am most proud of is the 0 incident safety record my team has maintained during my time here."
good,"RockTenn is an excellent place to work, pay and management is more than l could expect.  It a hard physical place to work which l totally enjoyed but they have their slow times which causes lay offs and l am hoping for my stability."
good,"This is a good Company to work for, s a world leader in the manufacture of recycled paper."
good,"Good place to work, fast pace and never a dull moment."
good,This was a great company that had many opprotunites for advancement.
good,"They are competitive they have a lot  of different jobs they will keep you busy from mill shutt downs to construction cleans and I do believe some"
good,"It was a good job, I enjoyed & looked forward to working everyday despite the 12 hour shifts. I learned how to operate different machines, & how certain stuff was made"
good,"It was a good work place, but the only downfall was it was very hot and humid and they expected too much out of one person for example 1 person doing a 5 man job."
good,At the time I worked at WestRock it was a very busy time they make displays for Starbucks and Walmart among other big companies but they’ve had many changes in management since I’ve been there
good,The team and project execution is changing based on meeting the cost/ton goals set by the company. There are some good teams and working relationships. Management is closed and does not share details.
good,Changing schedule fast paced and and friendly people to work with during all shifts six to seven days a week with plenty of space in the lunch room for Sure
good,Not a bad place to work. A lot of overtime available. Working on an alternative schedule to help with work/life balance. Decent pay for the type of work you do.
good,"My job now is loading/unloading trucks,it can be a fast paced job to be on 12 hour shifts,loading/unloading the lantech so things would not be backed up"
good,I had quite a bit of opportunity during my time at WestRock.  I was  fortunate to be invited to take management courses and eventually received a promotion to a management position.
good,Management is typical do as I say not as I do. High turnover. You get two tens and a twenty minute breaks for twelve hours shifts. Depends on what operator you get to what your work life will be like.
good,"I just don't like how they over work you, and also they don't recognize you. They will work you for over 40 hours . The good thing is that you can get 40 hours per week."
good,"If you like overtime this is the place. Maintenance works almost every Saturday and 5 to 10 Sundays a year. Holidays like Easter, Fourth of July, Labor Day, a couple other days are fair game for Maintenance to work. Weekend work isn't posted until Thursday so forget about making weekend plans with the family. The pay is pretty good and with all the overtime most mechanics get close to the 100k mark, but you're never home to spend it. Your first year has no vacation, 2-3 years gets 1 week, 3-7 gets 2 weeks, 7-I think 15 is 3 weeks. No sick time, have to take from your vacation. Safety is a priority and if you say something is unsafe you will be protected and a safe action plan will be produced. If you like money this is the place, but you'll be worked hard for it."
good,"I liked working over night it was a decent job just couldn't pay my Bill's so I had to leave I would send my buddies over there to work for them "
good,"Really redneck, Republican mindset.  Openly expressed political views, although this is supposed to against company policy.  It's basically a good ol' boys club."
good,Good job overall  quick paced easy job not hard work at all the work queue is never to high to where you cant do it its always easy and some ppl are easy to work with
good,"The job at Wesrock was a temporary position as an administrative assistant. The hours were good, the pay was good. There was a lot of stress in the office in which I worked."
good,Always concerned about safety.  Training was always a concern. Supervisors held knowledge of all goings on in the factory. Always knew ahead of time if you where going to be needed for overtime.
good,Westrock is a great company to work for. Working hours can become a drain after awhile but the benefits are wonderful. Consistent work and great people to work with.
good,Very family oriented place of employment..employees look out for one another when the need arises.....................................................
good,Great place to work but they let me go for forgetting my gloves when I was bailing boxes. Other than that I would have liked to stay there and make a career out o fit.
good,I didn’t have any enjoyable part of that job I just went in to do my job and leave to go home. It was very stressful on me and my marriage because they put me on 3rd for like over a month which was even more stressful and I didn’t like it at all and they didn’t say anything about working 3rd shift when I first got hired in.
good,Management always willing to listen and assist when needed. Allowed employees to work autonomously. Worklife balance was really good. Culture was old school could use some updating.
good,Overall my westrock work experience was great. Long hours but the pay was great! Most of the workers was very friendly and very helpful! I would recommend westrock to a friend!
good,"Good place to learn need skills good team work, compay has good benefits ,working conditions were ok, good communication whith managment, it was a new experience for me"
good,Its alot of buddy buddy and favoritism that goes on in this place the management sucks. It's some good people that work the floor its and okay place to work
good,"Under old management I was able to learn a lot, further my knowledge of warehousing. Learn a lot and get a lot of certifications. New management is different."
good,It's an ok place to work. it's not hard; it does get hot in the summer and pretty cold in the winter. I like the fact that I don't have to work more than 8 hours a day and we only have work Saturdays on the weekend they don't like to make you work 7 days.
good,It was a cool place for the most part. I stayed there up until they closed the plant down. It was a cool experience. I had learned alot from alot of people and got close with alot of my coworkers
good,I enjoyed working for Westrock.  Challenging work. Great business partners. Plenty of performance and development opportunities. Career opportunities exist. Good transition company.
good,Regular long days contracting/sub-contracting on everything for main commerical services to big custom homes.Changes to CEC over 20 years had to learn over again.
good,I enjoyed the people I worked with. It is fast paced but I love to stay busy. My boss was always available to assist us if we didn't understand what to do.
good,if your looking for a place to make good money thats the job for you  and if you love having days off then it could be somthing you look into  because of the way their shift is set up
good,it was always so hot I cant take that much heat it was like 100 degrees every day and it was not a very good work environment to be in I hated it every day.
good,very nice place to work great envirrment helpful team members great opportunity growing in industry plenty of training oppurtunty promote from with in when possible
good,"typical work day could be stressful if you let it. if you can keep your composure, usually the day flies by. Mostly 12 hour shift overall, not a bad place to work."
good,Basically Management assign work daily in a spreadsheet to individuals. You problem solve discrepancies related to invoices and purchase orders. Process invoices for payment
good,"We had a lot of struggles, but was resilient in accomplishing task. The development program was in its infant stage, so it wasn't much to offer when I was there. But I have heard great things, about the leadership development since than."
good,"Decent pay and benefits, fast pace work in operations. overall co-workers were competent and could be fun place to work. Frustrating and challenging at times when paper machines not running well. RockTenn and Mead Westvaco merged to form this company. Got too big and put an X through Coshocton mill even though we were consistently profitable and high safety awards for the work being done.  Closed quickly after merger even though we were one of a few mills that had a pulp mill, not all recycle. Don't think top management thought this through. But they control enough of the market to close us and raise the price of medium paper. Supply and demand."
good,"If you like money and no family life this is for you. management needs more organization,   Most people are good to work with. Can very hot and very cold."
good,Safety first knowledge of how to use a tape measure must know colors of in must know how to take storage be organized must be able to do a verighty of jobs
good,"Westrock as a whole is an amazing company.  They have great values that I feel they want to see in every plant. With some better training and structure, it could get better."
good,This is a very tough place to work very strict rules with very strict management they pay very well with great benefits and they are very willing to help when and where they can
good,"Fast paced, but not very well supervised.  People aren't oriented to their jobs very well before they are required to perform their job duties. Supplies for machines are scattered about and difficult to find."
good,"If you don't mind working nights and working 7 twelve hour shifts in a row and only making 8 hours overtime during that time, its an okay place to work."
good,"I really liked working for this company. I got hurt and was out of work and my short term ran out, so they had to let me go. They did tell me i could reapply when i was better"
good,"None given.  I wouldn't want to recommend that anyone I like work here.  I have a dire family situation and, while the mill's staff are overwhelmingly trying to help, corporate is not."
good,Nice place to work with great employees. A good place to work if you're looking for ot. Also has a nice break room with plenty of refreshments to help get you through the shift.
good,"The Company is very cool, I trhink its the best company I have worked for. But  my supervisor was micromanager, he was very stressful to work with and he underestimated me. He fired 3 other coworkers in less than a year and I was under a lot of pressure. He fired me and didnt even gave an oportunity to demostrate my qualifications. The office that I worked was very friendly and the majority of the people that I worked with. The work wasnt fun, no creativity and my supervisor was very squared in how things where supposed to be done. I think that I worked better than other designers in the company I just got bad luck with my supervisor and my training was very poor too."
good,"A typical day at this job is very varied, depending in which area of the company you are working at. I worked as a Process Engineer and my tasks included shadowing several supervisors in order to improve current management processes at the mill. Sometimes my own supervisor was disinterested of my work so he would not give me enough guidance. The hardest part of this job was to fulfill my tasks given that they didn't really interest me too much. I still worked as hard as possible to fulfill my expectations."
good,nice place to work if you want to learn a new thing about how boxes are made. nice people to be around. I didnt like how we had no weekends due to mass production requirments that wanted to be meet.
good,I worked graveyard shift from 10pm-6:30am Sunday-Thursday. I don't understand measurements to well and one of the employees know it and he kept picking on me. Other then that everything else was great
good,"The people I worked with were great, but higher management did not communicate like they were supposed to. That caused employees to have to pick up the slack due to it being a production job.  Working 12 hours is a normal thing out here. It is very fast paced and you have to learn fast so it is challenging and engaging."
good,A typical day at work varies from fast paced to relax and easy going. The overall culture is family oriented. The hardest part of the job is being told that you are all of a sudden are not meeting job expectations and not given any specifics of what you are not doing or training instructions to aid in improvement.
good,"Typical day is varied"
good,WestRock is  JOB that will allow you to make a fairly decent wage and provide you with an opportunity to make a lot of money. Management ...at least at the Atlanta Ga plant was sorely lacking. There's very little logical thinking and the plant was sabotaged from within by the general manager. Company frowns heavily on Unionized plants and are slowly closing each one.
good,":weekly paying job"
good,It is a nice place to work for and very productive. They are times where there is a lot of over time. They are very keen on safety and being clean. The management is very friendly and willing to work with you.
good,"worked all day with no breaks, no lunch, no restrooms, no running water. "
good,It's a tough environment to adapt to but overall a great company to work for.  They are extremely fast paced and they recently finished a merger with another company that they are still developing their processes and procedures.
good,I am unsure of the work place at this time. The company merged and has changed names. Can not give any review and unsure how to skip this part. I would if I could.
good,"Nice play to work if you're not planning a career, not a place you will get ahead at. In the summer it gets to be over 100 degrees in the building and it gets hard to breathe at times.(but they do have 50 cent Gatorade)"
good,the job was not very hard if you use your head you got this. learned how to work fast and neat. how to fill orders and check for bad product.the people were the best part.
good,very hot work environment especially during summer months very fast paced lots of forced overtime hard to balance work with home life or other activities
good,"Not a terrible place to work, and must guard your life away from work.  The work is hard and fast paced, but satisfying when complete.  The pay is good, but crosses the line when it comes to taking care of your family.  Provides money but no family time."
good,A Lot of money wasted by orders not being complete on time. Have to send 2 trucks instead of 1. A Lot of mismanagement . Scheduling very poor. Total chaos in shipping department because orders not produced to meet shipping dispatch. Machines down during week for lack of material to run. This leads to working on Saturdays
good,"This position provided the ability to program dating and pricing codes in machines, set-up lines to package, process for delivery to major retail corporations."
good,gezellige werkomgeving en leuk werk wat ik graag en met plezier gedaan heb
good,"Company not to bad to work for ,pay was competitive. Positive work atmosphere. Benefits were good Most holidays were paid ."
good,"Well I have to say there was job security before RockTenn merged with Meadwest Vaco.  RockTenn grew fairly quick purchasing other companies and once the transition to WestRock occurred it was like with other companies, jobs were outsourced and the employees no longer mattered. They are no longer able to provide their customers with the Great Customer Service they once offered"
good,"A typical day at work consisted of operating heavy machinery and pushing loads of boxes. The management cared about the workers safety in the shop. Overall, the job was not bad."
good,Can be a great place to work and absolutely great money but must be willing to sacrifice your life to work balance since shifts can go longer than expected many times out of the week.
good,WestRock is a great place to work. The company does well and the people at the plant are dedicated and a pleasure to work with. I started as a purchasing and inventory manager to learn the basic operations of the company; with a goal of moving up.
good,"I wish I was still there... It was a great place to work and a friendly environment. The company takes care of you. However, communication is poor and news is not spread well."
good,"The management was terrible and I had a lot of bad experiences, the pay was pretty good with a lot of overtime opportunities and the co-workers were friendly. I learned a lot of skills I can use towards various jobs."
good,"the work environment depends on the season. when its cold its cold inside the plant and vice versa.. "
good,"The coworkers here become like family to you."
good,"Warehouse work hot in summer cold in winter steady work, paid every week . Dresscode as far as skin shows but u can dress for comfort depending on weather conditions"
good,"the company is very strict on rules, great people to work with, really hot in the summer, cold in the winter, you stay very busy,"
good,"▪	Extremely proficient in picking, packing and moving duties"
good,"Micro manage company. Merged with MeadWestvaco July 2015."
good,"I have worked as a temp for Westrock for almost three years. In that time, I have been passed over for full time jobs due to full time employees having first selection at jobs. Temps are not allowed to respond to internal job openings and, frequently, are beaten out for full time jobs by people hired on off the street. As a temp, it's very disheartning, and I do not recomend Westrock as a place to work if looking for temp labor."
good,When the clock started you were on the go. Everyday held new and different challenges that needed to be taken care of. My abilities to improvise or adapt on the fly were constantly improved in my time there. I had the pleasure of working with some really smart people and learning how things work on the next level
good,I enjoyed the people I worked with.  Management was unrealistic with expectations.  The balance of work & family was not there
good,"This is the same organization as Rock Tenn. They are identical, just different names. Nothing to report differently. Rock Tenn and West Rock are the same."
good,"A good place to work as long as you are not in the customer service department. No HR on site, rules change daily. Horrible management."
good,"Good place to work and grow your foundational skills and meet new people in your line of work.  The opportunities to grow from the projects and tasks that were assigned to you are also great!"
good,"It was a clean place to work and the co-workers was good to work with. The management could have been better, not enough commication"
good,Advancement oppurtunity is a constant concern for most employees. Not a bad company its a typical corprate environment no bells and whistles.
good,The work place is a fast work place it has some hard working people within the plant but the plant lack in certain areas which is unfit for those who do their best for this plant.
good,"Workwise it is very demanding.  If you are an operator be prepared to be expected to miss breaks, be yelled at among other things.  Office management has no problem talking about certain employees in very demeaning and offensive ways.  You can only advance if according to management ""you dont fit the rock-tenn image"".  But there are those team members who will always have your back and make work quite enjoyable actually."
good,sometimes i enjoyed going to work and sometimes i didnt a typical day at work was ok when everything went smoothly and every thing worked the hardest part of the job was dealing with management . Some of my co-workers were ok to work with i didnt talk to many of them . i learned how to operate machines how to trouble shoot when having a problem with the press
good,packing and loading the products the management wasn't right at all the hardest part was standing in one place for 10 hours i really enjoyed packing the different products
good,Not a overall bad company. They do pile a lot of responsibility with few raises. wanting more and more for less and less. to many promises not followed thru.
good,"busy customer orders driving forklift 3rd shift lead safety team leader"
good,At first I used to think every company did their own graphics for their boxes and products. But come to find out a lot of these big corporations come to places such as Rocc Tenn boxing company to have their graphics printed and glued before putting them out on the shelves in stores such as Walmart.
good,"Typical day: Start my day at 7AM reviewing to do list and starting the various tasks. Once analysis was complete I would review with my Director for accuracy. Some projects were more complicated causing the Director to spend more time reviewing work, which I believe was fine. Found out that it was not as ok to take his time. "
good,Rocktenn makes boxes. They are a good company to work for they have steady work. There benifits could be improved.  the plant is a  union shop.
good,"I would go in a hour early most every morning to keep safety manager from having to fill in till I got there for my regular scheduled hours.  Was trained for a day or so, but was self taught on a lot of the work since it was very busy and demanding.  I enjoyed working with all of my co-workers I got along with everyone.  The hardest part about my job was trying to eat lunch and work at the same time.  I done my required job and helped my boss with some of her work as well.  I enjoyed the work I was doing and keeping busy with a friendly environment."
good,I inspected boxes before going to cutting department. while working at the company I found other employees were very nice and respectable to work with
good,You work on a line assembling displays.  The people that you work with were great.  The job was not really hard.  I really enjoyed when I got to work.
good,"I learned about properly packaging items to be purchased and sold in general stores."
good,"learned a lot, management not all on same page, most people good to work with"
good,I learned how to have a lot of patience with my co-workers. I liked to assemble and pack the displays.
good,"A typical work day is an eight hour shift, but the shifts can increase to 16 hour work days."
good,"The fellow workers are very helpful"
good,"it's an OK JOB., organization is a must. not for the lazy worker."
good,"Good summer job "
good,Very safety oriented. Strict but fair rules. I worked there 8 yrs and they treat employees pretty good.
good,"Great place to work if you are in one of the good plants, the bad plants are so mismanaged and unorganized I cant believe it."
good,"start time 5 am, check trailers, get bills done for 1st round of shipments starting at 6 am. Answer calls from CSRs and customers. Multi-tasking and being a team player is a must!   Load trailers and relieve forklift drivers for breaks as needed. Tally and bill bale trailers make appointments for there pick up."
good,No ventilation what so ever so hard to breath on top of that working around machinery that could perish you in a moments notice very unsafe place to work in my opinion.
good,"St. Louis office of RT housed several sub-divisions including recycling, trash collection, billing, and marketing. On any given day someone would be pulled from their regular assignment to catch up on someone else's work which left for no day-to-day sense of knowing what you'd find. Too often ""busy work"" was provided so competent workers who finished early on their own tasks were made to pick up the messes of less productive people. Management also was seldom able to provide positive feedback, although negative feedback was a daily ritual. Its not surprising that the Lowe's Recycle program was won and then lost inside of 8 months due to poor business practices."
good,"Small facility that runs well, leadership team is very knowledgeable."
good,"Fast paced work environment, good team work, learned to manage multiple priorities at one time."
good,i got suited up and went to the conveyer belt and started sorting.
good,"Easy money and an easy job. This could be best considered a job, not a carreer"
good,"Ran daily aging reports for one of the company's largest accounts,customer service,weekly account reviews with management,worked alongside cash applications and billing department to ensure money was applied accuratly along with resolving billing issues."
good,Stocking it was a great job for then. Very great Co-works.Opening boxs with hands hurt.
good,This was pretty much your average workplace. A place that can always stand for improvement.
good,"(Tacoma, WA location). Good paying union job with decent benefits and HSA. Ample opportunities for overtime to make even more money. Work schedule can be difficult for some depending on individual circumstances. 12 hour shifts that include 2 days followed by 2 nights back to back. Workers then get 4 days off. This is a 24/7/365 mill so depending on your assigned shift, you may or may not work a holiday. It's all by chance. But even if you do, workers are additionally compensated for it. The union contract ensures all workers receive an annual cost-of-living raise. The company also offers additional compensation for getting ""called in"" to work on a day off. "
good,"Do yto lack of trianing in all areas. Very hard to preform your job according to job spec. For instance operating all operators do it there way and very hard to help in the position."
good,No work life balance they will work you 6 days a week 12 hours every day for several months non stop and no advancement dead end job there is no place to grow at this company but all the employees are great to work with.
good,"Pay was fine, work wasnt. Weeks were up and down- there was never a consistent vibe throughout the office. Unhappiness and negativity was all throughout, and management was difficult to deal with"
good,Good Pay. Good group of guys to work with. Issues over the years with management. Nobody on same page. Job was not physically demanding but 12hr continental shifts are difficult.
good,"Any trade war that the US is involved in will, most likely, hurt this industry and perhaps your job.  Unfortunately this is manufacturing, and trade is essential, but this should be kept in mind,"
good,I worked there more than 15 years ago so this review (although required) would be irrelevant to anyone who is currently seeking employment with this company.
good,"Muy buenas culturas de trabajado"
good,Nice place to work at I learned a lot about working on a water based ink printing press the people were great to work with and very cheerful job security was iffy
good,WestRock is a great place to work for stability but not for advancement. They have a very old fashion promotion policy and its very difficult to get a position cross functionally. Nice people. Management is okay depending on your manager. My department manager did not approve the company wide work from home policy until after several weeks of negative feedback from the team.
good,It is a job that you go to in order to aquire a paycheck.  I find it low paying for the industry and chances for advancement are not great.  It is a reliable paycheck.
good,"The job involves daily inspections of the roll clamp truck and forklift."
good,"Great job, good expierience lots of earned training physical and mental, learned work safe practices along with good houskeeping, computer skills in the workplace"
good,Esta empresa ainda esta tentando descobrir sua identidade.
good,"Must be detail orientated, but it's a great job for good pay!  The work is fast paced, and they are good about hiring in temps that hit their 90 days!"
good,"West rock was I nice fun job to attend. I enjoyed everyday there.. only thing was hard about west rock is when I had to stack different bells of work up and unloading trucks. Them was the most difficult times there until I finally caught on.. west rock was positive and fun.. I only had to leave the job because I didn't have any transportation anymore.. if I did I'll probably still be attending west rock now.. everything was set, set time 5am-3:30pm everyday hours with two 15 min breaks and one 30 min break on the clock."
good,"Didn't mind working here, but there are more problems there then you would think. You don't get a 30 min lunch only 10 min breaks through the 8 hour shift."
good,"the company is a very old and established environment i really learned alot and the people are friendly"
good,decent place to work.  lots of hours and machines in this facility. This facility still has a small company feel to it. would work at other facilities for this company.
good,"Its a good place to work but looking for something with more pay that  I can find a good home with."
good,A typical day at work was from the hours of 3:00 pm until 11:00 pm.  I learned how to pack boxes and load/unload trucks as needed. Management consisted of only two supervisors as there was only a small  second shift department.  Co-workers worked together to meet the required production for the night. The hardest part of the job was lifting very heavy boxes without assistance and the most enjoyable part was completely all the boxes given.
good,"The shifts are log and streneous, but the actual shift moves by qickly because it is non stop work, so before you even know it the shift is over."
good,"its a job but im interested in more hours, and a faster pace job"
good,"I take loads from the machine, and do make-readies. I have learned how to run a cutting machine. The shift manager is awesome. Great guy. The co-workers are easy to get along with. The Hardest part of the job is the make readies and putting away the tooling. Involves very heavy lifting. The best part about the job is when we have an all night run."
good,"A typical work day is answering any employee questions, cooridnating meetings, maintaining records such as training,hiring, termination, leaves, etc. I have learned how to effecitively speak with employees/management, multi-task, and universal HR functions and policies such as FMLA, STD, the RockTenn Union contract book, etc. "
good,"Worked in conjunction with Manufacturing, Marketing, Production Development and Sales in the creation of new patient friendly packaging solutions."
good,Great culture and people work with you to feel comfortable within your role with the company.
good,"manage all employees during second shift production. i was the only salary supervisor during second shift for almost two years. their was times where i traveled to other plants to fill in as supervisor until they could get one.i also went to many classes in Chicago to learn preventative maintenance, TIR and measure bearing play. the hardest part of my job was having supervise parts of the plant i do not know much about. also having to do all the firing of the third shift employees that had disobeyed direct rules or from the point system when they came in even if they was not in my department because the plant ran mostly on leadman on the off shifts. i also done random safety and quality checks at anytime in my shift."
good,"its a very good company, with great culture and ideals. A typical day at work its contacting suppliers and give follow up to orders. Ive learn logistics, working with freight companies, and a lot of the packaging industry."
good,Empresa padronizada fácil de aprender e competitiva.
good,"Excelente Empresa "
good,"Good job to work at, I would recommend this to someone looking for just a pay check. They're good with people, management just needs some adjustments."
good,"tis is a great place to work if you can get a line and stay on it, But the coming in everyday waiting to be placed on a line or sent home was not really worth the drive."
good,"On a  normal day, you stay busy"
good,"Westrock was the best paying job I have ever had, and it would seem there was a reason.  They had a lot of turnaround, and whenever there was an absence of an employee, the responsibilities would shift to someone else.  The reason I left was because I had been covering for absent workers for too long, and I got burned out."
good,Recently left Westrock after ten years.....my health and happiness are back. Good pay...but they want your soul in the end.....if I had to do it all over again ...i wouldn't.....absolute brain washing.....thay manage by fear....always reminding you your replacable.
good,"Westrock is a GREAT place to work for employees. Though I am a contractor, I was treated fairly and great respect, however, given very little opportunity for growth and further education (which actually should have been offered by the contracting company, Insight Global)."
good,If you like to work long weeks and have bad feet from standing on metal rollers all day then this is the job for you don’t get me wrong the pay is great along with the benefits and they give you food when they make you work weekends but that’s every weekend you’ll have no life because you’ll be too busy sleeping after working a 12 hour shift Again great pay horrible working conditions
good,Workplace culture was great. My coworkers are like my second family. Typical day at work was easy. Great place to work if you're looking for a job short term or long term.
good,"Great emphasis on safety, high turnover a challenge.  Good volume of business for job security.  Additional benefits/profit-sharing for hourly employees might improve turnover."
good,"My overall experience with this company was great. The team I work with on a daily basis is extremely kind and helpful. The upper management loves to spoil its employees on customer service week which makes you feel appreciated. You do however have to find your own way on this job. Training has to improve tremendously. When I began, there was zero hands on training and the job itself is very hands on. We received various lectures about time management, company values, and basics of the system. However, the only preparation you really have for the role is to shadow others and ask as many questions as possible. Once you're on your own and you make a costly mistake, you will get a lot of heat for it. Sure trial by error can help a person to grow and learn. But this company needed to encourage and educate new hires about what mistakes were fixable and what mistakes aren't. Prior preparation would save everyone time and money in the long run. Also knowing how to do certain processes from the get go and solidifying this knowledge with more hands on practice before being thrown to the wolves would be very helpful."
good,"Make box's for fast food..."
good,"ezpawn is a good company to work for, thats where i learned all my skills and grew as a pawnbroker. upper management does involve assistant managers in a lot of the inside of stores progress, can be a little discouraging not having the your managers support in a lot of important situations. customer experience is good but like everything else you come into a few difficult ones."
good,To many management favorites and if your not one of them then your screwed.  To much drama.  maybe its better now I don't know its been 8 yrs since I worked there
good,"The day shift was ideal for me and my children. The work was fairly easy. Management, you couldn't have asked for a better plant supervisor. Most of my co-workers were very friendly and helpful."
good,"Long days stressful "
good,Good place to work on average. Long days and workload can often be stressful. Trying to create team atmosphere.
good,if management had their act together this plant would be number one in the company across the board!
good,An industrial setting on the banks of the Appomattox River. From the parking lot to the job site was a walk of .2 of a mile. Office foundation was of part ash composite creating an unlevel structure.
good,Very good support to employees in regard to training and development. It also has good fringe benefits.
good,"Enjoy working at Rocktenn, constant changes everyday, keeps your mind working."
good,very good pay a lot of mandatory overtime start off on 2nd or 3rd shift hard to get on 1st management ask a lot from you when they dont want to do any thing
good,The job had good pay and good benefits. The customer service manager was a great manager to work for. The bad part of the job was they play favoritism too much.
good,"Westrock is a simple and fairly easy warehouse to work at. The other employees, leads and supervisors are friendly people and good people to work with."
good,The only thing WestRock did right by me was my separation checks at the in. I grew as a valuable worker there only to get underpaid. I did not enjoy my time at WestRock.

good,Working at West rock can be very stressful. The work/life is not very balanced. People are constantly leaving due to management issues. I am looking for an advancement in my career. I set high standards for myself and would like the opportunity to grow.

good,"Plant closing, (Former Cameo Container plant) "
good,"Workers are expected to work hard, but not too hard and are given plenty of breaks and water. The overseers for our group were generally laid-back but didn't let us laze around. For me, the hardest thing about the whole job was my grass allergy, which was easy enough to combat, and staying cool. It was definitely a satisfying feeling every payday."
good,"I enjoyed working at Rocktenn, The guys were hardworking and passsionate about their job. Its very fast paced work environment and you have to be on your game. The hardest thing about it is keeping the machines running and keeping up with the orders."
good,Co-workers and management was good to be around. Learned how to work hard and work as a team.
good,"Once i arrived to work, we would have a meeting about what i will be running on my line.Majority of the time it was the Little Caesar pizza box. Once i got that information i would go to my work station, inspect my glue unit, make sure it was running smooth. Then check my rolls of paper, make sure they were the right one for the run that shift. After all that i would check with my workers and give them 10 minutes to do their final checks before i started my machine."
good,"A typical day is spent cutting cores, general cleaning, machine operation, time management. I learned about the paper making process in its entirety, rope splices, changing felts. I learned how to work as a group and individual in a fast paced setting. I had a great group of knowledgable and experienced supervisors and worked with a really intelligent and hard working group of guys. The hardest part of the job was the heat and the physical labor. The most enjoyable part of the job was the job security, the people I worked with and the pay."
good,"The Shelby Plant was a very good place to work. Also the Latta S. C. plant has good management,people and work inviroment. I dealt with all of the plants in this region (south)and"

good,"Typical day: Fix machines."
good,"In my job, enjoyed working with the people and the job itself. the staff was pleasant, work fairly easy. most machines were self fed and working with corrugated board is a very easy job."
good,its ok for a person starting a first job its they need a better staffing company and better communication between the sstaffing agency and company period
good,"It's a easy job I started as a packer and move up to a first helper, and then to a operator there's always the opportunity no move up your self to get a better pay"
good,"I always start early checking all emails and voice messages for any Kudos or concerns from our customers.  Check on daily meetings and duties for the week.  As employees arrive I fill them in on any and all extra duties that are required for the day.  I also ensure along with the team that we check our Ricoh emails for add training for the day, week or month."
good,"management is totaly disconected from the rest of the plant. co-workers are great to get along with. Rock ten and MWV merger was the worst thing that ever happened. outsourcing jobs to mexico, people been working for 20-30 years are left without jobs."
good,"On a 12 hour shift I am very fast pace workplace that consist an getting the job done , always on the run , looking for any types of defects , making sure everything is correct to the customer standards . I work well with others and learn from them, also enjoy working with others and looking for new ways to do the job efficiently and safe. I also like to work as much as need it when need it."
good,Fast paced and team work with other individuals that is as hardworking as yourself. Leadership skills and better opportunities with the corporate. I learned to communicate more
good,UPS gave opportunity for teenagers to be able to go to school and work by giving them free money to pay for classes. One think is that we really had to work hard especially in hot days.
good,8 hr and 12 shifts sometimes overtime is mandatory. Learned alot about running flexo machines. Management was horrible. Summer time is the worst because of the temperature.
good,"Much was needed to be done an 8 hour shift, staying busy was key, communication in management was poor, co workers learned to work together in a tuff time, making sure all task where finished at the end of a work day. I enjoyed the challenge of trying to get all my work done."
good,All the employees got along and there was not any tension on the shift that I worked.We were also given sufficient breaks. Our line supervisor was the greatest as long as you did your job everything was great.
good,A typical day at work starts with a daily turnover report from the previous shift any safety violations or incidents and an on time delivery report witch consist of any dock times that need to be made find out if their are any call outs so that we can man any understaffed machinery. The hardest part of the job is not knowing when your work week will end. The most enjoyable part of the day is working with co workers that are family orriented and that works well with other employees to complete the day successfully
good,"A typical day at work would involve me standing in the same place for 8 hours in 103 degree temperature stacking boxes. I learned how to apply adhesive to boxes, how to count pallets, and problem solving skills. The management was very easy going, and easy to get along with. My co-workers were all very great people, I definitely enjoyed working with my team. The hardest part of the job was to stay awake. The most enjoyable part of the job was the paychecks."
good,At westrock they treat you like family and give you good benefits and they make you feel like you belong there and they make you feel appreciated and have good management
good,"-Fed machine, made boxes."
good,"i really enjoy it working here i met alot of people , managers was very nice , and coworkers too..."
good,"This is a great company with a fabulous corporate culture. They are one of the most respected companies to work for, with good reason. The IT Department is, however, another matter. They are poorly led, unfunded, overworked, and understand only one thing: metrics. Metrics dictate bonuses for managers, reviews from upper management, and the treatment of employees."
good,"A typical day at work includes audit assembly line, inspecting incoming materials, writing NCRs and answering quality related questions.  The management in this plant is reactive and manages through crisis.  My coworkers come from many different backgrounds and generally do their jobs with little drama."
good,"It's hard to get on days, everyone goes to 12 hr nights. So if u have a family with kids...this isn't a great place to work. But it does pay the bills you just don't have time for anything else."
good,"No work life balance. Typical work week 70 hours, including Saturday and sometimes Sunday. We are required to work any shift without notice. The demands for the job hired for are highly understated"
good,"He has know idea what his employees do and has know idea how long it takes to get shipment ready. He has three employees that do what they want and are not team players but he blames the rest of us that do our jobs and make sure it is done right, and when you say something to him about them not doing their jobs he just says everyone has to work as a team. He is trying to get rid on one of his best employee by treating them with their job if they don't fix what his favorite employees mess up. He is more worried about the SOP's he is suppose to do than getting shipments out to our customers which all our managers are. I hear that other plants are a good place to work, but here at the folding plant do to our new GM we have more accidents and customer returns sense he got here. Stress is out the roof and they can't keep good help. HR cares nothing ab out employees and you can tell becaues when you go to them they do nothing to help."
good,"Its an old building and very unsafe for the type of work you have to do, but they try thirty best to keep it a safe place to work"
good,"Long hours, long weeks. Good pay, horrible benefits. An at the time sucky management upper management. Everyone else was ok. Some back stabbing employees, an of course the guys that say ""I couldve helped"" after the fact."
good,Importação e Compras de material nacional sendo serviço e material (MRO)
good,"Empresa dinâmica e com grandes profissionais. Porém, possue gerentes e diretores resistentes as mudanças, decisões não profissionais e de cunho pessoal."
good,"There is a lot of potential for growth at this particular plant, however I'm not sure that the management can rally the troop's trust after years of missteps and wavering core values."
good,i schedule the production floor. i find all the books. and run lines
good,"Good place to work, excellent co-workers.  Overall excellent global company that thrives on innovation and sustainability.   Safety and quality are #1."
good,"i would not return if they would call me back, some of the supervisors at the facility i was located at dont treat all of the employees equally they have their favorites, titles were not given to some employees because then they would have to receive a pay raise so a lot of people are working doing jobs not in their job description without receiving the appropriate pay"
good,Learn while you work hard to get promotion within the company great experience to know about the box plant. Alot of hands on learning also alot of down time
good,"Have not worked there long enough to give a proper review I believe."
good,Its a job not a career. The hardest part of the job is the heat. I enjoy my coworkers they are all about making people laugh. The management has no idea what they are doing. One moment its finish this order then five minutes later they change their minds.
good,Great environment. Great management team. People work together to get the job done. Great respect for the employees. Amazing overall culture. Plenty of advancement opportunities
good,People are great and friendly. They are safety concious and take care of the employees. Hot environment. But if you work and show up your job is secure.
good,The company of westrock is a good place to work but i personal recomend work here  good benefit. The work environment is easy goin and no tu much stress.
good,This is a customer driven business and at times the work week will consist of less than 40 hrs and at other times 7 days a week based on customer demand
good,Great place to work just felt like was never going to have a chance to advance. My supervisor was less qualified than I was. Really enjoyed my job and the responsibility that went with it
good,"Great place to work and to get paid good money. However, when the things hits the fan management wont stand up for their workers. They say they don't have authority to do this or that but they do. The benefits from this job are well worth it. Healthcare, Great learning experience."
good,"The bigger you are the harder you fall. What used to be a family like atmosphere changed to micromanaging with bad managers... Became very ""corporate "" list many you'd people who like would have retired with them"
good,"Fast paced, mentally demanding, good people, union job. Many different jobs to learn and all are used in daily life. The hardest part is doing other peoples job and being used by management. The best part is the benefits and the retirement."
good,"A typical day at work included the following:"
good,"Eye opening experience to learn, evaluate, and analyze different projects at a pulp and paper plant.  I was thrown into the ring immediately and had to play real-world catch up. I feel this put me in a better place to realize exactly how real world operations work. My work was trusted and respected by the highest of authority, including the plant manager. "
good,"an every day habit is helping people and solving lots of problems. and trying to maintain my schedule. I ran 10 lines on third shift help train few drivers unloaded trucks put merchandise away and shipped it on the other side by loading trucks for out bound trailers. worked 7 days a week fro 25 months straight, and between 8-16 hours a day."
good,"Prepared printing machines prep,learned how to run and operate 1'st Helper Flex Folder Gluer and 1""st Helper Medium Size Koppers Flexo Folder Gluer.Fair team players,making qutoa; knowing we made our ofjective and completed in a timely manner."
good,"For person like me, current job location is not fit and will be looking for a job closer to a big city. Lack of young people my age that I would be able to interact with outside of work is another big factor."
good,"25 years of work history is evidence enough of my loyalty to WestRock. Culture is driven from top down. Managers committed to driving improvement in safety production, quality and cost."
good,It was a fair place to work.  They had fair compensation and required a little more than average overtime.  I enjoyed the people I worked with and the challenge of the work.
good,Westrock is an alright place to work. Only cons are Management is always changing. The Lebanon facility has had 3 different general managers in the past few years. I personally have had 4 different department managers and several different leads. The work schedule has also changed allot. The work isn't hard. Good job security.
good,Westrock provides the capability to ensure a comfortable lifestyle for your family.  Although it does require you spend more time at work then at home.
good,Westrock is a good place to work.  Plenty of hours and top of the line equipment with the highest technology in the industry.  I enjoy working with my employees.
good,"Its was a very hard job to do.i liked the people i worked with "
good,Good people to work with. Good place to work. Not as good of a job as it used to be. Pay has been decreased and the work load and employee expectations have been increased.
good,"Very difficult time, work difficult to find. Enjoyed job, but only a temp.I was subbing for a associate on Med leave. When associate returned I was let go."
good,"Busy shipping office and busy work environment. Received orders, added to spreadsheet and adjusted in computer program. Copied and filed papers,entered data, and received, responded to and directed emails. Learned about the production and processing of paper."
good,If you like an environment where there are always challenges and many opportunities to advance this is the place to work.
good,Expectations of a position change daily with projects added faster than they can be completed with out the resources for the task. Onsite management good to work with but off site HR only show up to be cruel and uncaring.
good,Well my last job i worked on the corrugator i would come and prep these huge rolls of paper! When i say prep make sure that roll was in good shape before it was hung on the machine to run basically the corrugator made the boxes for the machines on the other side that put the ink on the boxes. The corrugator was a fun machine because it was fast paced! It kept you busy all day. My co-workers taught me a lot. The hardest part of my job was making sure that my measurements on my paper were right the length and width. when the boxes were made those measurements had to be right.
good,"Learned how to use different software packages such as JD Edwards, CForia, Sales Order Management (SOM). Co-workers were great to work with and very helpful. Management needed to find better ways to communicate goals and expectations to staff."
good,They are great. Really enjoyed workibg shutdowns and such with the company. Management has always shown employees with gratefulness fun atmosphere. I would definitely work for west rock again
good,"I have been with the company at this facility for a few years now, I can't say I desagree with some of the negative comments I have read so far, but honestly very few of them are true. I have seen people come and go, some of the best and some of the worst... what you put into it is was what you will get out of it. If you have the discipline and the drive to learn, the sky is the limit. “Leadership” can only put a cap on your check, but not on your knowledge or your work ethic. That door swings both ways, my advice would be know your true value, work to improve on it, and that’s something no one can take away from you, and the money will come, whether it’s from WestRock or anyone other place."
good,"lots of overtime available. daily challenges in maintenance.  24/7  operating.  union work.  I personally dont think the union supports all the employees,  stewards are self motivated"
good,Sorting and packing box’s for fast food restaurants. The person who trained me did a awful job . She didn’t speak English and it was very hard for me to understand what she was saying to me at all times . Paid trained was also provided but I still had a hard time .
good,"For the most part it's a fast-paced environment; however, people strive to help one another. People I worked with were supportive and family oriented."
good,"Westrock is a good company to work with in general. Although it depends on which facility to work with. The facility I was working with, for example, was a 3 out of 5 score due to the culture itself. As a design assistant, I have learnt a lot more than from the school, the skills, knowledge, attitude, etc."
good,"Company in constant growth, it allows you to interact with different departments, such as Customer service, sales, accounts, and let you manage and make decitions that impcat customer satisfaction, towards delivering their product in time and with quality."
good,"This could be a great place to work and to retire from, the job is okay and some days 12 hours flies by. "
good,"Nice company to work for, no issues. They collaborate well & listen to suggestions from staff. Management has an open door policy & I feel comfortable offering any ideas to help better the company."
good,Long hours and it is very hot inside the warehouse. The pay is very good and might honestly be worth it if you need that summer money. Hours are gauranteed with OT available.
good,"Two mill management teams: 1) initial management team was top notch, one bad project and team was dismantled. 2) second management team was all inclusive with the team members they brought from another location. 3) next management team, after my departure... back to a good work situation and environment."
good,Forklift operator pulling the production line loading and unloading trucks. keeping the warehouse stocked using an RF scanner.
good,It does get warm but everyone makes sure that you don't overheat. You do go through a safety training class but the rest of the training you have to pick up fast.
good,"As in most occupations, you must take the good with the bad.  My tenure as Westrock has been difficult because I was forced to work overnight for over four years.  It is difficult to maintain a normal lifestyle with a wife and kids when you work nights and weekends.  It is a job that will help you pay bills but can be difficult because the cost of living moves much faster than pay rates."
good,"Not bad overall need better facility otherwise (no ac factory) not a requirement, obviously, but would have made experience better. Great place to get a start in the industry"
good,"Very big company, lots of work. Very good people there , my co-workers are awesome. Lots of good experience learn and shared. This company is always expanding."
good,"Didn't get much of a chance to work with them, since they shut mill down within 2 months of purchasing the mill....but working with SP Newsprint was a long and good working relationship..."
good,"I took this job in order to survive.  Had a small business which went under, had no health insurance, had a lot of bills to pay.  It's not the worst job I've ever had, but far from the best."
good,"This is the only place that I have ever worked that I would almost say ""I love my job"".  After multiple years under the same combative manager and no action, I ended my employment."
good,"The work day felt the same every single day. The machines constantly broke down and everyone's attitude was constantly terrible. The workers constantly belittled the minority groups (race, gender) in the workplace. However, all of the workers treat each other like family. They stick together when the times get tough."
good,WestRock has treated me and my family fairly. I ensure my crews are safe and making production goals. Everyday is something new. The insurance and pay is excellent.
good,"There's a gap between management and the staff whereas the views of the end goal is obscure. Otherwise great company."
good,"Sometimes HR decisions are not applied equally through all facilities. Being the only HR person at this plant, the workload is extreme, handling 370+ employees, and when help is requested nothing is done. Therefore I lose vacation days and paid holidays."
good,"Westrock is a fast paced environment that i3s both challenging and rewarding.  New management however changed the culture and transparency is gone, so we all have to wonder what may happen next."
good,"At Westrock I worked independently for the most part.  I maintained machinery and jobs were inspected so that they would run properly. Put Dies together to be run, I was a lead in the Safety team, we did drills regularly."
good,"I enjoy working at Westrock. the company has organization and structure. Fast paced environment. There is some automation, a lot of manual packing process with the use of temp labor to pack displays."
good,I have learned a lot working for them. You can max out on your abilities and what you can do inside of the small office setting.The management is very seasoned.
good,Boa para trabalhar  e sempre com novos desafios. na carreira
good,"I have learned a lot of key skills that will help me advance in the future. A typical day consists of order entry, follow-up, problem solving, and customer contact."
good,"RT, now WestRock, was a great, great opportunity.  The people were great and the opportunities seemed to exist if you seriously wanted to build a career with the company."
good,"Great place to work , but rotating shifts take it's toll. When you start getting older, it really effects your life and your sleep. I can't sleep for more than 4 hours at any given time. Not making excuses, but rotating shifts take 11 years off your life."
good,"great job, family structure."
good,"Get information from person that's runs machine prior to your shift. You always learn something new everyday when working with digital machines. They can be very challenging, but if you have a good work ethic, nothings too difficult"
good,"The expectations are constantly changing.  The company was bought and sold twice in five years.  It appears unstable.  Very few women in leadership.  Because of so many changes, everyone is always trying to make a name for themselves."
good,"Was a fast paced work. Management was demanding, However the workers made it worth working there. Learned several different skills. From driving a fork truck to operating machines."
good,This is the same company as Corpak and Westrock.  Many similarities even in management.  Very demanding at work with little time for kids and family.
good,"Typical day is working on assigned task trouble shooting production equipment and daily p.ms "
good,care about everyone's safety at all times.  Very nice people to work with and something to learn there everyday.  good place to be
good,WestRock was a good place to work between the people with their knowledge and the way everyone cared about each other and how safety was everyones main concern.
good,Was my first job..was a temp..the job closed. I liked working there. Really wish I could go there again or a job like that.
good,The work place is not only a great plant to work for but also respective people that work around you. everybody is there to help you out when you need it.
good,Safety conscience company with an equally demanding production environment. Corporate technical resource group and corporate engineering is very helpful and knowledgeable.
good,"Technically challenging, good hard working people."
good,Very relaxed. Sometimes unorganized. My experience there was great. Lots of opportunity for engineers since there are so many capital projects taking place.
good,"Um local tranquilo , seguro e agradável de tabalhar, a gerência é muito competente, colegas comprometidos com seu trabalho, e muitos dispostos a nos ajudar. A parte difícil são as urgências, que muitas vezes não são fáceis de resolver, e a parte agradável é o trabalho em si,a comunicação, interação com outros departamentos."
good,A typical day involves me monitoring the DCS screens that controls the flow of our product (water/stock). I also communicate with my other colleagues in other departments to ensure everything is on the same page when creating cardboard material.
good,"Fast paced,corrugated packaging plant, aggressive management, good pay for hard work. Fair benefits package offered. Competitive wages. Extreme weather environment."
good,This is a very solid company with growth potential. You are working at a fast pace with many responsibilities. There are many systems to learn.
good,"a lot of overtime 6 to 7 day weeks, decent money, management seems fair, short breaks, not really a balance between work and home life"
good,My coworkers were very friendly and they were also concern of your well-being. RockTenn is an example of a family based business. We cared about one another. My job was to basically help the engineers with making their diagrams paperless and allowing all drawings to be filed in the computer to make them easier to look up
good,I started this company knowing that I would be only working for them a short time as I wanted to get hired in as a full time employee. I got promoted to line lead very quickly. I worked very hard and never missed work. I enjoyed working with the staffing company but needed to make more money and have job security.
good,I work with great people who are committed to excellence. Each day is an adventure that requires creativity and a team approach.
good,Great company with an intense focus on Corporate culture.  Made decisions with shareholder return in mind.  Great company to invest in.
good,you work 8-12 hours a day for 6 days a week. its a job that you spend most of your waking hours and sacrafice a social life for.
good,"Good company to work for, good compensation. Culture is a work-in-progress, stemming from a very large acquisition. Serious corporate environment - may not be particularly appealing for younger workers."
good,I enjoy working at Rock Tenn.  I really like my co-workers and my manager.  It is a lot of work that keeps you constantly busy and we all help each other especially at month end.
good,While working on the floor I learned what it is like to work in the extreme heat. I was able to achieve the goals I set forth through the help of my coworkers.  I increased my ability to prioritize and work effectively with deadlines.
good,"My day generally  consisted of finding a way to make happen everything that needed to be accomplished no matter what the obstacles were in front of me. I quickly learned how to become the type of person to always make it happen. I was well respected and worked well with my piers. The hardest part of the job was accepting second place when the time came. The most enjoyable part of the job was watching the machine, crew and plant develop into something to be proud of."
good,"work alot of overtime, fun place to work and the managment is nice"
good,"The hardest part of the job was the intense physical labor. "
good,Good location. Buildings are lovely. Days are long. Not for the faint of heart.
good,lb build cardboard pallets and to assist operators in operating task of a machine
good,I work a 12 hour rotating shift. On a typical day I make equipment checks hourly. I take samples of our product and test for consistency and quality. I have learned a great deal about the paper making process. I have also learned how to operate various forms of heavy equipment proficiently. Great co-workers who care about making a quality product and making sure we all go home safe at the end of the day. The hardest part of the job is trying to keep our aging equipment operating efficiently. The most enjoyable part of my job is the great feeling of accomplishment I get when my shift is over.
good,The company produces paperboard for many consumer products.
good,Somewhat of an odd schecule but over all a decent place to work
good,I enjoyed the fast paced atmosphere. Co-workers were all cool and down to earth. I learned safety tips and Lock out tag out.
good,"It was a good company to work for 17 years ago."
good,"Worked here for almost 25 years "
good,A typical day would be assisting co-workers with system or process related issues. There was a huge management turnover in the years of my employment therefore leadership within the organization was suffering.
good,Expectations are straight forward.  Its hard work and the company rewards employees for working safely.  Strong emphasis on creating a safety oriented environment.
good,Everyday was different and ther was never a dull moment.  I learned how to manage my time while juggling several projects at once.  My favorite part of my job was working with the customers and co-workers
good,"Nice environment, but cut throat. Good salary, but you're expected to not have a life outside of work."
good,"busy days.manager easy to get along with,coworkers great, hard getting up early every morning"
good,"Corrugated Box supplier in Columbus, IN."
good,"I run a feeder on a Heidelberg Press, which includes keeping up with the different jobs, filling the ink fountains, cleaning the ink fountains, dampening solution fountains, adjust controls, load feeder with paper, adjust feeder, upload printed material. Maintenance on press, managing print orders and requirements. Courteous relationship with coworkers. Ten to fifteen miles of walking in 12 hour shift, long hours with rotating shifts from 1st to 3rd."
good,Not there long enough to really review well. Enjoyed the work and advanced fairly quickly but the plant closed shortly after promotion.
good,I work from 7am to 5pm Monday through Friday. I start my day by having a meeting with the Maintenance Manager to see what needs to be done for the day. I will make sure that the parts are ordered in a timely manner. I also find out where the parts are that have been ordered. I review the parts that need to be ordered and make sure that the purchase orders are done for these parts. I also do a cycle count on the parts in the storeroom that are high moving parts and make sure everything is right in the computer system. I have learned a new computer program with this company. My manager is a very understanding and kind person. He helps me with what I need in the way of tools for my job. My co-workers are for the most part very helpful also when there is a problem. The hardest part of my job is telling people I don't have time to do something. I want to please and help with everything that is possible. I enjoy being in the storeroom by myself so that I can think of new ways to better my storeroom. I also have a hard time doing charts for the storeroom.
good,One of the best jobs i had wouldn't have left if it wasn't for them shutting down my factory i really wanted to retire from this place. The benefit was good and weekly pay checks and safety bonus checks always help
good,Was a good job the workers get on great but the managers haven’t a clue what they are doing they come in and tell everyone what to do but they don’t know what it’s like to be out there working they just walk around and don’t even do anything but the workers in there get on well
good,"As A shipping supervisor it was a high stress job and environment, but the management supported you. great employees to work with. very clean and safe enviroment."
good,Westrock has great benifits and training for all employees. Work and overtime provided for its employees. They have stock options and paid vacation. Depending on your time vacation was up to five paid weeks. Westrock also had many other programs with other local businesses for employee discounts. Their 401k benefits was matched and getting loans on it was very easy for employees.
good,"Its good to work in this company, as it helps to develop the ability to work in fast pace environment. the only thing I hate is the job is not secure."
good,Great co-workers company is strict with attendance policy and points.sets you up for failure with their expectations. union is worthless.easy work....
good,"The job was very competitive that made it a challenge, but since I had support for my team I had a better than average chance on exceeding previous years goals."
good,"Nice place to work, especially for non contractor. "
good,The place had many benefits and good salary. The difficult part was having to work crazy hours unexpectedly. The job work/life balance definitely needed some work.
good,Management is decent and will work with you on your needs. It is good place to start off with and get different experiences in IT as well customer service skills.
good,When I left the company was Rock-Tenn. I am not certain what the culture is like now since it has changed names more than once and has merged with another company.
good,"Used to be a great place, now new management is starting to drive it into the ground. Everyday coworkers are the only thing that make the job any good."
good,always wanting more from employees. never satisfied or appreciative towards employees and the sacrifices they make to make the company productive. just not family oriented
good,Small town but its right next to wi Dells. Housing is hard to find in this area for temporary employment. Over all its a great learning experience for any packaging major.
good,"Westrock was a very fast paced job. Though the pay was ok , I don't think that I would think twice about working at the establishment anymore. It truly just wasn't for me from gbe scheduling to the work."
good,"great people, fast paced. great benefits, weekly pay, physical work, extreme weather on cold days or hot. union befits, short commute to work, over all a great company"
good,"Come in check audit trackers for employees audit records. "
good,Good place to work if you can work 60+ hours every week. Constant power struggle in management gets old but pretty good people all in all. I would recommend it to anyone who is wanting to make good money and doesn't car how many hours and what shift they work.
good,"Worked at WestRock for 30 years.  Able to develop trusting relationships with customers, both internally and externally.  Enjoyed the fast paced atmosphere and the ability to be creative with the corrugated product WestRock produced.  Very safety conscious about employees at work as well as at home.  The Beloit facility is one of the top corrugated sheet plants .in the industry"
good,Work hours are hectic . The place is hot in summer but its agreat company with a lot of benefits and employee friendly . Uniforms are provided and washed by cintas
good,"Uma empresa que pressa muito pela segurança do funcionário,mais infelizmente não tem plano de carreira."
good,"shift relief person, trained to filled in for people requesting RDO and people calling in sick and vacation training shipping, receiving, driving bob cat, fork lift, clap truck and various machines."
good,"I would have stayed there for ever but they sold the plant and slowly closed the doors. They have plants all over but don't pay as good and would not even let people transfer to other plants . Had a good time while I was there, don't know anything about other plant's they have, can't be that bad."
good,The job ends August 31st and my husband and myself needs a job . I have met many great people and I have enjoyed working with everyone. This company has helped me and my family for years
good,I truly enjoyed my job and took pride in doing it the right way.  I love working with inventory and the process of taking a new order and following the process all the way to product going out the door.
good,"Nice place to work, safe environment, lots of weekends. Very safe culture.  Workplace balance is not that good. I enjoy working here"
good,"Not for everyone. Management is very ambitious and the culture is hard charging. Certain employees flourish, others do not."
good,I was just a temp but it was a pretty good place to work. If you can get on full time you can make pretty good money but it is 12 hour shifts and it gets boring after awhile. The people are pretty good though.
good,"Fairly OK company have provided steady work no major complaints"
good,"Short mtng. before start of shift to pass out line assignments. Monitor production, Make sure guidelines are being followed. Learned how to follow work orders, etc. Hardest part, having to rely on temp workers to fulfill assignments. When all quotas were met."
good,"operating a high volume high speed machinery.Experience in an ISO 2008-certifiled ,sharp recognized plant.And great co worker focus on making great mill paper .and making sure at the end of the day every one go home safe and no lost time due to accidents."
good,I enjoyed working here for many years. I leaned a lot and enjoyed working with my coworkers. the mill went 13+ years without a lost time.
good,"I was a normal eight hour shift"
good,"Competitive and driven environment. Culture of respect and collaboration. Good place to grow career, develop skillsets and meet incredible people."
good,"I work at a smaller plant for WestRock, the company seems to only care about their large plants and not their small locations."
good,Company tries to attract quality personnel and works to create a fun and productive culture. Serious about company image and product. Compensation package can be more competitive.
good,I have been there since August and seen at least 20 people come and go. rules change apon the employee and I feel it should be the same across the board for all employees.  There are things I see wrong with the management and don't care for there employees.
good,"Es una muy buena empresa para hacer carrera profesional, promueve a su gente a ascender de puesto en lugar de llevar a alguien de fuera y lo más importante se preocupa por la seguridad de sus trabajadores, así como la de su familia."
good,It is never a dull day...always learning something that will benefit the company as well as the department.
good,"just a number, good pay,benefits,12hr days 6 days wk no family time no incenitive program or profit sharing . company is known for pushing employees production numbers to extreme with no recognition."
good,"Even though you had to make line it was a great place to work"
good,I oversee production of the manufacturing of corrugated boxes from a multiple machines.  I process paper work and employee relations for my shift.
good,Management kept to the old way of doing things and staff that had been there did not want to utilize or learn new ways of doing the job.
good,"Considering my previous warehouse experience, other than learning different operating machines, I had all of the knowledge that I needed to be an asset to the company."
good,"Great company but the hours are long and some positions are extremely physical. I have one that is very physical. Pay and benefits are amazing but always work lots of hours, 48+ each week on 12hr shifts and non existant home life has led me to seek other employment."
good,"You become close to the people you work with - the atmosphere becomes like family. The culture can be stressful as with any job, but the management is always available to help!"
good,well starting the days was good when i started i was on nights and they work 12 hr shifts swing shift witch i love to work . the start of the shift i would go check up with the day shift crew see what jobs they finished or didnt finish witch jobs needed to be done asap then check on the materials and if i needed to stock up if any and just keep the machine rolling to keep next dep stocked with work
good,The people at westrock are great. It's a very chill environment on 2nd shift and the bosses are nice. The pay sucks so it depends on if ur willing to give up good pay for good work environment
good,"I enjoy working here; however, employees tend to stay in his/her position for long periods of time and are oftentimes the only one in that position so advancements do not come very often. At the plant level everyone, including the managers, are very helpful and welcoming. The organization does a lot of community involvement projects which is great and encourages community outreach among the employees."
good,"Competitive  but relative place to work after the training is done "
good,I have only one week and I feel this is a good company to work for. The people is nice. That have a lot of policies. Great Co-Worker. But too much time until you get the benefits.
good,"Westrock had an open office setting where it is easy to go collaborate or ask questions from other employees. "
good,Enjoyed the time spent there . Sometimes wish it would’ve been better . Enjoyed the time spent with ci - workers  & stuff . The head managers wasn’t really doing their part or didn’t really feel like there part was relevant.
good,Overall a good place to work.  Disappointed at rule bending at the local level.  Conflict of interest exists in my opinion.  Head turning exists.  Some really great managers and employees and some riding the gravy train bc they are allowed to.
good,When i started working there it was amazing but by the end i was work 12 hour shifts 6 days a week to cover people not showing up or because we were so far behind with products
good,"Westrock is a good company with decent benefits. Being close to the major refineries they are a excellent place to start training and gaining experience in process operations. They are also a great company to work for, for the long term to retirement. Unfortunately being a older plant there is a lot of issues with equipment not being kept up to standards due to lack of maintenance personal or budgeting. It truly gives a green operator ways to learn more about the process they work with daily and how to overcome those obstacles."
good,"Enjoyed my work here.  My manager provided me with a lot of independence and leaned on my technical abilities.  I took the job knowing it was a LONG commute.  No one forced me to do so.  After a time, the commute became unsustainable and the company culture did not support teleworking as a long-term solution."
good,"Well Oiled Machine.  Management worked with employees to get the job done when it was Rocktenn.  Various opportunities for individuals and great benefits like Insurance, 401K Match and family leave."
good,People there were and awesome group. I was able to work independently without having management being over my shoulder. It was like working with a big group of friends.
good,Fast paced work place. Need to be able to think on the fly. A lot of hours but you are payed well for the time. Company does what it can to take care of employees.
good,"good company to work for. Benefits are outstanding and a good 401k"
good,"This was CONCIDER an second job or AND backup for me.. the PAY could always be better, but the extra hours MAKE up for that... I WOULD highly recommend this job for beginners..."
good,"Good place to work, but they need to look over their vacation policy.  CEO is very down to earth and approachable.  The executive leadership team at WestRock has a very nice strategy and only good things can come of it.  WestRock has an excellent future."
good,If you're looking for a job and if you need one desperately go there. it's very fast-paced and a bit overwhelming at times but it will definitely pays out well.
good,Good environment to work at.  Needs some help in the area of management to provide more guidence on priorities.  I would rate the company on the whole at a 75 out of 100.
good,Overall my experiance with Westrock has been good. As part of the Maintenance team i would come in and have a handover from third shift as to how things ran overnight. I would then check the lines myself and go about doing Pm's
good,"Each person on the team was from different parts of the country, but the managers pulled all of us together to work in sync."
good,when i would go in to work i would work on a machine all day ...  i learned who to work in machines .... the hardest part of the job was doing the same thing every day .... the most enjoyable part of the job were the people i worked with
good,"Every day is different  and never boring.  I have the autonomy to do my job, grow and development in my interest areas and apply my knowledge to help our business succeed.  Facilitating personal and career development in others is by far the most rewarding aspect of my job.  I love to see people grow, learn  and succeed."
good,Great job challenge.  Good work environment. I worked Shutdowns for this company. Well managed.  Good communication.  Co-workers excellent.  Worksite is well organized.  No job security.
good,"Was once a great place to work.  Management needs to have an open mind to new ideas from current employees.  Middle mgt is trained to have to ""my way or the highway"" way of thinking."
good,"Pros:"
good,Great oportunities and lots of team player skills needed.  The only down fall is that orders slowed down.  Not sure what the reason was for the decrease in the work load.
good,Everyone knows what they are doing and helping each other out if there's any issues with machinery. Great benefits for everyone plus plenty of overtime for people to earn extra cash.
good,"Benefits decent, pay is below national avg., 401k plan is good. Like all production companies: Higher-ups want more boxes made, from aging machinery."
good,"Not a bad place to work, mgmt needs to learn how to talk to employees. Need to show appreciation for a job well done, in addition to finding the root cause of a problem."
good,"read drawings and blueprints"
good,Most of the time I am on a gluer machine. I have learned a lot from working at WestRock. The hardest part of the job is the 12 hour shift and standing all day. I would recommend this company.
good,"I provide a safety management for 100 employees by ensuring compliance training, federal and state regulatory standards are met and addressing hazards in the work environment for the employees. "
good,westrock is not bad place to work making spray bottle pumps on two different machines in one area the management  could be better the co workers stay to them selves for most part the hardest part of the job is standing in one area for 8hrs the most enjoyable part is the employees
good,"greeted all customers and visitors.  directed visitors to the correct location.  weighed in and out all trucks. Entered all information into the computer system. handled incoming calls to the scale house."
good,"A typical work day consists of clocking in, and packing displays for various companies that will be shipped out to stores such as: Walmart and CVS. I learned the behind-the-scenes of what goes into putting the displays together. As far as management, I learned that it can be stressful but it pays off in the long run. My co-workers are for the most part very nice, helpful, and a joy to be around. The hardest part of the job is when reworks have to be done, and the most enjoyable part of the job is when things are done right the first time and the order goes by fast."
good,"A good company in a highly commoditized industry. Life/work balance is good and the people are great to work with. A full line of packaging products and services to offer customers. Good supply chain development from paper mills, converting plants, display manufacturing to reclamation services."
good,Great place to work. Look forward to going to work. My supervisor is great and really cares about his employees. The work is challenging and always makes me think and revise my management of my temps.
good,"managing a small team to make sure we reach required production numbers. learned how to work in difficult situation , im a social person to get along with. hardest part of my job was to maintain consistency in production ..... but i always loved the challenge everyday"
good,"A typical day at work:"
good,Great place to explore different training opportunities as well as a wonderful culture of people.
good,Work was easy and same thing every day. Made you want to take long breaks
good,Smurfit-Stone was a troubled company bought by RockTenn.  I have nothing else to say about Smurfit-Stone.
good,Great place to work. Room for advancement. Management always available and empowered employees to make decisions based on accountability and ownership.
good,"Keeping up with equipment, data entry, learning peachtree accounting"
good,"not a bad place to work, learn how to become a good operator "
good,Fast pace with tremendous responsibilities. Florida Area Manager great to work with & for.  
good,Its def6not the best job in the world but paying the bills is about all I get out of it.  Management doesn't really care about you and if your on 3rd shift they make you work the day of a holiday
good,"A work day consist of cold calling and putting in orders. I have learned to be more organized and how to manage my time. Management can be helpful but I do most things on my own, if you want it done right you always need to do it yourself. My workplace is a little hard to make a connection with other employees but other than that I can not complain. The hardest part of my job is to accept all of my failures to continue to enjoy when I do have a win. The most enjoyable part of my job is the freedom I have."
good,"I was a Assistant Design Coordinator for Westrock for 4 years. I thoroughly enjoyed my employment and the growth I experienced. In my case, I came in with no experience but they were willing to teach me."
good,"“Displays” part of company "
good,Good place to work! Not much room for growth and constantly worry about your job being eliminated.  Never enough help to get things done and very political. Great culture other than that.
good,"I was able to talk with coworkers this out rush and was able to get to know them. I learned a lot about packaging while I was there. "
good,"Good learning enviroment, good pay. Management gave you the freedom to to use your skills to get the job done.Company was willing to invest in the lates technology"
good,"HR was excellent, helpful and supportive. Supervisor was weak and disengaged."
good,"Great paying job with room to advance if your work ethic is superb. Straight shifts, no rotation. It gets very tiring & weary on third shift. Other than that it’s a good place."
good,If your all about money it’s the place to go. It has good employees also management but it is not for everyone. The shift work is also hard to deal with.
good,"There were no typical days, Everything changes day to day.You just had to be prepared and rely on your experience,and the knowledge of coworkers always."
good,Depends on who you’re working with there’s a lot of good and a lot of bad just like any place it’s reallt what you make it but a lot of lazy workers trying to take initiative to get a raise won’t be worth your time just a lot of body’s they don’t care too much about how well you’re performing as long as you’re a half decent worker
good,The people and the company are great but the long and mandatory 12 hr shifts can be stressful and tiring after a week or 2. Some employees love the overtime but some people can be stuck working 12 hr shifts for 6 days a week for months at a time to help keep up with productivity and customer demands.
good,Muito boa empresa trabalhei 2 anos e 4 meses não tenho de que reclamar excelente; melhor da região.          Tenho saudades muito boa mesmo.
good,Like a lot of companies there seems to be a lot of the attitude of not micro managing and let people do what they want . Mananagment needs to step up the game here and put a foot down on some activities .
good,"The Human Resources person is horrible. Very rude and never follows through. Good luck getting a returned phone call or an interview. It’s excuse after excuse. "
good,If you love physical labor this is the job for you. You will gain skills in various fields that will be very beneficial to your career. This employer also has room for growth.
good,"it would depend on your work load ,some days are very hard and fast past , and some are a little more relaxed depending on the schedule. Management was alright , and my co workers were like familywhile i was there i learned how to work on different machines , and how to work in timely fachion."
good,"Check down time from night shift. walk the line check for any problems. order parts, help when needed, improve shop. Work with vendors for cost. Worked on safety team and improvements."
good,"Not much to say. It was a decent job and I got a competitive wage for my job. Management is good to work with you.  Would recommend. I was at the Latta Street location.... If they're hiring, check it out!"
good,the pay was good training program has some bugs that are curtly being worked on management is ok never really talked to them work place is good as long as you go and do your job
good,"RockTenn was a good place to work. They compensated me well, and the company had some options for advancement. They had a tuition reimbursement program as well. Sometimes the hours were long, but that is not unexpected in a journeyman maintenance role."
good,Solid company with a lot of up side.  Fast pace enviorment with lost of opportunity for improvement.  Awesome core values with a focus on employee safety.  Love the people that I work with.  It can be challenging sometime being that I'm on call every night.
good,Located in a small town. Everyone was like family. Managers stayed at this location. Was not a lot of turnover with employees. The plant had just the right amount of salaried employees so you were not doing the job of 2-3 people.
good,"Job was most enjoyable, a typical day at work included lots of variety.  I improved my organizational skill and review my priorities minute by minute.  It was very busy and people are great to work with."
good,They were very good to me. I would still be there if I wouldn't have had to take an extended time off for personal reasons. Most of the people where good to work with some where not.
good,"Local agradável , mas deixava a desejar no termo de evoluir com a empresa, era minima a chance de oportunidade ."
good,"You can quickly move up to machine Operator and make decent money but they will kill you with overtime.  I am not a disgruntled employee but they will constantly lie to you and give you hope of possibly having the weekend off and they hit you with a 12 hour shift.  It's funny now that I think back on it.  Pay is good but sometimes, money is not everything."
good,"Fast paced, great co-workers, good supervisors, understanding managers, challenging work, never boring atmosphere"
good,Muito boa relação com colegas de trabalho do setor e áreas de atendimento da fábrica.
good,"A typical day at work would be to answer all emails from customers, quoting jobs in FileMarker Pro & Adobe Illustrator, assembling and new work for artists, coordinating that work.  Ensuring that deadlines are meet by all.  Speaking with production in regards to capacity with the schedule to ensure deliveries are meet.  Communicate with production in regards to how orders will/can be produced.  Speaking with other locations in regards to the influx of work they may have that are not able to complete."
good,Nice company to work for they make you feel appreciated and they value their employees. I would recommend them to my friends and family.
good,place that you can move up in if you put in the time. There is always over time. Great team of people that work together. Would go back to work for them.
good,"Great place to grow and build a career.  Regardless of background, if you put forth the effort you can succeed.  Several roles available to expand."
good,"I was involve in third shift were I would walk clock in on my time sheet and place it in a box were others put there's. Rock Tenn built plastic products such as bowls, toolboxes, drawers, and other plastic  "
good,"Everyday at RockTenn varies.  Most days there is a morning meeting in which I update the management team on the safety status of the mill.  The rest of my day consists on touring the mill, safety committee and sub-committee meetings, program updating and ensuring compliance with MIOSHA and corporate regulations. Working in a facility with three different unions has taught me valuable management, and communication skills.  The overall culture in the mill needs to improve. There is a deep divide between the management and hourly personnel.  Like any facility, some co-workers are great to work with and others are not.  Many of the hourly individuals are good people, but due to the culture they have developed ""rough edges"".  The hardest part of my job is finding a middle ground between management and hourly individuals.  At this point, many of the individuals working on the floor believe that management does not really care for their safety.  It is hard to develop a true safety culture, because the employees will not join in safety activities, in fear that nothing will get done and that it is a waste of time.  The most enjoyable part of my job is working with the individuals that do the work, to improve their job quality.  My tasks vary by day, and each day brings a new surprise."
good,"Review schedule to material availability and demand, prioritize staff to respond to needs and changes, set the staff and crew to obtain the goals, and monitor production and provide customer feedback."
good,"Overall good place to work, great people, great benefits. some long days some weekends, enjoyable part is knowing that we made a great product and that the customer is happy,"
good,"day of work is filled jokes and laughter,importence of team work,its hard never knowing what days you are off,but just working hard making things happen is the best part of the job"
good,"I loved it at RockTenn. My duties were...Maintained all accounts payable reports and spreadsheets"
good,"A typical day at work for me included setting up my machine (hand stitcher) and monitoring the product.  We had to follow the orders per the specifications of the customers so it involved alot of detailed and specialized work. I enjoyed my co-workers and it was a nice, positive place to work.  I don't think any part of my day was particularly hard because it was mostly enjoyable.  I was also on the safety committee for several years with responsibilities for coming up with ideas for safety improvements."
good,"Long hours, management is always changing. Great people to work with.  The hardest part of the job is being short staffed."
good,Most training is done as you are on the job. There is much autonomy as you are working in the field looking for material. Would recommend this company for those who are looking for a challenging career in the recycling business.
good,The overall work day is typically 8 hrs but can sometimes require 12 hrs during high season. The Memphis facility is not climate controlled during the summer but the company maintains adequate air circulation. The environment is generally friendly and the benefits packages are very good. The hardest part of the job is not having many off days during the high season but the easiest part of the job is motivating your line crew to increase production while maintaining quality. 
good,"The work environment is hot and somewhat dirty, but you know what's expected of you. Work assignments are clear and you will get into the machinery on every level. Most of the people are pretty good to work with."
good,"I have been with this company for over thirteen years and I have learned so much. We were a productive manufacturing facility that had a very hard working group of people who made coming to work an enjoyable experience. And it was with great sadness that the company made the decision to close this facility. So after 13 years, I am again on the job market at no fault of my own. I have worked with many good managers that I will miss. Managers that gave me the oppurtunity to grow and the support to do so."
good,"My typical work day consisted of first a morning safety meeting 2nd machine production and quality performance. I also operated a fork truck a lot through the years. I learned a lot about safety and safety procedures. I learned a lot about quality and teamwork. The hardest part of my job was the physical labor, hand loading,product into machine at a very fast pace.. and it was very heavy. The most enjoyable part of the job was working with coworkers who were good friends throughout time at the company. The management could have been better."
good,I enjoyed my work and my co-workers. Each day was a learning experience and management was always there and available to help any way they could.
good,"operated corragater machine with 5 other people on radios "
good,"Some machine operator's have anger issues. There's a lot of overtime when someone on your line calls off, quits or is suspended. You will work 12 hrs. until that person is replaced. The benefits are good. This place is non climate controlled."
good,Way to meny people in management and they are always in meetings. Pay is ok for the jobs. Some jobs have you work day shift one week and night shift the next. Some are 7 hour shift and others are 12 hour shifts. The workers are nice and helpful to be around.
good,I liked it but It became a little hard to balance family in the middle of the working week with 1 day off a week mandatory hours. I would recommend it people still just make sure they know it’s very high pace and skill oriented.
good,"Westrock is a great paying job that does not require college experience. However, the job requires much overtime and working weekends. Breaks are limited unless the machines are not working at the moment."
good,"Excelente empresa para qualquer profissional, recomendo."
good,"The management in the accounting department really tried to allow for work/life balance.  The volume of work was high, and the department strived for a job well done, but they balanced it with a friendly staff and partially flexible schedule.  The people were the most enjoyable part of the job."
good,WestRock was a captive Shopper Marketing Agency for Henkel. This association between the two companies no longer exists. A candidate working for WestRock would most likely be working in their display division.
good,"Empresa boa para trabalhar um ambiente legal,cultura com segurança e qualidade ótimo."
good,It can be high intensity and a but hectic at times but the training is good. Long hours and working weekends is the downside but overtime is given for non supervisor workers.
good,"It's a good job and I would recommend it. The work isn't very difficult and if you put in the hours you are fairly compensated. There are some challenges and expectations, but if you come to work hard everything else falls in to place."
good,This is a good place to work. Management is good and will help with any thing you need.the hardest part of the job is standing for 12 hr. the pay is fair.
good,Great people to work with so you can enjoy your day but also fast paced so that your day goes by quickly. Always doing something different everyday so you are always learning and growing.
good,"You receive great benefits. Overtime is pay an a half, Sunday is double pay. Birthdays are paid vacation, Christmas is paid, family events, and there's a Christmas party. Great enviroment just quick paced and the machines break a lot."
good,"WestRock was a great place to work- in the office. The plants may be a different story. Co-workers, benefits, PTO were all fantastic. Management can get overwhelming at times."
good,WestRock was a safety and productivity driven company. There were good resources and people to support you. My position was very structured and rewarding.
good,Empresa multinacional de grande porte. Ambiente profissional e de grandes aprendizados. Ótimo para se trabalhar e se desenvolver como profissional. Empresa de cultura americana. Pontual nos pagamentos e benefícios.
good,"Was really my first factory job and it is a good job to start out in the Factory world Westrock has a very safe plan. They make sure you leave in the condition you came in, the manager however is a little over the top"

good,"workplace culture is good, and welcoming and they have where you can work remotely and have a flexible schedule to work, which allows you to use transit to work. If your on the right team within the company its the greatest place to work."
good,"Great Place to work too bad our facility close in Waxahachie"
good,Great team to work with and great opportunity to learn how to be successful.  I learned a lot about Six Sigma and Continuous Improvement are how to apply those classes to drive key essentials to drive KPI's and how to identify those opportunities.
good,"WestRock is a great place if you're looking to stay with a company for your career. There are opportunities for advancement and a willingness to educate and train employees. Management is typical for a big company, mostly it depends on your plant. I've had a range of managers from horrible to amazing. I'm grateful to them for giving me a chance right out of college and have learned so much the last seven years. But the most enjoyable part for me has been the people. Having good coworkers around you helps when work is stressful and incredibly busy, and during the lulls when not much is coming in."
good,I worked full-time at the plant in Chesterfield in order to earn some money for going back to BYU the following Fall. I was given consistent 40+ hour work weeks at a competitive pay of $16.00 starting pay. I was happy with the opportunity and the experience I gained as a result of working for Westrock.
good,"Long hours, but good money. Swing shift and plenty of overtime, they do have mandatory 12 hour shifts. If you can handle all the hours and time away from your family, give it a go. They money may make it worth it for you."
good,Productive and competitive environment that is a good opportunity for someone just getting a grasp of life.  Not advised for someone who is older age.
good,we were packing out tobacco in  boxes  making sure the tobacco was not open  then at the end we would it on weigh scale to see if weigh right that would let us know if all the tobacco was in the box
good,As long as you do your job and keep orders up its a fine place to work. Money's good. Nice employees. 12 hour shifts take some time getting use to. Attendance is a huge thing at Westrock.
good,good place to work but not very family oriented. ask to work ridiculous hours and sacrifice time with family. fed a bunch of open-ended promises that never were fullfilled
good,Loved my job at WestRock.  Only left because I was promised a big offer with competition.   Should have never left and hope to get back to working for WestRock again.
good,"Productive and supportive workplace.  Team oriented work environment, get it done attitude.  Innovative and experienced design teams and production infrastructure"
good,This was the first job I landed after being Honorably discharged from the Military.  This company opened the door for me in so many way.  I was young and had a good paying job with benefits.
good,good place to work. opportunities to advance and grow. excellent health and benefit coverage. downfall is its a huge company so in the end you are just a number..
good,"In the lime kiln I process white liquor, this is what the wood chips are cooked in. I have to maintain specific levels in tanks and monitor temps.

good,"WestRock is a fun place to work but it really does matter where. I work in the Camillus, NY location and love it because of all the money that the company has put into this location alone. The only negative is age range in employees. There are not many young employees here. Other plants have a much better age difference but then their plant may not have money put into it to make it run better and smoother. If looking for a position at WestRock, I would highly suggest looking at these two things for the exact location you may work at."
good,I have worked here 3 different times it’s like home to me. Work pace is laid back and friendly. If you need help you get it. Co-workers are friendly and helpful. Training and safety are a Priority

The management at Rock Tenn was strict, and on time production was a must.  A majority of the co-workers at Rock Tenn were hardworking, and dedicated to there job at Rock Tenn. I would have to say that that  the hardest part of working for me was the shift I worked, it was extremely difficult to arrange night shift around my daily schedule.

good,My current position requires the employee to take plant employees out of their confort zone to perform the same tasks but within a different system. Change management is the largest part of this process. The RSS/ULT team essentially instructs the crew over a period of 6 to 7 weeks on how to perform their jobs under the new Kiwiplan system.
good,"Relaxed environment and open to suggestions. Worked with company for 12 years. Company grows by acquisitions. There a constant changes.

The hardest part of the job was in the very beginning when I had to learn all about corrugated containers and boxes.

good,"It's a good place to get your feet wet if you don't have experience, but the internship program as a whole is not as strong compared to some of the other programs in the area (perk-wise). However, since they like cheap labor its a good place to get hands on experience."

good,"I needed to leave Atlanta, but wasn't where WR was, so I could not work remotely per VP. I would have stayed otherwise. If I recommend WR to anyone, it's to people who actually WANT to work. WR is not a place for slackers or for anyone who cannot or will not work at a quick pace. Everyone is overloaded, so you need to be able to handle that and like it. I personally like to be busy - it makes the day go, and I felt needed. I also felt appreciated, and that's a good combination for me."
good,As long as you were clocked in they would have work for you to do. I liked staying busy because it made the day go by faster. Too bad I was just a temp.

good,some days was over whelming but nothing to complain about and then there were some easy going days ive learned to commmunicate with fellow employees can make the day easier and management should keep friendship and business on seperate levels cause as a friend some slacking tends to happen a lot when one is besties with the boss  but the most enjoyable part is when you work as family because we are together all day trying to earn a living and trying to do our best as a team to better ourselves and our company

good,a typical day was always long learned to manage large numbers of people. if you knew your job management left you alone to do it very good workplace .
good,"My internship with WestRock connected me with managers and colleagues that taught me and allowed me plenty of room to grow. While the facility was outdated, it was well taken care of. Typically the environment was fairly laid back, but firefighting happens every now and again so overtime was sometimes an issue for some employees."

good,"The Plant manager came and said hello to everyone every morning. Safety was always 1st. Too much downtime.

When promoted to another office, the environment was a lot more cut-throat and tense. Worked a lot on managing sell sheets and organizing products in the database. Over-all enjoyable experience."
good,Well lets start off by saying it was a good place too work. Good pay an plenty of over time if you desire to make a pretty penny at the end of the week. Only problem i had was with my training for the PMC Machine because i could barley understand my trainer which in the end i walked out never came back. Wish the had more than one person that knew how to run the pmc machine
good,"management is really hard to find. When you do find management, you get far behind. Fortunately, they workplace is great, nice coworkers, easy work route."
good,"I enjoyed my time with Westrock.  I had great colleagues and I enjoyed coming to work.  Upper management often times is detached from knowing how people really feel.

good,safety is number one here. friendly supervisors and workers. great place to learn the business. clean building and work environment. they try to keep you home weekends.

good,"I would prepare crew and machine for that day's production run. I would enter the run in the computer and start up machine. If there is a machine failure I would make any repairs in a timely fashion to continue production run. Trying to get the most production out of the machine was the hardest and most enjoyable part of the job. In order to accomplish this, I have learned that it takes more than your average patience and good work ethics. It takes great co-workers and team work."
good,"Analysis of OEE and waste to target key areas to improve. Training, coaching and mentoring the Performance Excellence tenets to six teams representing Safety, Daily Equipment Care, Training & Development, Equipment Reliability, 5S, and Continuous Improvement. Facilitated daily team meetings to assure alignment with PE and advised team leaders with helpful insight, tools, and resources. Use of metrics to represent OEE and opportunities for improvement. Audit implementation of all areas to evaluate compliance to SOP's and sustainability. Developing and delivering Forms and Spreadsheets for use in production facilitation. Tutor employees in use of PowerPoint and Excel and answering questions related to job responsibilities. I constantly learned new ways to communicate information needed to increase the bottom line and reduce waste. Management needs to work as a Team to accomplish corporate alignment goals. Enthusiastic co-workers who want nothing more than to improve the status quo. The biggest challenge was nonexistence of WI's and SOP's and starting from scratch to develop and deliver them. Watching lights come on in employees who thought they could not be more and the subsequent ownership of new procedures to improve OEE and reduce waste."
good,"WestRock is a safe place to work, but you had a be aware of your surroundings. Our work involved some work hour changes so as not to impact production hours. There was constant input from managers to accomplish our work in a timely manner. They had a pay-for-performance bonus, but the company is now doing anything to avoid paying any bonuses. They had a small pension plan, but stopped it a few years ago."
good,This company offers multiple opportunities to grow within this company and more than enough overtime for those who seek it. Management is very hands on but does not micromanage its workers. The individuals that work for this company are very inclusive to newcomers and relate well to each other.
good,"WestRock is a large company, so my experiences in the office I work for may be vastly different from someone who works elsewhere. "
good,"I loved the people surrounding me. The job is very stressful because logistics is a stressful industry. You go through about 600 emails a day. A lot of people do not take lunch breaks because of how fast-paced it is. Moving up can be difficult because there is a lot of competition, but that is never a bad thing. Only makes you work harder."
good,"A typical day consisted of maintaining 4 robots on the production line. Ensuring all product was sent to shipping with the highest standard of quality."
good,Great team. Management works with team. Great work environment. Great environment if you like to stay busy.  Great training. Learned a new system: JD Edwards
good,"Was very impressed with the benefits, I don't think you will find another company other than a union that will give you better benefits than Westrock, the management and and HR were some of the most professional people I have ever worked with. Though I felt a little insecure due to the competitiveness of the business my time there at the company was short-lived. again as a truck driver I believe it's one of the better companies out there right now I'm just not a big fan of the corporate structure."
good,"This is an awesome place to work for regarding work culture. They strive to keep to their core values. Integrity, respect, excellence, accountability."

good,Westrock Extruder department was a very interesting time for me as as intern. I was able to soak in all I could and learn from the best. The management worked closely with the employees and they cared so much about them. Safety is the number 1 rule and the company is very proactive regarding that. It felt like home when I worked there and miss the team I worked with.
good,"My days were pretty well set, I did data entry from production records from the plant.  Entered board roll stock numbers.  Created reports based on the production records and roll stock used. Good people to work with."
good,"I really enjoyed working my co-op position. My managers were very helpful and great people. The work/life balance is very manageable. Sometimes I would have to work non-regular or extra hours, but my managers would let me take time off or adjust my schedule as compensation. I would absolutely recommend for anyone to work for this company."
good,Outstanding place to work with plenty of benefits. Training was provided when needed and necessary when new projects came on board. Resources were always analyzed and provided.

good,"A typical day at WestRock consist of making sure all areas are cleaned of all paper and other things. Also, making sure we work safely. The hardest part of the job would be the heat."
good,I enjoyed my time at the RockTenn Cincinnati Mill...I came from a retail management background and the management and workforce were all great in helping my advance in my career.
good,I enjoyed the people I worked with. After the company changed hands it was not a plesent place to work. I would like to thank them for rehiring me after I moved back to town.

good,working a different machine printing different style boxes every day. management was very good to us. hardest part of the job was the hours and the machines breaking down.
good,The work depends on the trucks that come in at night. Receive all of your work from the clerk that night. Everyone moves at their own pace to complete the work.
good,RockTenn is a rewarding place if you like a fast pace and intense shop floor.  The Culture initiative of being the best and most respected through culture is outstanding in my opinion.  Advancement however is not that achievable.
good,"A typical work day included going to a daily saftey and production meeting and we set goals daily that the company would like to have met and I learned ways to further work safer and faster without hurting myself. The co-workers I had there were great, they would help you with whatever you needed whether it was involving work our outside of work. The hardest part of the job was working 12 hour days sometimes 7 days a week but was something that took getting used to. The modt enjoyable part of the job was having great supervisors and higher up managemant and having a Union to help with whatever you needed and make sure your job was the best expirience while you were working."

Our job was to print beer/cold drink boxes and stack them onto pallets along with trash disposal and clean up.  Often times the conveyer belt would get jammed, or the copy machines wouldn't print right.  Other than that it was pretty repetitive."
good,Decent job. Good gig. Great benefits. Paid vacation. Weekly pay. Really good money. Decent union. Nothing bad to say except sketchy management at times

The management was good couldve been a bit better. Most Co-workers where ok we all got alone like a big family. The hardest part of the job was not really anything because the days where the same. The best part of the job was being able to work in a productive enviroment and was able to complete task."
good,Having a good time at work. Learning new things about the machines. Good supervision and being fair with employees. Making sure the quality of work that went out was within guidelines. Productive and good people to work with.
good,They a have a great opportunity to progress in life and workplace .The managment there is kinda poor. HR is always busy and barely can get your point across to an operator or supervisor. They go by what they think is best and your opinion doesn't really matter.
good,"It is a hot, humid place to work in. It has it good days and bad like most. There should be more understanding and more concern involving employees. such as, more fans should be put up to lower the humidity and make it a  less humid place to work in."
good,Great place to work. Corporate has a mission statement and the plants are expected to follow strict guidelines. There are many documentation procedures that has to be led by a SME (Subject Matter Expert} and they provide the training for everyone.
good,"But, no room for advancement.  Paid adequately for my job, but not enough really to live on.  I would recommend this for a person looking for factory work."

good,"I enjoyed working for Rock-Tenn. I was responsible for all aspects of plant operation as Maintenance Manager / Plant Superintendent. There was a core of great employees at my plant. the hardest part of my position was the lack of support when the union was involved as far as discipline was concerned. "
good,"Recibir turno, la sguridad es primero av 5 de febrero 1311"
good,"Westrock is a good company with good benefits.  However, my current job location has low morale and poor communication.  They offer continuing education for those who want to grow in their expertise."
good,"a good company to work for, Safety is truly a major part of the culture. Safety is driven from the top down and is seen across all levels of employees. As a Safety Manager, I was provided the time and resources to fully engage all employees."
good,Great place to work for would totally recommend this job to anyone. Would totally recommend a great place to start as an operator. Only reason I let was because got a better paying job.
good,Really good job with advancement. Some of the mangers have issues and you don’t want to work for them as a temp. But if you can hire straight in it’s a great place to work.
good,Good benefits nice place tow work management could be more with others. I think there was a preference for electricians as far as we discuss. Also safety personnel should be more effective and responsible a lot of gossip and unprofessional personnel.
good,"It's a Clean plant, they have a nice breakroom also, they supply personal lockers too. lots of hours, good pay and great benefits too. Its gets real hot in the Summertime."
good,Westrock is committed to providing a safe and friendly work environment. They have a proven track record as one of the safest in the industry. Additionally their commitment to being a leader in their industry through quality and innovation is unsurpassed. As an employee the opportunities for growth are endless through continual training and education of their employees. Fantastic place to work for anyone who is career focused and desires to be associated with a leader.
good,Contract labor and Union work side by side. Totally different environment compared to other situation. Lack of experience and patience of inexperienced within certain mills. Rumor is other mills do not run the same as other.
good,The main goal in west rock was to make great production with great quality using great team work. Manny of our goals was to maintain out machines to work at great speeds.
good,"I loved this job, it gave me the opportunity to learn things as well as to made me to take pride in my job.  I was really disappointed when the contract was over. It ever given the chance to return I would jump at the opportunity."
good,"Generally it is a great place to work. As with any company that is growing there is a lot of change. Sometimes this can be disruptive."
good,Good Company. they treat people fairly and wish I keep working with them but they lose contract with Colgate and I am laid off. hope everybody need to express their feeling with this company.

good,Working at Rocktenn is favorable . Supervisor and group leaders are well trained so operators can easily understand their respective roles. Operators are given on time break. Overtime are always posted and is given fairly.
good,"Bill plants"
good,getting there clocking in and checking the machines started feeding boxes sometimes they broke I had to fix them sometimes had to run more than one machine got along with all management and co workers hardest part was getting laid off enjoyable was having a job and going to work and being useful
good,"operator: check boxes"
good,This company is a great place to work. You do know going into work there that it is a long term temp assignment. They let you know in advance that they have not offered any temp a permanent assignment yet.

I had various tasks and thoroughly enjoyed this position in this Department.  In 2013 I chose to make a change, to a bit slower department, as I needed a little break, due to health issues with my dad.  I moved to the Recycle Division as Contract Coordinator/Administrative Assistant.  With the stress of my dad's illness, and the change into a new department, it turned out this just wasn't the best fit.  It worked out for the best as there was an opportunity for downsizing and I my position was eliminated.  I have since been out of the workforce for almost 4 years and I'm now looking to return to work.  If possible in a part time role.  I will consider a full time position."
good,Miss working at Westrock enjoyed everything about my job and coworking. Management was good learned a lot from manager.The part was that the job ended to soon.

good,I am retired and looking for part time work. I did Safety consulting work for WestRock three years after I retired. I enjoy enter acting with all levels of employees.
good,I took this position about two years ago to expand my knowledge in PSM and hazardous chemical management. My intent is to use this experience to move into the chemical manufacturing industry. My manager is very new and has no intentions of leaving . I would like to move back into a manager position and the only way to do that is to look outside the company.

good,"I learned all of my Kronos experience with RockTenn team.  I learned how important it is to communicate well with other teams or departments regarding a specific project or task that was scheduled or not.  The days were busy troubleshooting issues with Kronos timecards, reports, Citrix issues, or just specific setup within the application.  On top of this there were other projects going on with accruals, attendance, and implementation of locations or acquisitions.  The team members I worked with were great!  A great group of people who were experts in their position.  I always knew who to go to to get specific questions answered quickly.  The management team was great!  I worked with some of the best managers.  There was always an open door policy if you had issues or concerns.  Your voice was heard, most of the time.  The hardest part of the job was taking your work home with you...there was not always time in the regular day to get your tasks completed so much of it had to go home with you...it was hard to leave it until tomorrow but sometimes you had to.  The daily challenge of the issues and new projects, and working with the people were the best part of the job.  It's really a great place to work once you find your rhythm."
good,"Worked as a temp, otherwise would give better score for comp/benefits and security/advancement.  Great work experience though, would definitely return"

good,Our plant was purchased by Westrock 6 or 7  years ago total of 23 years I’ve been employed there and I have been on an off shift I’m interested in getting a day shift job now so I can be noramal because im actually tired of night shift but I’m willing to float shifts if needed great pay
good,c'etais correct la journne  la seule chose c'etait les machin qui ne fonctionne pas assez bien on est obliger de donner plus d’énergie
good,The best company I ever worked for.  Typical eight hour shift some mandatory overtime. The hardest part of the job was the overtime being away from your family. The workplace culture wasn’t bad but I had a lot of colleagues that have been there for quite some time and they were kind of stubborn and in their ways. Overall a fantastic job and I regret leaving. Upper management great and involved
good,small company - with solid operating principles and business ethics. Open employee engagement and investing for decision making and company vesting a plus and encouraged
good,"work could go from fast needed yesterday to slow burn . was not always kept loop on new procedure .time a way from family . sale team would in many cases overstate results to customers . Being remote from home base , did cause some break down in keeping abreast of new information , which was not sent by emails ."
good,"I loved working at Westrock, the only reason i left is because i found a career advancement opportunity, If they would of hired me full time, which would of been a pay raise i would have stayed at this company."
good,Working at westrock Is a clean environment. People there was very professional and respectful. Work was steady and sometimes challenging. If I am able I would very much like to work there again.

good,The culture was diverse and the job was really easy. Management was very caring and nice always willing to help if you needed it. The employees were great at the location I worked. Typical day was you clocked in and went to your station and picked up where you left off the day before.
good,WestRock is a great place to work with a variety of professions and personnel. It is like it's own city within a city always changing a fascinating.
good,Wonderful Place to work and build a career. Advanced quickly based on out put of work. Rewarded and encouraged in many ways - mostly by compensation financially.
good,It was fun to work there but since I was just a temp worker I wasn't required to work that much of overtime compared to the permanent workers. But overall it was a good experience.
good,"West Rock was a good place to work. I was there 24 years. If not for the fact that they shut down operations at my plant, I would have work there till I retired."
good,"Objective is to bring cost-savings to customers by improving their operations. This creates leverage for salespeople for negotiating contracts and gaining new business and margin improvement of current business.

good,I truly enjoyed a typical workday always something to do time blew by.
good,I have been with the company for almost 16 years and have enjoyed my time there. They allowed me to grow within the company and expand my knowledge. Smurfit was aquired by RockTenn last May and is in the process of relocating the headquarters to Norcross Georgia and unfortunately I will not be relocating with them. I am seeking employment in the St. Louis area.
good,"Empresa excelente, Salário ótimo e muitos benefícios...."
good,I loved working here.  They were super flexible and super supportive. I knew the job had a deadline but I stayed on even longer than expected and loved the work and the atmosphere.
good,The hours seems long at time working 12 hours but most of the time it's goes quick. The schedule rotates three days on two off and so on. I think Monday thru Friday 10 hours aday would have been better for alot of employees with every weekends off instead of every other weekend. But for the most part the job is steady and laid back once you get the hang of your job.
good,"I enjoyed working at rest Rock oh, but the work was too fast pace for me and I had to seek other employment. I did think there 12 hour shifts and 10-minute breaks every two hours were a little bit harsh... 15 minute lunch break was a bit short too"
good,The people I work for and with are purpose orientated and highly motivated problem solvers. I look forward to coming to work with these people every day. The Performance Excellence program is excellent and the support materials provided by Westrock is amazing.
good,I enjoyed working for westrock the time I did! It was just a ton of favortism and they were very unfair.. but with the new management I'm sure things have changed..
good,"A truly amazing company to work for and with! I have been with Westrock for almost 2 years now and cannot say enough good things about the company and culture. For an enterprise organization, they are very forward thinking. There’s a lot of personal empowerment in every role at every level. Zero drama atmosphere. Highly recommended!"
good,"Worked here for 11yrs. I loved the company. The division (Recycling) that I was placed in my last 3yrs of tenure, there wasn't any room for growth or advancement. The Recycling division has a very high turnover. If you can get within any other division, you'll love working for this company. Overall great company to work for!"
good,If u dont mind starting from the bottom and working ur way up  its a good place for advancement . I didnt have any problems working with any of the supervisors or the equipment employees are willing to help u learn the machines and dyes i regret leaving honestly
good,WestRock is an amazing place to work if you are driven and intelligent.  Things are always changing and there are always new challenges to take on.  There is lots of opportunity to learn new skills and expand your capabilities.
good,"very fast paced environment, very safety oriented. managers are always around to help if needed, must keep excellent quality and work fast and accurate."
good,"Great people. Great atmosphere. Modern company. Limited opportunities for advancement. Good pay. Strong culture. Some managers do not develop their employee's futures very well. The employee needs to determine their own goals, then ask for the proper training. Employee reviewing system could use some work. There seems to be no correlation between performance and compensation."
good,"You make a difference in your position. The work may seem overwhelming at first, but WestRock does a great job in showing they trust you to get the job done, regardless of your experience. The people are great and very friendly. This company has a small town feel. Management is composed of some of the most intelligent people. Highly recommend this company for an applicant."
good,I started learning feeding machine at West Rock. I was sent through temp agency but learned a lot while there also training is great. They have great benefits if hired on to company pay roll.
good,Great place to work good people job and home balance  normal for drivers a lot of hours. Drivers could make more money. But I hope to retire from there can't wait to get back to work. Avg. 60 to 65000 a yr.
good,WestRock is a great company to work for it is very challenging and you must work hard and have proven results. As a Maintenance manager you have to be able to forecast maintenance.
good,"Began in 2016 as office manager, I was able to completed my own duties and help procurement rep with reporting. Showed that I could take on more duties and acquired billing, gatepass requests for rail cars, monthly events for plant safety luncheons, recognitions, and holiday events"
good,"The company culture is fantastic.  The 401k benefits are amazing, but there is no sick time.  If you are sick you just have to go without pay.  There is also a 30 day waiting period before benefits kick in which is not ideal."
good,Management was easy to get along with it was just unfortunate that the company had to downsize prior to being bought out so I was laid off. If I did not get laid off I would of retired with the company.
good,Alot of advacement here at the lebanon company. You can make decent wages..benefits are good and they are not to demanding here.pay is great ! 410k is also great...
good,"Dando suporte aos usuários da empresa, para obter um bom funcionamento das estações de trabalho da empresa. Local agradável de se trabalhar."
good,I enjoyed making displays and organize people from a temporary service into a production line on what stages that the display had to be made to keep an ongoing production of displays so by the time it reached me I could check to see if everything was in its appropriate place then I would put the production into the computer and make sure it was packaged correctly and into a staging area for forklift drivers to pick up and ship
good,"Trabalhei em vários departamentos e aprendi muitas atividades, que me auxiliaram no crescimento junto com a empresa."
good,"Typical day at work consisted of working with other engineers and interns through various projects on the site. This included data collection, lab testing, and updating documentation and records. The most enjoyable part of the experience was being able to invest more time in additional projects or departments which were of personal interest, allowing me to learn additional experience with the process."
good,Eu aprendi a ter uma boa organização no meu trabalho através de projetos como o 5s. Uma das questões que a empresa também aborda é a relação do trabalho e segurança do trabalhador.
good,Lots of room to grow. Great culture. benefits and pay are very reasonable for an entry level job. Many locations across the gta to choose from. I recommend it.
good,Westrock is great company to work for but unfortunately they shut down the plant where I worked which is why I am looking for another job..
good,Work was always challenging throughout the day. It is a very fast paced work environment which keeps you busy throughout the entire shift. I worked with a small crew of 6 including myself and the shift supervisor. I'd say the hardest part of the job was loading the machine when you had very little time to do it.
good,"Good workforce fast paste, I also got to meet new people and we laugh and exchange number just in case i need a ride to work. what i learned is how to deal with other people attitude and there concerns about their surrounding. My Co-Worker were very help when i got on a new task and i did not know really what to do so i can always trust them to help me. The Hardest Part of the Job Was to labeling the each boxes and to make sure you did not label each box twice. The Most enjoyable part of the job is when i finish each task by the end of the day"
good,A great place to work for. The women I worked with in the office were delightful and caring. There was always something to do each and every day. There would be system problems as every office would have at one time or another. The building we worked in was as professional as you can get. Our general manager was the best GM I have ever worked for. He truly had an open door policy and reassured you he had your back. He wanted everyone to be at their best when it came to work performance. We all fulfilled that duty to the best of our abilities giving a thousand percent at all times.
good,"Inspección de producto terminado en lineas de producción"
good,worked as backup in critical areas in plant being able to multi-task duties.
good,Fast paced plant with safety number one. Rewards for job well done every week.Really good coworkers.The Texas heat is the worst in the plant .The company tried to keep us cool but it is very difficult.It was a well rounded atmosphere over all.
good,I really liked my job at Rock-Tenn it was a fun place to work as a driver I get to meet new people every day had really good benefits and I also work with some great people there was only two drivers but we got alone good and we always got the job done intil the day rock ten shut us down that was a sad day I lost what I would say was the best job I have ever had. Iwould love to get another job working for rock tenn 
good,comensation was great and as many hours as you were willing to work and they really cared about my saftey
good,Great work/ home life balance. The management team is smart and great to work with. Everyone is treated with respect and your opinions are valued. Plenty of room to express your ideas and try out new projects to stream line processes.
good,"This company check's all my boxes for a great company to work for.. The 3 day 12 hr work week are great for family life, overtime is there.. People are great"
good,"I truly enjoyed working at WestRock.  I enjoyed the responsibility I was given to do more than my job title was.  Co-workers were, overall, amazing people to work with."
good,"In all my years experience in the Accounting area,  I was elated to have had the opportunity to work there.  There is a healthy balance and the working relationships are genuinely team oriented.  I would still be working for Westrock if there were one in my area"
good,I’ve been there for four months and have learned a lot. As a feeder packer your job is to feed a belt that glues a carton and then packs the carton and you inspect it. You rotate every 2 hours between feeding and inspecting. The people I work with will literally show you whatever you want to know and it will help you move up in any position. 95% of the time ot is voluntary so you can make as much money as you really want. I plan on retiriing from this company.
good,Good company to work for .Team work and co workers are there to help you succeed .Good benefits and good pay plus you get paid every week which is nice
good,"I've been a employee of Westrock for a little over 2 years now and couldn't be happier about the transition from my last work place.  The culture in the facility is one of the best I've been apart of, with most people having a positive attitude everyday.  The work is challenging but rewarding as well, with a big emphasis on teamwork.  Upper management does a great job of listening and making changes whenever employees voice concerns.  The toughest part is probably the long hours sometimes.  You will typically spend a little over 12 hours on your scheduled work day but the long hours are offset by the 3-4 working days a week."
good,"Excellent company to work for. I experienced and learned a great deal about the packaging industry and what goes into the process of producing cartons. The people were wonderful to work with. At times the job was a bit stressful being on call 24/7 but was well worth it. Best part of the job was knowing that by doing my part, my coworkers jobs would be easier."
good,"really enjoyed the job, didnt like how the plant manager went about things and treated people like me but my immediate managers. i enjoyed them and had alot of respect for them"
good,I really like the atmosphere there it was fast paced but intriguing. They trained us the ins and outs of the machine and how to fix the machine if it had gone down . The hours were bit much they would never give you time off for your family.
good,I absolutely love working here. My contract is coming to an end so I am looking at job openings within the company and some external jobs as well. I would love to stay at Westrock if Possible.

good,"A empresa oferece vários benefícios, não apenas monetário, mas que fazem se tornar um profissional cada vez melhor."
good,"Embora fosse estagiária, durante meu período na empresa, tive a oportunidade de vivenciar a rotina normal de trabalho de um engenheiro floresta. Trabalhava durante 8 horas por dia, dependendo da demanda tinha dias que ia a campo acompanhar as atividades da área da silvicultura (preparo do solo, plantio, controle de formigas, aplicação de herbicidas, etc) e outros dia permanecia no escritório digitalizando e e organizando os dados coletados em campo. Além disso tive a oportunidade de conhecer as atividades das outras áreas (pesquisa, colheita, meio ambiente e planejamento florestal), além de conhecer a fábrica de papel e celulose."
good,Cest une tres bonne compagnie un bon environnment de travail.
good,"Overall I would say it is a good company to work for with competitive  pay, great benefits.  It was a very fast paced environment with mandatory overtime."
good,l'aspect le plus agreable etait la diversite de cultures et le respect mutuel entre les travailleurs

good,"WestRock Company is a great company to work for the only downside is the constant change in management. The culture at this location is very family like,"
good,This is a great organization to work for and it is extremely challenging. Be prepared to give it your best 20%. Plenty of travel but you get to work with some great professionals.
good,I enjoyed learning about the maintenance of all the equipment. I was able to perform my job well. I was able to run the print machines as well as clean them. I was moved around many different positions ans was able to effectively do them well.

good,Inspected boxes for holding products to ensure they were standard. I learned to identify any defects. Management was great also I worked with wonderful co-workers. The hardest part of the day was standing in one spot for twelve hours. The most important part was being productive
good,"A typical day at WestRock begins with making sure the storeroom is stocked with parts and tools that will be needed to keep the Mill up and running quality paper.  Non-stop issuing parts, cycle counts, expediting parts, providing excellent service to internal and external customers, creating requisitions for vendor managed parts, and communicating effectively with team members and management.  "
good,"One reason that I like it is, because you are not micro managed and actually treated with respect."

My coworkers are very nice, and caring. I really enjoyed working with them.  Before I was laid off I was learning about environmental, health and safety.  I was training people on the Dupont Safety program. I especially liked that the job was Monday- Friday."
good,"I worked at RockTenn for 19 years and absolutely loved my different responsibilities during that time.  The office was relatively small so the chance for advancement there was minimal.  The manager I worked for the bulk of those years was wonderful.  She was smart yet down to earth and definitely treated her staff well.  Unfortunately due to budget restraints and job synergies, my position was eliminated."
good,Excellent place to work.  If it wasn't for the drive I had every day I would still be there.  They treat you good and appreciate all that you do on a daily basis.  Got a lot of gratification out of doing my job here.
good,I started working in Oct. 1995 for Amco Folding Cartons as a customer service employee. I learned many skills on the job and advanced through the years to Office Manager/Warehouse Mgr.
good,"@ ROCKTENN-a typical day at work was fun, challenging and face paced. i learned inside and out about the making of boxes how to much water of glue can damage boxes and cutting the proper sizes and making sure print was right. Managment was on top of everyone making sure everyone was working and production was up to par. co workers were friendly help train the new guys. Hardest part was leaving the work cite. The money and having a job."
good,Everyone who works there is replaceable at the drop of a dime.
good,"I start work @ 600 and start with rollstock receiving and printing reports and a waste report for production ,next I process the billing. In the afternoon I do misc spreadsheets. I have one other co-worker in accounting and work close with our sister plants."
good,A typical day at west rock is once you hit the floor the person on the shift before briefs you about the day. You will learned no too days are the same. Once you find out the problem at the beginning and inform management he will tell you the way to go. The hardest part of the day if you just don't have what you need. Work culture is doing your job and doing it right.
