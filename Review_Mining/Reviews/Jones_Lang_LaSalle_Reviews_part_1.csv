rating,review
bad,They lie to their customer all the time and falsify documents. If you don't follow along they fire you. Also a dead fetus was found n the drain cleanout at work and they covered it up.
bad,"Place to work is overwhelmingly overloaded, too fast pace, place need more people, everybody is stretched very thin, Vice President property manager very condescending, very passive aggressive and treats employees very poorly, used people"
bad,"Not where you want to be in HVAC/R, management is very poorly trained and lacks leadership, they force you do others workload because they will not hire enough propel and threaten you with dismisses if you do not comply creating over stress situations."
bad,"job requirement is too high during job description but you do nothing much require to a tech position.  Something like half facility tech. and custodian.  I have to clean up from vendor mess, clean tenant recycle from cubicle, install cabinet and desk.  set up tables for meeting.  My job title is mechanical technician but my job duty has nothing to do with the job title.  Any one with out any experience can take on my job but the job description expect you to have at least 2 years experience in maintenance field.  What a shame..I got raise 15 cents after my first year.  Terrible pay raise bad benefit"
bad,"Pay is insulting low, especially with an MBA level educational background and relevant undergraduate studies (Finance). Relaxed culture depending on the team, however, managers do not exude professionalism in communicating, personal appearance, or approach to their role. On-boarding process was a nightmare. Ability to move up is based on tenure, and not performance nor educational background. Would never recommend working at JLL to a friend or colleague."
bad,"Manager is the worse I’ve ever worked for. Stay away from this company. . Company is horrible to work for. Stay away from this company "
bad,"I worked for JLL for 6 years they do not care about there employees only to save a buck every chance they could, They cut corners every were they could, I was told to put duck tape on it to make it work, The pay was low and the benefits were few our managers kept quitting it was like a revolving door a new boss every other month"
bad,"Everyone paid different salaries for same job but told not to discuss with each other or it would be gross misconduct."
bad,"Unstable work environment, does not value employees, and everything is 3rd party. After working for several years with company, they will one day random trash your career without warning. read other reviews from other people. Alot of lay offs take place, causing people to bounce between accounts. Company does not invest in continued education, or programs to better employees advancement opportunities."
bad,Jll is a good company to work in India. I like this company very much as they have given me an opportunity to work for them. My experience with this company has been good
bad,"Recruited from a different career site.  Was told by HR that JLL was looking for a candidate like me, and that they pay great wages, yadda, yadda, yadda.  Fast forward to a week later and was told that they are choosing a candidate that better fits their needs.   I'm befuzzled.  Why on earth did HR reach out to me then before even giving me a phone interview?  They have NO idea what I would bring to the table.  It makes me think that they really don't know how to operate, how to treat people, or what their hiring manager needs.  All I know is that I AM A GOOD EMPLOYEE and I've made considerable contributions in my career and I would have made considerable contributions there too.  JLL always has openings for Accountants, and you have to wonder why that is.  This tells me all I need to know.  JLL is not a good place to work, and people leave quickly and have to be replaced.  Got it."
bad,"The management is unethical ,disrespectful, worthless training,pay is not good at all,is the worse company to work for,no future at all,HR is bias. Management does not care for you,will not help you."
bad,"Came in after the RFP and downsize people forced people to take pay cuts and let me and others go for cheaper younger people, with no or little separation and no severance"
bad,"Don't work there, Jll management is awful and site manager is a joke talks down to women who are management and hires his friends who aren't qualified"
bad,"No matter how hard you work for this company, they will not move you up. I love my job and my team, but the ethics of the company are not there. I don't recommend working for JLL."
bad,"Do not work for this company.  There is not clear vision.  Work through every holiday.  Contract with Amazon, which is the worst company to work with."
bad,JLL Integral Aztec Bristol office is being ran into the ground by poor management. They do not care about staff and staff turn over is high due to this. Sack all the managers and bring your own in to run Bristol Aztec office.
bad,"JLLs upper management does NOT care about their people, they keep their yearly bonuses if they leave before 3/11, if they've given all they had to the co. the year before. They do not listen when you ask for help, they do not provide positive feedback. "
bad,"Management does not walk the talk, lot's of bending to please clients to show a way of leaving a company and securing a position with the clients instead.  Lot's of backstabbing, poor training of personnel in the areas of project management & business management, it is a ""say YES"" culture where promises are made to clients with poor and often unreliable information.  Compensation is low, level of professionalism is low, lot's of turnover makes it impossible to plan for succession."
bad,This place will kill you.this is Amazon had to pack tools like a monkey Takeabuse from Amazon management. Reported safety violation and was fired .............
bad,No advancement and people that gets management positions are not qualified but the ones that are qualified doesn't get it but yet the company wants me to help the manager
bad,Need better management  and communication in management not the best they have technicians traveling on roads to much and techs get tired and sleepy not very safe
bad,Horrible human resources; this company is not friendly to veterans or minorities.  Contracted work which means they can end the contract when they want to regardless of the quality of work put in.  A lot of micro-managing and over scheduling of meetings is a common practice.
bad,It’s a racist company to work for and poor management. Management treat coworkers like little kids. Rude and prejudice company . I wouldn’t recommend this company to anyone.
bad,I worked for JLL as a PM on a temporary basis a couple years ago.  The experience was terrible. The managers are very arrogant and unprofessional both in Vancouver and Ontario. A lot of travel and expenses required for simple projects. JLL management systems are overly complex and unnessessary for very simple projects.  They get by on their very flashy marketing websites to get contracts.  They do not have the expertise in house capable of doing any jobs and outsource absolutely everything. A lot of politics locally.  Abosolutely no long term future working with this company.  Very big disappointment to have worked for JLL.
bad,I don't like the way the employees are overlooked for family members of the managers. Too much work for one person. Company is not fair when it comes to job security.
bad,"Learned a lot about haz-mat, and OSHA"
bad,"No worklife balance"
bad,Lack of any management or commmumication.Started out day one with this status.Managed a crew and no experience in all of them.They got in by who they knew..Had personel show up drunk and management refused to do anything about it. Probably the worst organization on the ground level I ever worked for. And I have 40 years of experience and retired once from a state retirement fund.
bad,"It's seem more like I was hired to Socialize instead of work as a janitor, in fact in so many word I was told to have a bubble attitude at work. Not willing to work were I can't be my own professional self, quiet and focus on my work"
bad,Lack of real support from upper management made this a difficult job to be at. Took a while for real tools to get to the bldg. A severe lack of communication from management hinders everything from travel plans(flying out next day with little/no warning) to shift changing(less than a week notice) to new hires(here's the new guy) to trainees from other facilities. And that's not including the equipment or programs supplied by the customer that need to be restarted multiple times to get operating correctly.
bad,Life is too short to work for this company. The stress will take years off if your life. Think of JLL has a farm system for their competitors that actually pay a decent salary.
bad,There were always many meetings throughout the day so it was difficult to produce actual work.  Coworkers were typically to busy to be helpful to on-boarding employees.
bad,Company was sold 3 times during my tenure at JLL. Working for a property management company was very stressful and different pay or provide much in benefits for me and my family.
bad,"Managers are weak, people there are shown favorites and the pay wasn't equal. Intel should be ashamed of letting them in to work on their facility. cut throat people, and bad managers, horrible company"
bad,"Worst manager ever, threw me under the bus multiple times.  Stay away from this company.  Revolving door.    Don't care about employees.  Temp called me a name and I was fired."
bad,"There is no life/work balance.  You are pushed to no end.  If not liked you will be pushed out.  Ethics are wrong.  They say one thing and how they will help and how they are a Team and its all just a line that sounds good.  People are made managers that do not need to be, People are Directors only because they know how to play the game, know what to say, It is all political. Is there a true to life company that does what they say and say what they do?  Is there a place where employees can work the job they are hired to do without being pushed?  Maybe some people are good at what they are hired to do and do not wish for anything else is that wrong?"
bad,You will be forced to work and not paid for any extra time worked. if you say you will not work you will be threatened to loose your job. Make a mistake with safety and I guaranty you will be terminated. we almost had a full staff when we started this facility but have lost 30 people that either Quit or were fired.
bad,"It was not a nice place to work,they have a high staff turn over. Please come and go all the time and they refused to pay me for a day that I have worked."
bad,"Micro management in the property management department. Worst management I've ever delt with in my entire career.  Managers were ""clicky"" and often talksed bad about other staff members.  Absolutely unprofessional!"
bad,Work could be going smooth but then management gets involved and things go downhill from there.I learn that there's no advancement unless you're favored. workplace culture is micro managed. The hardest part is dealing with incompetent managers. The most enjoyable part is satisfying the employees on site.
bad,property managers are the worst in the business they do not have proper communication skills unwilling to discuss problems and totally play the shamed card
bad,"One of the worst jobs I have ever had. Would never recommend this company to anyone ever. Low pay, extremely corporate, horrible arrogant brokers / management. Management 100% does not care about their employees. Cannot even express how terrible of a company it is."
bad,"Helpdesk calls for GM Facilities and Plants. "
bad,"horrible horrible horrible, just was very inconsiderate, low low low low pay, hours re terrible also, working at mcdonald's is better , horrible place"
bad,"I worked for JLL for a year at a Cambridge Facility....absolute worst experience of my life.  I come from a professional Facilities background and was horrified at how JLL treats and speaks to their employees. Some people in the department resigned without having a future job to go to...it was that bad.  The pay is horrible.once they get you in the door and its review time..they come up with ""you are at the top of your pay scale so no increase""...I can't speak for other JLL sites, but stay away from the Cambridge ones."
bad,"Worst company I ever worked for with the worst ""manager"" ever.  Very hard to accomplish anything productive when there are constant roadblocks and you aren't given the tools and resources to do the job at hand.  Very much a high school/popularity contest environment and a bully manager who lies to save their own hide.  If you don't have health issues (stress, anxiety, blood pressure) when you come to work there you will within 6months."
bad,"Good company to work for but not much room to progress"
bad,"No recognition for hard work, very disorganized company. Very cheap company with no benefits, does not pay for professional fees (i.e. CPA License renewal)."
bad,"Poor judgment when hiring/letting go outsourced employees. Person in charge of such decisions expects unreasonable results from employees who have nothing to do with quality control. Work quality is based on equipment available, none the less hourly employees pay the ultimate price and lose their jobs to an insane decision maker who do no value people's time and efforts. I worked here for a short time under Xerox. Xerox does not value their own employees."
bad,"company does not care about employees at all, same with management."
bad,"The workplace was a complete mess that I inherited, the client was extremely unhappy all of the time, the team was miserable and made promises nobody would keep, hardly any on-boarding was offered to me, and upper management does not care about new employees. They also blame new employees for not performing miracles within 1 month of time, and that was all the time I was given to turn a complete disaster around."
bad,"if you want to be run into the ground! I worked hvac maintenance for 2 years and wouldn't recommend it to anyone.good pay & benefits don't make up for the stress & lack of sleep.too big of an area to cover and not enough help.24 hour call, constantly being called out in the middle of the night after working all day.like all big companies they make it sound good until one day you wake up & realize it's not worth it.good luck!"
bad,"Typical day consists of checking bank accounts for deposit/wire information, updating cash logs, checking positive pay for any fraulent items. Work on distribution or funding requests."
bad,"Property manager  wants a ""yes"" man. Everyone who works at this site always intimidated and bullied. They need to learn servant leadership and learn how to respect others beliefs and ideas. Would rather paint building instead of making it mechanically sound. Like being treated like a kid, work here."
bad,"Had I known what I was getting into when I interviewed, I would have turned around and ran the opposite direction. From the start, I was mislead about compensation, growth potential and workload. I was overworked, under paid and you can forget about appreciated. The brokers didn't care about you or how much work they gave you, just that it be done on their time, which was usually yesterday. The management felt the same and little concern was given if you were overworked or have serious issues with other personnel. "
bad,"I was on a short term and then a long-term medical leave for a high-risk pregnancy with twins. After the birth of my healthy twin girls, I was on my maternity leave. When that was completed, JLL told me I had been replaced, and that no work was available for me. So, I collected unemployment which JLL tried to prevent me from doing so, they told the unemployment office that I quit. Well, I always documented everything, so I had proof, and emails, etc. Like I said, I collected unemployment."
bad,"daily work was fast paced , taking on the unknown from day to day"
bad,there was not much to learn at this site i was only there for a day or two.
bad,No thought was put into the account setup and the actual scope of work. The client dictates whatever they feel like from day to day and will not allow for expanding staff to meet goals and objectives. I worked close to 80 hours a week and was being reprimanded for not getting all my work completed. None of my staff had the skills to back me up and I was on call 365 days a year. Everybody has a sour attitude towards the company and are grossly underpaid. I wouldn't work for these jokers ever again.
bad,One of 10 managers in a role in less than 8 years and treated poorly.  It was either silence or reprimands.  Never positive feedback.  Way too many hours expect for minimal pay.  Lots of unethical requests from higher managers
bad,I worked with JLL for more than 2 years but it was a blunder to join JLL. They show them the the most ethical company but actually it is opposite. They ruined my career after having more than 23 years of experience before joining JLL. There is no job security and hire and fire is very high. Please don't suggest any one to join JLL.
bad,"Overworked and underpaid.  Difficult to take time off if you're in CAS as you have at least 1 major deadline every day.  The only way I could describe my supervisor is as a certain word for a female canine, and it was a guy.  Might have had a better experience had I been assigned to a different team.  The position allowed somewhat flexible hours and work from home after a year."
bad,"Your reviews are not done by job performance but by personal friendship with management."
bad,Management here cares about themselves and are super gossipy. Diversity is almost nonexistent at the “top” and room for growth is basically nonexistent as well. And they’ll pay you in pennies.
bad,Working 80-90 hours per week with a supervisor who only made the environment worse. Supervisor also had racist tendencies. Senior management disconnected from the field.
bad,JLL office environment is very poor. H.R department not caring employees. No work burden but crucket politics in this company will give you mental turture.
bad,"Would not work for this particular job site since JLL is an international employer.  But from my experience, it's wasn't what was described.  They also will try to take away any compensation from wages if possible."
bad,This is for MDW7 specifically. I had the worst experience there. I volunteered for everything including night shift and was very knowledgeable of my job. Every person who either screwed up or didn't know their job at JLL was either promoted or fired. Does that make sense? Absolutely not. The individuals who had no experience at all were promoted. And a few who were fired for no reason at all.
bad,"JLL employees at Union Depot in Saint Paul are not good people. Work environment is stressful and no equality. They nitpick and have unrealistic goals that eventually will leave you jobless even for a hard worker. Event staff of JLL is terrible and she/they do not know what they are doing. If you care about your human and worker's rights, do not work with JLL or in the same building as this company."
bad,It was a very traumatic experience for me. Both Managers are not people person and difficult to work with. There are so much entitlement for the client and the intermediate supervisors
bad,"I joined JLL and was informed there would be a regimented training program. Upon starting, I quickly realised there was no training. Management pile on pressure and demands but do not give you the information you need to complete your job. The turnover since I have been here is incredible, I've never seen so many people change jobs or leave in such a short period of time. If I had to give any advice, it would be apply elsewhere. There is only stress and no reward."
bad,"As JLL sub-division in Amazon Fulfillment center, each of the 4 shifts are diverse and full of personalities. As an Amazon vendor, this startup job was an eye opening for technology opportunity in many electronic gateway. Enjoyed the responsibilities and the Pay time off. But other than that, due to the high turn around rate and what seem to be favoritism, advancement is based on word of mouth rather than the recorded document in demonstration of self sufficient technician. "
bad,"Ok job just very unprofessional. They didn't have work for me to do some day's, i would sit there for hours without anything to do, we would consistently let the supervisor know he really didn't care."
bad,Not a good company to work for. The management was not very fair to its employees. On-site supervisor was a horrible person who cared more about brown nosing that her staff.
bad,"It lacks inclusivity and if you're not directly hired with the company, in most instances,  you will feel like a slave to the client. They expect robots not human reactions."
bad,"terrible place to work,co workers were rude and did not want to help in any way.I should have stayed at the job I had.other amazon sites may be different"
bad,"Management is the worst!! Even the regional managers are terrible! The prioritize pm work over taking care of equipment that breaks down. Safety is nothing but pencil pushing, they are dangerous as heck !"
bad,"Management was disconnected.  Lots of micro-management at every level. If you like doing tons of paperwork, documentation, and being unappreciated for doing everyone else's work then this is the place for you."
bad,"If your female you'll go far if your in a relationship with tje boss."
bad,"They hire supervisors who have no trades experience. The talk about training but, only care about how they look not how well you do. They have you prove your credentials then question your ability every step of the way."
bad,"Working at Jll is not recommended, as hardwork and responsible attitude are not recognized as productive work traits. The more initiative shown is rewarded with bad job reviews and redundant work."
bad,Very stressful and underpaid.Always being called out on you work.  management changes what seems like every other week.  no one in management was ever on the same page
bad,Worked as a Stationary Engineer at the USPS location in San Mateo.  Small crew with one really bad chief / manager. I am the third engineer to leave in the last couple of years due to the the poorly qualified and disgruntled chief that is the only voice to upper management that results in a one sided vision of the workplace. Very hostile environment and would look to seek employment somewhere you get management and HR support. JLL is one of the top real estate companies but the account at San Mateo USPS makes me think other wise.
bad,"I left my comfortable job to make more money, I was offered Training, that was denied after employment, I was offered uniforms, which they gave me hand me down clothes from other employees, I was told they would supply me with tools, and I ended up having to bring my own tools. I was told I was too old to apply for an apprenticeship."
bad,"The upper management at JLL on the Amazon account is not up to par with other organizations. They put people in place (Regional Management) that do not have a clue what their true responsibilities should be, they manage like low level techs. Do not expect support from them unless you are a “ yes man “... they love those people."
bad,This group in Westmont Illinois is  highly unorganized and management picks and chooses their favorites. They will push you out of their team if they don't like you. Training is obsolete and the group in general is very unhappy. Management is not on the same page about many critical procedures.
bad,"There is no work life balance in this industry and there  is poor management within JLL as well as our building. Overall culture of JLL is cut-throat and if you don't know someone to move up, then you stay stationary."
bad,"I was requested by a client to work for this company as they had taken over the contract for their facilities maintenance.  When I was hired the other people on the team had been made aware that I was with the client to for several years prior and that I was to be used as an asset.  This is not how it was. I was shunned, ridiculed and argued with because I had a relationship with the client they did not. Petty I know. At the time of my resignation I was told to provide medical records to prove I have a mental illness. They can't do that. The people are shady and only have dollar signs in their eyes. It's a great place to work if you don't have e a soul."
bad,"If you have ever had a Real job at a Real company, DO NOT GO TO JLL. If you have any talent and common sense don't be fooled by this charade.  "
bad,Managers are not trained to work with diverse staff. Poor transparency when it come to promotions. Flexibility can be great depending what area you work in.
bad,"Little to no progression, lots of office politics, and I've even been bullied by the managers due to my (mild)  autism. For a company that prides itself on equality and diversity of its people it is insulting!"
bad,JLL is a profit driven company who think nothing of crossing ethical boundaries and hold little if any regards to building relationships. It's all about their bottom line.
bad,"Excellent teams and management."
bad,"If you're lucky enough to have an 8 hour shift, you work 13 days before having a day off. If you work the 12 hour shifts, you have 2 days off every seven days, but it sucks for night shift people because you still have no family life... I enjoy the job I do, but its a hard life to live if you have a family. The pay is decent though."
bad,"The management will hinder your growth in every possible way. There is no professionalism. There is no direction and management would take up a project just to drop it off tomorrow, without reason."
bad,Jll treats their facilities managers like slaves. 24/7 work hours and that is expected with very low salaries. I have techs that work for me that make 50k more per year than I do.
bad,"Started out as a job I thought could be a career: interesting field, a variety of work and machines to maintain, but VERY quickly degraded to a complete joke. There is no support from any managers, not enough tools and equipment to go around, tons of missing parts that are frequently needed, and all in an extremely toxic environment run by morons who think they're better than everyone else."
bad,"Great training, however the work-life balance is non-existent and middle management seemingly based upon time served rather than actual ability. Good place to get a first job and find a new opportunity before they are able to run you into the ground. Little room for upward growth."
bad,Changed my work schedule 4 different times in a year. The final schedule I could not work due to other commitments I had coaching in the community. Was told work it or theirs the door. So I took the door couldn't turn away kids that I have coached for over 7 years. We're the work life balance that they preach.
bad,No Communication They Are A Company That Only Thinks About Them Self's Using The Sweet Of There Employees!! Management Is Substandard.
bad,"Do not take a job here as a call center agent. The pay is horrible however they expect you to constantly exceed expectations. You will be written up for everything, including absences with a doctor's note, needing to leave for personal emergencies, etc. You are allotted 5 minutes a day to use the restroom outside your scheduled breaks, so if you are older, pregnant, or use the restroom frequently, be prepared to be written up a lot. You will be written up if you are 1 second late from your break/lunch."
bad,"Poor management , all computer work required ,no maintenance work needed by engineer ."
bad,"This is Amazon.  Not JLL.   Great people to work with but you are woking for Amazon.  Amazon's training,  Amazon's managment and Amazons tools for the job.   And that means cheap service,  low cost and everything is about the numbers.    If you want to be a professional engineer in a great corporate environment.  This is not the place."
bad,Management is just absolutely terrible!!! Massive corporation you're nothing more than a number your supervisors will for you underneath the bosses quick as look at you.
bad,have never worked for a company where it was extremely difficult to communicate with Human resources. HR interaction with new employees is NONEXISTENT. Onboarding is done by temp employee who barely know what to do. HR DEPARTMENT onboarding need to be your responsibility HR. Another thing with HR is that everything is  done electronically (which is great BUT) one can never speak with a person from HR face to face to resolve any issues. It's extremely frustrating. I have been working  for this company for a month now and have not been paid for my work.  When I asked why I didn't get paid; they blamed me (lies). They take no accountability.  They do not  care about your personal responsibilities  that you have outside of work (ie. Bills to be paid). I will be quitting soon after I get paid. This place is a joke.
bad,"Don't work here unless you have a desire for a back stabbing, toxic workplace culture that is all talk when it comes to diversity and inclusion.  The most important factor to management is the bottom line so don't get in the way of that."
bad,HR at JLL is a joke. There is no one you can turn to when your local Group Manager/GM is a horrible person. HR basically tells them what you said you that your continue to be harassed and bullied until you have no choice but to leave. It's funny how as a low end employee you are subject to many people basing your competence on only the word of one individual. These other people have no idea what you are actually required to do day to day yet they get to tell you how well they think you are doing. Even when a manager has had multiple complaints to HR about them JLL will still keep  rising them up. It would be nice if low end employees had the option to give their feedback on how they think their managers are doing. That will never happen..
bad,"Corporate Solutions is a mess. You'll spend forever trying to figure out why your A/R is off when it's probably because another associate misapplied the cash. Year end was a nightmare. Constantly at work til 11 pm with some others staying even later, for a week or so. Abysmal communication skills. Everyone has too much to keep track of so things get missed. Once the manager is told some reporting is late, then they come to you asking why it's late. Turns out they never communicated that to you. So now you have to do that report ASAP while it messes up the other deadlines you were trying to meet that day..."
bad,"Badly managed, not enough training or employees, no cooperative culture or team culture. Extremely stressful and short deadlines. I would never work here again."
bad,"Management was very combatant, co-workers always worrying about their job.  No support from management on key issues. Customer sometimes hard to work with.  Severe Us - Them relationship with management. No team atmosphere.  Management no concerned about hourly just their job.  Crews worked hard together but not well with each other. Terrible communication and basically no training. I strongly recommend people to stay away from this account, you are not allowed to make an honest mistake without fear of termination even if it's not your fault. They protect their own."
bad,"I wouldn't want to work there again, very hostile environment, flip flops managment on decisions, it is extremely difficult to plan your day and give assignments to your engineers ,upper mangment/HR don't pack you up and support you or your team"
bad,"I worked at JLL for almost seven years before being laid off. I started as a lease analyst and transferred over to compliance about 5 years ago. This company does not value their employees in any way, shape or form. My workload had continually increased over the past 5 years and I was told I would be promoted to senior level but it never happened. Basically they just want you to continue doing more work for the same stagnant salary. There is no opportunity to advance. I applied to DOZENS of internal positions and was never given a chance. I got the same run around message from the recruiters/hiring managers. They clearly have no interest in promoting employees from within the company. I was just recently laid off from the compliance department because they did a business restructure and eliminated my position. I would NEVER recommend this company to anyone. The salary/raises are terrible, you are constantly overworked and asked to meet unrealistic deadlines, there are no opportunities for advancement and you are basically just a number. I wish I would not have wasted 7 years of my career at this subpar organization."
bad,JLL hires fresh out of school managers with 0 expirience to run large scale properties. The do not practice what they preach. Dealing with Human Resources in Chicago is a nigthmare.
bad,"The ethics is just a smokescreen , Never got a real chance Company account at jll was terrible experience. Had high hopes in the beginning Manager acts as dictator."
bad,"Having been a pioneer on this assigned account, I was excited to come back and see how things had matured. Poor direction and lack of leadership actually resulted in JLL losing the account, and me losing a job I held off and on for 14 years both direct and via other vendors/employers. I am embarrassed to have this association on my resume today. Not one manager or director would listen when I voiced my concern. My direct manager had no prior experience managing people, and poor judgment in general. What JLL was doing was not our vision when we outsourced that work to be done third party. Very vocal about discontent with client expectations rather than partnering and providing solutions per the contract JLL is overpaid to perform. All around waste of 3 years of my life."
bad,"Lies lies lies from management. They promise support but never delivers and then will hold it against you, not to mention the unfortunate mental harrasment from upper management, specifically the NJ property management office.  HORRIBLE!!!!"
bad,"JLL Contract job. "
bad,"Despite this company trumpeting their HR policies, in the end they are only in it for the money."
bad,Falta de comunicación entre departamentos. Nos e incentiva la movilidad el empleado
bad,They want you to work endless hours on General Motors account while being submitted to hostile Plant Managers that belittle and threaten your job. Managers have no backbone and will not stand up to GM personnel. Difficult to get earned time off. Send you out of state and require you to share rooms with other employees. Claim millions in profit but are cheap on hotels. JLL Management will lie to get GM approval.
bad,"In the beginning I really enjoyed working with my manager, who was a true mentor.  Hard work, long hours due to not enough support or staff. Higher management was no help and didn't back up managers."
bad,"You can work there for years, and they still treat you like a number."
bad,"The managment promises the world and delivers nothing, treat employees like garbage. By far the worst place I have ever worked."
bad,"Learned a lot at this assignment. Also, was able to further my education with tuition reimbursement. Although, the company did not fight hard enough for their employees, during the acquition. I felt we were sent up the river without a paddle."
bad,"You need to understand who you are working for.  JLL is a contractor to Amazon.  JLL provides building and equipment maintenance support."
bad,There is no room for advancement. Management is not supportive of growth. The company makes promises to the client that they are unable to fulfill which directly affects the analysts.
bad,"The company culture was one of no talking to fellow employees, keep you head down & work.  "
bad,"Watched over ten long term employees leave because they were overworked, underpaid, and could not receive assistance on their accounts. Impossible to get a meeting, nothing is in order. Accounts have backlogs of 1000's of unread emails that they will dump onto you."

bad,Some Brokers caused a hostile work environment with unprofessional condescending behavior. No support from Supervisor to resolve work life balance issues. No room for growth.
bad,This company has proven to be of low standards when applied to the managers on staff. They promis the world and deliver little. I was exposed to desceptive business and hiring practices. They currently are loosing market share at a rate that can not sustain their current employment levels.

bad,JLL can be a better cultural admosphere if it wasn’t so many politics and more diverse and less toxic environment. My manager was toxic and talked down on the women at the company. She was abusive and belittling to the women of JLL.
bad,"Schlechte Bezahlung und Vorgesetzte, ich kann nur von dieser Firma abraten. Das Arbeitsklima ist einfach nur miserabel und wird sich auch nicht ändern. Kein 13 Gehalt, kein zusätzliches Urlaubsgeld."
bad,Worst job I ever had.     Poor management was the biggest problem.    Obsessed with training and safety.   micro managed everything.  Anything you couldn't finish in an hour they farmed out.
bad,Severely lacking in management Talent. No Proven Winners in their management team. Ethics problems persist. Writing false end of shift reports. Intended to mislead General Motors. The team at Pontiac Powertrain needs help.
bad,"JLL took over for our unions contract with a big client midway through 2019.The client fired our old company because they weren't satisfied with the services that were being provided.So JLL goes and hires EVERY single person from management of the old company and offers them basically their same positions with a new shirt.JLL promised our client things that our beyond our ability.They completely butchered our union contract and have people doing other tradesman's scope of work on a daily basis.They lie when we order parts and ask about the status of the parts and say they are on the way.With no parts, little to no maintenance work can be completed.Were forced to lie on a regular basis and take credit for preventative maintenance work orders being done when none of the work our client is under the impression is being done, isn't. They make us use micromanagement software to track our work throughout the day and even worse start and stop a timer on every single thing we do throughout the day, including walking between the buildings.The majority of the management team is friends and family of each other stemming from the old management company.If they want to fire you or get rid of you they will play dirty to give you write ups.Little is expected of the union laborers and managers that are related to our highest managers.More is expected out of the people that are scared to be put under fire for NOT doing what they're told.I can't wait until the ship sinks and everyone can see these clowns for what they are.Managers lie to protect each other and try to place blame on the tradesman.They"

bad,District manager out of Florida asked me to lie to property manager. Very uncomfortable. Enjoyed my co workers but company exec's don't care about anything but the bottom dollar. Look elsewhere.
bad,"Managers are expected to be on call and available 24/7, no excuses.  The regional managers are an 'Old Boy's Network' and very conspiratorial.  Too much time spent in meaningless meetings."
bad,"Good organization to work with good work life balance, good support of the management & Superiors. Upgrading the employees by regular training. Good co- workers, management providing opportunity to upgrade ourselves. Proper leave management for all the employees."
bad,It's the good old boy club. The management team are very arrogant.  I would not recommend at all. I complained about a property Manager on an account.  She was not taking care of the customer on her account.  I did this after I gave my notice.  They let me go two days early.  No worries! ! I Worked at my friends Air conditioning company.  They are touted as being one of the best companies to work for. CBRE Better company for sure. Very professional !!
bad,Run Forest Run as far away as possible.  Pompous management and they don't care about employees.
bad,Most of their managing staff try to rush in to manage a clients account without researching how the client wants the account to be run.  Interior designers are in charge of the architects and cafm teams.  The managers that are incharge of the cafm teams have no idea how to use Autocad nor Archibus.
bad,"Management team was horrible at my location, knew that unethical behavior was taking place and did nothing about it. Pencil whipped paperwork to pass inspections and daily rounds on a regular. I do not recommend this company if you have conscience."
bad,"Great pay and hours. Poor management. If your a tech, your nobody. High turnover."
bad,I wouldn’t apply for this company if I know they don’t care about people privacy. They will talk and show your resume to everyone you worked with in the pass before you even know it.
bad,This company likes to move you about without your convent or knowing the management is always changing and I felt as thought I never really knew what was going on however they do pay well so some people may be able to put up with it
bad,"was a difficult job to understand, liked the work I did and the people I worked with but didn't like the owner. We didn't pay any the employees on time and shorted our pay checks every week. Was under payed and didn't get overtime for going over 40 hrs. Was never a set schedule and then schedule would change an hour prior to going to work. Had a history with IRS not paying taxes."
bad,• Adept in managing project installation / commissioning & startup facilities at the site as well as implementation for smooth operations in adherence to the standards and specifications in Instrumentation and Controls environment.
bad,"Every day was like walking into a bad television show. The pay was great, the time off was excellent. My co-workers were all depressed. All felt taken advantage of and underappreciated. The management (or lack thereof) was yellow-bellied and cowardice. Never standing up when they saw something was wrong. Especially when it came to safety. And no raise in sight so ask for all the money you want for the next 3-5 years."
bad,"JLL doesn't have a competitive salary package but they get you with their benefits.  You start out with 18 PTOs which increases to 23 upon your three year anniversary but it's not worth the salary.  Once you are in at a salary, be prepared for only 1-3% raises each year if anything at all.  I have been at this company for over seven years and they didn't give me a salary raise this year.  Fun to work with the people there but no one is looking out for you.  If you want to pave your own path and don't care about salary, this is the spot to start your career."
bad,Work is great when you have right the team players.I enjoy staying busy and finding a way to make people happy.I always look for a way to save money for the company.
bad,From day one even my manager could not stop saying how bad the company was. Why would I want to be with JLL. The allow one employee to just sit around and do nothing most of the time. Could not even get my manager to get me my benefits. Had to go behind his back and figure it out myself.
bad,waste of your time as a pro . They don't know what there doing at all !!! The recruiters are air heads and talk way up here and act like your down there.
bad,good place to work but there are a lot of loop wholes that need to be addressed and there is poor management and payroll is way off because they checks bounces and they take money out your check for no reason and they dont give paystubs
bad,"•	Ensuring all the Checklists are maintained and being followed."
bad,I learned all about the politics of an office environment of a large corporation.
bad,"JLL is basically has a great environment to work in where at every step there is a learning."
bad,the company is just ok depending on teh position you will hold will determine whether the company is good or not but in general i think you can find better company who can showcase your skill and support your career plans
bad,"Needs improvement in taking care of employees in terms of employee benefits,salary increase and company events as well as supporting career plan of employees."
bad,"I wasn't there long enough t really get a feel, but the short time I was there I enjoyed the people and the job."
bad,"This job has a child atmosphere. A lot of favoritism, no advancement to move up in company, Pay is horrible. Supervisors are sneaky and secretive. Open door policy is horrible because the management team are all friends."
bad,"I worked for the company at a pharmaceutical plant as a Lead Tech and filled in for the Chief Engineer twice (the company fired one, the other got smart and left) the customer liked my work, lots of KUDO's."
bad,Loved my co workers the managers were horrible. They didn't pay enough.
bad,Management forced me out of my job no help.Manager no help at all with day to day problems not trust worthy.Didnot stand by workers.Manager face to face was friendly then talked behind your back.
bad,the management team had many aspects of nepotism.  I was one of few hired from outside.  I was deemed an outsider since I was not part of the clique.  JLL based their decisions on the clients needs and not their employees needs.
bad,The culture has changed drastically since the Property Management Department has started managing industrial buildings. There is not enough staff nor structure. There is no training and no real structure provided by upper management.
bad,"Does not worthy to work with a such a bad Environmental  and work culture. Not a work team effort, people with no sense of costumer service... leaders with 0 experience pretending to be effective using old techniques."
bad,"They sell you the promise land when you are the one that creates the promise land for upper management. You as a person are not valued. They care about stats and not about you. They overload the work when they dont want to really pay up. The more people that quit, the cheaper they go for the next person and promote their own self to boat themselves with more money. Best of luck to whoever falls in this site"
bad,Debido a que la empresa subcontrata no puedes pensar a futuro ya que te liquidan cada año y te evaluan cada tres meses. En cuanto a conocimiento que puedas adquirir es muy poco probable ya que cuando contratan te solicitan con aplia experiencia. Te ofrecen una gama de cursos muy conveniente
bad,"Rumor has it life in the corporate environment is much different but on the account level the environment is terrible. Employees are not compensated, payroll process is faulty, and the disrespect received from leadership is unreal. The workload is not manageable due to leadership who only cares about the ""savings"" delivered to the client rather than the stress being put on their employees/retention percentage."
bad,"There’s a cap on what kind of raise you can get, which, depending on the situation, promotion, or new role, can be very unfair. As a result I saw high turnover when good employees weren’t appropriately compensated. Employees on client accounts tend to not feel as connected to JLL and more so to the client account."
bad,"The company is ok, i think that it has a way to go to be a cutting edge company to work for. It sometimes feels like they are 20 years behind and don't want to evolve."
bad,"Because of the Amazon culture at the warehouse JLL services. You walk 10 to 14 miles carrying a tool bag during a 12 hour shift.  Amazon's lack of training causes call for equipment where you simply Plug in or push a button to get Equipment running. Monee, Il. warehouse is 875,000 sq ft. Workers told to call mechanic if they have a problem."
bad,"I found that the work ethic of my associates to be both lazy and unprofessional. I learned that the majority of the management were not formally educated to hold the positions that they held. I witnessed a multitude of situations where management stated things in meetings that were absolutely incorrect. The items are not interpretive, they are building codes, laws and items that are common knowledge if you are qualified for your position. This was one of the hardest parts of the position. To sit and listen to nonsense from some senior management, knowing that the real professionals in the meeting knew that they were incorrect and often commented about this in private."
bad,"Here at jll, there is a lot of promises when your first hired and prior. You soon realize that you have to wait years to advance, spite your knowledge and talents. I work for the att account. Call outs are unforgiving. Called out all times of night. Performing two and three man jobs by yourself. The business motto changes as often as every year. A poor place to work with other people constantly negotiating a contract every year, so you can keep working. The changes I’ve seen in almost five years where dramatic. These changes jll made got us kicked right out the door."
bad,"J'aime beaucoup mon travail."
bad,Every one micro manages and no one knows wtf their supposed to be doing! And absolutely no communication till stuff is done and not how they want it. And
bad,"They are not focused on keeping people, very low ethics, very low manager assistance, out there on an island by myself. not doing the job I was hired to do. corporate models don't work at every location and they don't know how to fix the broken parts. upper management is lost."
bad,"The whole atmosphere was bad, it wasn't a good experience. The managers were not helpful when you needed help and if ayones did they got written up"
bad,"Terrible management. I have worked two different jobs for them and they don't staff or budget properly and then it's up to you to make it work. No training in 3 years, they don't pay for continuing education. You have no accounts to purchase what you need, my boss asked me if i was re-using rags????? I didn't even know what he meant."
bad,"Do you like to feel valued for the work you do? Do you want to feel included? If so then I highly recommend NOT working for JLL."
bad,On-boarding and leadership weren't the best. When bringing someone onboard you should expect to be prepared for the new team member and have someone to train them.
bad,"Managers play some politics they will not trust FM they Cal other team also."
bad,"Started loving this company when I was hired, after a year it went downhill. Workloads got more complicated, alot of changes, out of date equipment. Also there is no room for advancement unless you know someone. Very biased upper management. No bonuses or raises. Very high school like environment."
bad,Leadership is no good. This company sets you up yo fail. They make promises during the interview to reel you in. Then once you accept the position it is nothing like they say. I'm speaking about the site where I work. There is no team work.
bad,Entire shop was thrown under the bus and terminated after the Chief confessed to an in authorized recycle fund . No care or concern for the employees who had no clue . Managment has cover up agenda . No exceptions .
bad,"JLL branch that i worked for was within the Amazon warehouse account.  The managers that i had to interact with were the worst managers that i have ever experienced,  They expected folks to read their minds and whenever there was an issue that you needed help with they would get bothered that we could not figure it out.  If you worked the night shift you never interacted with the leadership as they never worked past 4 p.m.  Even the manager in charge of the night shift."
bad,"CIB sold to JLL in 2016. Numerous employees laid off over the last year - no longer adequately staffed. Employees treated poorly. No work/life balance,"
bad,"Lousy Management, always done their way and not given the time to explain why things should be done differently. Felt management was out to get rid of me when new manager took over because I wasn't their guy."
bad,"I learned that nothing is done if you get physically threatened by a co-worker in a crowded room, but you get fired for questioning another co-worker's work ethic."
bad,Each day starts the same way the budget ! How can we keep our commitments to the client while Our organization (JLL) grossly underestimated the cost of operations at this site. Site staffing was coerced into carrying out creative financing by getting the client to pay additional money for services which were included within the original JLL contract.  This is a very poor business practices from an ethical standpoint which I was placed into by JLL.
bad,"This place is slave drivers and managers don't recognise hard work and loyality. Lot of time they prefer employees don't know much because otherwise managers jobs may be at risk."
bad,"JLL has a great staff, but the management is third-rate. It's not unknown for them to be dishonest with employees, promising one thing and delivering another. Management is very disorganized and wants to pinch every penny to the detriment of staff."
bad,This company was fair but didnt have to much advancement to their employees
bad,"The work load is over bearing, they do not respect the workers opinions. They have no experience in the fields they are trying to manage. They rep-remind you for your mistakes, which goes on your evaluation for the end of the year."
bad,A lot of Management but with no clear direction. The Program manager was the bottle neck in all processes. JLL promised a lot of deliverables but executed on very few. No team atmosphere and the team lead was always traveling with no understanding of what the environment was really like.
bad,JLL has never controlled or operated the job duties that are required. I have knowledge of the requirements. I fully understand what needs to be done in a safe complete manner.
bad,"JLL does not pay its employees nearly enough and the turnover rate is high due to this.  The job requires a lot of attention to detail and strong accounting and organizational skills.  The benefits are nice, but growing within the company is not very common.  Most people that have been here for a very long time have been in the same position for years."
bad,JLL is a full scale brokerage firm so when it comes to people it is a hit or miss. There are many wonderful people there but their are plenty of people who are in it for themselves.
bad,JLL has great package of benefits but that's it. Lack of humanity and emotional inteligence from managers lead to an extremely negative work enviroment.
bad,"Was told I would be hired as a robotics tech and was informed that the program was ended. Upon employment my manager also informed me that he had no concept of mechanical systems, as a maintenance manager. ""I'm an ops guy"" was the response I was given. I was told to stop my preventative maintenance duties to assemble a table top hotdog warmer."
bad,"Management doesn't care about it's employees, attempts to over-delegate their work so not only they work less and you are over worked, but then they can assign blame to others if something goes wrong. They take advantage of employees in giving them as much work as possible while also paying them as little as possible. Management can do no wrong. If a manager messes up or acts unprofessionally it doesn't matter and no one cares, but if an employee does the same thing, their job could be threatened. If anything ever goes wrong, it's someone else's fault. It's a negative, unpleasant environment where you are only criticized and scolded while never praised or appreciated. Your voice is rarely heard, it's do or die with what your manager tells you. Only told of empty potential future possibilities with no intent on following through in attempt to keep the overworked, underpaid employees around for as long as possible to save as much as possible. Management doesn't realize that people are an asset so they drive many people away with their unpleasant conditions knowing that they will be able to find replacements. There is no internal review of managers themselves so long as their bottom line is met, so no matter how poor a manger may be and how unpleasant they make things for those under them, no one will know and upper management won't care. So the poor management continues to keep their nice, high paying jobs and get their large bonuses and pay raises while they continue to cycle through new workers to do all the work for them while giving them little to nothing."
bad,"There is no work/Life balance with JLL, it's all work. The better you do at your job the more work is dumped on you. There is not enough staff to adequately meet expectations."
bad,"Not interested in leaving comments.  Not sure why this I required to apply for a job.."
bad,"JLL has excellent benefits and well meaning employees that try hard to meet a demanding customer's expectations. Management leadership is very poor, confused and detached."
bad,"JLL is a stressful place to work. The demands by management are sometimes inconsiderate and make no sense.  Management holds an excessive amount of meetings, tool box talks, one on one, and training sessions that repeat the same subject matter.  Management's mentality of ""you're only as good as your last mistake""  takes out the motivation of doing your job and it stresses you out.  If you're a person that likes to do the bare minimum and doesn't like to advance in a career and expect to get paid a high salary, then JLL is the right company to work for.  It develops a culture of less is better and if you do more, then you're looked as a person that's out to get your boss's job and you're held back.  Some people are great to work with."
bad,The staffing model agreed to with client was unattainable.  Causing an overwhelming amount of work for all staff.  I enjoy my position with the company.  If it was staffed appropriately we would be extremely successful.
bad,"Upper management has no clue of what really takes place out in the field. The company is so large and involved in so many different things, they are disconnected with the workers."
bad,"Employees treated badly , miss treated forced to find employment elsewhere . Supervisors demanding unreasonable changes and regulations not with company policies."
bad,"Was not a comfortable or enjoyable culture for women to work in.  At least not in 2018.  Does have a good salary and benefits, plus very stylish offices."
bad,Considero que es una compañía que se enfoca desarrollar profesionales de alto desempeño gracias a su completo plan de entrenamientos.
bad,"The JLL culture is a bit toxic.  Its more about stepping on others rather than promoting peers."
bad,"My worst job experience! "
bad,The company has no prior experience before this contract in facility management. They have expanded rapidly and allowed people not capable of performing at their role in at all levels. I have had significant safety issues among other thing that resulted in my decision to leave.
bad,Client required remote work. Travel was a constant requirement for the project. Client restructuring produced the cancelling of the renovation program.
bad,"Poor management.  Promise advances, but never follow through.  Pay is too low for the amount of work being done. I do not recommend JLL for employment"
bad,"Jll culture is if you are in management then you don't speak or even look at a technician. "
bad,Mislead during interview process. Pay lower than average companies of its size. Constantly changing job requirements and expectations.  Management seems to be going downhill quickly with no guidance other than from of service techs.  LOTS of mileage on personal vehicles which company vans were promised countless times.
bad,"Just like with CBRE, the brokers are regarded as revenue producers and staff and other professionals as overhead. Definitely cliquish. Large cube environment and so the work can be distracting."
bad,"Management is mostly non existent .   Must be able to work independently,   No room for advancement HR is non existent as well.........................................."
bad,Micro-managed and even if you work hard and finish all of your work and go the extra mile when your job evaluation comes up they will give you an average score to keep your raise at the minimum. Health insurance is awful and extremely expensive.
bad,Everyday brings something different to assist each client.to provide good customer service in a timely manner.work well with team members.everyone is friendly to work with.
bad,"Working in Amazon's fulfillment cent is chaotic.   If you like not knowing how to do your job due to lack of training, answering to 5 managers telling you to do your job 5 ways, no accountability,  no training, then this would be the place for you.  Expectation here is to be married to your job 24-7 and a work load you can't complete at work.  Overtime only really available during peak times and unwilling to spend money on improvements.   Always worried they will get kicked out of the building.  Cannot keep controls techs or leads.  It's like a revolving door and a constant job listing.  If I had known this was the way it was, I would not have taken the position"
bad,the work pace as slow.  I was so organized and made work there really easy for myself and others. I didn't learn much at this place. some of the people were nice.
bad,"No support even after repeatedly asking for help, then informed that the job wasn't good enough because I couldn't do what I was asking help for.  Complete lack of empathy."
bad,"Your working peers made the environment bearable.  We new we were doing our job for an important client and we took pride in our work.  Management, sought undermine the workers, but in general were unsuccessful.  Management was not as concerned with truly resolving as issues, rather put the bandaids on to make the metrics ""look"" good at the time.  Therefore, they were never concerned with long-term solutions.  Management would lie and be deceitful to others to advance there own agendas -bonuses.  Hence, our raises would be .25-.50 cents/hour for all non-management personnel.  The rest goes to management.  They also would make you fill empty positions for months on end while performing your core duties without further compensation.  They would wait until the following year to fill positions to make the years budget look better."

bad,"Field sales does extensive work with unhappy clients. As soon as the account is profitable for field sales, the account is ""assumed"" by a sales manager. As soon as the manager upsets the client, field sales gets the problem back."

bad,"Huge account, but terribly structured contract with client , doomed for failure from too lean of staff."
bad,for the time I was there they were not very organized I worked at three different buildings with a audit process that was not understandable and compensation for end of year review
bad,This organization is super political and senior leaders can be VERY unprofessional...bad-mouthing senior staff members in front of junior employees. Overall weak chain of command willing to throw others under the bus just to save their own jobs. Not a lot of moral fortitude here.
bad,"No perks"
bad,Average work environment more work pressure. Management ruling company. Salary is very less than industry norm and lack motivational. Negative wave spread every corner of work floor
bad,"horribly abusive environment in Irvine's commercial division. seriously poor communication by mid mgmt, BS treatment and demeaning behavior. high pressure rolls downhill.  temp agency does not protect their employees. I begged to get out and they told me no jobs and stick put."
bad,"Poor upper management structure. The goal is to get JLL's, foot in the door and then try and solve the issues as they come up with additional charge-backs to their customers.  This management style results in a blame game with its customer, due to JLL's lack of understanding of the actual cost involved in running there operations due to a lack of due diligence during their initial negotiations.  In addition JLL fails to provide the adequate manpower necessary to make these commitments which they promised to there customers. JLL may be a great office support company, however they have no idea what it takes to operate and maintain a support roll of a manufacturing facility."
bad,"This was an  unhealthy work environment. The management team was constantly tearing you down.  They work say do more show more drive, than the next week they would slap your hand and say stay in your lane.  The HR policy changed daily."
bad,"1. Worst place to work and the co-workers. "
bad,JLL Management is beholding to the Client even when the client is wrong. Terrible ethics and poor communication.  The senior leadership needs to visit the facilities so they can see want is really going on.
bad,"The company's benefits are great. The job itself is ok if you're looking for something that has no authority/decision making. Very easy job . Little to no marketing.. so if you have hopes of managing social media or running ad campaigns, think again. I definitely think the job title is misleading 95% of the work is reception and office assistant duties. "
bad,"A typical day at work would be carrying out administrative duties as well as answering phones, drafting documents and emails, filing and greeting customers. Also providing strong customer service at all times."
bad,smart people but culture is 100% business.  No real personalities to speak of either in field offices or at HQ in Chicago.  I have worked for four other companies in middle management all over the U.S.  This by far was my worst experience.
bad,poco stimolante l'ambiente di lavoro. Nessun coordinamento con lo staff dirigenziale

bad,I've been with this company for about 7 months now and I have yet to have anyone from upper management visit to see what is happening at this facility and the people here. A shift to another engineering company is upcoming and they are not helping the existing employees with finding another job at all.
bad,"Now, at first, I thought that maybe it was just the IFM team at my site but after reading the bulk of the other reviews on this website and confirming my suspicions with colleagues at other sites I can see that there is a global trend with JLL."
bad,"When working for such a large company as Jones Lang LaSalle, it is very easy to get lost in the mix. They do not recognize their employees as often as they should and there is little room for advancement."
bad,Serviced and maintained chillers for AT&T.
bad,Inexperienced management made for a very poor working environment. A very high turn over rate due to mistreatment of personnel.Very long hours.
bad,"Every person from bottom to top that have Manager in there title have no idea how to run a maintenance program nor do they have any idea how to take care of and mentor the technician. There is no road for promotion laid out. They do not counsel in any way on the end of year review. Techs on the Amazon account are jam getters not maintainers. It's a very frustrating place to work, but the pay and schedule are the only things that make one stay."
bad,"Met some great people and enjoyed my job but felt under valued as an employee, and couldn't approach management for support or advice  without feeling some type of belittlement."
bad,"You don't go anywhere unless you're in the ""in"" group. Expected to do more work with less people and more stress. Insurance is nice, but not much else is worth it."
bad,"When I first started it was great. I was making a decent salary for my position and it seemed like a great workplace with a small, close knit group of employees. Boy was I wrong. It's a very toxic workplace where people spread rumors, try to ruin your career advancement opportunities (what little ones there are), and don't even give the common courtesy to say hello. To make things worse management does nothing to fix these issues. There's cliques and if you aren't a broker you aren't treated with respect. They view you as replaceable. It's sad because it could be so great to work there, but the management is weak and won't step up to make any necessary changes."
bad,"JLL isn’t all the hype is claims to be. Now, if you know the right people, are a part of the “club” that will define your chances of advancement. "
bad,"The lead position is a great job. Work from home, set your times for meetings, great work -home life balance.It is a very clique type of work environment, managers are all over the country, most meeting with management were tele-meeting."
bad,"I chalk up my time there to be interesting and educational. I learned things I would not have learned elsewhere. My main complaint would have to be with the supervisors. Because of their lack of experience they could not manage properly. I took issues to them (3x) and they wouldn't work with me. It was very frustrating when I would clearly state what the problems were and they brushed them off. It only showed their lack of training/experience/concern. It's sad when your own supervisors won't invest in you or you care more than they do. I would not recommend this company overall. The hours were good and pay was good. There are some departments with good supervisors, but for the most part they hire friends, then friends of friends, etc. Some of these 'friends' are not experienced enough to handle the job but I feel they are 'protected.'"
bad,Not enough employees in a given department to handle all the work that needed to be done.   Most enjoyable part of the job was working from home and the flexible schedule
bad,The culture of some organizations are good and others are not as good.  You will have to understand your situation and ask questions about who ultimately decides your performance.
bad,"When I was hired, I thought I landed my dream job. However, I should have started to notice the red flags sooner because looking back, I realized that there was no real onboarding system. I was told to sit next to one of the outgoing employees and just do what she did. I never even knew who the HR rep for our office was. I was also told that the hours were ""casual because we're all adults"" by one supervisor and then told by another that I needed to be onsite from 8:30 to 5:30, otherwise it would put the rest of the team (people who barely spoke to me) behind. As far as day-to-day efficiencies go, there were too many systems and processes you needed to go through just to get one task done. The line of communication was too long, meaning my work had to be approved by the team admin and all of the brokers on the project before the actual client even saw it. Most of the time, projects sat on deck for weeks or months at a time before decisions were made either by the client or brokers. There was always a sense of ""hurry up and wait"". While I found some of the meetings necessary, most were a waste of time. I worked closely with the team admin and sat next to her, but if there was ever an issue, it was brought up to my supervisor and sat on until the next scheduled performance review (possibly months later) and then brought to my attention. As a creative professional, being chained to my desk with no clear design direction because the brokers used phrases like ""make it pop"" or  ""make it look modern and tech-y"" did absolutely nothing to keep me inspired to create my best work. I would"
bad,JLL is a 3P (3rd party provider of services)  Focus was on recording your work time per the expectations not according to what you actually did or did not do.  Management would not come out and tell you to falsify the records but there was no doubt that the desired outcome was what was expected.  The promise to the client was a high amount of PM type activities but the quantity expected was simply not available.  The actual amount of work needing to be accomplished fell far short of the available hours.  Finding things to do was not discouraged but how the hours were recorded were to be as prescribed not necessarily reality.
bad,"Worked for 5 months, Get a good training process to starting,"
bad,"After a year I am looking for a new company."
bad,"Good opportunities to progress in some departments.  Other areas I feel are mismanaged and lack of resources allocated to certain portfolio's doesn't allow the business to provide the level of service that customers should expect."
bad,"Over the last year we have had multiple changes in management. These constant changes in management, direction and task ownership makes for a difficult work environment, micromanagement to the fullest is driving away the good employees. With a limited number of qualified candidates they are hiring anyone that submits a resume to fill positions to appease the client, hiring the wrong candidates increases the work load on current personnel."
bad,The Kimberly Clark account was a large campus with 7 five story buildings run by 3 building engineers and a chief engineer . under staffed we were overwhelmed every day just to keep up with the work demand . was promised training on site but never really received any . Did alot of repairs and learning on my own by taking my time and figuring things out. At times it became a safety issue for me . Not knowing everything your doing around large equipment could get you hurt if your not really careful ? The chief engineer was not really engaged with the overall staff which caused some issues with the overall team enthusiasm. I tried to make this job a career but after 6 months i just had to move on and i put my  2 week notice in to find a better opportunity for me because i deserved better .
bad,"Pretty standard day, The work that we did was rewarding and the day to day work was okay - I worked on different systems that were easy to learn and the support was there to help."
bad,"Management could use improvement "
bad,You learn how to do a lot of important warehouse jobs and stay in good shape due to the type of work. The hardest part about the job is when you show up to a job site and have to tackle a stair carry of objects over 200 pounds.
bad,"Management does not have a good back ground in preventative maintenance, consequently priority jobs do not get done. This is mostly cause of lack of parts or the safety culture. Most co-workers are helpers which do not have any training and JLL will not spend the money for there apprenticeship."
bad,"Company is professional"
bad,I used to work 1 year for JLL.
bad,"do whatever it takes to keep client happy, even if it means losing the morale and respect of our onsite JLL team.  many resources available but finding them on the JLL work site is very difficult and frustrating-not user freindly"
bad,"Then leave and make real money somewhere else. They notoriously underpay. They're flexible, generally, which is why most people put up with it. But they're never going to pay you what you are worth."
bad,The New Orleans Management Team is just a joke. The management team does have years of experience they currently do a little as work as possible. They will have administrative support do work for them but never train them to do the work and then say how incompetent. When being hired raises and continuous training is what is offered but it’s never given.
bad,Big Mistake!! Some days management make you feel less then them. If you're not on their level then you're nothing. They are unclear when they hire for a job. It can change in a week and get upset if you don't get it.
bad,"they would treat you like a lesser person if you did not work in the bigger citys , being a rural worker they tend to belittle you and think that your slaking off because you have to drive long distances between the town/citys"
bad,"It really depends on your manager, but the higher up you get, the colder the people get. It's difficult to be listened to if you don't agree with management's tactics."
bad,Not enough training provided to employees - career growth in denver office stunted. Salary increases only average 2.5% per year. Seems like a great company in other states. Not that many opportunities for growth within Denver office.
bad,"JLL is a good place to get exposure to complex facility management contracts, accounting, and financial analytics. They offer a casual work environment and flexible PTO and work from home policies. However, I do not recommend staying long because their salaries do not keep up with market rates. Therefore, tenured employees are essentially penalized for being loyal to the company. As a manager I have found JLL would rather pay more for external hires than give good employees their deserved wage increases."
bad,"it is a good company, the working condition is also good. the company management is also good. co workers is in friendly nature"
bad,"A day starts with site handling and undertaking of resposibilities and monitoring of the infrastructure and smooth working environment over the entire day at work."
bad,Perception is critical. if a tenant has issues the company starts looking for a scape goat. The Audit is a joke.  You spend months getting it ready and half the time the owners fail to buy off on the items needed preventing you from passes. The company in most locations have few perks and it's rare to see anyone get a bonus.  The Healthcare is mi imal with a high copays at many locations.
bad,the job itself is an awesome job but the one thing i would disagree with is how the upper management over My current facility is only looking to benefit themselves
bad,"JLL CAS was OK for a bit but my managers (I had two) were either a) buried in other projects and too busy to teach/train or b) a total blowhard moron far too inept for his role.  "
bad,"good company, work life balance is a priority for them. But they are not leading edge technology and they lack effective managers."
bad,"OK Company, didn't really get to work with people from the company since I was always in a bank of America office"
bad,Call center that was in high demand.  As soon as you walked in the calls started.  Calls came in back to back for 8 straight hours.  I definitely learned how to multi-task as well as paraphrase which was important due to the calls being timed and all the information needed to complete the call.  Due to this being such a fast pace environment my co-workers and I weren't able to form any kind of relationship however they were good workers overall.  the hardest part of the job was the fast pace and the micromanagement. 
bad,"JLL has great benefits. But be prepared to work like a dog. And don't even think about having a life outside of work cause you will always be at work. The pay is pretty good, but for the all the duties they ask of you, it is truly not worth it! Also, the management is horrible. Some of the managers are very cold and impersonal and could care less about your career growth. It was so bad for me, I left there to take a lower paying job!"
bad,"Management sucks, especially the ones u consider friends."
bad,I loved this job. All up until I got laid off for some ridiculous reasons. The people whom run this job are stuck up and judgemental as all heck I never should have been laid off and treated the way I was.
bad,"very large company "
bad,"Disgruntled maintenance lead, in my opinion not enough attention to safety issues. Always worrying about some budget. Manager thought Intimidation was a good technique."
bad,"Challenging team transition"
bad,Mangement is terrible crew comes up with ways to fix things and nothing changes. Might just be this site but hear its everywhere. Been trying to hire people since I have been there many employees have given resumes to chief and he hires nobody but people he knows we are probably short 6 people for two years now
bad,"É uma multinacional de grande porte com muitos benefícios, mas falha em alguns pontos que deveriam ser prioridade: plano de carreira, suporte aos colaboradores de contratos."
bad,"Everything from lights to toilets to HVAC. Elect troubleshooting skills needed."
bad,The supervisor had me change out fluorescent light bulbs and later he went and twisted some of the bulbs to where they would flicker. The next day he came and got me and in front of all of the tenants told me that I did not twist them in correctly. He told everyone there that I was new and would one day learn how to screw the light bulbs in correctly. Now of course I had been changing out the lights for 3 weeks and never had a problem. I think you can get the picture.
bad,"People are not trained before becoming managers and do not have great leader or managing skills. Only the benefits make this job worth it. If that is what someone is look for and not great management, then this is the place to work."
bad,Great stakeholders but not enough guidance; No knowledge transfer where gaps identified- highly technical environment; Fast paced projects                                                                   ;
bad,I came on board when this account first started. It was chaotic and frantic. The management was more of a bully than a leader.
bad,"My job entails HVAC start up at 6AM Mon - Fri. This property is not a 24 hour service one. Fans on line at 6AM and are off line at 6PM."
bad,"JLL in general is a great company to work for. However, upper management is very difficult and unfair to work for."
bad,Very traditional corporate culture. Lots of long time employees who are steeped in the way they do things and not open to a fresh perspective. They will push out anyone who tries to change things. 
bad,"they are a great company and will give you unlimited training , great place to work if you are just starting in the field but if you have a lot of experience , they don't pay enough or give raises much . great people to work with and great environment , great team ."
good,Bad management. Recommend allowing all team members to participate in team building. Major dumping of higher level work. Unrealistic Expectations. Salary not competitive.
good,it's only okay working here. it's a job. no structure within the group. managers focus on the bottom line over employee sanity. no sense of belonging with this place
good,Very busy. very demanding clients.  Jll is a great company. 18 PTO days per year is a plus. Benefits could be better very high deductible. The pay increases are below the cost of living.
good,is stressful. not much more can be said. To top heavy. Life and balance is good. Increases are not good at all. Some departments are not on the employees side.
good,"No growth in JLL , Maintain preferential policy to grow team , leadership in india is worst , All Top positions lead by North indians "
good,JLL allows us to work from home most of the time and also lets us manage our own time. We also have pingpong table that is avaialble anytime.
good,"Meeting with client. Discuss and plan the day ahead and formulate schedule work pending work and fix the timeline for these jobs."
good,• Coordinating day-to-day utility activities
good,"A day for work starts at computer , i prioritize Pm'S and W/O"
good,Inexperienced and young management leads to pervasive clique culture and interpersonal issues.  I was aggressively treated and experienced harassment by a co-worker but management did not do much and I was made to continue working closely with the co-worker.  I don't believe these issues apply across the board for JLL.  I believe my experience was account and site specific.
good,"worked for JLL/Amazon and it was painful ,over stressed,under managed, short cuts taken to make amazon happy, will throw employees under bus if it would make them more money ."
good,"No formal training program, set you up to fail. Coaching on job tasks, learn as you go. I had hoped it would've been better."
good,1. when i work hard
good,"Definitely NOT recommended for those who want to advance in their career. There are zero opportunities if you are on a client location."
good,"From the start, job was not what it was billed as... No training; Expected to be on call 24 hours a day; Required babysitting untrained start up supervisors at regular intervals.  BPD-Business plan development is a joke. Promoted by people who want things laid out in an unrealistic fashion by people who could care less. There was no reimbursement for out of pocket expenses."
good,Learned a tremendous amount about the industry. Great mentors for Real Estate transacting and doing daily business. A clear management structure needs improvement .
good,"Policy is subject to change from week to week as it is dictated by the client. Management is afraid to stand their ground on any issue, so it results in lots of work outside of our regular scope."
good,A good company to work for if the Employer appeciates the employees.
good,Management lacking people skills.Co workers not skilled.
good,"I have work for JLL going on 9 months now on the Leidos account. JLL has a major onboarding and training issue on this particular site in Columbia, MD. Management does not make sure staff has the required equipment to perform day to day task. Senior management is out of touch and has no concern for their staff; and just focus on pleasing the client and higher ups. In my particular position I still do not have a clear direct supervisor; this has been the worst job experience I have ever had . The lack of support is horrible. I would recommend not working for this company"
good,"Poor Management"
good,"I began with Spaulding and Slye Colliers and this company was amazing.  A real family real estate feeling.  Then they sold the company to JLL and the entire culture changed within weeks.  Every S&SC assistant scrambled to find another opportunity, despite having been told our positions were secured.  Bummer"
good,I was contractor and did not have much exposer to the company or the culture.  Our work environment was stressful.  We also had to work long hours.  Overall it was stressful environment. .
good,"It was a good experience working with a big brand of IPC. The job was totally target based and the company is fully professional."
good,"A typical day to day is reviewing the AP dashboard to see what is in the que and set my task for the day."
good,"This is a very fun environment full of energy; however, the opportunities for advancement are pretty slim for non-transactional roles. The expectation of rapid progress is very dim."
good,"Not well managed, contract not well set up. Management seems more interested in the bottom line than in hiring the people needed to perform the work."
good,"La esctructura de JLL en Argentina es pesima."
good,"Check e-mails Doing rounds to check operation of HVAC equipment. Making repairs to equipment as needed. Check chemical levels and pressures for boilers and chillers. Respond to fire system if needed. I did anything that management deemed pertinent. "
good,Company is ok to work for.  I wouldn't depend on the company for training or support.
good,Meeting the expectations of the customer and management is a continuing challenge.
good,"My typical day at work is very easy going and i experiance different issue with different Citi Bank Branches and locations. In my feild as a CRS Citi Bank Help Desk Agent i place mainteniance tickets for branches and building whome may be having some facility issues with there water reatments, electric, and HVAC."
good,I enjoyed my job with the customer...not JLL management. They like to micro manage.
good,"A productive work environment. I enjoyed working as a facility coordinator.   Co-workers are supportive of each other. The work is not hectic. However, I wish the company is more diverse in terms of employees and provides more job security for contract workers."
good,"I was a temporary Admin. Assit. for JLL in Febdruary of 2018 within the North Bethesda Corporate office and fell in love with the office, the staff and the culture. Once that temp. assignment was over I was granted a full time position a year later! I was ecstatic! Throughout that year I gained experience in property mgmt. etc. as a temp with office team and applied for the property management assistant role at JLL. I spoke with an HR specialist and was granted that position. The official hiring process took about 3 weeks but I felt it would all be worth it... Fast forward I am given my address to my job and the pay looks great! I arrive and am greeted at the HSBC headquarters but am being trained and welcomed as the receptionist of the office... I spoke with a few HR admin and was THEN told that I needed more experience before I could take on  an property ASSISSTANT role... I was very frustrated but stayed in my position hoping to ""gain"" more ""experience"" and be bumped up into the career I intended to be in... I was completely blind sided and felt as if I was just thrown into this position because it was available. The HR did not understand my frustrations and I feel as though whenever I expressed that I most definitely was not being challenged enough or doing anything at the office for that matter, no one really heard me or took my feelings or skills into consideration.  I stuck it out for 3 months and although the office staff was very lovely I did not feel like I made an impact at all. A typical day consisted of me staring at a computer screen all day (studying in my meantime)"
good,JLL is a contractor for multiple companies taking care of facilities. Good place to work for the most part. Its a contract job and not direct hire positions for clients.
good,"According to me is work profile is good. Work environment is not good, i was hardly around only 6 months over there. office equipment's is not enough."
good,Over all OK company to work for. Raise this time around was only about 2% thought it could have been better. They are really big on safety which is really good.
good,"Internal promotions in the company have become a thing of the past .  Regardless of performance, the current management team is strongly pushing their diversity agenda, which has led to an increase of hiring from outside the company to meet these objectives.  Hard working and experienced employees are being ignored, as the focus is solely on meeting diversity objectives.  On the positive side, the company does promote work/life balance and allows employees to work remotely on a regular basis."
good,"JLL is a large company made up of smaller accounts.  Each account is different.  Each account is almost as if it is its own small company."
good,"Upper management was always cutting corners to save money. Many jobs were eliminated to hire overseas employees happy to make minimum wages. No job security, call center was always being downsized"
good,Lack of work life balance with faceless interaction causes a work environment that gave little room for success for an interactive person like myself.  I am dedicated and don't mind working long hours but there was no focus on work life balance which is extremely important for both professional and personal health
good,Open cubes so you feel like you don't have a lot of privacy. It is also hard to get work done sometimes when everyone is talking to each other most of the day about non-work related things.  It is important to make sure you have a good manager who has a strong presence in the office and can make time for their team members.
good,"The company is great on their wellness programs and promoted a healthy living and incentives through your health care carrier. They held their biometric screening at headquarters and allowed everyone to participate in the program.  They also promoted other programs such as Fitbit, allowing you to lead a healthier lifestyle, while challenging your coworkers."
good,"unstable, no learning/training, poor backing from boss, leaders in it for themselves, knowing i'll never get anywhere, the clients."
good,"Its a different ball game working for this organization."
good,Working for JLL has been a great learning experience and I will remember working with them for a very long time.  JLL is very organized and well managed.
good,"The work is interesting, with a steady flow of stuff to do.  Could work on better employee benefits and training new managers.  I am sure as they grow they will work thru these issues.  The enjoyable part of the job is working with the clients and co-workers, as well as learning new stuff every day."
good,"I worked in Lease Administration with Jones Lang LaSalle. I felt detached from the lease administration business unit as an employee. Hub for lease administration is in Pennsylvania and I felt the way we were operating was very different. The pay was awlful for California, although my manager in Pennsylvania thought it was great. JLL is also not very diverse it is a typical commercial real estate firm controlled by the good old boy network."
good,Averaged 60+ hours a week.  No clear direction and leadership does not listen.  They over promised the client and the associates suffer with long hours and lack of appreciation.  Leadership is also not fully transparent with the client.  This along with the hours led to my leaving.  I had a wonderful team.
good,"Great brand in the real estate space to launch your career. "
good,Worst Management. No one supportive.No learning. office environment is also negative. It's spoil your if you trust your management. Also spoil your future
good,"Goal and task driven environment. No work life balance. Good benefits, remote work options, the environment depends on the manager you are assigned...not all are good."
good,"It's more like who likes you or doesn't like you that affect your ability to do your job successfully as well as advance in your career . I started as lead and ended as lead .  Human Resources is hard to get straight  answers from . If management or someone friends with management doesn't particularly know you that well or if your not in the ""click"" I guess you'd say . Makes career advancement impossible , there were 3 chief engineers during my time here . One which was great two that were horrible"
good,"Customer is number one, regardless if employee is right, wrong or indifferent.  Things tend to not be completed correctly, as long as customer is happy."
good,The Management should do more to retain their employees and work on career progression or succession planning for staffs who had served with them long in the company.
good,"The company appears to be very good but HR and management are very poor and mistakes are made constantly."
good,The culture here is almost non-existent in the sense that there is no teamwork or camaraderie among employees. Everyone seems unhappy to be there. The benefits are decent and there are work-from-home opportunities which makes people stick around longer.
good,It was a decent place to work. Some days everything aligned well most days it was a hectic environment. Things were inconsistent managers would go on without providing assitance.
good,Very busy workdays. Work life balance needs improvement I.e. working from home. Advancement opportunities are not encouraged. Currently reducing staff across the offices.
good,No cuento con los veneficios antes prometidos y no veo claro la forma y rumbo de la empresa
good,Great job until Sun Micro sold out to Oracle. Oracle did this work with employees versus 3rd party companies. Not much else to say.I enjoyed this job until the position was eliminated.
good,"You will be a contractor for Amazon. Amazon security is quick to terminate JLL techs for safety breaches that are normal operating at most facilities. Amazon rushed the construction of the Monee, IL facility. Lots of downtime due to shortcuts by installers."
good,JLL is a REIT which can mean your role could be in a company asset or on contract with one of their vendor sites. Make sure the people you’re interviewing with are clear about where you’ll be working and the terms of your employment.
good,"Although they claim to ""pay for performance""- that sounds good, but is not followed through. Promises are made when taking on extra workload, but not followed through with annual raises."
good,"Too political; people of color have to work doubly hard to advance.  Promotion isn't as easy/fitting in is not as smooth compared to counterparts.  Just me experience for me,."
good,HR and Management can not be very helpful (for AMAZON account) since they are all over the world and under staffed. they don thave agood feel of how to support you
good,"The work environment is good, but employee management I think is bad maybe this is because you are assigned to a different location (clients location). People from the head office doesn't often see the people deployed in the client's location so I think it prone to miscommunications and such."
good,"The office is great and very good people who work there. However, as an intern they did not have a lot of work for me to do. The rest of the office seemed to be busy but I was not challenged."
good,Mangers do not speak to the other workers on the floor and thus the supervisors do the same thing.  The hierarchy is all messed up and it is an every man for himself atmosphere.
good,The biggest problem at JLL is that the management team refused to consider the observations of the workers. The company is a management company with closed minds.
good,"-- Need to deal with different kind/level of the people"
good,"Bons benefícios;"
good,"Very heavy workload with continued higher expectations.  Worked with some wonderful people but within JLL and with Client."
good,"Overall, JLL is a great company to work for, however, I think your satisfaction with the company really depends on your account and your direct manager."
good,"A typical day was coordinating meetings, typing correspondence, email, travel arrangements, office supplies, screening and redirection of incoming phone calls, company daily mail, filing and light accounting projects."
good,"Lots of hours, lots of responsibility, not always organized around processes, flexibility a must, creating stronger culture, willing to create your own path"
good,healthcare account for jll is a joke no backbone when it comes to getting the guys who actually run these buildings and upper management doesn't have a clue
good,"Enjoy building strong relationship with client at Bayer & JLL."
good,"great company. growing rapidly. clean facility. pay is in the middle and lower portion of the scale. benefits are better than nothing, but would be expecting a better benefits package with as large of a company as they are."
good,This company could be really awarding however management can do better developing new employees. The workplace environment is relaxed however during certain times work can be overwhelming if expectations aren't communicated and responsibilities and timelines aren't explained.
good,Good workplace  and good management with strong knowledge about the facility management. There are lot of things to learn in JLL management and also the reporting structure is also good.
good,Responsibilities are not clear. Everyone is doing everything. Lack of focus of management on new business initiatives.
good,"It was good working for them these few months.  My supervisor was up front with me from the start about how long the job would last.  I learned more about the financial reporting side of facilities.  Management was good.  The work culture was good until I moved to another site for 1 month that was a culture shock.  The move to the other site.  It was very open and very strict on what you can do and cant do.  The most was being able to enhance my skills, meet and work with new people.  Being able to give my input and getting the recognition for coming in and getting the job done."
good,Not much room for advancement. Big company so it depends on your supervisors but so many supervisors and not enough hens.
good,"Typical day consists of downloading bank lockbox deposits, analyzing, entering, and applying cash to tenant accounts.  "
good,"JLL is a good company to work for.  They offer a wide range of clients/accounts to work with and have good career opportunities. "
good,Working in client site is a different experience. the management team was fully supportive. Good opportunity to work with many IT companies.
good,Answer phones respond to emails greet students respond to customers about equipmet purchass schedule pick ups for portable equipment
good,"First my facility management experience in a Shoping Mall with Multiplex.I learned lot about centrally chiller system,CCTV system,fire alarm system,Plumbing system,Water treatment system."
good,Typical day was processing checks.  Management didn't really take the time to know who you were.  My co-workers were entertaining and we laughed a lot.
good,A typical day at JLL is answering phones and doing your work to the best to your ability. I've learned a lot of things doing special projects. The hardest part of this job is not being able to move up in the company. Also management focusing on the smallest things and treating their co workers like kids. The thing I enjoy most are my co workers and some of the people you come across when on the phone.
good,"Input utility bills"
good,"The job was enjoyable for many years, but while JLL talks so much about work/life balance, they do not follow through.  60-80 hour work weeks were not uncommon and if you have a family, it takes a toll on them, and you."
good,was working for RBS as our client. looking after their facilities management.
good,JLL has a good culture and tends to promote from within. Like any service provider this depends on the account you are working on and the clients expectations.
good,9 hours work
good,"JLL was (overall) a good experience. I worked on the AT&T account. This was a new account and we had massive turn over. In a few years, things will settle down."
good,It is great teamwork to solving new problems on  the site. Get increased knowledge of solving solutions of facing activities of maintenance . It so agresive Team to ever for support me.
good,PM roles require a lot of skillsets in all aspects of property management.  Can be very stressful and requires approx. 50 hours per week to obtain any success.  The Firm will promote for quality work.
good,"JLL is better than the competition but it’s still an archaic work environment much akin to “Mad Men”. As with the industry, the company is focused on revenue producers."
good,"I went into JLL very excited about the opportunity, but my particular supervisor was extremely controlling and micromanaging.  They didn't really give you the freedom to do your job."
good,We use to celebrate all national holidays and cultural events at JLL. Good place to work and start your career. I will recommend others also to apply for jobs in JLL
good,"I have worked for JLL for several years. It is a good company. However, some portfolios do not follow adhere to the workplace culture and HR guidelines that JLL attempts to enforce."
good,"Very typical services oriented corporate real estate firm. Slight advantage with regard to inclusion and internal innovation. "
good,"Working at Jones Lang LaSalle was fun.  Located at Colonie Center, my job allowed me to walk around the mall to visit retailers and talk to them about their businesses.  It also allowed for development of special events to drive traffic to the shopping center."
good,"Almost impossible to produce real meaningful progress in achieving goals.  Leadership is mostly interested in talking about the next big idea and rolling out new programs regardless if they are thought out and beneficial to the team. If it sounds good, it is good.  In reality, it prevents employees from performing exceptional service to their clients."
good,"I had no relationship with my manager or the boss of the office."
good,The Project Manager left suddenly.  Then the new manager that was assigned to fill in was clueless in most all areas of that position.  The employees claimed to have completed their maintenance work but did not turn in their paperwork so the work order and/or PMS inspection could be closed out and cleared from the system.
good,"JLL has a lot of opportunities for growth! Work culture is very inclusive. Pay compensations are great. Always busy except for Friday's, most people work from home on that day. There's always food on one of the 6 floors"
good,"Very corporate environment. Landed on a less than ideal client account, but received great management from the JLL side and several opportunities to stay with the firm if desired."
good,I am free to travel to my different properties and plan my day without being questioned. The most enjoyable part of my day is interacting with tenants. What I have learned is if you listen to people and address their needs it  makes the property run much smoother.
good,Facility Managers were micro-managed and not allowed to make decisions.  Budgets were extremely low but FM was required to keep facilities in top-notch condition.
good,"Worked as temporary executive assistant to three Managing Partners assisting with travel, expenses, Calendar management and other ad hoc projects that arose."
good,Working at jll was very good as i have the chances to learn various things and the colleagues were very much friendly. Communication with senior officers was very relaxing.
good,Short manned in the Amazon account and culture puts people at risks of overworking conditions. managers don't put workers training ahead of work demands
good,"JLL is a very good company, but the site management was so budget driven that they lacked the leadership capabilities to motivate and drive a positive workplace culture and vision.  This created an environment where great employees did not feel they had a future to grow with the company and caused them to look outside of JLL for a future and leave the company."
good,Shift requirements were to check site equipment and take readings.Respond to customer requests for service as per work order requests. Performed required preventive maintenance as per schedule.
good,I had 3 facility managers and a Chief engineer before my current Facility manager took over. Previous were fair and competent supervisors. The one i have now is the reason for the two star rating.
good,I have enjoyed working for JLL for over 11 years.  Management can be challenged with setting realistic goals for the client which can make getting the scope of work delivered to the client a challenge.
good,"A typical day at work consists of assisting a myriad of customers.  Sometimes this can be challenging due to equipment issues and external co-workers who are contracted through a separate entity who have little to NO experience in customer service.  "
good,My Co-Workers are amazing. They are the only reason I'm still here. Wish the management was a little more supportive. You can't move on to new roles here unless you are involved in the politics. Your work will not speak for itself.
good,Some wonderful role models and good opportunities available for growth. Unfortunately this can vary greatly depending on the department and the team manager.
good,The company is good. Some of the HR policies are also beneficial. But some where they need to improve their culture of meeting the other site employees rather than meeting only the site managers.
good,"Wouldn't be a bad place to work if management knew or followed the rules they create."
good,"JLL is a solid RE company - you will consistently stay busy through-out the day, month, year.  It is fast-past and you need to keep up.  Taking time of - you still own the work so there is catch up that needs to be done when you return.  Overall the people you work with are easy to get along with but you have to navigate your own career path and it is not easy to identify which position match to others."
good,Work wise ethical but when it comes to salary I feel it is the most unethical company. With false promise they will make you work like an @## & later ditch you during appraisal.
good,You will have to wait some 5- 10 years and slog till you wish to see some growth in this company. Salary is a big constraint in this organisation . Job is secured
good,"management has a great humanity ,"
good,"hard work, responsible, never give up, learned  to handle pressure jobs.help others, follow the term and condition of company, be punctual."
good,I have worked past 2 to 3 yrs in the same field. I need some more challenges which I am chasing for so management is taking little more time to take decisions.
good,"In dieser Firma wird mehr darauf geachtet, dass man ordentlich ist, als dass die Arbeit erledigt wird. Es ist schwer, das zu beschreiben:"
good,I had a very good working relationship working at Merck. Co-workers very helpful. I enjoyed my responsibilities. I had the opportunity to work with some very talentd engineers and Project Managers
good,"Uma empresa boa para se trabalhar ,  aprendi muito sobre o mundo de trabalho , mesmo ja tendo feito CURSO DE FMT (formação para o mundo de trabalho ) no Espro Ensino Social e Profissionalizante tendo Certificado."
good,"I had worked in JLL for one year,and our senior manager informed that will moved to other site, "
good,Good compensation package and benefits.  The job had a lot of variety. There was the usual conflict in the department surrounding vacations and time off. Was able to work this out to some satisfaction for all parties concerned. The best part of the job was the ability to move around the campus freely and get to know a lot of the 500 employees.
good,Overall a very good company culture and have a lot of very talented people there. Worked in the property management division with the company and it was a very good management team but I am looking to advance my career more into a financial position and I am looking outside of the company to do that.
good,"Buenos profesionales comprometidos con su trabajo."
good,"Local management is great to work with - honest, fair, fun, encouraging, helpful, team players."
good,"El clima laboral no era el adecuado y era muy difícil de trabajar, ya que nuestro cliente Banco Nacional de México S,A, de C,V, es una institución que trabaja sin criterios, con un sistema de informativo deficiente, personal irrespetuoso y déspota."
good,"I was a great employee when it came to my interaction with merchants, vendors and customers.  I was able to provide great customer service to all that came into contact with.  With the change in management came new challenges and more effort on my part to complete my job to the best of my ability."
good,"Busy, "
good,"Good organisation to gain experience."
good,Maintained a professional appearance of the branches and maintained all HVAC equipment as needed to keep all employees and their customers comfortable. Replied to on call in a timely manner.
good,"Limited Resource management by top management"
good,"interface with client, vendor, city, county and state officials on a daily basis."
good,Enjoyed working with very talented employees. Upper management very click-ish and hard to join their club.  Performance reviews too often & unfair. Lacks cohesion amongst groups.
good,We did service calls for the tenants in the building. Did preventive maintenance on the building equipmentto insure that it was working properly. The mamagement and engineering staff worked good as a team. Ordered parts and supplies needed to maintain the building. What I liked about working at the building was not sure what you may have happen when you come in that day
good,"Overall corporate benefits are very atractive, including encouragement to work from home for all corporate staff. This is very important for mother of young kids like me. However, the people who are put in management level are not qualified for people manager. In my group, the manager has been creating a very dividing culture within the team by picking the favorites, getting extremely defensive on honest feedback from employees and more managing up and no managing down."
good,"Not a good organisation to work for. Attrition rate very high. One man show, if managers are happy u get promotion otherwise not. No value for hardwork"
good,"No progression within company unless based in London. Too London Centric. A regional position with a Travel ban. Top Heavy department. No Accountability, tracking & communications of core processes."
good,JLL has a great reputation.  I was new to the market and returning to the industry after being in another field for a while.  I wanted to reenter the industry with a firm with a great reputation.
good,"Jones Lang LaSalle Management Services Did not provide any professional training to employees, only a simple new employee induction briefing. But there did not have many workload."
good,some accounts are great to work for and others you'll want to quit. Appears management can't be touched & will let you go for no apparent reason. No room for advancement.
good,Lots to learn about real estate with a supportive environment. Flexible work schedule after a couple of years. Worked on site with client. Learned to use excel to support old systems and templates. Lots of redundant data entry work. Not much decision making based on facts. Too many systems which  do not share data.
good,"The volume of work duties you are accountable for doing on a daily/weekly basis is nowhere realistic and there is ZERO opportunity to work ANY OT to get your job done. So your stuck in a bad situation- you can not get your work done in 40hrs, JLL has reason to let you go. If you do work over your 40hrs, and your team lead DOES know, but turns hi/her head you still are only allowed to log in 40hrs per wk on your timesheet. Some people with the same position are paid the same, but they ARE allowed OT. The purpose of the OT is to get the work done for the Clientsothat they shine and JLL proves we can succeed. If it were not for the Client, we would be out of a job. This is a No Win situation for some JLL employees. There are MANY employees in my office that 100% agree with me. And the final straw for me, was expecting my paycheck on a regular pay period and I was not paid. This was admitted y Payroll, that it was their error but I still had to wait another 3 weeks to be paid. A company who does not pay their employees, is that the company I am proud and happy to be working myself to death for?"
good,"Work is Ok, management seems to be overloaded or not trained. Project work is a joke passing work off the other contractors which inflated labor cost."
good,"The job is tough because there's so much to do, I almost never bother to stop for lunch and continue to work and do overtime daily, finishing late missing night busses resulting in a 3 to 4 hour trip home that normally takes 45inutes."
good,"I enjoy working here, good team, but nowhere to learn more on my position, too many managers not enough help, they always give us safety training, safety first company"
good,"This company was very professional and had lots of room for advancement.  However, the work day was usually long and stressful. Overtime was expected but not paid as all employees were salaried."
good,"A good place to work.  Not much opportunity for advancement."
good,"Working within brokerage at JLL was competitive.  The greatest emphasis was on establishing new leads for the senior brokers.  They required lots of ""cold calling"" which was not always desirable."
good,I was only there for a short time.  Couldn't afford gas when gas costs skyrocketed.  The only thing I really remember was getting a verbal warning after using a fire extinguisher to put out a small fire.  Should have let the place burn.
good,"clock in and cover receptionist area till she arrives by 8:30 "
good,"Everyday is challenging, lots of deadlines and daily tasks. You have to take on many projects at once. Day goes by quick because you are always busy doing different tasks."
good,"Upper management out of touch with frontline employees. To our clients we are the face, voice,eyes and ears of JLL. I can easily communicate with all levels of clientele. Communication is only one way within JLL."
good,"We enjoy work with personal life balance."
good,Great company t work for if you are located in a market where theres opportunity for growth. I've learned how to operate in many different job roles and have acquired skills that will stay with me for a lifetime.
good,"Innovative, would recommend to others and have, value all that has been learned.   Work on a big account and appreciate the ability to work across platforms."
good,Great place to work if you are in a multi income family or retired looking for more income. Also may be great for student doing classes at night. For maintaining a Home and a family of for not so great.
good,"easy doing day."
good,The actual work was enjoyable and interesting - the usual maintenance duties in an office building setting. The Chief Engineer thought he was a hard a** and walked around with an attitude. Very irritating to work with a person like that.
good,Very large company - too easy to get lost in the crowd.  Most employees are assigned to a client account - you have to balance the client needs and requirements with the Company demands.
good,"I enjoyed the company in my earlier years of employment, however, as the company grew, silos of accountability were created within the facility operations teams (PDS, Analytics, Management, Strategic Sourcing, Operations, Financial, etc.) that has become a detriment to efficiency.  This resulted in team dissention, inflated cost, client dissatisfaction and churn of essential personnel."
good,"Being an old employee , the privileges are extremely poor . No Growth No Money. Opportunities are available at Corporate office but it is only through reference"
good,"No overtime."
good,This is not the most creative environment and people are all out for themselves. People will step on each other to get ahead and are all about their position and standing with more senior positions of which they aspire to be. Unauthentic people.
good,"Come to work every day and do your job ,go home safely to your family. Working safely is an important part of working here .they stress safety on a daily bases.the benefits are good,probably take about 10 years of 2nd and 3rd shift before you ever make it to day shift."
good,"JLL is a good company to work for. However it seems that they are still trying to figure out the database which is used for transferring, promoting and other such things."
good,"Overall a good place for people that enjoy project work however working on an account, you may get in a situation where the number of staff the client can pay for will not align with the workload."
good,Os gestores são péssimos. O rh é pessimo. O gestor nem o RH ajuda o funcionário
good,AM rounds (walk the building for hazards ) check work order system to set up my schedule for the day. complete all work request .afternoon rounds
good,Overall not a bad company to work for.  Watch out for managers that work off site for a client -- if they're bad and no one else says anything... it makes the work day miserable.  They can get away with almost anything.
good,If you're just starting out in facility management then JLL is the place to start out as they offer the best training program.  No matter what client account you're on all files and procedures remain the same making it easier to assimilate into the next client account. Staff are moved from account to account often and interviews are handled like an open call for audition.
good,Fast paced cutting technology for order fulfillment at Amazon.  Subcontractor in building to support Amazon equipment and treated like red headed step child by Amazon management. JLL management was not willing to push back.
good,"Lack of job security, not much direction from senior leadership. Good open environment for day today operations. Not much chance for advancement."
good,"Really good to work with JLL but between the top management peoples?"
good,"I worked with the company for 7 years, during my mid year, they decided to open a ""branch"" that caters shared services across accounts on a regional level. "
good,"Receptionist/ Clerk was my position. "
good,"Journée très occupée. Travail varié. Service à la clientèle exigeant. Apprentissage d'un système de cartes d'accès. Utilisation de plusieurs logiciels. Formation régulière par ordinateur. "
good,A typical day was stressful. It was like walking on egg shells. You were always being looked at as if you were under a magnifying glass.
good,Company contracts frequently change. HR seems hard to communicate with if you have an issue. Employees told to make HR requests through manager. Company does have good work/life balance.
good,"Great diverse place to work. They provide commercial real estate strategy, services and support to organizations around the globe."
good,"I personally learnt a lot during my entire tenure in JLL, as a person I have earned to be mature, patient , improved my skills as people manager. Being the relationship manager between client and as a jll employee that is the most challenging part as we had to play dual role on client's site."
good,"I enjoyed working with this company for 5 years, but i relocated my family to Richmond, VA and there were no opportunities with me to stay with the company."
good,"I was with JLL for almost 10 years and the company was good with life/work balance for the most part. However, my departure from my current position was far less than acceptable. I was a veteran employee and I was treated more like an outsider upon termination. For one of the ""best places to work for"", it was a real disappointment."
good,"JLL is not a bad place if you're looking to get in the CREIB industry. As a lease analyst, there is a lot of paperwork involved and can be repetitive, but is a good jumping off point. Recommended that you attempt getting in to brokerage, as that's where the highest level of satisfaction seems to come from."
good,"Typical work day consisted of doing preventative maintenance on broken things around the intel site and completing work orders submitted by intel employees. Learned alot about making repairs on doors, carpet lighting, plumbing and electrical. The management was average but in some aspects lacked leadership skills to alocate work  properly. The Co-workers are a good team of people that are very helpful and knowledgable. The hardest part of the job would be trying to complete certain jobs by a deadline with the amount of work flow and shortage of personel. The most enjoyable part of the job is always learning new things on how to do the job better and expanding your knowledge of new things you dont know."
good,"Poor management, sub-contractors/ vendors weren't getting paid."
good,"I have been a facilities coordinator with JLL on the ExxonMobil Baton Rouge account for a little over a year. JLL is contracted with ExxonMobil to oversee the daily maintenance at the refinery, including HVAC, plumbing, electrical and landscaping.  A typical day at work is different from day to day due to the constant changes in maintenance demands. One thing that is always constant is the paperwork that needs to be completed. Daily, work tickets have to be printed and assigned to employees responsible for that particular field, material has to be ordered for jobs to be completed, tracking cost in order to monitor budget cost is a must. The list of demands for a facilities coordinator is never ending."
good,JLL does have wonderful benefits and pays their employees well but the work environment does not suit all personalities.
good,"Boiler Operators/Stationary Engineers with experience in the operation of multiple plant utility systems, such as Steam, Ammonia Refrigeration and Dehumidification, CO2 Collection, Compressed Air and Water"
good,From Facilities department I achieved some Engineering skills taking TPC tests.
good,Always on the go. Challenged to satisfy clients at all times.
good,"Too much busy work and managment cannot make a decision on anything.  The people are great, but the pay is low."
good,Changes needed to meet client's needs and more flexibility..
good,"I have learned about managing the vendors, as i am handling more than 18 vendors per day."
good,A good Co. to work with. Co-workers are also very good.
good,"Good benefits but low pay, work environment is good but alot of politics. Alot of management and not enough workers. They do provide tools. They do track your every move ."
good,"Worked as a temp. The office was nice, and everyone kept busy, but you don't get any real proper training. Long hours for actual employees. Would be fine for someone who has been in the field for a long time, but not so much a newer employee."
good,"It's a good company to work for, if you don't care about advancing your career. Despite all the hype about service, etc the company only cares about selling, not performance."
good,I have been unemployed for almost two years. I lost my mother and my bother all at the same time then got laid off work. It was such a great year. This job is right up my alley!!
good,Leader in the real estate industry and offering exquisite property management services.  Trusted by notable companies to provide facilities management services as well.
good,international company with great culture. professionalism expected on work. They train before giving actual work. the company works through regional managers down to the team leaders.
good,JLL is focused on their bottom line and will take on clients to meet that. The accounts you are on will greatly determine what your work life balance and experience are
good,JLL is a commercial real estate company headquartered in Chicago Illinois. It has global operations supporting clients with all real estate needs and decisions
good,I had a very good time working with JLL . The management and the employees are very cooperative and sociable. I wish to stay longer but the assignment was terminated .
good,Get your experience and leave like everyone else. They are moving majority of the Westmont office duties to India so they are laying off current employees.
good,Difficult environment created by client and client not confronted by JLL Senior management- Senior JLL Management was aware and had opportunities to address and chose not to address.
good,"JLL was a fairly good company to work for as long as the client followed the contract. Some of the things that the client would request would be for something the next day. This would like setting up for open house hiring and trying to schedule housekeeping and security to monitor potential employees for the client. "
good,"Limited advancement, laid back atmosphere, great management. 40-50 hours per week. Welcomed creativity. Limited time to canvass. Property needed more upper management attention."
good,"Company OK to work for"
good,JLL is a big company and has decent benefits. You have the option to travel a lot which opens doors for growth. The communication could be better as well as training.
good,"When outsourced to company, company didn't provide any training to do our jobs properly"
good,"Good career opportunity firm. Opportunity for advancements. No micro management , flexible hours, ability to work remote, travel and great leadership."
good,"If you work hard and can network effectively you will excel at JLL.  This is a forward thinking company, that values those employees that display the company's core values.  Those that are team players and appreciate a collaborative and fast paced work environment will go far within the company."
good,"Work hours were extremely structured"
good,"Depending on where/which customer you are supporting, the job satisfaction can vary from ""great place to work"" to ""worse place to work""... i.e...outright suck.  The customer and customer location plays a big role in job satisfaction, however the management team at that particular location plays an even bigger role.  If the local management team is good and provides an environment which rewards ""ownership"" and encourages strong work ethics, then even mediocre techs can grow into great techs and great techs into SME (subject matter expert) or into leadership or management roles.  If however, the local management team is poor or ""lacking"" or in some cases, possesses NO leadership skills or experience; then the exact opposite happens.  Some sites have hired according to ""who you know"", not ""what you know"".  At those sites, turnover, moral and performance of the entire site suffers.  Finger pointing starts and everything spirals out of control... Regional management is stretched too thin to be of any help.  As long as the #'s appear to look good, there are no issues."
good,Gained valuable experience that helped me in my future endeavors. I would consider working for JLL again under a different account. Most management companies seem the same.
good,"Being a contractor for General Motors, with only 8 JLL employees on site, the ""management"" left much to be desired. Not saying this is typical of all JLL management, but the facility manager we had was not much help and hardly ever showed up at work. If she did, she left early."
good,"I worked here for just over 1 year.  I learned many new skills and utilized many new programs, which were beneficial to completing my tasks.  A good group of people."
good,"Good company overall, but whether or not it ultimately meets your expectations is dictated solely by direct manager, so make sure personalities mesh well."
good,"JLL gave a yearly bonus and salary increase.  Gift cards were often given."
good,"JLL is a great company but, since I work for a third-party client that hired JLL to manage their sites, JLL really has very little to do with us on a day to day basis."
good,Training is a mission that does not occur with much forethought.  Cost savings come before training.  Fairly high turnover rate.  Unrealistic work expectations.
good,Boa localização. Pessoas atenciosas e o contato com os lideres é fácil. Possui pessoas dispostas a lhe auxiliar no que precisar.
good,"I felt the upper management treated those in office administrative positions with disdain, and as though we were less than capable or less intelligent."
good,The Amazon account is growing so fast that they aren't able to keep sites staffed sufficiently. They rush to get sites launched and don't allow the people who maintain the sites to get up to speed as far as training and experience with the equipment that is used.
good,"I consider JLL to be a good company overall with potentials to be the best in the market. However, it needs to grow in the area of fair pay that matches employee knowledge and diversity."
good,Company worked hard to educate it's people. Made many training opportunities available. Very detail documentation oriented. Spent a lot of time doing paperwork
good,"Fast paced and aggressive Firm focus on Budget more than Relationships with Clients "
good,It was a small group of people doing several things for a larger company.  The group of people I worked with were very pleasant to work with and enjoyed my time with them.
good,"Uma empresa remonada, forte em seu ramo de atividade, presta serviços praticamente em todos os paises do mundo, é bem conceituada."
good,Great place to gain exposure to the world of commercial real estate. Very friendly workplace environment with more casual vibe. Solid work/life balance and benefits.
good,Definitely a good organisation with capability to accommodate wide range of managerial and consultancy services. to feel further goodness one should go out and try to fit in if required to have more visibility of the company. coming to workplace culture we have ethics in place where women of this firm acknowledged as excellent.
good,"Perform ongoing preventive maintenance and repair work on facility mechanical, electrical, and other installed systems. Maintain, operate all HVAC systems and associated equipment, electrical equipment, plumbing systems, building management system, and building repairs."
good,Great Benefits. All depends on which location you work at. Some locations have great people to work with and a wonderful atmosphere. While others are hostile.
good,"JLL's culture is based on client approval ratings. Though there are many company based policies and procedures, many clients also have preferences that need to be met in addition to company procedures.  Day-to-day work can be fast-paced and require new, different tasks based on property operations, audits, and ownership changes."
good,Company was an interesting place to work.  lots of variety if you make connections and try different parts of the business.  If the market takes a fall you will be forced to relocate.
good,"JLL was very good organization that i have seen in facility management industry"
good,"A typical work day for myself is waking up and checking my email, phone or laptop for any emergency's that might have occuried over night or any jobs that need to be taken care of first. then I get in the work truck around 7. drive up to 2 hours out daily sometimes. Complete the task and return back home or to another job site if its before 4pm."
good,"Large company with poor management practices.  Silos everywhere, and if you don't work in Chicago, then no upward mobility.  Pay is subpar for work performed and level of experience used.  Work the teams too hard and run very lean and mean."
good,Easy work but constantly be called for down equipment.  Its a good job if you like easy work but have to be able to prioritize what your going to get to first.  Also must be able to deal with people always watching you asking when it will be running again.
good,The work environment was excellent.  You met co-workers from all over the country that you would ordinarily speak to over the phone on a daily basis.  Great place to work.
good,I enjoyed my time at JLL. They could use some help in the HR/Recruiting department. Good people...good processes. Sometimes it was more about who you knew than what you knew.
good,"Since it is my OJT, I've been exposed first to their projects."
good,Its overall a good company to work in. My peraonal experience was good in the company. It is just like other companies with all the facilities provided.
good,"Our company makes each and every employee feel valued and they show genuine and authentic appreciation for the work we do and the effort we put in. Managers at this company are really effective at leading their teams. They show that they care about employees by sitting down with us one-on-one to discuss our futures, the projects we're working on, and any challenges that stand in our way. We don't realize how much you need a caring and effective manager until you're on a team that actually has one!"" They educate their employees and leaders on how to effectively give and receive feedback. My company's culture ROCKS! Coworkers work well together, trust each other to do a good job, and enjoy spending time together outside of work. We're not just team members — we're friends."""
good,Participação ativa da implantação de ERP Mastersaf e Oracle (E1)
good,I wasn't employed there long enough to make fair review. But  the Benefits were Good! The compensation is was also good. The work/life balance was Great.
good,"maintenance and repairs on all the ATT job sights.  Had some "
good,"Depending on where you are placed, this is a little biased. Certain plants assigned to management in facilities are appreciative, and eager to help you succeed. Other areas that are production based and unappreciated, over worked and not enough help or training. You are faced with failure from the start and are used as a scape goat for the customer."
good,The workload is easy to handle but there is favoritism and partiality.  I like the work I do but this department is biased.  Working in town is good but need to rely on public transportation.
good,"- Know the structure and function of the duty"
good,"Unless you have degrees better than Associates then you will always be at the bottom. They only move who they want to different and better positions. No matter how hard you show improvement you will never get ahead. "
good,"I enjoy meeting new people at the different locations through out my work day.All around a good company. Nothing really bad to say ,.its only bad if you make it bad."
good,"I enjoy working at this company I just wanted more pay, other than that you would like this company. They treat the employees fair and they truly care."
good,It has been quite a while that I was given a better opportunity with JLL and I am now hoping to find a new employer that would introduce me to a new career in project management
good,"Atmosphere is very corporate, a major contrast to Nike, the company that they took over the space and move group from.  I found it difficult to adjust to."
good,"A competitive but socially interactive environment. Work hard, put in the time and effort to constantly be learning new things because if you're busy chatting, somebody else is busy working. Do that and you'll do well here."
good,"Very challenging"
good,"JLL is a great place to work for a young, perhaps unattached professional who wants a great work experience for resume building.  There is a lot of opportunity for growth and advancement.  Work/Life balance is lacking, although the company is implementing measures that may help with that.  Hours during quarter and year end closes feel like busy season in public accounting; however, lots of work from home flexibility for top performers."
good,"The IFM team working at Whirlpool is too lean.  The communication is very limited on a need to know basis only.  The chances for advancement are limited.  Jones Lang LaSalle has let their Human Resource department take over their company.  Even if they don't know the over 4,000 employees that are employed they make decisions on their own rules."
good,1.review my first stop 2. what I learned depended on client need 3. weak due to direction 4. micromanagement 5.management discontentment 6. making sure all work request are completed daily.
good,I am only worked for 60  days and left due to get a new job dyty as I same as before.My working place is individual building and under development. There is only one chair and small place for 2 staffs for working for the same time.
good,"I learned that we need to be organize at all times and you have to accept or acknowledge the ideas of other, in short ""teamwork""."
good,"jll was not that great at the site we were stationed at, the site was very difficult to work for and there fore made it hard to work for jll. management was very horrible the turnover was very high in the 5 years jll has had over 10 facilities managers."
good,"very intense, long term care hospital! Great staff, many nurses from Bayfront Hospital nearby. They treat you like a team member."
good,JLL is a great company with great people working for it.  Property Management is a different beast and is difficult to maintain a work life balance.  I would prefer to work in corporate because it seems they have more of a work life balance.
good,Morning meeting at 7:15 must be here at & am but don't get paid until 7:15 stand up meeting and its off to babysitting the associates 10 miles of walking and its 1/2 mile to get to the shop to get a part feels like I am waiting my time and knowledge here. Dead tired after work too much stress too many different mechanics working and adjusting machinery only to come in to adjusting it back the way you had it the day before.
good,"cost savings and lean staffing can result in less-than-competitive salary and financial compensation"
good,"One of the most leading company world wide, well structured and process oriented for completely client eccentricity. The superiors are very friendly and supportive"
good,"Property Accountant for 2 malls out of state. Difficult to manage without being on site.  Management spread out all over US. Always busy, didn't work with co-workers. Didn't like working for a huge company."
good,"The company is very ""corporate"", meaning - that they are structured to a fault.  They have an internal audit that can choke a bull.  The benefits are near the top of the chart, with a lot of PTO and freedom.  There is little room for advancement, unless you are willing to relocate.

good,jll is new to facilities jobs. i enjoyed oppertunites they offer. I just need to keep my eyes open for greater. JLL IS a great place to work for
good,"This company operates in a virtual reality world, or at least the part of the company I worked for, where everyone works remotely. My manager was in Florida, while I was in Arizona. We never met face to face we only spoke on the phone or communicated via email. She had no knowledge or experience in how to do my job and claimed to have hired me for my expertise; yet refused to listen when I would advise her on how things should be done and was quick to criticize and sit in judgment when something she told me to do failed.  It is a very cold impersonal company. I was like an island out in the middle of the ocean. There is no over site or supervision. I was not in a management role yet I was expected to assume such responsibilities without compensation or recognition."
good,"JLL is a fair and reasonable employer, however like all large employers it has its silos and advancement must be done very proactively."
good,"Cadre agréable (avec un petit bémol pour l'Open Space)"
good,The company has provided me with a great opportunity to learn about SAP and improve my personal and professional skills.
good,I have scholarly so many new things via colleagues and client. The fun place to work. I was always chock-full with the work freight which was the happiest ingredient. It was exigent and stirring job.
good,Putting a smile on the customers faces. I enjoy making sure that the customers needs are met on a daily basis. Whether its ensuring they are comfortable with the temperature in their offices to bringing them a key for their desks.
good,JLL account teams are client focused and work to assure that client needs are being met.  Management from all levels support the account and are visible to the client and account team.
good,M co workers are very supportive and i have learnt so many good things about corporate but after all move on is required to step ahead in your carrier.
good,Property management and facility management - networking opportunities are abundant...learning and training is quality
good,I would do a walk around the building and be observant on anything out of place or look for a problem that might occur. I did preventative maintenance  on a monthly bases to ensure all equipment stayed in great working condition.
good,JLL provides its employees with solid training and collaborative opportunities.Its global platform and range of services allow individuals to learn much about the business of real estate.
good,"Creating scopes of work"
good,"Great company with tons of potential for growth if you are well liked by the Managing Directors.  If you rub a Managing Director the wrong way you will be hunted down for execution (termination of your employment).  Be careful with this firm, they will smile in your face and talk about you like a dog behind your back."
good,Lot of challenges in job makes learning more fun. Exposure of travelling to different geographies within India came as the biggest advantage for professional and personal development.
good,"salary increment is not good,but good and nice place to work,gives freedom for workers.good management."
good,Good place to intern and learn about commercial real estate.
good,Binnen JLL heerst een prettige informele werksfeer en je kunt binnen de eigen organisatie goed doorgroeien.

good,Industry Standard worked off a computer based management system. Maintained a long term care facility.
good,"When I got my last appraisal letter"
good,"enjoyed working for the company as I learned a lot as well as hands on repairs to help employees further their carers.  The one issue I had, they don't seems to promote from within as the employees have knowledge of the company.  Also if you get promoted, the only two months your raise will kick in is April or October.  You will not get your raise any other months, which is a huge down fall in encouraging to get promoted."
good,"Nice to work in JLL and with co workers who were supportive."
good,"Co Workers are good,Administration is poor, Not Satisfied with Response of company"
good,"too political. too much ""good old boys club"" mentality. Typical day-Show up, check status board and email for events/ issues/ passdown info, etc. Address as needed; perform/prioritize work orders/ preventative maintenance jobs; end of day- perform/ document equipment check (rounds), note/ escalate issues as needed. Go home."
good,Company doesn't put any emphasis on training. Be prepared to train yourself with little help on antiquated systems. I would not recommend this job to seasoned professionals. The great thing about working here is you are not micro-managed day to day and you meet lots of great people in this account.
good,"•	Generate detailed real estate documents requiring high levels of accuracy including, market surveys, tours, proposals, etc."
good,At JLL their is a good corporate culture. Everyday tends to be something different. My coworkers are all over the map. The hardest part of the job is pleasing the client. I enjoy having multiple responsibilities which keeps the day interesting.
good,Lease administration is a good avenue to learn the real estate business.
good,"The construction division in S.F. is new to the West Coast, established 1 year ago. It is a West coast branch of other construction divisions that have been in operation and controlled for many years by corporate headquaters on the East Coast."
good,"JLL only retains the best of the best, bonuses are based on subjective behavior and only the top ties receive a bonus. Being young and agressive is the key to success."
good,This is a publicly traded company that focuses on providing asset management services for Fortune 500 companies.
good,This is a private equity company that focused on the development of industrial and commercial property.
good,"insufficiently planned training to build skills, as i hadnt used excel in over 5 years so building up speed on excel but they terminated my contract"
good,"JLL took over maintenance at Pfizer where I was employed for 34 years. They matched our compensation and offered comparable benefits.They do a good job managing sub contractors, but still need to work out a few things for their own hourly employees, especially in relation to maintenance...not their strongest suit."
good,"My job description is a bit vague, however the daily challenges are plenty to keep me busy and focused. Management lines are not always clear and the overall mission view is somewhat blurry. The hardest part of the job is taking responsibility for inconsistencies in customer service when you know the problems should not exist."
good,this is a great place to work. the staff within JLL is very helpful and knowledgable and upper management is very attentive.
good,"Adquiri experiência o tempo que estive na empresa desde a preparação documentações necessárias para aprovação interna de budget,participação da seleção dos executores,com análise de proposta e acompanhamento técnico.A equipe que trabalhei são profissionais bem qualificados e com uma bagagem grande em obras e projetos.As decisões a serem tomadas com os clientes considero a parte mais trabalhosa onde temos que atender as escolha do cliente,mas não podemos fugir das especificações e normas de um projeto.A conclusão de um projeto bem trabalhado é bem satisfatório para a equipe."
good,"I love the work enviorment of the account. Diverse culture, great people, and business casual!!"
good,my deparment was outsourced from other employment. never really got to come across anyone.
good,"Work differs based on client and location. Good people."
good,i have learnt few things like how to manage the environment of the workplace .There i was working on Accenture's site and i have learnt how to manage things at Accenture's  workplace.
good,I enjoy working here. There's a lot of ambiguity. Project work is great. Not enough job security with transitioning off accounts and having to seek new annuity accounts to roll on to.
good,Plenty of opportunity to grow if you stay long enough. Day to day duties are manageable but large projects are hectic and directives regularly change. Health insurance is passable but are by far the most expensive deductibles I’ve ever had. Management could do better in understanding ‘ground worker’s’ struggles and providing mentorship. Both accounts I worked on had staffing issues for an extended period of time.
good,"Positive work environment."
good,"JLL is good company, depending on where you're working or what account you are working on.  The reason for that is the leadership is different for each account the customer you work for his different.  The current account I""m on, has the reputation of being, ""If you can work on the """" account, you can work on any account!""  I'd say I believe it.  Leadership on this account shows no backbone or employee support.  We feel as if we're set up to fail and that's what the customer wants.  Not a very friendly environment.  Again, you could have a great account and it be completely opposite.  So, just be careful."
good,"Even though most of us work from home, we were close knit. There are plenty of meetings and gatherings to keep employees in communication with each other."
good,"My job changed from being part of a team to just another number sad really "
good,"This is the year that I got hired from Pro-fab to join JLL to perform Preventive maintenance, and repair, and learning a lot from my supervisor, like AHU, pumps, changing out ballast on lights fixtures."
good,"I really dont have nothing to say, management looks out for themselves are not genuinely concern about the employees. the moment we express ourselves you get black balled"
good,"JLL offers ethical and professional work arrangements, combined with a lot of flexibility and work life balance. It is a good place to learn in your career, and the teamwork of the people is a valuable part of the firm. The company is going through a lot of technological projects, acquisitions, and changes that are in turn changing the workplace culture. In my time with JLL, I have learned a lot about the business, the service offerings, management and execution visions."
good,This is a good company to work for but demands from client can be a problem at times. The commincations between employee and supervisor could have been better even though this position was embedded at the Client Location not JLL Office.
good,"While the commute was very long, it was well worth the trip. JLL was added experience for me. Working with this company gave me some knowledge of invoicing for a property management organization. I enjoyed the learning experience."
good,The company overall is very good. They do not provide much formal training relevant to job or systems used. Working remotely for this company is challenging.
good,"Im not sure about JLL as a whole, but the account I worked out was poorly managed, paid next to nothing and had no real direction. "
good,"Working with JLL makes you feel valued. The company is very supportive and management will bring out the best in you."
good,Extensive permitting in NY.  Culture was difficult due to one large team working difference types jobs. Conversion in between two work systems. Learning new aspects.
good,"Very competitive workplace with not much senior direction.  Work life balance very poor.  Good opportunity to make money, but there is a high turnover rate."
good,"JLL is a pretty typical place to work. There are a lot of challenges with management labeling individuals based on prior experience. This can make it difficult to be taken seriously but overall, if you work hard and your clients are happy they will let you do you job. I was led to believe as long as you were in the office a good bit that it was a flexible workplace but that doesn't seem to be necessarily true"
good,"JLL is one of the best platforms to learn Real Estate Transactions like other International Property Consulting firms. The company has a lot of reach among the corporate clients and has a great name."
good,"its a nice place to work and we would have lot of support from seniors. we need to inline with clients, there are lot of things to learn on new intiatives"
good,JLL deals with Real Estate and is trying to get into Technology Services Domain. They need to realize the differences between work cultures of a brokerage firm and a technology firm.
good,"You use all your tools for this position including Plumbing, Gas, Carpentry, Electrical, Painting, Wall Repair, Carpets, Doors, plus lots of driving and working at heights."
good,"My day is varied and busy and never boring.  I have a great team and wonderful work colleagues,  the hardest part of the job is ensuring my deadlines are met.  The most enjoyable part of the job is knowing my contribution is appreciated and that I am doing the best I can."
good,"Truly learned a lot in this position, and was able to acquire new skills that can help me in a future position. Challenges including documentation and financial reporting while perks included benefits package and some management."
good,"I was (at my contracted location)  allowed to expand and gain knowledge. No severance when contract ends. Good pay and benefits, bonuses no longer available to anyone below management."
good,"Exciting place to work , Team members and colleagues very co-operative , fun loving environment, lunch hours fixed , can relax listen to music and work ."
good,"My daily responsibilities included scheduling and approving meetings.  Maintain the client reception area.  I was the help desk and answered questions throughout the day to assist colleague or client requests.  I was the liaison for IT and the client/colleague.  Part of the facilities team and scheduled work orders and completed various reports.  The last few months, I was the reception and the Meeting Coordinator. JLL was under-going structural changes that was not favorable."
good,"Was fired via a phone call by the regional manager, of the company"
good,"es una trabajo donde los colegas, supervisores y clientes nos tratamos de una manera muy respetuosa la convivencia es muy agradable, el tiempo que tengo aqui me eh involucrado en el ramo industrial."
good,"Worse than CBRE, but better than Cushman & Wakefield with respect to culture.  Brokerage is rough and tumble and you need to be prepared for how dysfunctional it can be."
good,"Fantastic overall company culture, leader in commercial real estate. Great place to learn the ropes and be given a chance...especially for new graduates. Financially successful, stable company. Laid back work atmosphere. Flex-days, work from home options are big pluses to work-live balance. However JLL is a large company and initiatives and good intentions from corporate don't always trickle down to the numerous offices and remote employees on client sites. There are too many incompetent managers and supervisors that are promoted and kept on in spite of their inadequacies. However that can be expected with a large company. But the truly non-competitive salary cannot. A quick survey of competitors in the commercial real estate industry shows that the company ultimately undervalues employees."
good,Overall good working environment and fun loving place.A Place of Lot more Learning and the most enjoyoble part of the job is excellent culture.Hardest time of the job is month end reports but overall it enhanced learning and speed.
good,"typical day included"
good,"Just as any job, it has the ups and downs."
good,"This only exist at the senior level, if you fight hard enough for it."
good,"Good place to grow."
good,"this place is good to work and learn."
good,"Everyday is a new experience,"
good,Priority part of the job is understanding the site/property where you company has posted you to take care of the facilities.Overall client satisfaction.
good,"a typical day at work -Make understand all the work to our junior."
good,"Management somewhat provides ability to move around laterally, but difficult to advance. Strategy is not always clear. Old school culture."
good,"A typical day could range from slow paced to high pressure, but there is always support to help you with the work load. A certain level of collaboration and team work is often required to succeed."
good,"Good management."
good,"Depend of the account i guess the job will variate, in the amazon account we have good benefits but the rate for the work you have to do is low. i love the 3 days off"
good,Nothing really out of the ordinary but the pay is a little low and the raises are never more than 2ish percent. Decent bonus structure for management. Good but small teams so don't expect to work less than 50ish hours a week and don't expect weekends off.
good,I overall enjoyed working for JLL as a Facilities Manager.  The Company is good to their employees. I retired from the State of Tennessee as a Facility Administrator 3 & went to work for the Company when the State agreed to a contract of outsource maintenance.  I was responsible for 181 Lease Facilties & 14 State Owned Building including all contracts & maintenance personnel.
good,"I worked there for a long time. Started off great but over time I experienced the shift in management, restructuring which changed the culture of the work place.i believe the core of the company is still strong overall."
good,There is a lot of change going on; if you want to be part of change - you have an awesome opportunity in front of you.  Many employees want to be successful. Some of the management is wonderful - some could use change in their roles after being in these roles for 10+ year as the mindset changes. JLL has the potential to be great in a niche market. It will be interesting to see if  the necessary forward steps are taken to get the company and team there.
good,"The option to work from home 2-3 days per week makes the job very flexible in addition to flexibility in hours, etc. However, they pay significantly below market which is strange for a company of it's size."
good,"Worked for JLL for many years, great company. Great Benefits  however compensation packages are a bit low but that depends on what account you are working on."
good,"One of the fastest growing IPC and one of the oldest one. Focuses on numbers (target) and not on people. Work life balance, Bonus on time and holiday on official holidays is big question!!!"
good,Good place to work JLL on client site.... working with procurement & engineering team for obtaining approval... vendor management for sub contracts employees & equipment vendors
good,I am working with this company from past 5 years. it is providing flexi time to work. and recognise the people who worked very well. they are following the well cultured procedure for promotion and increment.
good,empresa muito boa pra se trabalhar e com ótimas oportunidade de carreiras na matriz
good,"Empresa Multinacional, entretanto com pouca oportunidade de crescimento para quem está alocado em contratos."
good,My department was understaffed.  We had a backlog but were able to  get current on billing at the time of my departure.We had a lot of changes to upper management which made working conditions difficult.
good,"JLL is a good company overall and highly competitive against other companies in it's industry.  It offers competitive benefits and has flexible working schedules for the working families they employ. JLL has done good by me overall and I have enjoyed working there.  If you are in a good department that truly supports you, there is a lot of room for advancement, however there are some departments that are not as supportive. I am of the opinion that indicates a lack of strong leadership in some of the management positions. Not all management positions but there is definitely a need for improvement."
good,"Nice place to work with great colleagues.."
good,I enjoy working for Jones Lang LaSalle. On a typical day I am answering phone calls and attending to visitor's at the same time. The hardest part of my job is to come in for just  a half day (4.5). The most enjoyable part of my job is knowing I make my client happy by giving exceptional sevice.
good,"a typrical day at work involved crunchung numbers, [posting payments, reconciliation of amounts. Evaluating market rates, reviews. Calls with brokers and renters alike."
good,"The people at JLL were always easy to talk with and the hours were reasonable. The hardest part of the job was speaking to people who called in, as they were not always friendly. The management was wonderful and always willing to assist in any way."
good,"Chasing debts and overdue payments by letter, telephone and email. I learned that debt recovery is a hard, difficult and taxing job and has little if any rewards apart from beng salaried. Management seemed to be overloaded and floundering. Co-Workers took very little responsibility for their actions and were unhelpful to me as a new and inexperienced Credit Controller. Hardest part of the job was working with no or very little background knowledge and little help from previous Credit Controllers. Most enjoyable part was going home."
good,"I very much enjoyed working for JLL. Being that JLL is such a large company, it's a bit less personal as far as career guidance and mentoring are concerned. Especially the NYC office was always hectic, but I enjoyed being exposed to and able to develop personal relationships with all of the top executives across all different business lines. The job security and benefits were most definitely a plus. A typical day at work was always interesting during my time as a project manager because we were overseeing so many different projects simultaneously, so really we had to devote our time to whatever was the most important task at hand; a lot of 'putting out fires', but it was fun. While working for the President of the NY region, my days were more predictable including working on presentations, setting up meetings, travel and whatever operations tasks were needed. The most enjoyable aspect of the job for me was learning new methods of management, the creation marketing materials, and the contacts/friends made. The hardest part of the job for me was not the actual work, but I would prefer to work in a slightly less corporate environment, if it were up to me. But overall, JLL is a wonderful company and I am very grateful for my time and experience spent as a JLL Employee."
good,"When i walk into JLL I make sure coffee, conference rooms and copier room are all organized, cleaned, stocked and ready to use. "
good,Company was good at work life balance but suffered with favoritism. Also failed to match designation and profile with actual work to be performed by employee.
good,Belle boite offrant un équilibre entre vie privée et vie professionnelle.
good,"Good workplace, good people to work with. Needs work on micro management. Overall not a bad place to work for."
good,"Great place to work, relaxed and positive atmosphere. Awesome to be able to work from home. But the healthcare plans make it hard to want to continue as a an employee."
good,"Enjoyed being with colleagues that I had previously worked with, as well as the opportunity to be a part of growing the new NJ office location.  Good learning experience in a fast paced environment."
good,"Good company to work for, sometimes unorganized. Always on call. Lots of traveling. Hard to keep up with work orders. Different location daily, lots of road time."
good,"First job in finance. We worked in accounts payable. The responsibilities were very typical, processing invoices, managing property taxes, etc. The job was based on maintaining an account with a client, which ended after 18 months at which point we were offered other jobs within the company or had to find employment elsewhere."
good,"My first two+ years with JLL were fantastic but the culture very quickly eroded when the CHRO and the Director of Talent left within a very short period of time. Honestly, I feel like JLL sold out culture and that's really sad. I still talk to many of my former colleagues and they saw that it's only gotten worse. If you're looking for that first job out of school or to build your career, having a Fortune 500 company on your resume, JLL is great for that. If you're looking to avoid office politics and backstabbing, this might not be the place for you."
good,It is a nice company to work for. JLL has good benefits and a good social committee. My co-workers are extremely friendly and good fun.
good,JLL is a great place to thrive if you have the right skills. In order to succeed all you need to do is work hard and hope you have a reasonable boss. A typical Day includes being huddled over a computer until 8 hours is up.
good,Very little room to progress no matter how are you work. If you are looking to do a job and go home with no growth good place.
good,"The company will help you grow your knowledge pertaining to EHS,"
good,"Brief on Company: "
good,"amazon cancelled our contract ,and we all lost our job at aurora den5, be careful when working with JLL as third party, JLL is good company, benefits are good bt when you work as third party anything can happen."
good,"It is a ""guy's network"" in the Atlanta Project Management office, but extremely petty, ruthless and two-faced.  What was a problem one day, became a KPI that was missing its mark, the next day.  Very ""firm first"" and more concerned about upsetting internal resources or offending someone of a higher title, that doing what was right, what was promised to the client & what we were capable of doing."
good,Worked with JLL is challenging especially when dealing with the vendors and procurement heads. The employees at the head office are professional and accommodating as well.
good,"The atmosphere was great and very laid back.  The diversity in the organization is a plus and work culture helped make the days go by quickly. Lack of training was a major problem and a new system should be implemented rather than throwing new employees at a desk and saying ""do this, do that"" and expecting them to know how.  This was mostly out of laziness.  Very few were willing to help, the ones too lazy to help mostly just sighed and seemed annoyed.  Investment in new employees only saves time and energy in the future.  Good money for the time being, but as you would progress and advance to higher positions it seems like you wouldn't be making enough for the amount of workload they throw at you."
good,Good company to work for fair pay good compensation good insurance fair amount of payed time off fair amount of sick time room for advancement they recognize extra effort
good,Great coworkers everyone got along and always willing to help someone that need to catch up on work. Management always willing to listen and met with employees in both a group and individual setting to make sure any office conflicts were heard and addressed.
good,"A large company that has a lot of benefits. Hardest part of the job is showing up. This is a good environment for self-sufficient people. Lots of PTO, that is challenging to use."
good,"i like to passed great time . ,and iwa verey intrested in this journi and ihope that i woud like to have one time to to being in this journi again"
good,Managers and co-workers are extremely supportive and encouraging towards learning and development of new hires.
good,It is a very reputed longest surviving company.It is an honor to be part of it
good,"Very good benefits and working environment, great management and team value. Lack of tech oriented people and tools to improve efficiency when working on projects."
good,I had good experience In my life for this kind of review because of your questions I like one of company now I am working in Wipro i am handling your accounts
good,challenging work but no family life no time limit but good in work style.
good,Had a hard time with upper management.When issues came up they where never around.
good,"Typical Work Day: Stressful, Multi-task, No support"
good,Be ready to find a new job if the account you work on doesn't win the renewal bid at the end of the 5 year contract. JLL provides you with a Truck and the tools needed to perform your job.
good,"JLL is fairly new to the equipment maintenance field and as such is experiencing some growing pains. We were contractors working within the Amazon Fulfillment Center, We had enough access to do most of our jobs however, there were many occasions where we would find an issue that needed to be resolved and were forced to live with the problem. There were a number of different companies within the facility that we had to deal with which made our jobs difficult. The atmosphere was toxic. That being said, I would like to see how JLL operates in a different facility. I think JLL could be a good company to work for."
good,After I Joined Their I Learnt Management Skills That Really Needs For every Person
good,I love the shopping center business and working for JLL at this regional mall was a great introduction to retail property management. I enjoy working directly with the retailers and  being Apart of the consumer shopping experience. I learned a lot about the industry.
good,"Calls calls calls, emails, txts non-stop all day long juggling 20 things at once.  I didn't like that the company didn't protect our team from the client always asking do this, do that on and on and on and our work day goes from crazy to intense and all the time.  "
good,"It seemed as though the only possibility for advancement came through attrition."
good,"Work culture is extremely good at the corporate office."
good,"Provê os recursos mínimos necessários para a função."
good,"Good solid company to work for, high emphasis on training, very talented people in key positions throughout the company."
good,Team was great and enjoyed working with them. Management and promotional opportunity was only there if you knew someone and not by merit. It is a great company if you know someone going in.
good,"There so political and non direct. They dont tell you what they want and they dont tell you what they dont want. They leave all answers veg. So they have exap goat. Example is I made a mistake on my time sheet. They said need to pay more attention to detail, 4 days after I turned it in. I had. I had know idea what they were talking about. I only figured it out as I frantically looked back at all I had done. They need more clear direct instructions"
good,"Me gustó la experiencia en JLL , aprendí mucho más que en los estudios de empresariales. Sin embargo a pesar del estatus de la empresa tienen poca estabilidad para los contratos laborales . Pueden contratar temporales para durar dos meses y a la calle"
good,"I loved working from Jackson, MS office.  Wonderful Management and work team.  I advanced and worked remotely.  The hours were ridiculous.  At first the pay seems great but when you figured that time by hours spent working 7 days a week, it was pretty sad."
good,"1. Typical day would loaded with work pressure."
good,i like my team under me could not trust anything that management told me.the manger above was the biggest lire i ever worked with in my whole life.i also travel ever and didn't get paid for it.
good,"I loved working with this company at first it was difficult, since there is no absolute training which I enjoyed since I im the type of person who likes to put her hands on. Stressful, under preassure, dead lines, everything I love!!!"
good,"a typical day at work involves performing PM's throughout of a 750,000 sq. ft "
good,Great opportunity! Good mentors and lots of varied work experience.
good,"JLL overall is not a bad company, but the management at the Georgetown CITI Group Data Center leaves much to be desired."
good,"All type of electrical parts.Dg .Lift.Escalator.Fire fighting system,cctv"
good,Not much to say. No opportunities for advancement.   Management only cares about their own. A typical work day isn't that hard but peak is very difficult with minimum staffing.
good,"Miss my team but the customer needs were a moving target with no rigidity. Turns out there was a restructure of client, and then building sold so contract was nullified and void after."
good,Very good company to work with. Salary is always on time. My experience was at times bad due to abusive manager & hr team which I feel is an exception in my case.
good,Personal time off and holiday schedule is great other than the use or lose part. JLL provides tools needed to accomplish required tasks. Mileage compensation for using personally owned vehicles is acceptable.
good,"Overall, JLL is a very good place to work. The company continues to grow and is well respected in the business world. The opportunity for advancement and relocation exists for those that desire."
good,"Grossly dysfunctional agency account that has not learned how to be JLL after an extended period of time. Management covers up fallacies with text book learned rhetoric."
good,"大公司很有人情味 ，在這公司有很多不同類型的工作職位可供求職者選擇, 很容易選擇到適合自己的 工作地點"

good,working internationally was a great experience. completed the project from start to finish. definitely work for them again. sorry it was a project based assignment.
good,"Getting to know my brokers and their business to craft engaging pitch deliverables that secured new listing agreements. We'd work as a team to market the new listings, and it was great to see our efforts result in sales or fully leased spaces."
good,"The company has many employees but we are scattered around so the teams are always very small"
good,"Great place to start working in the commercial real estate world. "
good,Have worked for JLL for almost ten years. It's a great company to work for. The client makes all the difference. Maney long days and crunch hours. Projects and construction going on. Lots of over time.
good,Lots of training available. Safety minded. Busy environment. Overtime is always available and required. Management makes a lot of unnecessary meetings.
good,"I've love before the working relations with client and third parties but in our team their is favoritism,we are not properly guided by our superiors,all our rendered services are not properly earned and with difficulties in claiming for an online transactions and payrolls,systems are not in placed and still on a trial and error process.and we cannot direct our complain to tje department involves."
good,"I truly enjoyed my Job and loved working with my team "

good,"JLL was a place to work, normal corporate America atmosphere, some good and some bad. Work life balance was professed but not practiced. Goals are set to unrealistic levels with work load requirements,  Promotions are based on political correct attributes instead of the skill base of the employee."
good,"JLL values diversity and inclusion and works hard to retain the best talent through mentorship and progression through the company. It still has some of the old habits of a 100+-year-old corporate, but it's willing to try new things, even if change is slow sometimes."

good,"I'm a Ops Engineer for JLL contracted by Amazon.  Every day I work, I start by running the conveyor system to make sure everything is functioning the way it should.  I'm checking to make sure there is no strange noises coming form the conveyor.  I'm also checking for tracking issues with the belt.  I look at the HMI screen to see what alarms/faults Amazon had the previous day.  Once I complete my pre-sort check, I complete the other PM's that are present that day.  Occasionally, we have situations where a part of the conveyor system becomes inoperable.  My job at that point, is to troubleshoot to find what is causing the problem.  Since I been here at JLL, I've learned how to inventory parts into the parts inventory system.  I also had to learn the job of project management.  I've learned how to use RSLogix 5000 as well.  JLL is very good company to work for but the Amazon account is very fast-paced and stressful environment at times."

Costomer first, whatever it takes to make them happy. Great mentor. Always above and beyond! I'm still his friend to this day and still listen to his wisdom. "
good,"Pretty decent gig with little supervision.  You are assigned a set of buildings in your area and are responsible for the entire building from the ground up.  Little supervision gives you a ton of freedom, but that same freedom tends to make you bored and lazy.  Honestly, this is more for the middle aged man with some good work ethic and discipline.  The lazy side gets you noticed"
good,"Project Management is an all consuming position.  As a Project Manager, you are the ""buck stops here"" contact for your client.  With this moniker, there is follow-up, follow through and get it done, if the responsible party has not completed the task.

good,Good Learning experience
good,JLL is a great company with thousands of clients throughout the US and internationally. There are a lot of opportunities for someone who is looking to progress.

So your day at work is in the customer site, which in my case was a big computer and manufactorer where I was responsible to bring saving (cost reduction) keeping the quality or increasing it in anything related to indirect costs for the company.

good,JLL provided a great industry learning environment.  Working on several different properties allowed for learning different building systems and experience with dealing with different management teams.
good,I like JLL as a company but not the client account that I was assigned to. JLL can be a great company to work for if you are at a decent account. The client account that I was at was was not a good one. The client company was not run well and the employees were very negative. I would love to stay with JLL if I could find another account to be at.

good,I really enjoyed my job and my co-workers. My typical day at work was to oversee the daily operations. I was directly under the  manager and helped him as needed. We completed work orders which included general plant maintenance as well as the boilers and waste water...etc. The hardest part of the job was not being trained on all equipment and needing to know it to be able to do my job to my full potential. I liked the opportunity of completing the OSHA 30 hour course to further my education.
good,"Um ótimo trabalho que me gerou ótimas oportunidades de se relacionar melhor com o cliente, desenvolvi muitas habilidades e estratégias para vender o nosso produto. A gerencia da loja foi muito boa enquanto estive trabalhando, porém houve algumas falhas que não me agradaram muito. Fiz muitos colegas de trabalho, não tive problemas com ninguém. A parte que achei mais pesada era a que nós temos que ficar no celular 24h por dia, o que dificultava um pouco o relacionamento com familiares e amigos. A parte mais agradável era a foto que tirávamos com o cliente após a venda, ver os clientes satisfeitos e felizes era a parte mais agradável do trabalho."
good,The department I was in could have used better management. Management more nurturing would have better helped employees advance in their careers.
good,Overall a great place to work with lots of opportunity for you to create impact.  They have a heavy client service mindset and focus on results which allows you to have impact on a daily basis.
good,"My day to day work is very interesting as I did not have any experience in the field of Building Executive I managed to take the lead. I have learned a lot during the last 2 1/2 years.

good,Great place to work but due to their client they are loosing their employees. So if they stop making adjustment according to Client it will get better & better.
good,The organization was too top heavy with many managers for one department which would convoluted the environment of the organization.   Office politics were on a top high in the organization which started to cause a lot of turn over within departments.
good,A empresa proporciou experiência de gestão em projetos de facity management.
good,"There's a lot to say about the company. As a firm, JLL prides itself in being ethical and a top workplace. Whereas on paper it looks good, there's a lot of mismanagement and disconnect between workers of different generations."
good,"As the building manager for 260K sq feet of Class A office space in downtown Boston, I have learned that Property Management requires an understanding in many different areas from building operations to financial budgeting/ accounting skills to lease/contract negotiation.  There is never a dull moment as each day can bring new challenges and I feel that I am always learning something new. Ability to multi-task, prioritize and sound decision making are essential to success in this industry. I work with an amazing building team who are supportive to each other and work well together to achieve common objectives."
good,JLL demonstrates highest levels of Professionally Managed Organization and working at JLL is really a matter of pride as it gives the vast learning on Processes and Procedures and prepare an individual to rise in hard dying situations.
good,Company was nice to work for.  Nothing spectacular but I was on a contract that was lost and they took us on.  No special treatment.  low balled our salaries.  Transition was awkward they were unprepared.  This changed over time and the onboarding process changed at bit I hear

good,Enjoyed my time with JLL. Friendly office with a large and professionally competant staff
good,"I have been with this firm on the Wells Fargo account since December of this year. It was a contract take over, and I was with the incumbent company. It was a rocky start, but we have smoothed out some, but still some hurdles to overcome. My team is still the same team that I had in the past, with some exceptions. We are determined to make our group sucessful."

good,"Upper management on my account was a struggle. Not familiar with client so everything seemed to be a fire drill, lots of turn over and the workers were always  cleaning up the mess. Also the pay was not up to par with industry standards."
good,"For a short period working with JLL, meeting good people. My manager was very supportive..........but it a shame I didn't got a chance to stay long. No further comment. This company was highly recommended."
good,Benefits are good but I think the health insurance should be cheaper given the size of the company. Management is lacking structure and leadership. JLL is a very large company and you kind of start to feel like just a number after awhile.
good,Great opportunities to progress within the company. The progression plans were well thought out and JLL provided great online training that were accessible to everyone.
good,JLL has a lot of client. Some employees work for JLL corporate but most employees work for the world wide individual client accounts which operate based on the needs and budget of the client. I worked on a client account which is more structured and not a lot of room for advancement.
good,I don't want to do this right now.  I don't want to keep writing.  This is not a good use of my time to add more things about a company that has been good to work with.
good,Muy buen lugar para hacer experiencia regional y conocer distintas culturas.
good,"I work in an ever evolving organization that is focused on technology, people, and process.  Understanding and working through change management is an everyday activity."

good,It's a good place to work.  The benefits and pay could be better for hourly employees.  The work/life balance in certain departments is ideal.   They really try to focus on diversity but should do better in upper management depts.
good,They recognize talent and help you with any questions or skills you wish to work on. I wish I could have stayed there permanently but I had to relocate.
good,Love that the shifts are 4x10 gives more time with my family. However the graveyard shift gets old real quick. Safety is number one but to an extreme where one little slip up will get you fired. The pay is good and the paid time off out of the gate is awesome. Good team environment. But once you reach Tech 3 nowhere to go.
good,The work keeps you busy all day. I would interact with different groups on a daily basis on different projects. Which made the work always different from day to day.
good,"Empresa lider en el mercado de real estate comercial, buen aprendizaje, buen salario y beneficios, proyectos dinámicos trabajo bajo presión. ambiente multicultural."
good,Good company that has your back. Very understanding with a great team of people to be around who are all professionals in their fields. Learned much from working here.
good,"All in all its a very relaxed environment with enough free time to engage in training and extra tasks for our client. Opportunities for advancement are lackluster within the Whirlpool contract, but the position is a great resume builder for a new member of the work force."
good,"How do you rate JLL?  Their benefits, culture, and what they promote are good to great.  All else really depends on the account and the management in place.  The account I was on, was a Corporate Solutions dedicated client account and it was a demanding but good account due to the client and the management team."
good,"JLL overall is great with development, advancement and opportunities.  I was on a difficult account which limited work/life balance and development/training"
good,"Like most companies, we were under staffed. There were lots of long days with high expectations from the client.  Roles were not well defined, which lead to confusion with regard to responsibilities."
good,"JLL is a great place to work and gain experience. But manager's tend to become complacent, resulting in slow growth for employees. The culture is good and the work-life balance is highly valued. It's just a matter of vouching for yourself so that you can grow and get the pay you deserve."
good,Being on call 24/7 and not being apart of the bonus program as an 'Assistant Facilities Manager' was the reason I left the job to pursue other options.
good,"ANZ top 4 Bank in Australia. "
good,"Having an open concept layout in the office also opens up the communication among executives to clerks. They also gives employees opportunities thru their online curriculum or sessions which you could avail online for free. There are also options to work at home, for a more balanced work and life."
good,Able to learn a lot about the industry. Current account is not set up as it should and staffing is low. Recruiting seems to be an issue especially getting hard services people.
good,Good company to work for. Great Benefits. Lots of long hours though and lots of personalities to deal with. Some very good senior managers. Contract work.
good,This was an interesting job due to being third party.  Hard to work for another company and follow the guidelines of the client. Great experience now I have had both sides of the equation.
good,"I enjoyed my tenure at JLL. A typical work day was consistent with any other. I learned new programs, training was always available. Culture was diverse."
good,"Easy,Laid back work environment. Relaxed as long as you complete PM's schedule."
good,"Aggressive growth firm. No micro-managment. Flexible work styles and work life balance encouraged. Better than average benefits."
good,"Good place to work with, but the politics are off himalayan heights, it is very tough to sustain that survive in that company, very process & systematical company though"
good,"My experience with JLL was challenging and rewarding.  JLL provides a variety of career paths and a mentoring program designed to help one excel in their chosen path."
good,"Project scheduling and monitoring the Schedule; providing periodic progress reports. "
good,"It is a typical corporate environment.  It helps to make friends with upper management.  If you're not liked, you won't go far within the company or receive certain perks."
good,"JLL provides many tools and resources, to be successful in the workplace. They also have many location and different accounts that can help diverse ones portfolio."
good,"- Highly Process Matured"
good,"If on the account side it's all dependent on which account you are on and who your manager is.  If you get the wrong manager, your career at JLL could be dead in the water no mater how effective you are.  if you get a client who despises the outsourcing model, your career at JLL could be dead in the water as management puts it back on you and not themselves to improve the relationship and conditions."
good,"JLL is a good company with people who care. Like any company, there are areas that need improvement or poor leaders."
good,"Was a good job with long hours, callouts, furnished vehicle and tools. Corrosive atmosphere ate equipment and coils. Mostly patch and go type work environment."
good,"OK place to work. People are friendly. Its a union company  "
good,"Improvement in professionalism of employee with jll, good learning experience of employee with jll, proper management of employee with jones lang lasalle."
good,Plentiful training for an initially challenging job that was directly related to my degree.  A brand new facility that was still very much in flux when we parted ways amicably.
good,Good Company to work for only problem is 2nd party contract with man power being a problem to supply services. This is a on going problem in the industy do to shortages of skill trade.
good,I worked here for 9 years. 10 at this same account. The only draw back I see with this company was the purchase and utilization of corrigo. . This MMS system bogged down the process so much that I couldn't get anything done. The only other problem is that my industry and the industry we were serving just didn't mesh right. the customer wanted everything now and in my industry and dealing with 35+ year old kitchens it just doesn't happen.
good,"A very dynamic, aggressive & rewarding organisation, full of opportunities, talent and support."
good,"I worked for Jll, but was outsourced to VMware. It was a fun environment for employees with a nice game room and all snacks/drinks in a large kitchen, we also enjoyed many social times . I enjoyed my time with JLL, however I didn't care for how they performed their mid-year and yearly reviews. My direct manager was in another state and I feel it made it harder for the review to be completed. I also would have liked to see a better system for classes, they did allow us to take classes, but we were limited to only so many. If I had a choice in jobs I would not go back to JLL."
good,"I was working as a Fire and Safety Manager in one of the Biggest real estate and property giants. Work culture was totally different from the normal work procedures of Fire dept as various sections of people were included from students to residential and shoppers."
good,as a company its very good. but your future and career depends on the mode of the reporting manager and management. getting promotions is very difficult. salaries are ok but not satisfactory. Open culture everybody is given freedom to express the ideas and suggestions. the traning and educating the internal teams is very good. the central operations backend teams are good. each vertical does an ample amount of business. there are good supportive teams in the office.
good,"Learned basic of what HR ops do. the management was great but not excellent since its my first job i cant rate it as excellent. co-workers are okay, some are hard to please but most of them are friendly. hardest part of the job is when i'm busy doing nothing."
good,"you get assigned to site, account or client. Your performance thereafter gets analysed by client, all benefits enumerates etc gets through client approval."
good,"Good job bad management.  Great safety training. "
good,Good company to work for with good ambiance and lots of opportunities to evolve as a professional...
good,"You are always on your toes, perform and perform is the key words. A strategically focused organisation with strong long term plans and ideas."
good,This job is focused on customer satisfaction you must be very outgoing and ready to take on all challenging task that any of the different people from different departments come up with.

good,Enjoyed working for a big company.  Schedules and work itself was pleasant.  Unfortunately company didn't renew contract and I was laid off.
good,If you work here be prepared to be very corporate and email everything. If your under direction of Western region the opps manager G.S. Is the best man ever to work for! Jll is a good place to work
good,Jones is a great company to work for with the exception of being in the mobile engineering position as I have vast experiance in the field but will sadly be layed off in the near future because of the lack of clients needing service in my geographic location.
good,Lots of coaching and mentoring available internally. many employee resource groups to guide you.  Ability to move from one position to another.
good,"As of right now, we are around 2 MW. We have been operational for over 1 year. My daily routine consists of doing daily building rounds and taking care of the work orders provided by 360. The equipment PM's are starting to come in now. We have a standard 3 man crew per shift, 1 electrical, 1 mechanical, and 1 BMS. We have finished writing our SOP's to our company standard."
good,"PM's on varies HVAC systems, DX & chilled water systems."
good,The company is good....& very nice  for working. We get full support from senior management.
good,I work from home taking maintenance work orders over the phone and working with a specific computer system.  I learn something new every day.  Management is very helpful.  I get a long with all of my co workers.  The hardest part is not having any interaction with people face to face and mosy enjoyable is helping people.
good,"Work load varies day to day."

good,A creative shift is required at this particular site which interferes with personal activities.

good,"~Positive and engaged work environment"
good,start with Motorola became a contractor with Jones Lang LaSalle and finished the contact out and moving on.
good,"Working with Jones Lang Lasalle was really good experience and it was a knowledgeable place. I learn a lot in this institution as it was just different from my old job. Dealing with different kind of work and job every day makes man much adult. I have learnt about addition thing as managing the DG sets, AC Palnt, STP plant, Electric Panels and managing these all. I got a good working team with me. Initially it was just different jobs and meeting the acceptations of public was a little hardest and later on I really enjoyed my job."

good,"I was able to expand my knowledge of Microsoft Excel, create a legally binding amendment, and distribute each amendment to vendors."
good,"Worked with some really good people but the pay was low for a maintenance supervisor , facility manager, and most employees in an industrial environment!  Need to differentiate between industrial and non industrial positions"
good,Brings you out of your comfort zone with supporting management. Project managers will guide their trainees until trainees understand their assigned job.
good,"In my 2 years and 8 months working in JLL with 2 different accounts, I can say that it was nice working with them. Salary is okay and the benefits as well. It just that I need to have career growth and to find a direct work with the better salary and compensation. I learned a lot from them working from a fast pacing environment account and move to a more light, creative and fun work. Colleagues are very approcahable as well as the leads. The most challenging part on my first account is working with an environment where all the expat and the boss of the company are located. Every request are special and priority. While the second account, the challenging part is there's a working place rotation every year."
good,I was sad when we walked away from the contract. I loved this job & the group of people I worked with was like family. I looked forward going to work everyday.
good,Management of service contractors and providing excellent customer service
good,Perfect place to work in Moscow with a large number of real estate market professionals. Perfect corporate culture.  Good office in the center of Moscow. The balance between work and personal life depends on which department the employees work in.
good,"I don't have any complaints about my employer, i do believe it is a good place to work. If i did have a criticism it would allude to the size of the company and difficulty in advancement for lower level employees. I would like to earn a higher wage as the cost of living in my area is pretty high and I do believe I have the skills and experience to earn more."
good,"I was interviewed to work in capital markets (CM), which is why I took the job. However, one my first day, upper management came up to me and told me I would be joining the infrastructure team. I was told that the infrastructure side was very busy and needed help, but eventually I would move me back to CM; however, that did not happen. I joined this company because I was interested in learning about and working in CM."
good,"Good working environment. "
good,"Typical day consist of "
good,"Great company, but very limited advancement especially in a specific MSA.  Often make statements bordering on promises and can only deliver 20% of the time base on other promises made."
good,Though this place can be fast paced at times. Normally its not that bad. Alot of walking and no real time to sit down. But the job is stressful dealing with amazon.
good,a decent place to work. lots of training and good information to learn and add to  personal life lots of computer time running all the  automated systems.
good,it feels good working here and the workplace culture is nice.The hardest part of the job is when we get sev calls on the equipment everyone goes crazy and sometimes they don't know what they are doing.
good,Company was Facilities Management company. Worked for them to set up new GM Powertrain Lab. Was a Technician position. Worked with me to leave in ay I could qualify fot unemployment benefits.

good,typical day was good the most enjoyable part of job was getting off learned a lot working nice people nice place to work enjoyed going to work everyday
good,"We would have a typical Monday morning to review the schedule of all projects. Jobs were tackled in the order of due dates, often adjusted for last minute rush requests. There was a great team effort in all projects which made it a very satisfying place to work. Everyone felt they could ask each other for helpful critique of work/design. "
good,JLL is a progressive company that treats employees well.  However transparency is lacking.  I have enjoyed my time working here.  JLL is brokerage driven and I don't work in brokerage so I might not be the best to speak to that portion.
good,"JLL is a great company with numerous employee programs available."
good,"As a Mobile Engineer, we pretty much had control over each day and our interactions with our client sites. Our Operations manager was good, well balanced and easy to talk with concerning the job and more."
good,Overall good company to work for. Just need more women in higher positions. Still mostly men in higher positions and women in lower level administrative positions.
good,Check in with crew and then off to meetings. Always learning something new on processes/policies. Management was flexible with work and home life. Fun working group.
good,"Its Great to work with JLL,I was placed at Client Office Microsoft,"
good,"Great team, great environment, only drawback was contract employee could not find position open for full time work. If could have become a full time employee with JLL would have remained"
good,Jll is a great company to work for. Management had your back all the time. Fast pace. Co-workers are great. HR is always there to answer questions when needed.
good,"Môi trường làm việc chuyên nghiệp, luôn có khóa đào tạo cho nhân viên"
good,I love the company culture and the amount of personal/career development and advancement opportunities but it seems you are constantly inundated with work and have no real work to life balance.
good,"JLL offers superb benefits however, depending on who your direct supervisor is, direction and mentorship can be spotty. If you are a new employee in need of guidance, don't count on receiving any.  You'll have to teach yourself the ropes."
good,"As a Corporate Solutions JLL employee, your world is all about the client you serve.  JLL employees are expected to adopt the culture of the client.  If I were looking at a job at JLL, I would get to know the client to best understand the environment."
good,"Days varied depending on what jobs you were doing.  Some days it was a focus on marketing, others accounting, or collections.  Some days we were decorating the center for a major event."
good,"I have worked with JLL for a year now and have been very satisfied.  The networking vast and full of people always willing to support or offer advise.  My senior management is great to work with and client relationships seem to be very productive.  "
good,JLL is a great place to work. The culture is very relaxed. Company is working to limit overtime for its employees. Great benefits as well. The only downfall is limited opportunities to move up the ranks. Salary is not competitive with the market as well.
good,I was happy to work for JLL.  They treated me well and offered a decent package.  I respected my manger and they respected me.  I would work for them again.
good,"Great team to work with, flexible about schedule, many resources to grow skills. HR can be annoying and will always need to follow corporate rules which can make promotions a long process."
good,JLL is a great place to work if you have prior experience. It is an environment where they expect you to know what you are doing within the first 2 months of being here. The biggest con is the salary.
good,"Love the culture, very nice environment. Great Place to start career and learn the key and core accounting concepts. Juggling many deadlines and assignments has given me a chance to grow and increase my efficiency."
good,"A very busy and fast past work load, a lot of support from others.  Safety and quality of work is the main focus of JLL to support the customer.  Casual and relaxed environment to work in."

good,"1.Begin each workday by arriving at work on time and prioritizing the completion of important tasks from your to-do list while your brain is at its peak. Scan your inbox and check your voice mail for urgent messages but avoid the distraction of opening every email."
good,"Staggered month-ends for properties allow for workload to be spaced out reasonably throughout a month.  The first few months were difficult: I was asked the question ""Why don't you already know how to do this?"" quickly followed up with ""Well, it's not my job to teach you, go ask someone else"" when asking a question to nearly any person I encountered.  Luckily, I found a small number of people willing to show me the ropes and, since then, the work has been stable and manageable.  The challenge in working here comes more from workload than the specific work itself, which is good for being able to complete your work accurately and on time, but difficult for standing out."
good,"Ranked as No 1 in Facilities and Property Management in India and the most ethical firms in the world. Enjoyed working here, as I was exposed to the real estate industry and a holistic HR experience."
good,"JLL is a great company and provides you with the best tools in the industry to perform your job through their data analytics tools and cohesive environment.  Everyone is willing to help grow the brand.  The negative is your day to day experience really comes down to your client.  The better the relationship you have with your client, the better your day to day will be."
good,"I loved working with JLL.I have spent almost 5 years with the firm.Job security is very good."
good,Company has amazing benefits with vacation time and insurance.  Night shift is beginning to take a tole on my family and sleep pattern.
good,"Office environment is very good, people are hard working and motivated, and working with motivation is its self a key towards success."
good,"Work can't be funnier and lovely than anywhere else at JLL."
good,"I start my shift at 7:00 a.m. the first thing I do is check my emails then my work tickets to see if it's something that is needed of me. After that I walk around the building checking the mail slots for any outgoing mail or packages, by the time I'm finished with that I wait on my deliveries then deliver them to the associates. I learned how to effectively multi task on this job, there is not a moment when I am not doing at least two things at once. I also picked up on leadership skills such as; effectively communicating, being well organized, making my co workers feel comfortable. The hardest thing about the job is being underneath so many people with high positions so it can be difficult at times on who to take instructions from. The most enjoyable part of the job is I get to manage myself and not be micro managed."
good,"Iam looking for the site change as this is too far for me to travel. i spend more time in travelling  then at work "
good,"there are lot of thing i have learnt from my Sr. Mangers."
good,"es una empresa buena para trabajar con personas muy profesionales y dispuestas a hacer las cosas de forma correcta,"
good,I started working for Jones Land LaSalle on the Citizen's Bank account. Unfortunately the account began to be transitioned in the week after I was on boarded. JLL is good company with a lot of opportunities around the world. Good if you like to move a lot.
good,"A empresa é considerada uma das melhores empresas para trabalhar e com razão de ser, pois existe um respeito enorme pela partilha de vida privada/profissional."
good,"The co-workers were the most enjoyable part of the job.  They were young and energetic. "
good,"I loved the company itself.  They offered a great deal of training and career development.   The management for the most part was very impressive.  However, there were some managers that were lacking in guiding employees with their career path."
good,"An eight hour work schedule from Mondays to Fridays that focuses on administrative and engineering works in the building. Jones Lang LaSalle Philippines provides on-line training for employees deployed in every site through the help of intranet."
good,"A typical Day at work..."
good,Helping others daily on making sure things in the building are working. •	Coordinate building maintenance activities; deliver mail.
good,JLL offers you the various options of growth and gives you the right platform.The work life balance depends upon the role you choose but you will have to give few late evenings.
good,"The day starts with checking with the Night Security before their shifts ends to inquire on how the night went and if there were any issues or problems that need attention. Then checking for any work requests that may have come in after hours, finally review emails that need your attention and start any required preventive maintenance that is scheduled or work orders not completed the day prior. What was learned working in a call center is that there is always something that needs corrected, fixed, or replaced. Need to stay abreast of the budget at all times, service contracts and continue to look for ways to cut cost and improve the overall condition and environment of the facility. The hardest part of the job would be putting in the long hours to insure that everyone's needs are met without telling them ""no we can't do that"" , but explain what the cost would be if we did. The most enjoyable part of any job is the satisfaction you get when you can put a smile on someone's face or the thank you for making their job easer."
good,"A day starts with a pressure and will go on with the same but later it will be enjoyable."
good,"I never had a typical day at work.  One day I would be working on a heating or air conditioning piece of equipment, the next would be fixing a broken lock.  I like working within a team environment, where everyone has the same goal.  I provide a great customer service, and enjoy completing a job that makes the customer happy.  The hardest part of my job is being able to do the job needed and keeping the cost to a minimal.  The most enjoyable part of my job is the customer.  The customer creates the need and I provide the service to make their job easier."
good,"Learned a lot.  Great Sr. Management.  Clients can be a handful, but JLL is a well run company."
good,The hardest part of the job was trying to find a manger to speak with. The people there are very friendly and most are helpful.
good,"The FM program manager job entails attention to details in all areas of facility management. CMMS, Call center, EH&S, Capital programs, energy conservation programs, training programs, and are part of the day to day responsibilities of the program manager. I have been challenged to discover processes not previously explored, and learn things that are of higher worth than things I have done in the past. These things required me to stretch and learn a great many processes that were new to me. The hardest part of this job was to discover the full scope of my responsibilities. Discovery is great."
good,Small office with a new building. Not enough work day to day. My direct report was one of the best managers I've had. She still works for the company in MA.
good,"No day is ever typical; most of the work I do is based on client needs.  While there are contractual deliverables - reporting, defined performance metrics - flexibility is key.  If the client's business climate is changing, we need to be able to adapt to that and change course on a moments notice.  I've learned to be flexible and open minded; I've learned a lot from the clients that I have worked with both from a business/industry perspective, but also how to work with a variety of personalities from C-Suite to engineers in the field.  Everyone needs to understand the communications that are coming out so I try to make sure to appeal to all audiences.  The best part of my job are my co-workers and forming relationships.  It doesn't matter how long ago you worked with someone, you may need their assistance/knowledge some day so it's satisfying when I get the call ""I heard you may know...."".  "
good,Learnt about Standard Process and procedures Improvements in FM services
good,"My duties included sites in several states. I was in daily contact with clients, giving them information, helping to resolve problems, and contacting vendors for needed repairs. I oversaw safety issues, equipment issues, and the general welfare of each facility, which included security, janitorial, and pest control, etc.. All had to be done with an annual budget that I assisted in creating. The job was very stressful, but rewarding. I had one person who reported directly to me and business partners throughout the country.A typical day would find me trying to get an air conditioner repaired at one location while possibly trying to get the power back on at another."
good,"The Jones Lang LaSalle is a large diverse product company within the US and nationally. The job that I am in is a very physical, dangerous, and male dominated field. I went back to school to get my BA in business to make a career change to enhance the skills I have gained as an electrician and team leader. I have managed my own crew and trained new employees. I believe this is my next step in my career."
good,"This position is a position that requires diversity. On a typical day, I may encounter individuals from diverse backgrounds, diverse cultures, and diverse beliefs. Management teaches me how to deal with a diverse environment while maintaining a positive, professional, and pleasant first moment of truth. My co-workers and I work work well together. We provide flexibility in scheduling time off. The most enjoyable part of my position is meeting diverse individuals. The most stressful part of my position is trying to effectively perform my task without equipment working properly."
good,Jones Lang LaSalle - Real Estate & Project Services Company.

good,Much like other real estate and property management solutions the account (client) influences the experience. In this particular instance I was fortunate to be part of a team of highly professional and intelligent managers.
good,"JLL has great people that work there. If you are a young professional trying to get into commercial real estate, you will not be alone here. The pay is good if you work hard, however work/life balance can be hard for brokers as people are constantly calling their cell phone and work phones. My boss was very unorganized and as an intern didn't have much to do half the time. I did enjoy being there and great people will help teach you a lot about real estate."
good,"JLL is a multinational company that has a good management system and has a good employee development program. "

good,A typical day at work is filled with monitoring the power plant site and fixing problems that occur in an orderly and efficient manner. I have learned how to quickly fix problems efficiently and correctly. Management and workplace culture are fine. The hardest part of the job is trying to fix a huge problem quickly and efficiently. The most enjoyable part of the job is that it is easy to work and work with others.

I was covering the Brooklyn district due of the passing of one of the engineer for that area. My area was Queens since I was told that I was going to cover the Brooklyn area temporary but it end up to be for eight years or more . After so many hours and time put under  any weather conditions and situations they let us go. Apparently they needed Mobile Engineers for the account with experience and certification in HV/AC and we were not prepare for that.  We never had the chance to work with this units due to  we weren't allowed to touch them. They have outside contractors to service them. We all felt that it wasn't fair to let five of us engineers go for a reason that was not valid. They should of  give us time or training for us to prepare  for the the new task. I was very disappointed for the fact that the company said that they will help employees to advance their careers within the company but that never happened.  I had no complaints about JLL for the past 14 years I did my job responsibly, accurately and very professional. I would like to go back to work with JLL  is there is an opportunity. Thank you."

I over saw contract workers and there was always pressure to complete a project to go on to the next one but we were able to accomplish what we needed with satisfactory results.

good,"I have worked for JLL on 2 different accounts and they are night and day. The JLL Benefits and perks are second to none. PTO is great, holidays and healthcare are great. The account you work for make all the difference on how much this matters. My first account was about getting things done and keeping great records. My most recent account is more about penny pinching and dealing with frustrated and sometimes irate clients because you cant get work done due to budgetary slowdowns and cost deferments. I also have to deal with onerous paperwork for the sake of paperwork and redundant systems that only make getting work done confusing."
good,"A typical day at work is approx. 12 hours ranging from morning into night as managing facilities contracts has no time limits, especially nationally. Different roles may have different ways to balance work and life and different stages of client integration. I learned so much - on my own. This is not a job for someone who requires training. The management style is hands off. Coworkers are awesome and very willing to help and share information. The hardest part of the job was that I had the largest client, very demanding and lack of control of legacy contracts. The most enjoyable part of the job was working with the people in the field and my staff and accomplishing tasks that often seemed impossible. I would highly recommend working for JLL if you like to take on a challenge and be innovative."

I had 3 managers in two in a half years, (one had retired and responsibilities shifting caused these changes) however all 3 were instrumental in increasing my knowledge and developing my skills. I worked very autonomously with my client so I did not have much interaction with others in the company aside from the day-to-day water cooler chat, but all in all, mostly everyone regularly had a smile on their face."

I have learnt many personal, and technical skills including punctuality, meeting deadlines, and patience. In addition, Adobe Illustrator, GIS were in extensive use in order to get the job done. I worked along a colleague where we divided tasks equally. The hardest part of the job was to work with heavy CAD files which slowed down the computer and made a simple task turn into a strenuous task. However, I enjoyed the learning process which consisted of learning new softwares, and the relation between Urban planning and real estate."

good,"These people roll out the red carpet at first. Offering Competitive wages and travel for training. They hook you up with a company laptop, cell phone, and a bada$$ backpack. Traveling opportunities are always there with these guys since they continue to grow which opens up plenty of advancement opportunities.  The account I work on goes well with their PTO polocy. (I'm really home more days than I'm at work).  But although Their benefits are available, they're nothing special and they give poor raises. Overall, a good company to work for and hard to others who compete with what they offer."
good,"Depending on which contract you are put on makes all the difference. I was initially on a smaller account and took a promotion into a larger one which opened up many opportunities that weren't initially available on my previous account.
