rating,review
bad,"I have never worked at Yahoo.com.  I currently work at Owens Corning at 500 Case Ave. in Newark, Ohio.  Owens is a union based employer which for someone like me, that shows up to work to give a 100% everyday,  is just not a good fit.  All job advancements are based on seniority,  not work ethic and experience.  I am looking to gain employment with a company that values hard work."
bad,They let employees go after 5 years loyal service or make life miserable until the employee quits.
bad,There were days when it created an impact on the world. Now it only survives on that legacy and having a slow death every day. The management and its promises fluctuate like a pendulum. Job security is nill.
bad,"Relentlessly tense atmosphere, backstabbing, poor managers, micromanagement and neglect at the same time. Massive, ineffective bureaucracy. Terrible stack ranking evaluation system; performance evaluations were simply a means to fire people. Managers tolerated bullying and discriminatory behavior, and engaged in it as well. Typical workday would involve sitting down at your desk and working non-stop without relief at tasks you were never quite sure were contributing to the company or not."
bad,"with free food all day, gym, phones, and mac laptops it's generous."
bad,"When I joined the company, there were great people, a ton of industry leading technology, and a sense of camaraderie as we tried to turn around an industry icon."
bad,"Some of the perks are still good at yahoo! like Free Lunch."
bad,"overall it is nice work place."
bad,"Managers get promoted based on the friendship relationship they have with their managers. Managers are lacking real management skills, there's no sense of career advancement. Other than that food is great and benefits are good even though salary is really low and never gets increased."
bad,Frustrating to work for.
bad,Not a flexible in schedule low wages favoritisms don’t honor requested days off not always allowed to use earned days off not a good place to work it seems to be behind the times when it comes competitors
bad,Product Analytics at Yahoo gave me the chance to learn about how user behavior is affected by changes to products. Discovering patterns among a broad user base has its challenges and would have loved to learn how to penetrate this space further.
bad,"Working 24/7 wasn't enough.  Their quarterly goals will burn you up and spit you out...and then they'll just hire a fresh person that knows nothing for you to train them so they can take your job. I enjoyed my role here tremendously, but departmental cuts kept whittling down my staff and pretty soon I only had the outsourced team."
bad,Position was portrayed different than what it really is. Did not know it was a call center. There are no guarantees for advancement and not much room to grow.
bad,"This company makes a great offer, high compensation including free food, cellphone and gym reimbursements etc. The catch is that you are expected to work all hours of the day and give and give until you can't give anything else. There is no work/life balance and the boss's do not care that you have a family. You are required to compete against ALL of your peers which causes a tense and stressful working environment. Shortened cubicles are claimed to ""open up teams to working together"" and you still end up sitting next to people who will not work with nor help you on anything. This is truely the worst environment I have ever worked in. I am currently searching for another company to change to in order get my work/life balance that I miss so much."
bad,The company has a feeling of defeat throughout .. defeated by Google.  It's a terribly boring place to work.  The management is often absent and/or hostile in their interactions.
bad,"Strategy changes often, which effects teams directly. No job is safe;  everyone is on the edge of getting laid off at any point in time because of strategy changing on a whim. Benefits are good."
bad,"Yahoo! would be a much better company, if it was real diverse. diversity does not mean only moving people from India.  This over exceeding move now are going to cause problems for the company. diversity should have a fare distribution."
bad,"Good company to work for"
bad,"Buena compañía para trabajar, no tanto el ambiente."
bad,"This review is applicable for developer and tester - individual contributor roles. "
bad,"At the time, Yahoo implemented a ratings system where teammates were ranked against each other. Anyone with a low ranking for multiple quarters was let go, regardless of how well the team was performing on the whole. It created a tenuous atmosphere."
bad,Quarterly written reviews and goal summarizing would barely be completed when the next cycle had to start. Being a people manager at Yahoo was very challenging. Constant change and could never finish anything before minds were changed. Layoff was a blessing.
bad,"Directionless, poor leadership, identity-less company. Wonderful people work there, but they seem to clear house of all leadership every two years. No one gets too much of a chance to succeed."
bad,"Large companies arrive with a wealth of issues as well as benefits. Things are no different in Sunnyvale, where we've had our fair share of challenges. The companesation here is excellent, but right now the company's vision is still being determined."
bad,Unorganized company that is lacking in strategic direction from the C level executives creating a ripple effect throughout the company
bad,"Because Yahoo touches on many parts of the industry (display, video, programmatic, search), there is a lot of value in the learnings you get while working here.  They also take good care of employees with good pay, benefits, and work perks (free snacks, lunch).  The only thing to be concerned of is the future of its business as it has officially announced that it is officially exploring a sale of its core business."
good,Calls came in one after the other until break or lunch.  You have no control of the schedule.  Only engineering controlled their schedule.  Cases once escalated were no longer in your control.
good,Great work environment with knowledge sharing . Search Marketing knowledge share.
good,"The team in NYC is great, very supportive and we found the time to get to know each other outside of work. Problem is the company thinks the media capital of the world is Santa Monica leaving the folks in NYC with the mentality that it’s a bureau/satellite office not taking into account that this is the media capital of the world. Communication between the folks on the west coast and east coast is horrible. West coast managers have no concept of the three hour time zone difference and expect the NY folks to be always available even when its dinner time or time for sleep. With all the layoffs, lack of direction in the company as a whole and inept middle managers that openly talk negatively about other employees I would suggest people to go someplace else that respects you, it’s well worth it. There are plenty of other companies in NYC to find that will treat you right."
good,"Very cliquey environment. Managers foster the clique vibe. If you are cute, or are well-connected, you will keep your job *and go perm* even though those busting their behinds around you, who *are* actually qualified, get laid off or never go perm. Funny how all those in ""the clique"" seemed to all have kept their jobs *and go perm* during the most turbulent times at the company - no matter how unqualified they were, (ex: a receptionist was given an analyst position - even though she never went to school for it, nor had the experience. Her background included waitressing and reception work. I later realized she was dating someone in a high position there..hmmm. Another example, a former waitress with humanitarian studies was brought in by her sister and all of a sudden had a perm position doing something she never had experience in and seemed confused all the time doing, while others all around her were on contract, hoping to go perm. She was cute and knew the right person (i.e., the right person in ""the clique""). Another example of how favoritism played a role here: Another person went perm because she was given praise. Praise letters are read out loud at staff meetings by the head of the department. I later found out on the DL that the person who praised her was in a high position and in ""the clique"" -- and the kicker: was best friends with the person - they had grown up together. She went perm after that)). Another messed up practice: The majority of recruiters there are on contract, but, would not pass on highly-qualified candidates for positions because the candidate was"
good,Yahoo! works hard to hire cream-of-the-crop-talent only to fire them after 9 months. This is the company's way of avoiding making full time hires (barely skirting California contracting laws). Most positions there are extremely unstable.
good,"In the short period I was at Yahoo, I learned a lot. The culture was challenging and the leadership was constantly changing...yet, I learned a great deal from the adversity."
good,"Over all it is a good company very friendly and nice staff. Im just looking for advancement with in the company, to excel to the next level and its not up for option. We would always get spliffs and extra ways to earn money. I did not feel secure all the way because of the business. The job did not have benefits which is a plus to have a better future for myself and my kids."
good,"It was a steady job. Security is the kind of job that will pay the bills, but has no real future."
good,"There are a lot of great people doing good things at the company. While some departments are strong and getting stronger, other areas seem to lack direction. This may get better as their future becomes more clear."
good,"Managers are hateful , little pay , too much hours of hard work and no benefits , that's job literally sucks , I wouldn't recommend it to anyone , managers take everything personal."
good,Good place to work specially for rookie. Need to be smart enough to cope up with the expectation. Good Work culture and lots of scope of learning. No dress Code. College atmosphere.
good,"The environment is great.  A fully staffed cafeteria that is free to all employees is a great perk.  I work there as a freelancer.  No job security. Few Staff employees,"
good,"Yahoo is a great place to work, great people, great environment.  This is true, however if you are a full time employee.  Contractors who worked there do not have full benefits or access that others do."
good,"They try and pretend they are different, but it's just like working in any other call center environment.  It's all about how short your calls are, how many you take, and how well you can stick to a script.  "
good,Bloated middle management neither understands nor encourages creative team(s) to innovate on a stale product offering
good,"Yahoo! The name itself describes the company the best. I was a Search Analyst and my day would begin at 12 PM at work and went on all the way till 1 or 2 AM almost everyday.Except the work and the Management, everything else was just awesome(by that I mean, the gym, the play stations, the pantries and the food)."
good,Muy buenos compañeros. Buenos productos y equilibrio vida personal/laboral. Su inconveniente es que cada tres meses el equipo de dirección cambio de objetivos con lo que nunca se llega a saber hacia donde va la empresa. Los procesos se solapan y son ineficientes pero la dirección tarda años en escuchar a los empleados y hacer algo. Cualquier iniciativa por parte de los empleados solo encuentra problemas a menos que busques a algún jefe que te permita compartir tu idea.
good,Assisting clients with password recovery with 8 minute handle time. Assisting clients with browser troubleshooting via email within 4 hour turnaround.
good,"I have worked with some of the nicest and smartest people in the industry at Yahoo. Unfortunately, the company is struggling to engineer a workaround and work/life balance, job security and advancement opportunities all take a backseat."
good,"A typical day at work is your behind the desk, checking any issues involving email portals and answering phones from customer who needs assistance. I have learned a a glimpse of what the systems in Yahoo emails, a very complex organization, but it works. I barely see the management, they were in close net group, and was never curious on the progress of employees. The hardest part was that you felt just a number, like you were a robot doing the work and go home. There was never interaction, and group functions, it was all in your cube environment. The most enjoyable part of the job was just being able to have a job at Yahoo!."
good,Great people. The company is currently going through a transition.
good,"Good company, good people, every one just got on with the job and help was at hand if needed."
good,"I loved the opportunities that Yahoo Geo cities Sales job gave me to engage with new people and to learn about what they did, how they did it, what they enjoyed, what caused them pain and whether or not I could help them out."
good,"Was a good place to work and an attractive destination. Too many people seemed to be pulling in different directions, no overall strategy, employee loyalty lack as internal communications were often leaked to the public within hours of announcement."
good,"Employees have been laid off after several years, only a few months, or in one case--the entire group was eliminated 2 days before the new hire's start date. Press is calling them ""drip layoffs"".  Poor people managers who have gotten more political and micromanage more as a result of quarterly goals/reviews.  If you're lucky, very lucky you might get a manager who will have your back.  The current executive team is killing the great employee team culture there by pitting everyone against each other."
good,"Interesting culture, lots of technology, but slow to identify with and respond to the evolving needs and interests of consumers due to lack of innovative leadership and corporate bureaucracy."
good,"Émission et réception d'appel ,je me suis sentie très a l'aise  dans mon poste j'aime le contact téléphonique et les challenges ."
good,"Interesting work, dynamic environment. Only downside was they they didn't put any effort into training management, therefore there was no leadership consistency"
good,"A typical day involved checking tickets and completing the tasks that came up.  I learned to use some scripts in dos and the wonders of remote software.  The management was nice and as long as you respected them they respected you.  The people were organized and when we had large projects we worked together.  The hard part was getting access passwords to help to admins, I couldn't do all the requests that came in.  I enjoyed the quiet when there wasn't mass pages and the steady work request we had coming in."
good,It was a fun place to work but they focused too much on the fun. My dept. was too worried about perceptions and there always seemed to be some fun event going on. I always wondered when the engineers actually did any work.
good,"studios department is essentially a small company that has the backing of a fortune 500 company. best part of the company is the people that you work with, but career development and growth is very limited."
good,"Great workplace with lot of freedom to work and learn, performance oriented approach, helpful people make work easy and great colleagues makes work fun"
good,The reason why we’ve built a company is because I think a company is by far the best way to get the best people together and align their incentives around doing something great
good,"Learned a lot but got no progress in this work as they used our team for data entry rather than real research. "
good,"I was working at Yahoo full-time."
good,"The change to Marissa has lifted little of the culture and precedent set for by previous CEOs. The landscape has changed and they are reacting slowly to the market - they take 2 steps back with every new change to the environment."
good,"Yahoo has a big name and is a fun place to work at with lots of good , talented people around. Lots of things to learn. Free lunches available."
good,Company goals are changed very quickly. Not good and fair for QPR. Higher managers know nothing what their members do everyday.
good,Daily work performed at and for contract of Yahoo!. Zagwear enjoyed seeing results with little to no direction given to their staff. They also expected little to no questions being asked and tried to keep most of their process as a needs to know basis. Overall they were out to make money and at no cost to them.
good,its was good but not much good as ther was lot of work n there was no leave at any critical condition you have you come.
good,I was there for a year. It was fun but no alot of opportunities to grow.
good,"The culture of Yahoo! is amazing, the environment is highly tailored to the geek chic, with colorful interiors, fun and engaging co-workers, annual events, and a focus on the individual. Pay is amazing at Yahoo! Small Business for the work done. That said it is a call center  which means that the work can be non-stop and there are tight metrics to be held to in regards to average length of call, and customer satisfaction. Performance is bonus driven, and bonuses are generous for quality work."
good,"YAHOO! is a fun place to be. There are a lot of intelligent people around. There are free lunches, quarterly outings and stuffs which makes it the most coolest place to work."
good,"Productive and fun"
good,"Developing softwares using opensource technologies"
good,"The days at Yahoo! are never boring, things change quickly and you need to be ready to roll with the changes."
good,Enjoyed working there. Colleagues have very good working relationship.
good,"Operate as the lead point of contact for agencies in the Seattle, San Francisco, Los Angeles, and San Diego markets."
good,"Truly enjoyed my job at Yahoo! the departments I supported and the work I did."
good,"The mission and culture of Yahoo/Oath/Verizon Media continues to change since the Verizon acquisition. Some soft benefits are no longer as good or available. The people are dedicated, passionate, and very good at what they do."
good,"Good, it's good. Perks are good. Work environment is also good. Work pressure depends upon indivisual team where you are assigned to."
good,Employees join general work hard . Senior management team is too weak to right the ship. The CEO has great intention to bring the company to the next level but her staff are too weak to implement her vision.
good,"Vey Nice company to work , very good work culture, management are very supportive, they help you in every area."
good,"Yahoo is a huge platform that has struggled to find identity. It can't compete with Google as a search engine; it doesn't have social network immediacy of Facebook. I'm here because Yahoo had the idea of becoming a content provider. And indeed its digital magazines, in addition to original news, politics, finance and sports coverage, in my opinion, are, or were, excellent. However, the company failed get the word out that there was such rounded, broad coverage, including health, travel, food, tech... There was little to no promotion on the old or new home page, unfortunately. To me what seemed like a lot of potential for growth has turned into cutbacks in the editorial product."
good,"the company yahoo "
good,"- Nice culture."
good,"In over 5 years at Yahoo! I've had plenty of opportunity to learn many new skills. Due to the nature of the business things would change very rapidly and the requirement for flexibility was very high. This was both the hardest and the most enjoyable part of the job. It was hard sometimes to find the correct processes to go by, but it was empowering at the same time for the degree of self-initiative required."
good,"Challenging but very fun place to work"
good,"The best thing about yahoo is the multicultural environment, you exposed to different things daily and helps you learn how to deal with different situations."
good,I enjoy working on articles and the research involved. It helps me understand relationships and human behaviors much more since I have to do survey's. When I talk to each person I understanding their life circumstances depend on their choices.
good,Good work/life balance.
good,"Yahoo! is a search giant, and in order to fuel this giant machine, many Yahoo! team members must work in synch to create the harmony necessary to get the job done. This means that in any given office building there can be 800+ team members. This creates a real microcosm of different types and personalities."
good,"Mass layoffs occurred three times in the years I was employed. The CEO changed five times. Inconsistency and constant changes were the norm. This leads to employee anxiety and burnout,"
good,"Very good culture, benefits and compensation. need to balance work can get hectic at times. Management is normally good , but some decisions can leave you scratching your head."
good,A typical day at work involves a lot of research and design scenarios to create an application. Management is light so the onus lies on you to resolve several areas for end products. Work culture is awesome with several perks.
good,Effective and productive enviornment for the decommisioning of the Yahoo Data Center
good,"very challenging and fun loving work place, job and life can be balanced, however the job security in Yahoo! is very slim. Management are not transparent enough of their decision. Overall a good memorable experience"
good,Yahoo! has resources because they are a big company which makes it much easier to do excellent work. You have the support and the tools to get what you need done.
good,"A great place to work with a nice culture, facilities and working environment. A very challenging business environment plagued by confusion about the strategy and continuous turnover of executives"
good,"nothing really exciting about working here. go to work, do some stuff, go home, get paid. It was not bad before Verizon acquired the company but after that I completely lost interest. Funnily enough I was able to coast for quite a few months before finally collecting my bonus and quitting."
good,Web at scale - addressing the needs of 700M plus users world wide
good,"High tech company, a good environment and great and supportive people to work with, also good place to work and grow ."
good,I had a great experience at Yahoo as I l managed a team of sales folks across the country to provide the rights solutions to our clients in an ever changing digital environment. We acquired many companies during my tenure there and had to pivot quickly to incorporate this within our offerings to our clients!
good,Great work life balance.  Would be great if they would allow studio producers the opportunity to become staffed.
good,wonderful experience at yahoo. learning to work in a group and having fun with whatever we do is the best part of the job.
good,"Great place to work, for committed employees! Put in the time and see the results. Learned a lot about the corporate world, and how things run in silicon valley."
good,"Hardest part of job: The instability and directional changes "
good,The state of company is unsteady. Too many org changes too often. No job security. My team is understaffed and overloaded.
good,"Empresa joven y con talento, donde era fácil aprender de departamento colindantes, aunque no promocionar."
good,"A typical day included news gathering, writing, editing, building site, working with freelance staff, collaborating with other departments, working with content partners. The most enjoyable part about the job was working with great people and getting to interview highly respected music stars."
good,Help to support Yahoo customers via chat and email support only. We were doing phone support but that has been downsized.
good,whatever  yeah bad for  me great for others. If you get stuck labeled as the bad guy you won't get trained on anything or go any where
good,"Yahoo! was a great place to work.  There is lots of transition and turmoil, but the company is focused on growth and moving with speed on product development.  The mission of Yahoo! is to make Yahoo! a place that consumers go on a daily basis for all their informational needs."
good,a typical day at work
good,"intéressant, enrichissant, je ne sais pas quoi dire d'autres"
good,I enjoyed my team and my duties at Yahoo. I was encouraged and supported to grow. However upper management often understaffed departments causing burnout. That said my manager was awesome.
good,"Provide Application and Sr. server support to the development teams in preparation for migrating 2 global "
good,"Work here was a great experience. Managers were very friendly, with positive energy. The team was very collaborative. Great work ambient. Free meal. They are reducing staff constantly in the newsroom, overloading the work of those who remain. They prefer to contract out (contractors) and change them constantly, instead of hiring full times workers."
good,Yahoo was a great company to work for - we were always having fun but working hard too. The benefits were great and there was always an opportunity for career growth.
good,"This company has now operates under Verizon as OATH."
good,"Yahoo was a fun and energizing culture to work.  I only spent 25% of my time onsite.  It had all the amenities you would want, great food, awesome fitness center, large outdoor spaces, fun events etc"
good,"Great place to work and learn. Great people, who are genuinely interested in the progression of your character. Not a lot of growth as company is slowly doing worse and worse."
good,"Build strong relationships with existing merchants and execute negotiations to secure best pricing, sales programs, and promotional support. Maintain good business in Yahoo Deal and Yahoo Store operation"
good,"Première expérience dans une grande société américaine, qui m'a donné l'occasion de travailler sur des sujets très divers et de côtoyer différentes personnes très compétentes."
good,good place to learn and gain knowledge .co workers are good. Lot of facilities . Management is good and quite friendly. Transport system is best . Love to work ..
good,"Environnement de travail agréable, des avantages en nature."
good,"Global News Desk Editor at Yahoo (Paris and London) having spent almost five years creating digital content, managing brand content projects and working as a social media manager in a productive and fun workplace"
good,"Amazing place to work if you don't mind a lottery style management system. The coworkers and work place was amazing, at least when I worked there, but hey lay offs and cut backs can diminish a place. "
good,"7 years at Yahoo, met so many smart people that kept my desire to learn more going. Spent all my time writing software and automating complex processes."
good,"Tactical and strategic work available. But little career growth now "
good,"It's a good company to start the career. Lots of freebies. However, the morale is quite low since the company used to be No.1 in social media. It's feeling like a falling ship."
good,Great place to work. Many amenities available to employees. They make you as comfortable as they can while expecting you to work hard.
good,"It has been an incredible work experience."
good,"Flexible schedule that leads to a good work-life balance"
good,Yahoo! is a fun place to work at. The co-workers and leadership provide a great environment to grow and learn. the company is a complete survivor and things are getting better under Marissa's leadership.
good,It's a great company to work for that allows for a multitude of areas to development of any interest.
good,"Fun place to work, lot of learnings, good technical and people challenges, new scope and innovative environments."
good,"•a typical day at work : Good"
good,Great company to work for. Innovation is back and the company is moving forward fast.
good,Working for Yahoo for the past four years has been a wonderful opportunity to develop relationships with Yahoo employees internationally and to refine my technical troubleshooting and communication skills.
good,"During the seasonal position I worked, it was busy and exhausting, but was also a calm environment. I learned how to use UPS Worldship to print labels, how to weigh and pack items up, and also how the company runs. Management was well organized and eve helped with what was needed. The co-workers were rather friendly towards me, helping me when I asked. The hardest part of the job would be locating the items scattered about in the freezers. I mainly enjoyed typing on the computer and being responsible for printing the labels. "
good,"My work at Yahoo involves managing and optimizing Search Engine Marketing Campaigns for premium advertisers in the US and Global Marketplace."
good,Yahoo paid their employees well and had good perks. I would work there again in a heartbeat.
good,Rogers paid their employees well and treated everyone fairly.
good,Sunday.
good,"Yahoo is a great place to be at but like every effect has a side-effect, so is the situation at this internet giant."
good,"Yahoo at Champaign, IL is a great place to work for. I learned a lot about Cloud/Hadoop enviornment in the internet search marketing domain."
good,"Empresa de boa de se trabalhar, porem com estrutura exuta que sobrecarrega demais demais area da empresa."
good,"I joined in 2005 and it had a great energy - but over time it faded, and with each re-org most teams lost interest (and they're best people). Still a recognized name, but doesn't carry the weight it used to carry in Silicon Valley"
good,"It was a long process waiting for Yahoo to be sold.  "
good,"Was a great company, and offers great work-life balance. Work culture is fabulous, though the compensation structure left a lot to be desired. They could improve a lot."
good,"Good, solid technical work and tools to do it."
good,Started off as a dream job but slowly (over the course of 3 years) turned south with layoffs and incompetent middle management who seemed less concerned with core Yahoo goals and beliefs.
good,"I worked as a contractor at Yahoo, and only for the amopunt of time that Yahoo limits for contractors. "
good,Workplace with lot of opportunities to work on systems of large scale spanning several key areas. I had a chance to work with several intellectuals at this organization
good,"I was excited to have the chance to work for a high profile company such as Yahoo but I found the management to be poor and chaotic at times.....very disappointing , great IT staff. Impressive facility."
good,cool culture.. good benefits.. nice company to work with.. startup culture with all benefits of a big established company...you get the best of both the worlds.
good,"Yahoo offers many great benefits to full time employees such as gym memberships, insurance, phones and phone plans and also free food and drinks during our shift. It is a very casual relaxed type of work environment. The down side can be working odd hours, weekends and holidays. We are open 24 hours 7 days a week which can make it difficult to have time for family and outside activities depending on your shift. It is hard to advance unless you consider relocation."
good,"Most enjoyable part of the job was the people i worked with everyday. The overall work culture, and career advancement assistance."
good,"Great place to work"
good,i enjoyed those years; the environment is really good; the package is amazing; the only issue is the career progress.
good,"I actually loved  working  there. I wish they had stayed there for us , but  barely even  gave us notice when they left.They should have  gave us more time and opportunity."
good,Yahoo is a good place to work at with good intelligent people who have a good grasp on technology. All teams deal with large scale and volume that is parallel to other major companies in the same space.
good,"The work life is yahoo is very much balanced, not much stress. Lot of benefits for employees such as free food, cab, stocks option, insurance, gym etc.."
good,"My time at Yahoo coincided with the run-up to the Verizon acquistion.  Because of this, my organization's effort were much more focused on a short-term revenue push vs long-term strategic planning."
good,"I really liked working at Yahoo.  I left because there was absolutely no chance to advance. Also, Yahoo went through a rash of new CEO's and the company felt ""unstable.""  The benefits were good.  The pay was a little on the low side compared to other datacenters in the area."
good,"Soon Yahoo as an independent company will be no more. It was an awesome run but like all things great, they eventually come to an end."
good,"I gain lots of experience working in this company. It has a good culture and team work. The management seems to change more often due to company overall performance. But overall, it is a good experience."
good,Until management was in hands of expats it was phenomenal company. Later as more Indians took over SEA leadership and more sansopanja cropped up it literally destroyed the company. poor decisions and misreporting within leadership led to fall of this giant
good,"Working for Yahoo Studios has given me the ability to work with all of Yahoo's verticals including News, Sports, Finance, Style, Beauty, TV, and Movies. Being the assistant editor for all of these verticals I have acclimated with working with various media, workflows, and looks. With that comes the pressure to work with all of them in a professional and concise manner, and at times simultaneously. However the coworkers at Yahoo Studios make this pressure worth the effort."
good,"Yahoo! is a great company to work for.Great benefits and perks, the culture is awesome, and there's always lots to do.I would recommend this company to everyone!"
good,"The editor's desk made it possible for me to improve my writing skills, which has been invaluable."
good,"A typical Day @ Yahoo:"
good,Good company to work for - really take care of their employees. Good communication company wide - fun culture and work atmosphere.
good,"Yahoo! had a lot of very talented, interesting people working there when I was there. "
good,Great place to work especially for youngsters. The salary and benefits are the best in the business. However job stability is poor and the management is not very transparent.
good,"had a fun time. global environment, challenging work and good work life balance"
good,Flexible working environment
good,My day at Yahoo! Sports consisted of overseeing of guest content that was going over the air for our flagship Yahoo! Sports Radio 1560. Through out the day I would go out and cover our local teams practices and their games for both the network and locally.
good,"A typical day would be spending most of the day in production, working email cases (and sometimes phone calls). Another big chunk includes technical writing in drafting new content as well as editing existing content in our knowledgebase. Breaks and lunches are flexible as is scheduling in general. Unlimited internet access and no micro-managing. I'm treated as an adult who can get work done without being told what to do every step of the way. On-site coffee bar/cafeteria, combined with game and relaxation rooms make this place an easy one to get away on breaks/lunches."
good,"Easy job.  But, Yahoo was sold to Verizon and the culture is very different now.  The pay is average but benefits are incredible. Most associates are heavily micromanaged."
good,The Act Creative Solutions design team inside Yahoo! is incredible. If you are applying to work at Yahoo! and are a designer this is the team you should try to get on.
good,Enjoyed meeting and working with some of the coolest people in the Bay Area.  I am a contractor at Yahoo so technically they are my client.  I manage 12 large training rooms on campus and work closely with the Yahoo events team on internal events.
good,"I love the fact that every day at work is so distinct from the next — no two days look alike. I have grown in my writing, on-air and producing skills through this job."
good,Yahoo / Oath is a good company to work for. It has a good work culture compared to many other companies and also good perks such as free food. There's also a lot of growth opportunities.

good,"Great people , Great teams and a willingness to go the extra mile to help your fellow colleagues.   A tremendous amount of changes at the top of the org. that had to be worked through."
good,"Yahoo Music was a fun, fast-paced work environment with smart, dedicated people who worked well together. The company had several partnerships that allowed staff to collaborate on projects with other major entertainment and digital companies."
good,"Lot of talented people and lot of fun loving environment."
good,Yahoo's first data center built from the ground up had its Grand Opening in December of 2007 and I was a part of this wonderful occasion. It was a very family oriented company to work for but with a lot of management turn-over and growth changes it seemed to have lost focus on the family values. It was a great place to work nun-the-less. I loved the people I worked with and most of us (new and old) became very good friends.
good,.Need more active things to do can be boring and not attentive to work due to sitting behind the desk all day. But decent benefits and management team.
good,"a good place for new grad.student"
good,"Although Incident Management can be a very stressful position, this is neutralized by a great team atmosphere.  Co-workers are willing to lend a hand when in need."
good,The job itself was repetitive and unrewarding but the benefits were there to have you stay and they tried their best to make sure that you felt appreciated but that sentiment was not always there.
good,"good compensation, free food, flexible schedule, but also fast paced environment."
good,"The hardest part of the job is the company emphasis and forces the employees to have fun while working itself. Sometime, it becomes difficult. "
good,"Fun work place, learned alot about web interface, html languages, good co- workers, very good management"
good,"Good place to start career . "
good,"Learnt a lot about global products and teams, explored into business development and was given great responsibilities"
good,"This is the best job I have ever ha. Everyone had a specific role that they played and training was very efficient. Even though it was a cubicle job, Yahoo made sure that we took enough break and had all the free coffee we wanted to stay alert lol. My manager was always there to answer any questions and was very organized."
good,"Good company, I do enjoy the life there."
good,A great place for young minds to thrive. Management has persons whi vibed very well with millennials. There was a clarity on how to achieve targets and a whole lot of mentoring.
good,I really enjoyed the 5 years I worked in Yahoo. It is a fun place and the people working there had very good relations with each other. I like the culture there.
good,"Enjoyable place to work, lots of changes with the new executive staff.  They were very focused on being sure that everyone understood the goals of the company."
good,"Answered calls from customers w/ merchant accounts, sometimes from those expecting advanced coding assistance, set up new accounts, processing billing info"
good,"Everything's good but the company did not increase salary for 2 years. Usually start working at around 10am and can leave at around 5pm. Also, free food is a plus."
good,"Yahoo! is a web services provider, wholly owned by Verizon Communications through Oath Inc.[7][8] and headquartered in Sunnyvale, California. The original"

good,It's a fun place to work and awesome benefits including free food. Enjoyed working with talented people and work environment is competitive and fast paced.
good,Great work culture. You feel at home when you work there. The only problem is  the job security as you will be asked to leave out of the blue. But i anyways enjoyed working in Yahoo.
good,"Each day could be different than the last at Yahoo.  One day you are in sports production and the next you could be on a plane to DC intv. the president.  You're able to learn other positions.  Management is extremely fair and treat you like family.  Co-workers are the best in the industry.  Everyone gets along.  Hardest part of the job is not knowing if you'll have it in 6 months.  Most enjoyable part is all the perks of a full studio and connection to all the major events.  News, Tech, Sports or what ever."
good,"State of the art facility"
good,Work/Life balance leans much more on the Work side. Nearly everyone you work with is passionate about what they do and are supportive of each other. The people are what make the environment enjoyable.
good,"A typical day at work would involve productiveness, fun and family culture. It would involve having easy access to management, and working collaboratively with other teams."
good,"Many great benefits and perks, but still too big, too corporate, too hard to get things done. CEO is great but middle management layer is pretty bad."
good,"The culture is amazing and you won't find a better group to work with. However, there are always changes from upper management and our strategies and vision seems to constantly change."
good,"My typical day at Yahoo consists of assisting customers through different properties. I am cross trained in handling email accounts, mail tech, Flickr tech and billing. "
good,Yahoo provides most versatile experience and challenging projects at your desk. it helps you to think in direction to serve millions.

good,"Great benefits.  High paced environment.  Work from my inbox so there isn't a ""typical"" day.  Each quarter we have new goals to focus on that determine the companies priorities for the next 3 months."
good,Co-workers were friendly and helpful when needed. The morning snacks were helpful and unlimited drinks and snacks throughout the day helped.
good,"A typical day at work involves grabbing a freshly juiced vegetable/fruit drink and an omelet at URLs (Yahoo's onsite cafeteria), reviewing my tasks for the day, digging into email, reviewing the systems for required action/adjudication of pending background checks, taking a coffee break for a free caramel macchiato.  Next, I schedule calls with candidates whose background checks require additional information or further review and responding to requests for information from clients, stakeholders.  Off to URLs for free lunch with my co-workers and boss. Back to the office for meetings and/or more work.  Mid-afternoon I take a walk around the campus, usually a mile or mile and a half, then grab a quick healthy snack from the kitchen on my floor. Then it's back to work until the close of the business day.  I then head out to catch the free shuttle from Sunnyvale to San Francisco, at which time I might finish up work using the shuttle's wifi, listen to music, play games or watch a movie on my Kindle, or take a nice nap before getting home to my family."
good,SBC yahoo was a good place to work with good management and co-workers but shifts here were also abrupt.
good,"Nice place to work, you will learn a lot of things about how advertising work in Online Media and how online media will earn from advertising, search and social Media. Work life balance is awesome and have not faced any hardest day in the job."

good,"I enjoyed my time working for Yahoo, the benefits are great, the people you work with are great. I have no negative complaints or things to say about working there. I left only because I was laid off due to my job being eliminated in the States and outsourcing."
good,"I learned a lot about how the professionals work, and how to manage customers, also manage filing and data entry. However, I dont feel like there is a lot more to learn in the company."
good,"The Yahoo brands are a little more focused now over a year into life as part of the Oath family. People are driven, the culture is very positive and progressive, and I think they're really poised to do great things. I have and will continue to recommend it as an amazing place to work. Performers are rewarded, and promotion often comes from within. The scale and reach of the brands remain impressive, there are truly few like it. Many people forget that. Sometimes the size of the company made it hard to affect real change and things could move really slowly, but current leadership is committed to changing that part of the equation."
good,"talks a lot about their transformation and helping employees be their best. I'm pleased to see that they are really making an effort. From their focus on work/life balance and compensation, to their brand new workspaces - i couldn't be happier working here."
good,"I learnt a lot over the 7 years I spent at Yahoo."
good,"Great team chemistry and a positive culture created a family style environment. This allowed for more challenges and thirst for knowledge. As a team, we succeeded together, and failed together. I really enjoyed progressing individual's careers and building great relations with everyone there."
good,"This is a nice place to work in where it has a nice gym and that there has lots of tech talks that employees can learn a lot."
good,"I worked at Yahoo as a Software Engineer Intern II for more than 8 months."
good,Above title says it all.  What more does a person need if your basic needs to provide for your family are taken care of.  To much emphasis is placed on what can the company do for me and not enough on what you can do for the company.
good,"- Summer Internship here"
good,"Great offices, intelligent co-workers. Infrastructure to work with. With an good manager at the helm one should be able to learn considerable amount tech stuff in a year's time."

good,"• Responsible for the facilitation of testing software, using automated test kits"
good,The biggest perk I had in my previous company is the chance to work with the few brilliant people in the world. Our team esp had the start up attitude which all of us enjoyed. Th work I did was very critical to the project which made me feel special. The hardest part of the job was work-life balance :)
good,"I loved my time at Yahoo.  The people and culture were amazing.  Unfortunately, there was a lot of turnover and publicity.  If I didn't receive an amazing opportunity, I would have stayed at Yahoo."
good,與同事們一起完成各種專題，尋找各種資料，互相分享新奇資訊，盡各種力量，協力完成直播節目內容，真心感受大眾傳播帶給人們的魅力。

good,Overall it is a great place to work at. The culture is exciting and felt unified. The overall leadership has changed considerably. More recognition is needed for the lower level workers.
good,I have never before worked in a company that has offered me the security that Yahoo has. The work/life balance is also excellent...I cannot remember a single day where I worked overtime. This company really cares about its people
good,"I really enjoyed working for Yahoo! All though I was a contract employee who worked a temporary job, I was treated like a FT employee the whole time.

good,Yahoo! has good benefits and work/life balance for employees.
good,My job consisted of answering over 120 phone calls a day to solve our clients Internet needs. Clients used us to advertise their products on-line and it was our responsibility to maintain their webpage up to date. The hardest part of the job was the high volume of phonecall received daily.
good,"Yahoo was one of the best places to work, people called it as their second home due to the best  work culture, fun at work, work/life balance and comp/benefits, but everything changed after Verizon Acquisition, they destroyed the Yahoo work culture."
good,"A typical day at Yahoo! would be to address client email inquiries, schedule or attend client calls &  research growth opportunities. Management was constantly changing due to our changes in CEOs over the years but the managers I worked under were mentors and peers. The hardest part of the job was the ratio of clients/agencies per person. We were given large books of business with promises of getting additional headcount that took months before there was reprieve. The most enjoyable things at Yahoo! were your colleagues and the positive company culture."

good,Great culture with plenty of opportunity for advancement. High stressful sales environment. Excellent benefits. Would recommend employment to friends and family.
good,"Yahoo is a great tech company to work for because it doesn't take itself too seriously. It likely depends on what manager you have but I was lucky enough to get the best manager there was who truly cared about me, my career, and what I was interested in."
good,I worked at Yahoo for 12 years. The people are amazing and the benefits are top notch. There are a few issues with departments not working together (sales/engineering) but I hope this gets streamlined with the acquisition by Verizon.
good,"Very good place to learn and have fun with ping pong. I mean seriously, I liked the work culture at Yahoo and employees are treated really well. Lot of good Engineers who are talented and provide innovative ideas, truly motivated, lots of fun with games and flexible work timings.

good,"Yahoo was a good company wherein there was a lot of focus to ensure Employee engagement and comfort. It's a flat structure that enables and encourages growth and learning. "
good,It is a very friendly work atmosphere and everyone is very helpful. I strongly suggest students interning here as they can learn about every detail should pay attention to as a good UX designer. The manager will be very helpful on your development.

good,"Being one of the pioneers of the web, it still has that charm in it. The quality of work and work-life balance is extremely good."

good,The workplace is full of challenges that keep you in engaged.
good,"I do not work in an office but online. I submit articles as often as possible on the Knicks and Jets.  The hardest part is formulating ideas into something that hasn't already been produced by other journalism platforms.  Also, not having access to quotes unless taking them from somewhere else is difficult. Management is helpful anytime something is needed and answer your inquiries within an acceptable amount of time. I thoroughly enjoy being able to display my opinion on a platform with the potential for it to be read by many."
good,Working for Yahoo! during this time was such an honor and an experience I will never forget. I didn't stay with Yahoo! because I wanted to get back into my recruiting career. I struggled with that because I did learn a lot about customer service and how Yahoo! cares about their employees. They let them thrive with their own ideas and gave tremendous support to their customers and employee's. Not to mention they had fun recognition parties letting their employee's know that they appreciate and recognize how hard they work.
good,"-Look for topics on site and pick what I want to write about"
good,"Yahoo is a great company to work for. The salary is fair, the poeple and management are great as well.

Very fun group to work with, very knowledgeable about their job and how changes in their job can affect yours. We continually seem to run short staffed."
good,"I wake up and see what the news is in either the sports or video games world. If I see anything that I can make an article out of, then I take a few hours to write my article. Once the article is published, I put the link on various social networking websites. I am learning how to write relevant, long-lasting, and interesting articles. I am learning this because those types of articles are they only ones available for up-front pay. The most enjoyable part of the job is that I get to write and see my work published on Yahoo!.

The best part of the ride was the ability to take advantage of the autonomy and carve out your own niche to help the team. There was always someone who needed my help. The hardest part was obviously prioritizing and the most enjoyable part was also helping people get their work done, knowing that my purpose was to help others and to make their experience at Yahoo! a good one and to make their day run a little smoother."

good,"Everyone was very professional and friendly. The best part of the job is when you were able to fix a customer's Yahoo! Mail account. I sat at a desk most of the day, but when we needed to we could take a walk on the path on the grounds. Managers where very involved with the employee's, and would sit at a desk with us."
good,"Yahoo is a fantastic place to work for many reasons. The company has a tech culture (read: ping pong tables, coffee bars, open office environment), excellent compensation/benefits packages and a great focus on work/life balance.

A typical day at work included communicating with CFO and COO on daily tasks that needed to be done for the week. Included inserting sales orders, creating sales proposals and other tasks required of me. I learned that I was able to be able to leave my comfort zone in order to complete tasks in radio that I was not diversified in. The management that was above me helped me out constantly to keep me encouraged to help finished tasks that may have been a larger obstacle than normal due to the lack of knowledge of radio lingo. The hardest part of my job was understanding the different terminology in which radio had compared to other office environments. My co-workers were great to have around keeping me motivated to come to work daily to enjoy being there. The most enjoyable part of the job was just being able to be around the different entities that went into being a sports radio station, from sales, to office administrative work, to radio trafficking."

good,"Data la tipologia del mio lavoro, la mia giornata non ha una sua tipicità specifica se non nell'offrire l'assistenza necessaria agli utenti locali o a quelli delle nostre altre sedi. La sua peculiarità mi porta ad interloquire con tutti quanti indipendentemente dalle funzioni lavorative. Partecipando a gruppi di lavoro internazionale mi occupo anche delle necessità locali legate a progetti globali quando necessario. Fungo da punto di contatti locale per quelle realtà che non sono rappresentate. La parte più piacevole del mio lavoro coincide con quella che maggiormente lo rende difficile, il continuo contatto diretto col cliente. Ciò, se da un lato lo rende interessante e differente, dall'altro lo rende anche causa di stress, soprattutto in particolari periodi."

There was always work to be done, but the time seems to fly by.  I learned how to use Red Hat and FreeBSD, and how to configure switches and routers.  My direct manager was awesome, he was a very task orientated person so, you better have your tickets worked on and updated.  But, if there was a major issue, he would have your back no questions asked.  The thing I miss most about working for Yahoo, is working with some of the smartest and most influential people in the industry."

good,"The best place I've worked so far. I feel very fortunate to have had the opportunity to gain some great experience from a tech standpoint and also to have worked with some very competent people. Everyone there seemed on top of their game, and the culture was great. The work was challenging but rewarding. I'm sure the experience varies depending on the group you are in, but I worked in two separate teams during my time there and have a positive impression of both. You do need to perform and push yourself, there are high expectations but not unreasonably so I think. One thing I am realizing now is that because a lot of Yahoo tech is built in house and run on premises you may not be able to put a lot of sought after keywords on your resume after you decide to move on.  A minor gripe however, overall it was a very positive experience."
