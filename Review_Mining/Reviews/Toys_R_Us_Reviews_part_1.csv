rating,review
bad,Over worked. Under paid. Busy hours with no breaks.  Management was bad. A lot of theft going on.  Dirty store. Bad reviews from customers. Employees always coming and going.
bad,"Manager was a complete bar steward. Nasty, horrible, cruel, vicious, hateful woman who would bad mouth disabled employees for laughs. Hopefully she's dying slowly of something chronic and painful."
bad,This job was extremely toxic. The managers didn’t know how to talk to people. Your co-workers aren’t ever willing to help when needed. I wouldn’t suggest anyone take this job.
bad,"Very poor management... rude and I professional. Many times left to fend for yourself! Promise hours then not put on schedule, and many times left with no breaks"
bad,They don't pay well and expect you to work long hours. You only get 1break during the duration of your shift. The hours aren't ever the same in your schedule which messes with your work/family life. It could be a much better place if they tried a little
bad,I had the worst experience at Toys R Us this season. The management team is not organized and if they are in a made mood get prepared for attitude. They get you to do a lot of switch shifts and want you to come in on your day off last notice. If you accidentally miss a shift they expect you to make up for it.  Never again will I work for them !
bad,"1) worse job ever"
bad,"I was so excited when I first got this job as it was part time, seasonal, and I can work it on my days off from my main job. However, I didn't even last long. We had about 2 hours of training which most of it was just the training talking down about the company and then thrown onto the floor. I was lucky if i got 1 shift a week and would try to pick up shifts when I needed. I was yelled at by management in front of customers and treated like garbage. The management wanted me to prioritize my 1 shift a week over my main job and I would get treated like garbage if I gave away a shift. Please don't even apply here if you want to keep your sanity."
bad,"co-workers would not talk to me, too much stock and little shelve space. manager was bad at her job explain. Managers didn't do much. they criticized my work while they didn't do anything the whole night"
bad,I wont tell nobody to work there poor of everything . And manager  don't do they  job right. Managers got favorite... and some don't what they want to
bad,the Coquitlam  location is a gong show management was manipulative and used there platform to intimidate staff. HR didn't ever try to resolve situations they would just side with management.
bad,"Boring and sluggish"
bad,Manager's picks favourite. I barly even talk to the management. Whenever I need help with something they never actually came so I always had to get someone else to call the managers over even after that they always had a very rude attitude towards me.
bad,This place was a less than satisfactory. The hours were all over the place. My pay plus my hours worked were not reflected when payday came around. I do not recommend working here ever.
bad,To much work not enough pay staff not problem solvers breaks to short stores not organized uniforms not provided and equipment none existent cant do it
bad,"Too much to be said, so I’ll just say with the way they were happy with being ignorant was the way that destroyed them. It’s exactly how you do not run a business, and as an example they’re no longer in business in the states."
bad,"Manager was highly immature, very verbally abusive behind the backs of other employees , expected you to be on call when you were not scheduled to work, and expected you to do her duties as manager."
bad,"store is now shut down, days were busy, management did not care about its employees, workplace was very dirty and cluttered. the hardest part was the long lines and long days"
bad,Very busy Xmas time Black Friday open 24 hrs expect to be on your feet constantly. Managers expect too much. Store is closed only time busy was holidays
bad,"The store manger gave preferential treatment to their friends and give other very low hours or leeway. No matter how hard you work it did not matter, it only matter if you can be buddy buddy with them"
bad,Well I worked at toys r us and the management team I had was not a great team.She was constantly taking vacation to get paid for not working.and even when the store was closing she continued to take her vacations I was a store manager and corporate basically made me run the store myself through the liquidation.
bad,hours kept getting cut and they kept on adding more and more work to your load.  pay was horrible and they would only retain the laziest people they could find.
bad,"bag managers. managers did not care, so i in turn did not care. worked for a few months during the holidays. employees stole stuff and also did not care."
bad,"I would not recommend this company. I was with them for 3 years. In that time i saw a lot and experienced a lot. In the beginning I had some very immature managers that i worked with, that if they didn't like you would only put you on the work schedule every 'other' week only for 4.5 hours. How can someone live off that as a part timer? Eventually they switched managers and I started getting more hours and it took a while but eventually i rose through the ranks. It was hard for workers to get promotions at work, even if you had good work ethic. They put a lot of pressure on staff to make the company money but did not want to pay the staff decent wages that would match the cost of living. They were willing to lose good workers by not compensating them accordingly to their work performance."
bad,"Management was terrible, hours were abysmal, and there was no sense of camaraderie or friendship between the employees. Management praised credit card sales, but only ever had same 4 people on register. No wonder company went down."
bad,Was my first job ever and was not at all what I was expecting. This job was an experience that I won’t forget. Terrible environment and management were not at all helpful.
bad,"the company has closed down due to lack of cleanliness, sanitattion and sells. the company wasnt that good overall it was a nice exoerience but oh well they are gone now"
bad,Toys r us is no more great for high school kids while it lasted but unfortunately it didnt. pay sucked and advancement for me sucked as well left for something better
bad,Toy R Us was a great place to work for. The benefits was great and the company was very family originated. Employees receive paid vacation and time off from work. The only reason for leaving Toys R Us was because the company went of business.
bad,"stressful bad management a lot mess, not enough employee double work to do enjoy working with people interact with them and provide a great customer service"
bad,Company no longer exists due to going into receivership.  The business closed down in 2018 due to decline in sales. Management was pretty average. Most enjoyable part is the news toys
bad,This is a good filler if needed to gain extra christmas money. They are no longer in business. Fun to see all the new toys come in and to see the childs face as they get to see and play with them.
bad,"I started working with Toys R Us right before black friday. They threw me in with basically no training and put me on a register. The fired me without notice, I only found out once I got to work and couldn't sign in."
bad,"Toys r us is the worst job. I never got called into work, I got paid nothing until I fought for my check and management just walked around not doing anything. The other employes were always eating and doing nothing. They never cleaned and even had roaches under registers. Got mad when I tried to sweep up."
bad,"Mala experiencia tanto con las  dos encargadas como con la jefa  , a parte de feas malas y envidiosas eran maleducadas."
bad,They are no longer in business. If they ever reopen I hope they rebuild their management structure and put a focus on front line help and less on cosmetic improvements.
bad,this job was okay but it didnt last that long. the time i stead there it was okay but it wasnt the best. the customer were very rude and so was the managers.
bad,This company is no longer operational so a review is of no help. It was not a good place to work with no set or regular hours and no part time or full time contracts available except for management.
bad,"All the managers there were on a power trip except for my BOH supervisor, he was amazing. Not enough pay. No severence, no benefits, no pto, not many enforced safety standards, no communication between shifts, just kinda guessed what happened and what needed to be done, idiot managers wanting heavy cardoard bundles on the top of shelves instead of light boxes"
bad,This company is no longer opened and is not operational.  During the time that I worked there I made a lot of friends and it also opens your eyes to a whole new world in retail
bad,"horrible empresa, te explotan, literal.totalmente te exolotan"
bad,"The company went  bankrupt in 2018, there's not much to say."
bad,Company filed bankruptcy but still have to upload a review to continue updating indeed profile. Hopefully this is useful to someone. Not sure what else to say.
bad,"The company shut down, so a review would be kind of pointless. It was a distribution center. Pretty fast paced and temporary for seasonal work. Not much else to say."
bad,No comment. I worked and went home. No room for advancement. Went out of business. I was treated fairly for the most part. I have nothing more to say. Didn't work for them very long due to them filing bankrupt.
bad,My job always consisted on different hours all the time.  I would never know i I was going to get my 20 hours per week.  They never wanted to give me extra hours.  There were no benefits.
bad,Management was never available fr any concerns with employees or customers except one and she quit due to over working and no time with kids then another manager quit and one gt fired the store was a mess
bad,"What is there more to say about this store? There's a reason it went out of business."
bad,"Loved working for the company but the companies upper tear let us down,  It's obvious that after working for the company for many years they didn't care about the employees.  Finally Bankruptcy with no severance package.  I did hang in there until the end for the customers I loved serving."
bad,It was a fun and relaxed work environment with bosses who actually cared about their employees and would switch jobs around so everyone always had something to do. Sucks they shut down
bad,"while worked there I enjoy going to work every day. it was a fun place to and worked. I enjoyed helping customers with there purchases. also,enjoyed the excitements and smiles on kids faces when they would arrive at toys r us"
bad,"took peoples orders, answered question, handle cash, process orders, and manger people break and time cards. found and located hard to find orders and managed returns"
bad,typical day of work was unloading the trucks seperating the products for particular parts of the store then moving them there an stocking the shelves properly. You Would then have to break down the boxes and throw them away to keep the isles clear before the doors opened in the morning. Overall enjoyed the job until they closed down the stores.
bad,"Management took advantage of seasonal workers, giving them the worst jobs with impossible standards and deadlines, was scheduled 18 hours for black friday."
bad,"I was so glad to see this place closed down. Management was godawful, and cursing out the high-school aged employees was a common occurrence, regardless of if there were customers within earshot or not. When he wasn't eyeing underaged girls, the regional manager was screaming at employees who doing their best with what they could under his poor management."
bad,"Estuve trabajando en el almacén de Alcala de henares, un encargado cuyo nombre no quiero decir por aquí, daba mal trato a sus trabajadores (la mayoría inmigrantes por cierto), mal ambiente y mal trato y ademas parecía que estabas dentro de una prisión ya que tanto para entrar y salir te hacen un control no recomiendo a nadie aceptar este puesto de trabajo si no os queréis sentir pisoteados, a mi me llamaron para una campaña de navidad"
bad,"Manager was wonderful to work with and so were the employee. Most of the employees were part-time and went to college.  The work place was very friendly. If it had not closed, I would have recommended it to everyone."
bad,Bad work hours. No money . Could not have facial hair for some reason. Tried to get me to stay late everyday. Unpaid over time which I feel should be illegal
bad,"I felt like I worked at a sweatshop. No directions, no goals it was very disorganized. I didn't know what to do half the time and everyone was just so busy to give direction so I'd always ask an elder or hoped to help customers. I learned that when you work in a facility that operates on fumes you will never get far. They eventually ""lost"" my roster and I couldn't work somewhere that they didn't have me on file anymore. I'm pretty sure computers were a thing so I don't get the issue."
bad,"Hours were flexible, nice amount of time for lunch or a break, friendly co workers, offered overtime when needed. "
bad,"Toys R Us had the potential to be a major contender in the toy industry. However, low wages and low employee morale made it a not so good place to work. Billions of dollars were squandered by corporate executives who were more interested in lining their pockets than approving pay increases for their staff. Overall, many of us as employees felt cheated when they liquidated their stores. We have lost money from earned time that was owed to us. Many of us had 10 or more years of service with very little to show in return."
bad,"Management was awful, they cared about one thing and that was their sales. no concern was shown towards the employees and most of the time even customers faced the attitudes of the management."
bad,I was a 16 year old high school student who applied for a seasonal part time position but often was required to come in and work for 40+ hours per week. All managers and supervisors clearly did not like their job and it showed.  Hard to get in touch with management and you are forced to stand in one spot for your entire shift 8-10 hours sometimes without chances to sit other than a 30 min lunch and a 15 min break. Would not recommend.
bad,"I worked nearly full time hours as a part time employee. a full time position was dangled in front of me for about a year before I finally left for a better job."
bad,"Worked graveyard shift for 2 months, 8 hours or 10 hours 4 days a week. After missing 3 days of work due to a miscarriage i was fired that day i went back. Had no idea i was pregnant at the time."
bad,I worked part-time stocking shelves and assisting customers on the floor whenever they required help and internal store wide directions to wherever they wanted to go.  Toys R Us went out of business.
bad,"Toys r us was not a good company to work for. Pore management. The company is now out of business. So writing a review is pointless"
bad,"Company was not worth working for, terrible conditions. bosses were very immature when it came to staff members. everything shipped into the store was basically damaged so we were constantly reducing prices. We were promised a severance package prior to the store closing, and were told if we help pack up the store wed receive extra pay in which we did not."
bad,"great company..... would still work there,,,,, amazing..... let's go to work"
bad,The chain has closed down therefore i would not recommend for employment. The work was not rewarding and there was minimum room for promotion. Hours were inconsistent
bad,"Nothing left to say. Company went under due to its own ignorance, Executives should have thought about what they were doing n the first place.Now they lost everything"
bad,"help customers find stuff played with toys, cashed out people handled money stocked shelves swept and mopped floors counted money counted inventory anwsered phones"
bad,Wokled morning crew filling shelves and customer service the rest of the day. Hardest part of the job is that the company closed. So sad that there will never be a toy store for the younger children
bad,this company closed down and they are permanently closed and it was for seasonal help and the they are not open any more they di not pay there back taxes that is why there closed
bad,It is always sad to see people lose their jobs and companies close. But sometimes it is a move that is easily understood. This company had poor management that started at the top and went to the very core of this company.
bad,For me it was the worst Job of my whole life. I did not like it at all.
bad,Terrible company that ran this brand into the ground. The ceo and management sent the company into the ground through advisory fees and debt. They treated the employees very bad. Management lied to me about my transfer and vacation at the end.
bad,working at tru was fun i loved helping the customers and i got promoted to upc specialist but then they did away with the postion so i got put on as maintence which wasnt bad
bad,"This company is closed now I cant work for it and no body else can either, it was kinda fun while it lasted but it got rather lame on a count of management mistreating you once they had you on the clock."
bad,"Good job until they went out of business and left us with nothing. Very disappointed in the company. Over 30,000 employees left with nothing to fall back on."
bad,I would never recommend this place to shop or work at. The pay was awful the work was hard. the bathrooms were not ok. The company was run by crooks and no one cared about the employees.
bad,A regular night shift consist of us unloading a full truck or two of toy boxes.  unbox toys and place them on shelfs and racks. Best part was the music that played at night time.
bad,"I loved being able to work with family's. However the management team was not professional, the environment was unsafe and nothing got taken care of properly. The communication between management, HR and the crew was all over the place you never knew who to go to if you had a problem half the time you just never told anyone."
bad,"Not applicable as the company no longer exists, the company is no longer available, its gone for good and hopefully stays that way, it was horrible and management was terrible"
bad,It sucked and i learned nothing and the manager was barely around and the place was disorangized and the job wasnt hard at all and the enjoyable part was leaving.
bad,This is no longer a company to have a career at. The company went bankrupt. Even if they were still an active company I would NEVER suggest anyone work there as they do not care about their employees or customers at all.
bad,Worked for 3 months here and quickly realized after the christmas season there was very little work. Expect to work long days during season 12+ hoyurs 5-7 days in a row and then get 2 days scheduled at 4-6 hours each
bad,I found toys r us to be a letdown. It's team and management was so scrambled and unhelpful for new hires. It didn't help me grow in the workforce. It was not a good job.
bad,Going to toys to help them close there doors started off great turned into a nightmare. The other employees made some of the Babies R Us ppl feel left out or just unwanted there made for uncomfortable shifts.
bad,Mismanagement from the top. Low inventory. Meetings that went no where. 800 service the worse... Bankruptcy planned year before announced to workers blindsiding everyone
bad,It was honestly one of the worse places that I have worked and it required a lot of attention and work for such little play.  would not reccomend to anyone
bad,Toys R Us was an extremely poorly run company. There were constant issues from not getting merchandise to getting to much merchandise. Store was dirty and old and was never in the plans for any type of renovations.
bad,"Moot point, since the company no longer exists, but, like many retail businesses, the experience all depends on the people with whom you work.  Our location had an awesome team, a great manager, and basically felt as ""un-retail"" as possible."
bad,There would be weeks where  I’d work up to 35 hours and there’d be months we’re I’d be scheduled 4 hours a week. It was unfair and they made me push poor people into getting credit cards. It was a horrible working environment and over-priced for no reason.
bad,Managed overnight shift of employees who stocked the shelves.  Corrected the entire warehouse inventory count to properly assist customers with any product stock inquiries.  Helped achieved best quarterly loss prevention in the Northeast for the store.
bad,"Prior to Toys R us going out of business a typical day for me was to Process ship from store orders, RGD, directs, and assist with unloading trucks and replenishing product on the floor"
bad,"possibly one of the worst places I ever worked, threats made by customers if they did not get what they wanted, swore at by management if you done something wrong instead of giving you constructive feedback."
bad,Toy R Us was a job were you have to help out customers tell them  were things are located around the store.You also have to get rewards and credit cards.
bad,I had trouble from the first day I started here. Management was horrid. They didn’t pay well. I would give them my school schedule 3 months in advance and they wouldn’t follow it.
bad,"I loved working for toys r us, but i felt I was doing a job of a manager, but got paid as a regular cashier. I loved helping the customers, but dealt with issues that a manager should have dealt with."
bad,The managers were very unprofessional I felt that everyone was getting better hour's it was a lot of favoritism going on and in a way that was not fair
bad,Terrible. Expected to work unpaid overtime on every shift. Asked for 1 day off with 3 weeks notice and this was not taken well. Work was very boring. Only positive is you learn to bite your tongue working with difficult people.
bad,They did not exactly have their stuff together and were not the best people. If you were not their friend you did not get treated fairly with hours or job duties.
bad,Toys R us was not a very good place to work.  No advancement opportunities. This was a job from a a very long time ago.  I can't remember too many details.
bad,This company doesn't care about employees or it's customer. They only care about selling their store credit cards. Their management just sits in their office eating chocolates and not managing their store.
bad,"This place was awful to work. Incompetent managers and it shows because they are no longer in business. If the managers were any indication of how the whole company was run, it's no wonder that they went out of business."
bad,"Glad this location went out of business, sad i lost my job in the cross fire. Bad management. Rude supervisors. Most of the time, the supervisors were unorganized and made things very stressful"
bad,"horrible work environment with awful pay, and worse management."
bad,Always got shouted at even when i was asking for help. No other staff really helps you on tills when it’s busy. Very very very long hours. Managers are terrible!
bad,"there's nothing to say. the entire company is liquidating. a few years ago, the company was a decent place to work but that changed last summer when there was a store level restructuring."
bad,This company is bankrupt and going out of business.  There will be no company left to evaluate.  It used to be a fun place to work.  Now the locations are near closing and not much is left of the company.
bad,don’t work here. i am happy they fired me for giving my employee discount to my grandmother. they also lost my check of $342 while i was homeless. they don’t care for their employees.
bad,Last i checked toys r us closed down due to the fact that amazon was beating them at there own game 3 to 1 it was actually pretty funny working there though i witnessed people stealing consistently along with a high turnover rate with everyone working there
bad,They are closed already so I mean theres nothing to write about them. they were a company just to help pay for my bills and while I was going to school
bad,I start work very early and what management promised never happened. I was doing work that a graduate would have done and never got paid for it. I was also promised to further studies in the law society
bad,"This is the worse company that I have ever worked for! Management is abusive and do not care about employees. From the district managers, to the location managers. There is no team work, so much gossip, and people fighting each other. Employee takes months to even research and try to resolve employee issues. I say management was the worse. The abuse in this company is unfair and unjust. They abuse the minor working laws and regulations and do not care. This is just from one store location in Kendall Florida. Do Not Apply to this store ever."
bad,Had fun working their people are nice learned alot fast paced and flexible hours unloaded semi trailers and stocked shelves and directed people to merchindise
bad,They were always short staffed. Always made to work as if you were 3 people in one. Management would always be in there office. Not walking around and helping customers. The pay was minimum wage. Just the worse place to work
bad,"store managers were required to work 85-90 fixed hours over 7 days a week from November to Jan.  Also, District manager constantly cussed on the sales floor at team members and managers"
bad,it was horrible working there the managers were so rude and they were horrible and the work environment was very hostile and it made me very anxious all the time
bad,Toys r us is currently out of business so i would not recommend that someone start to work here.  Toys r us screwed over all theyre current employees.
bad,"It was a never ended nightmare of screaming children and mangers. You had to work extremely long hours while the mangers sat around doing absolutely nothing, The store would get stolen from by customers despite security yet our bags had to be checked before we got to go home from a long shift!"
bad,It really wasn't a job that i would keep it was just a job for Christmas break that was all I don't think they pay fairly at all......................
bad,"The company is defunct, and I would appreciate it if Indeed would stop wasting my time asking me about a company that is no longer in business. Seriously; give us the option to skip this nonsense."
bad,All pto went away as well as employee discounts. You can't call out for family medical emergencies/ funerals without attitudes from management. You're also often  forced to stay hours after your scheduled time off.
bad,"Poorly managed "
bad,Toys r us is going out of business. When I worked there it was a good company. Had great training and career advancement opportunities. Sad to see it go as that is where i started my career.
bad,Bad management not a good place to work they do not pay enough unsafe work equipment forklifts real ragley they do not fix them on the regular they do not pay what they supposed to
bad,They are very unorganized and you can never find a manager. They sell broken items to customers. They didn’t have a schedule. They lie about uniforms.
bad,Company liquidated and now is with the courts for Bankruptcy. Enjoyed my 20 year tenure but unfortunately the time has come to pursue new opportunities.
bad,Upper management did not learn the processes and was a not a team player. The employee did not trust them. The morale was very poor. No one could be trusted.
bad,"Sadly Closing so do not work here. Was a good company to work for unfortunately we cannot control what the higher ups choose, so when it went out of business this makes it a bad place to work. Because it wont exist."
bad,"Company is having financial difficulties  Very stressful everyday. Senior executives really miss-managed the entire operation and blamed the issues on all the store teams. It was, at one time, a great place to work, until the current management took over."
bad,"I was over worked and yelled at frequently. Management does not train you, they expect you to figure it out on your own. Then when you ask other associates for help that associate and yourself get in trouble. This job terrorized me, and I truly have thick skin. Every day I went to work was like being in an abusive relationship."
bad,"At my particular store, management sits in the office and does nothing for the majority of the day. They let shoplifters walk out the store with out calling metro first (even though they know they are repeat offenders). Cooperate controls the air (they keep the store freezing), however you are not allowed to wear a jacket (of any color) unless you pay for a particular one from the Babies R Us company. They do not work with your hours at all and if you are unable to do full weekends, your employment with them will change. Favoritism plays a huge part in how this particular store runs and there is absolutely no room for advancements."
bad,"You are expected to do more than you are hired to do. Don't do more than your job description, you won't gain extra money or any special title. They will make you work more, the most you will gain from doing more than you're required is to get more hours, which leads to more money. Fun part about the job is the kids, a learning new things."
bad,As a former employee I can honestly say Babies R Us does not care for their employees.  Stores close all the time.  I understand that.  However they told their employees they would receive severance packages and a bonus if they stayed till the last day when the store closes.  It was a complete lie.  They decided they are NOT doing anything they promised.  We won't receive our vacation pay.  Something we already earned. And to find out not only are we losing our jobs we are losing what we should be entitled too.  I'm sorry but if a company has to lie to employees to get them to stay and work for them .... obviously they are NOT a good company to work for.  Especially with how low the pay is.  You can make more money working fast food then you can with Babies R Us.
bad,"I had a bad experience while working there, a member of staff was continously horrible to me through my employment and bullied me into eventually quitting. The managers gave no support and offered no help when it was most needed."
bad,its a good first job for a teenager or a side job for an adult. it is not a career. Hourly wage is not enough to support a family or a lifestyle. Many better jobs out there.
bad,"Stay Away they won't be around much longer. Every few years they extend their bankruptcy due to how high their debt is to collectors."
bad,"""It is a fun and fast paced environment to work in. Always something to be done: training, coaching, customer service, anagrams, in stocks, truck processing, etc... I love it! I think it is decent pay and is comparable to other companies like Best Buy and Walmart."""
bad,"Upper management is awful, The DM never respects time off.  You have set days off that the District Manager has no respect for, you will get constant calls and texts during these days wanting to know if your store has enough credit card signups.  Favoritism is ridiculous, no consistency, everything is the end of the world.  The best time is during Christmas because you are so busy that the District Manager doesn't have time to harass you.  District Managers will lie and change stories to support what ever issue they want to create."
bad,Was an ASM in a high volume location.   Hours were terrible.  You never got out on time.  Constant turnover due to awful pay for associates.  ASM pay was low due to it being salaried so you got worked to death.  Store AC always broken so it was beyond hot all the time.  If you did not sell enough BBP's  (replacement plans) the Director would encourage you to buy them to keep the numbers up.   Unless you absolutely love children work elsewhere.  Working there will make you want to be childless.
bad,Management was terrible and communication was even worse.  Pay did not equal the work that was required of us.  Only positive they worked around school schedule.  Morale was terrible and turnover rate at job was just as bad.
bad,Worse company i have ever worked for they dont train anyone for what position they ask them to do. Then they write up those who are not properly trained. When you ask for training they tell you figure it out by yourself! Worst job i have ever had
bad,I really dont have anything positive to say. The place was hot in the summer and cold in the winter. I was underpaid and over worked. The management sucked.
bad,"was full time worker and college student and they did help work around my schedule to accommodate my education, did get paid for they work, worked 40-42 hours a week and only made minimum wage."
bad,"Toys 'R' Us was not a good experience for me. I worked there in order to earn some Christmas money that I could spend on my family members and friends. Overall, the management made my experience horrid and I would not recommend this job to a friend."
bad,Management act like they dont care about your training act like kids and mess around way to much..and management is too strict on new employees for no reason
bad,"outdated equipment,no security staff,improper training from managers, interpersonal communication unprofessional. During busy month December was hectic, communication issues within co-workers,managers. hand held device was ineffective kept breaking down."
bad,"They were very inconsistent, never kept their word, management would contradict each other, hours were inconsistent, no perks, bonus, or benefits. company did not care about workers, pay was extremely low even for those who worked their for years!"
bad,cashier cleaning sales floor and making sure the toys are stocked back up in shevles it was an easy job but not a long term job to stay at for the long haul
bad,They wouldn't work with me to save my life. Not only is the pay horrendous but the management is just awful. I never got any hours from start and they wouldnt work with my schedule. When i quit it took nearly a year to get my checks from them...
bad,It was a basic retail job that included basic retail duties. The location I worked at went out of business toward the end of 2017. There is no other store of the same type in the area.
bad,"The management has it's favorites and is not professional.  Work load is pushed on a small number of employees while others get away with doing nothing!  The pay is not good for an adult but for a younger person, they can get by."
bad,"This job was by far the worse, you had to do so much but got paid so little. The expect you to bend your back for more than 1 department and still only get little pay"
bad,"all employees do is gossip, cut eat others throat. unprofessional. they don't pay you what they offer. it took them 4 months to fix my pay and that is unacceptable for a head of household."
bad,"Rude management, bad hours. Never got breaks after 4/5 hours of work. Worked an 8 hours shift to have a break 10 minutes before my shift was over. Other hires with me didn’t do their jobs. Lazy job. Annoying workers."
bad,"They over work you with very minimal pay, as too having poor/unprofessional management. From having customers scream at you to co workers starting up drama. Very unprofessional"
bad,"As a salaried manager, I was amazed to see what the hourly breakdown was of my pay, especially through the holiday season! I was actually making less per hour than my stockroom associates! It was fun to be on the ""frontlines"" of new toy releases and being on top of that kind of thing. My particular general and assistant general managers had personal issues, including an extramarital affair within the store that made for a particular uneasy work environment."
bad,"Not a good environment to work "
bad,Was told when I was hired I would get 20 hours a week until Thanksgiving then all the hours I could handle plus overtime til end of Dec.  I only had one paycheck with 31 hours total for 2 week pay period. Most of the time I ended upnwith 18 hours or less per pay period.They gave the hours to the school kids and the adults who needed the work were given half  what the school kids were getting.  Management only cared about getting credit card applications and making money. They don't care about employees nor do they listen to them. Management finds excuses as to why they can't follow thru with price match for customers such as it's out of stock locally so they don'thave to price match the competitors sales price. Also sale prices were never right. The items would be marked at a low price on shelf but ring up regular price when customer got to checkout. If they weren't paying attention at checkout they would end up paying more than they should have.  And if we said anything to management they would get snotty to customers who caught on to the nonsale price when they had to give the discount at the register. They offer no military discounts. Management has no idea of promotions that are being offered and cashiers are not given notice of sales or promotions that are going on in store as they dont have any sales flyers to look at most of the time . They dont tell you when your job ends you just dont get an email for the following weeks  work schedual and thats when you know your job ended even though you asked the day before and were told you would be working and they would give you
bad,Toys R Us is a decent place to work if you are in school but other than that i would not suggest it to anyone looking for a decent and well paying job.
bad,Job doesn't pay and the current work enviornment is hostile and stressful. Toys R Us 's main focus is on metrics and sales not with mentoring and coaching their team members. Current management is insensitive and doesn't know how to manage.
bad,"It was a nightmare experience, a lot of the women (apparently a lot return for multiple seasons and some have worked there off season) were highly jealous and manipulative bullies that acted like sociopaths. The female night manager was an instigator, the male supervisor was sleeping with most of my coworkers, HR fully supported them. You either fell in line with their behavior or got fired. They alienate everyone and are incredibly fake, they harass you relentlessly but they are your best friend when they know they are being watched."
bad,"Terrible employers, no one cares, team members were walked over and not cared about at all. If you can avoid it, don’t work at any toys r us at all. It’s not as fun as they make it out to be."
bad,"A typical work day consisted of assisting customers and assembling bicycles and ride on vehicles for children. As well as unloading and receiving shipments that came in for inventory."
bad,"first of all i didn't do what i got hired for, calling this place unorganized is an understatement there was toys all over the place nothing was in its designated area which is expected from a children's store but not expected from grown staff workers."
bad,Definitely can do better? Poor manager skills can't even be let out for lunch no thank you anyone could do better definitely needs to be upgrading to better managing skills
bad,Terrible management from from up top to the actual stores. Their idea of a staffed store is one cashier one in the Rzone. And one on the floor recovering.
bad,"I worked there for 3 years i got injured so they basically forced  me out the door,I was supposed to be on light duty i dont think they know what that is. I could not work anymore i was in so much pain."
bad,"The managers were lazy and the company just didn't do anything right. Toys R Us was very unorganized, the managers didn't know what they were doing and the coworkers were lazy."
bad,"Review tons of data and numbers."
bad,"Terrible workplace. I was a seasonal overnight stocker, we worked on average from 10pm-8am and were only given one 30min lunch break around 2am. Very small number of employees who were all extremely overworked."
bad,"Only staffs two employees in the morning or throughout the day "
bad,"hours are based on sales, not performance, so no matter how hard you work, there is no reward"
bad,"Toys R Us is not a good company to work for if you want to have a good work/life balance.  Expectations are very high and unrealistic.  Hourly associates are not compensated fairly, therefore they are not motivated."
bad,I was hired as an seasonal cashier 11/2017. I was told what I write down as my availability that's how I will be scheduled. (All LIES) Management shift u all around to discuss ypur schedule. No-one can answer. Resigning was the best thing I did.
bad,"I worked very hard to make a career at Toys R Us and because of a vengeful ex-husband the legal department decided that I was a ""threat"" to Toys R Us and they let me go.  I had advanced quickly but that did not matter to their legal department (even though I passed a background check)."
bad,"Low pay to hourly employees means constant turn over and unskilled employees. Inconsistent business planning and poor upper managers push blame and accountability. Unwilling to try to work with the people closest to the customer to create unique experiences with the customers."
bad,"Working in the corporate office at Toys R Us was an incredible dream killer of a job. As a contract worker, you are essentially a ghost in the office, and if they don't want to work with you anymore, they just cut you off of your duties and let you die on the vine."
bad,"Going out of Business.Cashier, stock floor and layaway. Also baby supplies sold there too. Nothing too out of the ordinary but kids will be allowed to run around."
bad,"terrible place to work and management sucks. the pay is low, you over work yourself for low pay. management communication levels sucks, they tell you things at last minute and no holiday pay,"
bad,Awful place to work. Nothing nice to say about the company as a whole. Only positive is I made some friends there while working. I am surprised it took TRU this long to file for bankruptcy.
bad,"All of day side upper management was terrible, there was no HR while I worked there. Any issues or problems were automatically blamed on the over night truck crew who's only responsibility is to unload the trucks that arrive and work them out on the floor. Not do signage, price changes, vendor displays, store maintenance. But at the store I worked it it was just easier to point fingers and not take responsibility. No one cared about anything not even the store manager as he was already leaving."
bad,"This is coming from a head office employee. "
bad,You rarely got the hours you were scheduled for. During the holidays you won’t be going home at your scheduled time off. You can not have overtime. The managers don’t do a lot.
bad,"I really don't want to do this. "
bad,"Toys r us was a pretty good company, I was working and going to school. The hours where to much at the time i would let my children work for toys r us"
bad,this place is a dead end for anyone thinking of advancing. the company keeps you down and as complacent as can be and does nothing to take care of their own
bad,"So glad they're shutting down.... Everything was over priced and working there has so much pressure on getting customers to sign up or apply for rewards and credit cards, had many complaints about being hounded for credit card applications, and one instance I was reprimanded for taking too long to check out when my customer had five baskets full of over $5000 worth of items and two mangers had to help because it was such a large check out. Should have left sooner than when I did."
bad,Manager was not fair at all. Favoritism was heavily there if you were night stock management didn't like you one bit. Was good my first seasonal. after not good. manager blames everyone but themselves for not hiring people that would actually work. Pay is rough hours get them while you can. Oh and no good raises
bad,Do not work for this company in west Hartford CT the management is HORRIBLE  they don't work with you GOD for bid you have a family emergency they will cut your hours down to nothing.
bad,Location is in a vacant mall and store manager is horrible at her job. Special treatment given to select individuals while others are treated like dirt. Only certain people are allowed to never have to work Saturdays. Horrible place to work.
bad,"this jo if for high school kids maybe college "
bad,"Imagine working as hard as you've ever worked just for all that to be unnoticed and don't get me started about working there during the holidays. It's a complete mess especially since the managers didn't care at all about their employees. The break room was disgusting, managers didn't even know what they were doing half the time, and to top it all off we didn't even get any type of hours to make the slightest budge in our bank accounts, well at least in my case that's certain."
bad,Terrible place to work! You are a replaceable nobody and frankly managment has a quota to fill. Not a happy work place. I would often be repremanded for leaving the baby registry desk after I requested coverage for a quick break. They ignored me because they could. Discount is NOT worth the bullcrap.
bad,"toys r us in tukwila (at the time) was one of the worst places to work, Management was terrible and there was a lot of favoritism. I'm sure there is a new management team seeing as i worked there 5 years ago."
bad,I would not encourage anyone to work here. They do not train you. They will put you with someone for an hour or two then let you work on your own in a hectic environment. Upper Management doesn't care at all. Always understaffed. Wouldn't be surprised if the company went out of business soon.
bad,It sucks. Do not apply there. Don't waste your time. They use people up and fire them when they get sick plus constantly lie to there employees as well as treat them poorly.
bad,Low pay poor management sloppy work environment bad hours  lack of customers service no room for advisement discount were ok but it wasn't much of a discount but still ok
bad,Management do not provide support to employees or any sort of motivation. Offer jobs that they have not received the contract for. This results in the salary for that role not being paid. Overall badly manage company. Awful to work for.
bad,I worked here for two holiday seasons and I hated it. The administrators do not care about you and there were times when they had me stay later than I was supposed to without paying me for the time. The manager had me clean the dirty bathroom with no gloves and that was something that was not part of the job description
bad,Wouldnt recommend it they have you all over the place like a chicken with its head cut off. They dont train anyone at all bad vib3s everywhere no 3xplaining
bad,"This company is great for Christmas gifting, but not much else, they keep the prices high even when they pay their employees almost nothing, even management gets paid badly."
bad,"Compensation is unfair due to the amount of work that is done.  Hours can be long or very short, usually running on the longer side.  You are expected to shove credit card applications at every customer who walks through the door.  There are informal rewards for opening credit cards if you are close with management.  Expect free meals if you can open the most credit cards in the store, and brown-nose the management."
bad,it is an ok place to work if you're in high school. no room for improvement and the company does not care for its employees. the sister company babies r us is just the same
bad,"There is minimal communication between management and the team. Leadership is incompetent, and will throw you under the bus to save their own skin. Employee retention is terrible because of the miserable environment management fosters. Unless you work at the GRC, don't expect any creature comforts as far as your workplace goes.  Don't expect any of the systems to work, and on the off chance that they do, you'll be doing your work on equipment for 10 years ago. I worked on multiple projects for this company, and I came to find out that my supervisor took all the credit for my work, and when it came to be know that my supervisor had zero involvement with said projects, I was harassed and belittled in front of the management team. During my performance reviews, I scored excellent in all aspects; however, when I approached my boss for a raise I was frequently denied, and the highest pay increase I received was 15 cents."
bad,"poor management"
bad,You work to hard for terrible pay the managers are complete a holes don't apply for this job at any point it's the worst place to work especially the store in media PA worst job ever don't fall for the bs
bad,"While working at archway programs , i was pick & packing make-up , baby oil & baby powder , Johnson & Johnson. I was also a feeder for a short amount of time due to the machine breaking down."
bad,Nothing but the work. It was busy all the time. Best to just focus on the work so you can be done on time. Take your break to actual break and make it count cause closing clean up is no joke
bad,"Didn't like working here, customers were annoying and demanding and the training was light. bosses/supervisors were often nasty. definitely would not recommend working at this store."
bad,Management staff not very professional. Too much favoritism is showed to certain employees. Hard work may go overlooked if not management does not like you.
bad,"I'm a supervisor and I must say, it has by far been the worst experience I've ever partaken in. They don't teach you anything, it's a lot of drama and racism, and I work deadly open-close shifts due to my GM not wanting to do it."
bad,pretty much this place was a transition for me. Got hired and moved up quick to no other options for advancement and store closures. Made my mind up to get out.
bad,This job was fun for me in terms of the work and people I worked with as well. It was a seasonal job so it didn't last long but I enjoyed it while it last.
bad,Around the holidays it gets really busy. For the company to make so much money they pay minimun wage that sucks. They barely give out hours unless they like you
bad,Horrible place to work!!! Don't go there. Its too hot and muggy and no one last here. They don't care about you and its never any work for the employees.
bad,"I was harrassed and human resources did not care nor did they try to fix the problem, I was not paid fairly nor did I get benefits like I should have."
bad,"The location that I worked at had a terrible manager. The work itself is typical of most retail jobs. Also, they cut back on hours as soon as Christmas is over."
bad,This is very stupid can we just be done with this already I don't wanna done these any more thank god this is hopefully my last one.  Byeeeeeeeeeeeeee
bad,"Very stressful, lazy managers that don't feel like they should do their part. No team work at all, constant immaturity and drama. You are expected to do not only your work but everyone else's. Weekends were never rotated, the job its self wasn't bad, it was everything around the job that was. Unless you are in desperate need of a job, I do not recommend."
bad,Stay away from this place i understand when it's seasonal time people want you to bust your butt and go go go go but it doesn't matter how hard you work there is little to no appreciation in that place people are always angry and mad.
bad,"This was the worst job ever. I was a new worker and everytime i asked for help they showed attitude. Also they wasn't clear on the actual times my shift would end. My schedule said my shift was over at 9.. i'd be walking out the store at 11. There was only 1 or 2 managers there that was actually willing to help whenever it was needed. I'd also get 15 minute lunch breaks, had to rush eating my lunch. Over all it was just an unpleasant experience."
bad,"I worked with the r us company for two years and it was some of the worst work experience i will probably ever have. The managers where incompetent relying on us and eventually just me as a supervisor to do all his work for him for absolute disgusting pay. I honestly didnt really hate the work, but horrid pay, with awful management and absolute zero recognition is just a awful work place"
bad,"its not a good place to work, way too much drama here your better off looking to work somewhere else you'll be a lot happier in the long run trust me on that"
bad,"A typical day at this job was stressful and hectic. It was always very unorganized, and managers were very rude and unfairly demanding. I worked the cash register at a very quick and thorough pace and organized aisles every day and night thoroughly."
bad,very boring. very bad. no room for moving up or makiing a better income. Long hours not good pay at all. blah blah blah blah blah blah do not reccomment
bad,"The only way you get hours is if you can sell those toys r us credit cards like hot cakes. Have a bad week, cut hours you sure are not getting them. "
bad,you are just a number people get demoted and loose pay just to keep their job and poor hourly pay and poor manager base salary. would not recommend to my worst enemy.
bad,"I was pregnant and had diabetes, current manager that was there at that time was not a very nice man, he overworked me and did not like the fact that i needed to pinch my finger on a daily basis routine, since i was on a glucose diet. The coworkers were very nice and helpful, I mean i was not the only pregnant women there. But she was also treated unfairly, overall i did not have a good experience here and did not learn anything as they only had me at the resistor for hours."
bad,"Once your in you'll be surprised on how many tasks you have to fulfill.  They have high standards on credit card and rewards enrollment,  you'll be the cashier, salesman, maintenance in which you be picking up the trash outside also cleaning the bathroom.  For minimum wage I don't think it's worth it and no one will be hired as a full time."
bad,I started off liking the company but the longer I stayed the less days I was receiving . I started off as a seasonal worker . Stayed longer than I thought I would
bad,"My hours were completely reliant on how many credit cards I got customers to sign up for. If I didn't get 3 cards out per shift per week, shift cut. As you probably know, nobody wants these credit cards, so all this meant was that every cashier got maybe 12 hours a week at best. It's amazing how a store can stay in business with a business model like this. Instead of getting a few, quality workers and giving then normal shifts, they hired an army of workers, gave them 3 4-hour shifts a week, and called it ""passable"". Absolutely awful. Do not work for this company outside of stockroom or something in the back to that sense."
bad,Working at my latest location showed me that hard work isn't always rewarded. It can be taken for granted. Being flexible can lead to talent being exploited rather than enhanced. There was a obvious lack of awareness and teamwork. Accountability wasn't a storewide standard.
bad,"part time job for christmas season. long hours have to beg for breaks pay very low, but staff is very nice to work with, would never work full time here"
bad,Everyday i would come in sensor some clothes. Restock the floor. Sometimes I would online orders for customers. I would help backup as a cashier. Assist customers if they need help finding anything.
bad,"If you were a cashier, you were a cashier. Absolutely no room for advancement whatsoever. They didn't even want you to do anything else, because a customer might come and they wanted you standing job. I've never felt so unhelpful."
bad,very demanding company. very big on selling credit card. lots of hard work and running around. decent pay and hours. not a great discount.
bad,"If there was a way to give zero stars, I would. If I listed every reason I hated this place, I would grow old by the time I finished. The jobs are tedious, the employees and management are rude and you don't get trained."
bad,"no hours,  low pay,  supervisors do not help out.  They talk badly about each other and they do not even work hard.  company does not care about employees."
bad,"Employees are expected to provide great customer service without proper training. Most of what I learned from this company was self-taught using the company's resources. Management promotes employees based on personal preference, disregarding qualifications. There are many great employees that unfortunately will not have an opportunity to advance with the company if they choose to focus on advancing their education as well. When managers promote, they often skip over employees attending college."
bad,"Never really was trained. Expected to do task with no knowledge. Tattoos were discriminated against. No hours. Management non-existent . Employees were back stabbers,"
bad,This job was horrible. They were understaffed and has horrible training. The pay wasn't good at all. I honestly wouldn't recommend this job to anyone at all.
bad,"I started seasonal, stayed a couple years. Was never given credit when it was do. Was left to do more than one job at a time on my own."
bad,"Not a great place to work. Schedules change weekly. Id go from serious overtime to 15hours a week. Even though my evaluations were always outstanding, I never received more then a 25cent raise. This company does not care about its employees. The benefits were the worst. There's no future there. Its okay for college kids, but that's it."
bad,"I have learned to have a lot of patience. My co-workers are great and we all work well as a team. The hardest part of the job is the problem solving while the quest is being rude and troubling to handle. The most enjoyable part of the job would have to be seeing customers happy when you help them find something. Management is okay, not the best with accommodations at all."
bad,"They pay minimum wage, 7.25 an hour bi weekly. The worst."
bad,"I accepted the job to become a seasonal stocker from 10pm to 6am.  Off the back I found out that I was not a stocker they put me in order fulfillment which I did not apply for secondly I was at first 10pm to 6am then they abruptly changed the schedule to 11:45 pm to 8am which if you have kids who go to school is impossible to do. Then they have the nerve to cut your hours when your wasting gas because they have to pay their own people the full time pay and the overtime pay that was promised to them. Then they let you go because they don't feel that you are ""happy"" who would be when they can't survive off theor method of pay? If you live at home and don't have any bills then this is the job for you. But if you are a single parent trying to struggle to support your family then this is not the job for you."
bad,"They are not organized, they are always rude . "
bad,The management is horrible. They aren't flexible on your hours. They pay poorly. They don't like to give you breaks. They expect the world out of you and give you little recognition for it.
bad,I worked here for two months and it was horrible from the first day. No training at all! I was left at the service desk by myself my first day. The supervisors are nowhere to be found when you need them. The supervisors and management will talk down to you and Human Resouces will do the same.
bad,"They expect you to know everything about every toy ever! as well as selling £60 worth of bags and £60 worth of batteries!! It's insaine how much they expect you to force on the customers. Such a money driven place, working minimum wage and beaing treated like a replaceable piece of trash."
bad,"I do not recommend working here. They told me I'd have full time hours if I wanted, then proceeded to give me 9 hours for all week! When I asked the manager why I only had 9, she told me it was because I was new and no one knew me yet... pretty sure I gotta get hours in for people to learn who I am. "
bad,Worst job I have ever had. Worst management I have evr seen they will threaten your job daily. Once you quit your 2 week notice will disappear. You will be a slave just stay away do not apply
bad,There's no hours from the month of February through June. Employees are just biding time and managers are very unprofessional and biased
bad,"The whole time I was there I hated the place. there is no sense of organisation, nobody you could actually talk to comfortably if you had an issue and the managers were rude. They blamed me for being payed incorrectly (they expected me to know their machine was faulty and on a few occasions even signed me out 30 minutes early). On top of this, I was under 18 at the time and was not given adequate breaks as stated by the young workers act. Their equipment was old and made things difficult to do efficiently too. For a place that was meant to be fun and a team that's ""like a family"" they are a horrible company to work for and care very little about their staff. i can't even say my pay was worth the stress, if i got paid right that is."
bad,Toys R Us is a very stressful job with little pay. Management didn't appreciate their employees and expected so much from us. If we didn't reach our goal because of a slow day we get yelled or our hours will decrease to 4 hours a week. The only thing I enjoyed was seeing children's faces light up when you found their favorite toy!
bad,. The overnight supervisors are mean to certain people and they will curse and talk about you amongst themselves. If you work the night shift you will only get a 15 min break and then you have to go right back to work. The pay is low the highest check I received is $125. I highly wouldn't recommend . This is specifically the  armingo ave one
bad,"Worked seasonal for the holiday time. Walked out after 2 weeks. Failed to give me hours, locked in the store all night, dirty as ever in the store. I feel sorry for kids because this store was filthy and dusty as ever. Management was racist well the store head manager. The supervisors talked to the workers like kids, told us we couldn't go on break until half of the store was finished then sat on their butts all night. Poor training, unloaded a full to the max truck then did the entire store. One day we finished the full job but it still wasn't enough so I left. This store managers need psychological help."
bad,"There was no work life balance. You earned time off but they made it very difficult for you to actually use it when you want to."
bad,Awful management who are rude and uncaring towards employees. They may provide lots of joy to the children they are providing products for but it is a miserable place for employees. They don't treat employees all the same. They do have favorites. Advancing is practically impossible.
bad,Awful place to work management are so bad apart from male assistant manager if the store manager doesn't like you she will make your life miserable they also treat all there staff bad apart from the ones that lick there bottoms don't work for them because you'll be over worked and underpaid. When being questioned to and reviewed by head office then seem to not be able to recall any events. Many have left because of this awful company! If you want to end your shift on time then this is not the job for you! Finish 30 past your shift and not getting paid the store closed due to being left by management team to complete there tasks!
bad,Management can not be any worse. understaffed at all times which gives no flexibility for the remaining employees. most employees barely make it over a month there until they quit. we do not get paid enough for such a stressful job. Would not recommend this job even to my enemy
bad,"I was very disappointed with the organization within a store with the sales volume of Toys ""R"" Us. It is not a pleasant place to work."
bad,"Staff are bullys, no structure, managment are a joke.. they tell you you will go for interview for a full time contract and when you get there they offer anyone a 0 hour contract"
bad,"A typical day at work would be filling the shelves and helping customers"
bad,"I tried to apply for a job here, but their software is faulty and makes it impossible to create an account. They should re-evaluate how they accept applications instead of limiting to one route....."
bad,"I was very optimistic about working at Toys R Us, as I have always shopped there, but the place is very disappointing. Management ignores any issues and takes advantage of new workers. There is no positive encouragement and you are only trained in a few areas. They expect you to know everything when you join, even if they know you have no retail expertise."
bad,Bad place to work at. The management is rude. They always think customers are stealing and it is so much drama. The entire store is corrupt and damaged.
bad,This employer needs to take a major step back from how they treat their employees and need to assess every situation as a new one
bad,Management treat you unfairly. No benefits. No flexible schedules. Fast paced job. Learned to communicate with customers in crowded work environment. How to locate product if not on floor.
bad,"too many hours for management, upper management is not good. building is messy, to be a family company they care nothing about work life balance."
bad,"If I could give a lower rating I would. I am speaking only for the Frisco location directly but their are some nationwide issues as well. I have been there for two and a half years, I have seen more irrational decisions made by my store manager than ever before. Before I go on I would like to note that I am not an employee who is upset that they did not get a promotion, I am an employee who was cheated and walked all over. I can feel a rant coming so I will just bullet point the issues."
bad,"the employees are very chatty,everyone knows everyone's personal business due to management telling other co-wokers. the  management team at the store i worked at had no communications skills what so ever.alot of favoritism going on.If i was asked would i ever work there again? My answer would be no."
bad,"The management of the store is awful, with lack of time management and no motivation. The managers do not take in to account who they are hiring and take no interest in their employees."
bad,job was temporary. Warehouse working picking items and loading them onto a pallet. Moving big quanities on items into a truck with a hand jack. Scanned items to make sure they were being delivered to the right truck for the right destinations
bad,"Full of angry bitter management who will never help customers. Everything comes down to the team members who don't even have the authority to change half the things that customers need fixed. No incentive to sell buyer protection plans, credit cards, etc outside of threats from management. Even if you're not seasonal you can kiss your hours goodbye after the holiday season. Disorganized company, useless training. You have to teach everything to yourself.  The particular location I worked at had a gross store that just looked and felt depressing. It's a toy store, with literally no joy to be found."
bad,Did not pay employees for overtime work an were not given 10 minute breaks.  Senior employees did not perform any work and instructed seasonal hires to perform all job duties.
bad,consistent call off by co workers childish mangers that steal time off our check in a store full of mess they will steal time off your check in make you wait weeks to get it constantly
bad,"I can't stand working there, as an assembler I'm expected to build things at a timely rate. Yet, I am not given the proper tools and work area. A lot of the times I am improvising tools to get the job done. Also there are rarely an sapphires that work and walkies as well, which makes it very hard to help customers when they want to know the price of a bike or something in the wheels section. I also did not receive training and had to learn everything through other employees or on my own. The last thing is employees only receive a 10% discount on certain items, customers get better discounts than us."
bad,"Teesside Park Toys R Us"
bad,"This was one of my first jobs but it was by far the most terrible job I have ever had.  Management was terrible, they would make you work long hours with just a 5 minute break."
bad,"They hire you and after the season is over, they say they are down sizing and you are no longer needed.  After you left your family alone on Thanksgiving. "
bad,"Mal ambiente de trabajo, mal trato de los responsables de producción con los operarios."
bad,"A typical day at work is stressful, we are always having to deal with unhappy customers or employees and figuring out how to fix the issue at hand. There is no room for advancement, store management says there is no potential.   Pay and benefits are not that great, I have been with the company for almost four years and get paid less than what minimum wage is about to be."
bad,Unorganized and the staff/management are rude. Probably the worst experience i have ever had working. New staff everyday that would not come back because of the people/management that work there. Would not recommend this.
bad,"The management was terrible, I had to teach myself from day one; granted, it was seasonal, and therefor very busy. However, the managers would just stand around talking anyway. I was constantly ordered to clean (both) of the restrooms as I was the only male working at the store that wasn't management (at the time)."
bad,"made sandwiches, cleaned tables, knew the family, I was treated well but they closed later on, it was a nice job ,I  prepped food, cashier, treated customers with respect, wiped tables, cleaned bathrooms, emptied trash"
bad,This company use to be a great company to work for. Now there just trying to get rid of all the employees that have been there for years and hire people who do not care about there job to save money. They also play favorites. The employees they like can get away with what ever they want. Everyone else has to watch there step. Some employees can be late every day and others late once and you get a write up.  Not a good environment now. Like I said use to be the best job I've ever had.
bad,"The managers there suck, only worked for 4 days because I could not memorize where all the toys and products go (never went in toys r us) in the midnight shift from 11pm to 4am, it really did suck, even though it sucks to be fired it wasn't as bad considering...because you couldn't get any worse from toys r us in pensacola,fl ... so  yeah I was fired only to be picked up by a higher paying job and company weeks later. But yeah I feel sorry for anyone who works in that brutal camp. It probably has changed in 2015 but... I doubt it."
bad,There is too much drama within this company. Higher ups don't understand what the stores need in order to succeed. There is never a pay on the back. It is always a scolding and during the holidays you can kiss your family goodbye. You won't see them between November-2nd week of January. A few times I closed my store when we stayed open extended hours and slept in my car in the parking lot because I had to be at work 4 hours later. The pay is also pathetic. You are practically working for free if you are a manager. The hours and money earned do not add up.
bad,"I would never work here ever again, the job you sign-up is not the only job that you end up doing. The pay you for your job but will have you doing someones else job."
bad,For a multi million dollar company they don't take care of there staff they underpay there employees and show no type of respect or integrity.
bad,"This job originally started as unloading the truck, but soon turned into standing in the door for 8+ hours yelling at people to come in and try the toys. If I wasn't loud enough or not following a set script I got written up. Time off requests were 'lost' even though they were filed in the proper amount of time. Finally got a $0.25 raise almost a year after working there, and after having a doctor's not as to why I didn't come in to work my boss accused me of going to a party instead. Terrible work environment. One time we had an RC car to demo and it caught fire, manager took it to the back and handed me a new one like nothing happened."
bad,There was no typical day at work. Since no one there wanted to be there anyways. People who were hired walked in and saw that we had to set up the store and walked out just as fast as they walked in. And those who stayed didn't want to do any work.  Management we really didn't have any management. They brought people in from stores and said here you go. And they didn't even know the first thing about setting up a store. It was like a fly by the seat of your pants operation. The hardest part of the job was setting up the store since no one knew what they were doing to begin with. Most enjoyable when I left.
bad,"Horrible company to work for especially if they take you as a seasonal. Their ""training"" lasts about an hour and consists of videos about customer service and nothing else. They'll show you how to run a register but other than that, you are on your own. Then they will start throwing tasks at you that you have no idea how to do, and when they ask for help, they will blow you off but flip out if you make a mistake. "
bad,i started off seasonal. and after the season was over they kept me permanently. they only let me work two days out of the week then when i asked for more hours so i can help them out they would tell me i should be grateful that they kept me..
bad,I think that a job at Toys R Us as a sales associate is perfect part-time job for a college student. There is no job loyalty and there is a high turnover rate. The pay was low for the job I had performed.
bad,"run register, people lie about prices, terrible, jerks, standing 4-6 hours and walk around  for hours at night cleaning, going home"
bad,"A typical day at work is usually fun, long and drawled out. I learned how to work on the cash register very fast and also how to deal with big purchases. Management was well put together. My co-workers were also always fun to be around and full of energy. The hardest part was dealing with more than one big purchase from costumers. The most enjoyable part of the job was just being there on holidays as well"
bad,I personally was not a fan when I got the job at toys r us. The staff was very sweet nut management was not up to par as it should have been. It was very diverse which was a good thing but overall I did not feel like part of the team.
bad,"Work/Life Balance:"
bad,district manager can't be taking seriously. management has no respect for associates and talk down to employees. changes pay with out notice nor paper work to sign to verify change in compensation. over worked employees.
bad,"very unorganized, management has no idea what they are doing and take their mistakes out on the employees. The whole store was always a mess and the other employees where lazy and expected others to pick up their slack. very bad company to work for"
bad,"The company is okay, management was average, co workers were nice. Pay was horrible and customers were usually irate. The point system is a real flaw, but the best part is that everything is computerized and you can access all info from home which was cool."
bad,Treated employees like garbage.  worked people like slaves.  promised permanent employment.  consistently lied to by corporate.
bad,"Don't accept a temp contract from these jokers as you will not believe how much you will be messed about & lied to. Absolutely ZERO health & safety as they let you wear trainers in work and if you turn up in a hi-vis, you will be told to take it off, contrary to UK Health & Safety legislation. They like to think they know what they're doing, but they clearly don't as two managers were fired after Xmas. Wages are usually just over minimum wage for FLT jobs and staff are constantly leaving. Management don't know what they are doing, treat people like children and be prepared for constant wage queries. I was there on short term contracts for around seven months and not one of my wage slips was correct, even though clocking in is done with finger scans. One star rating is only because I couldn't leave any less. If you want a good chance of being seriously injured on the job, this is the place for you"
bad,the management was terrible and the employees all had inflated egos with power. It seemed they liked to push their weight around.
bad,"It was a horrible experience, the workers were rude. I dreaded going there everyday. The customers were very nice but the workers made it very hard to be there."
bad,"Arrived to work, was told to grab a basket and restock the shelves and clean up the isles every day. I learned that people you work with are not always nice and the way they treat you depends on how they would like to treat you.The managers did not care how my coworkers treated me. My coworkers were rude and because they worked there longer than me they were given more hours to work. was having to deal with rude co workers. The little kid's faces would light up when I would help them find a toy."
bad,"Administration–Sales-Customer Service-Sales and Marketing Coordinator"
bad,"Co workers we not friendly, management was hardly involved, there was no enjoyable part to the job, I learned nothing.  The hardest part of the job was the schedule"
bad,"It was not a healthy work environment, and they never kept you on your position. The job description is only operated one to two days a week."
bad,"Temp cashier for Christmas season 2013 at Peoria, IL store near the Mall."
bad,"Describing this company as a ""joke"" is actually generous. They are incredibly under staffed and their management teams in the various stores I've been too are nothing other than useless. However it's amazing when a head office visit happens all the staff in the world get called in, obviously to massage their egos as the top dog signs the hours off every week, so it's obvious they know the score while they sit on their megabucks but undeserving salarys. One of my GSM's was a complete bully, yet was supported by Head Office even after numerous complaints about him. The targets are completely unrealistic and when the going gets tough they are very quick to moan at the staff even though the staff are the ones that do all the jobs and a bit more. They are experts at promoting the useless employees and treating the decent employees like something they've stepped on. It's a shame that getting a job is hard to come by these days because many would leave if this wasn't the case. Due to the way the company is run the morale is awful, making the job very unenjoyable. You should look forward to going to work, but this is the complete opposite. I do not recommend anyone to work for this company at all, unless you are absolutely desperate."
bad,"Horriable place to work, I was over worked for my pay. Management staff was very unprofessional. Management staff sleeping with each other on the job,"
bad,Management always down your back about things. When help is needed you get told something about doing something wrong.
bad,"There was no room to advance at the company. One week you would have 20 hours then the next you may have 5. If you could reach metrics, you were one of the favorites."
bad,On the register and help out on the floor. Also help customers find things that they were looking for.
bad,"No organisation, minimum training people wouldnt know what they were doing, poor 1980 induction dvd, no health and safety no safety equipment, people working under forklift trucks, the roofs leaking and there's no wet floor signs."
bad,"This was my first job and right from the beginning the managers weren't helpful. They knew that I lacked experience and they completely abandoned my training process."
bad,my first job and it was okay until the manager was very FRISKY.
bad,Can be extremely stressful. Too many unrealistic expectations.
bad,"A typical day here as a Registry Consultant would be to greet guest on the floor, re-stock shelves if needed, sign-up new registrants, order furniture, call registrants, and maintain a clean work space."
bad,Not a friendly fun place to work. Everyone just waiting for the shoe to drop.  Lots of blame game without much ownership. Other departments function well but as a service group they don't respect other groups much.
bad,"Go in early"
bad,"Working here is unpredictable. The store manager is hateful and puts all employees down. As an employee, I always hated going to work. The store manager would slander anyone that walked in the door. This includes employees and customers. She made everyone uncomfortable with her racist comments and disgust for people in general. She never cared about the sale of a product to anyone that wasn't Caucasian."
bad,i reallyt did not enjoy my time working at toys r us. my typical work pattern would be maintainin the shop floor and assisting customers. i really didnt enjoy working with my co workers or management if there was an issue or problem they seemed reluctant to help. the hardest part was working with the staff and the long hours with out a break especially during peak christmas shopping hours. i dont have an enjoayble memory here sadly
bad,"Rude management, didn't teach anything they just told you to go to the floor."
bad,"The compensation wasn't up to par. the people were cool, management ran around frantic half the time."
bad,"Unloading and loading truck,scanning merchandise into the bay as well onto the floor. Serving customers with great customer service skills and giving the knowledge about the product or merchandise they are willing to purchase. Co workers weren't so friendly would go behind back and tell lies about one another to get ahead. Hardest part of the job was carrying swing set by yourself when there are several pieces to a swing set due to lack of hiring employees when needed. Serving the customers children and making their day especially around the holidays."
bad,stock shelves. management was ok pay was low good work for some work history
bad,I had managers who didn't care.  They spent all day on the phone and had me do all the work.
bad,"Seasonal job, want a lot for the little pay and hours."
bad,"This is a good started job for a high school kid or someone who doesn't have to pay bills and eat. The hours are 8 to 10 a week at worst, and 20 to 25 at best (which is pretty much only at Xmas time). I had to work Thanksgiving Day, Black Friday, and for Christmas, we were open 24 hours all week. There is an assortment of shifts to work, including overnight stocking, and starting as early as 4am. There are opportunities for advancement, but even then you still don't get 30 hours, and there are NO raises. "
bad,The job requires you to be able to work in various different positions in a given day. Due to the lack of employees individuals have to pick of the slack. Over all there is a lack of management. I would not advise anyone to apply for this job. Though you can quickly move up in ranks at the job the stress and frustration is not worth it.
bad,A good place to work if you only support yourself and only care about working.
bad,Terrible place to work. Doesn't want to work with school schedules and is very unforgiving when it comes to emergencies. Demands 110% for minimum wage.
bad,Learned alote but at the same time it was under bad management.  Management have not a good underminding to do his job.
bad,The worst job I've ever had to many this is a job I would never work for again the store manager is the worst of all just a real know it all and think everyone is beneath him.
bad,"Very unorganized, totally disregarded availability. Expected to learn things without proper training. Customers very hard to deal with."
bad,This job is sloppy and poorly managed. I worked 8 hours and was never offered a break.
bad,n\a none nothing to review very bad commition between management and shop floor
bad,"Don't work here if you replied yes. "
bad,Poor quality of life as a manager. Often worked up to 70+ hours per week.
bad,"La peor encargada que podia haber tenido, no era solo estricta si no mala..."
bad,The workplace was a fun environment.  I was able to meet new people and I enjoyed helping people.
bad,Loading trucks. How to use scanners. The hardest part was loading four trucks at a time. I enjoyed my breaks.
bad,constantly had my hours cut and pay taken away for stuff that wasnt my fault...i didnt like the management what so ever.
bad,"Bad pay, no hours, hard labor, short breaks, no set schedule"
bad,i worked at toys r us for the holidays. pretty fun. it was overnight.
bad,"It was an ok job it was only seasonal. Nothing for long term, nothing really for advancement"
bad,Absolute worst company to work for during my 17 years employment.  I was even a manager and still I have nothing good to say about the company.  I have seen too many things happen that were unethical and too many innocent employees hurt and wronged.  I would never suggest this company to anyone seeking employment.
bad,Was my first job for a bit of side cash in College. Wasn't expecting anything great
bad,"not very customer service oriented, management wasn't about the customers nor the employees"
bad,Was supposed to work shop floor but they put me in the warehouse did not like it.
bad,Was a cashier at first then got promoted to the floor were I could help customer find what they needed. Then got another promotion to customer service desk where I would answer phones and take in returns. Then went on morning crew for stocking shelves. Management was a joke. Co-workers always stressed out. Hardest part of job was showing up cause I knew every day was going to be a disaster. No motivation at all. Most enjoyable part of job was helping customers on the floor.
bad,Poor Management not a lot of hours and other co-workers were not friendly 
bad,"too many roles to fill."
bad,"was only there part time seasonal work, there was not much to review being I was only there 3 months"
bad,"I worked for this company for almost three years. The management is the problem they don't care about there employees, there's absolutely no room for advancement , and its almost as if you have to beg for hours, there's clearly favoritism , most of the employees there are unhappy!!"
bad,Managers dont do their job. Others are forced to look after and do what the managers are supposed to do.
bad,the only way i would justify this place to be a good job is if you are between 16-18 and need a part time job.
bad,"pretty garbage job i hated it, waste of my precious time. management sucked everything sucks except talking to the little kid customers"
bad,Upper management is very belittling.Everyone has an attitude problem.
bad,I did not experience good things there. They were not very welcoming to anybody. Trained you one day and left you on your own after that.
bad,The in comparison to the work is terrible. Management aren't particularly fond of their job so the mistreat the staff. The scheduling is unpredictable with mandatory overtime. Wouldn't recommend
bad,"A typical day at Toys'R'Us sees a merchandiser doing just that. We're the guys that put all the merchandise on the shelf in the first place. I learned the basics of what companies will expect of their merchandisers. My co-workers aren't so bad as the management team we have now. When I finish face changing (rearranging according to layout) an aisle I don't want to told I was ""struggling"" when the day was easy for me. I even finished before everyone else and was clocked out and headed out the door when they were still adding their finishing touches! That's actually typical now. Old management team have all left for other jobs because Toys'R'Us was not ""worth it"". Whether the day is heavy or light I don't cussing to yourself and complaining about even the smallest mistakes is good leadership. Also if your seasonal workers are standing in a circle talking while we labor in the back go tell them to work. Do not ask someone else to do it. You are the boss for crying out loud! When you do tell them to go faster or at least don't just stand there talking you should look them in the eye instead of walking past while speaking to the floor! Antagonizing someone and acting as if they are doing a terrible job just be they couldn't finish the EXTRA work is nonsense ( they finished they're assigned workload early, that's a good job, not bad). I could go on. Been there for 5 years now and am physically and mentally done with this place. Would not suggest working there ( at least as a merchandiser). There's much more to say but I don't want to type up a short novel."
bad,Not many customers came in. Those that did never needed assistance. Management didnt help with letting employees choosing where to work at in store.
bad,"Awful management, strict policies, no flexibility in hours"
bad,I basically knew half of the movie/tv gerne so in case someone needed like an action figure of the movie or tv show i was able to idenitfy what the customer was talking about.
bad,"While the job itself might be fun and interesting, it really is because of the people that you work with. However, the job that you do might not be the job that you trained for or even what you might of been hired to do. You also might work alone with a constant demand with little time to take a break, yet alone your lunch. Plus constant pressure by management to sell with it being tied to your work performance, hours, and benefits."
bad,interesting place to work..typical retail and customer service job
bad,"Horrible, hardely no hours and management skills were terrible."
bad,"well the hours was short, no respect. they did not have a stable manager, they didn't have a fix schedule on anything."
bad,You work a lot of hours and get a lot of promise that are not keep.
bad,Very stressful and hours are limited. You are treated as a machine rather than a human being. You are lucky to get a break. You are on your feet your entire shift. The pay for the job you are doing is not enough.
bad,"Nice part time job, this was a job to help with making my desicion on going forward with my career"
bad,"At Thyrsus I worked in the back of the house as a warehouse specialist. I was responsible for maintaining the in store and warehouse inventory. I worked with everything from unloading trucks to constantly supplying the front store with inventory items. I maintained the inventory levels, while providing excellent customer service every time I was in the front store. I performed numerous clerical and administrative duties during peak season times, while managing, training, and assisting new employees as they were added to the schedule. I delegated tasks to ensure operations ran smoothly."
bad,If you can not find anything else or are in desperate need of a second income then this is the place for you.
bad,not a good place to work. managers always yelling at you in front of customers and never around when you need them. Other co-workers were fine but not during work
bad,"A typical work day was just full of head ace. there is always something going on. this place is so disorganized, and miss manege. all the company care about is number. how many BBP and reward and yea the new credit card you can get .if you are making good number all is fine. but if you number go down. that is when i ugly comes out."
bad,management failed across the board. customers were given free run of the store. security was practically non existent as corporate did not see fit to fix the decade old non functional security cameras or employ any security or loss prevention resulting in thousands of dollars in losses per day as well as certain managers ignoring employees complaints.
bad,"the worst place to work ever,benfist not good, no felxability or advancment"
bad,"They recruited me, but they provide no training or website to be resourceful...They don't provide enough payroll to run a store. The district manager is a liar. Please don't work for this company."
bad,"management doen not know the law concerning human resources, the are unfair when it comes to advancement"
bad,"The only value this position had was helping parents, grandparents, etc., with what products to buy their families for the holidays. Other than that, the management took advantage of its employees. I sometimes wasn't given a break and was often forgotten about when I needed a break to use the restroom. Incredibly unprofessional."
bad,"A typical day at work consists of price changes within the store marking merchandise up and down and also marking down apparel. Every Sunday, I am responsible for setting the advertised and unadvertised deals within the store and online. Working independently and effectively communicating with mangers regarding sales in the store. I am also responsible for big ticket maintenance which are the big merchandise in the store that will not fit properly on a shelf but rather on the sales floor."
bad,they tend to give no hours and want you to work for very little they managers are very rude and harsh to thier employees
bad,"new experiences and meeting new people, trying out new foods before sold to the general public"
bad,"It's a toy company but ran like the military. I'm amazed Toys ""R"" Us isn't completely out of business yet, especially after what goes on at the store I worked in! Director Level and above very disconnected from the rest of the team. Horrible time off, always called in on days off, shortens your vacation time. Store manager would never treat employees with respect or dignity. Store manager played favorites to employees that treated others poorly like him. During my time, there were so many people quitting or fired on a weekly or monthly basis. Some of the policies employees are forced to follow are quite ridiculous. For example, employees can't have an ""unnatural"" hair color like cranberry. Employees also have to provide S.T.A.R. service (smile, talk, ask, and rapid). The first three parts make sense. The rapid part does not. Corporate expects us to spend only two minutes or less with each customer. That much time may work with most customers, but there are some customers who need more than two minutes of help. Cashiers are told to ask all customers if they'd like batteries or a Buyer Protection Plan (BPP) with their purchase, even if the customer is just buying some gift wrap or a gift card! It's like asking someone at a restaurant if they'd like fries with their ice cream cone. Management and Corporate will try to find silly things to fire you over like not punching in and out correctly or not offering a customer batteries and a BPP with their purchase. All employees here are trained in how to operate a register just in case they have to be used as backup. However, that training"
bad,"Not the best"
bad,The first five years were ok at TRU.  Things went south when TRU was purchased by a private equity.  Minimal investment was put into IT.  This hampered the company so it was unable to compete in the marketplace.
bad,"I grew up a TOYS R US kids always wanted to work for them it quickly became the worse job ever. No one could do their job right, management continuously played with my hours it was so unorganized anyone would lose their minds."
bad,"They are too much about quotas, if you dont reach the quota they fire you. It is fast paced so if you cant keep up they will fire you. The customer service is really bad, no one ever around to help if you get stuck on something."
bad,"Their promotions were shady, they barley paid their people anything (store manager of a small store for $14.00/hr.). Your success depended on how many batteries you sold, how many people you signed up for their terrible credit card, how many buyer protection plans you sell and how many people you signed p for loyalty programs. A month before they went bankrupt, they gave all of their top executives millions of dollars in bonuses. If they had given it to their hourly staff, they would have had a $5,000 bonus per employee. Corporate shadiness disguised as a toy and wrapped with a cute bow."
bad,"Brak możliwości awansu jeśli nie ma się ""pleców"". Słaba atmosfera, wieczne obgadywanie innych osób i udawanie kolegów/koleżanek. Zarobki nijakie, obowiązków aż nadto."
bad,"They used us the Facilities Maintenance Technicians to destroy all toys in the Distribution Center. They didn’t allow any worker to take a crayon from the DC. Baby beds, brand new and used ones were destroyed by us on instruction."
bad,"Was ran by kids and washed up old people. No morale no energy just horrible. No management, no control, no loss prevention and disorganized. Not worth the stress."
bad,Another job I worked at that went out of business. The store manager here was a jerk and treated all of his employees as if they were actual garbage. He made me go out in a thunder storm to clean outside in the parking lot and all around the store. Just was a waste of my time
bad,The managers treated their employees horribly then if someone got inqppropriatly harassed they keep you on the same shift and ignored it until I quit. The managers had a attitude with the employees everyday and wasn't willing to help the new employees.
bad,"The managers were sexist and discriminatory. They pressured the male stock crew to quit, hired young women in their place, just so the middle aged manager could oogle them. Disgusting and outdated."
bad,Days there were very stressful and there were some good days. They had specific requirements for employees each day where we had to get credit cards and reward cards.
bad,Business never had a chance given how bad the books were. Its still sad that an erstwhile iconic brand is now going to die in this manner. Has the least tech savvy people for employees
bad,I was unable to find a job and TRU was the only place who hired me.  For that I was thankful. But the overall company needs to be completely revamped.
bad,"At first when i worked here i enjoyed everything about it. Then 2 years later everyone started quitting including the store manager who held the store together very well. After that nothing got done, never had enough people employed, we were forced to work 12-14 hours during holiday season because we were shorthanded and busy. The store is a mess and unorganized. The pay is awful for all the work you do"
bad,I was seasonal employee with them and they let me go without any notice. I had to call them to find out I wouldn't be scheduled anymore and I find that completely disrespectful
bad,Shifts would either be too long or too short. They would only give 30 min lunch breaks and sometimes no breaks. The hardest part of working at Toys R Us would be the long closing night shifts.
bad,I worked at toys r us for about a month they wasn’t giving me no hours really because of my availability.I said I could work from 10-6 weekdays and open on weekends.I talked to my manager about it and he said that’s why I didn’t have so many hours .I Called out thanksgiving and he just never put me back on the schedule. No communication or nothing I called them after a whole week of waiting to hear something and the manager tells me they’ll call me if they need me like what ??even though it was seasonal it’s still a job
bad,"There's practically no room for advancement, theft is rampant and the regional staff do nothing to improve the situations. Definitely would not suggest!"
bad,"Managers don't care about their employees, company blames individuals for lack of sales, breaks are never guaranteed, often punished for helping guests. It was a terrible place to work, I dreaded going there everyday."
bad,"management was extremely racist, incompetent and stalks employees. there is one particular manager who would call out black families as thieves and would talk down to all non white employees she still has her job and corporate refuses to do anything about her"
bad,Manager was not good.  Some supervisors worked extremely hard.  Others were on cocaine and management was aware and there were no consequences.  The supervisors that worked hard never got credit or advancement when warranted.  They hired some dimwits that were clueless and employees would just quit whenever or not show up.  No work ethic.  The customers were the best part of the job.
bad,"I worked at a Toys ""R"" Us location for over a year as a sales associate with the option to become a baby side specialist. The managers there were all in cahoots with each other, sitting in the offices and break rooms on their phones doing nothing, and would always call in extra floor employees to pick up the slack, thus causing us to go over hours constantly. this and many other childish behaviors and rude demeanor from coworkers, supervisors, and customers, on top of the need to fulfill a career i love is why i left the establishment."
bad,"Toys R Us consisted of several duties including: truck receiving,stocking, online order fulfillment, customer service, display assembly, etc. All employees are paid a base rate slightly above minimum wage regardless of performance.  The culture was very inconsistent due to poor communication, inconsistent/lack of  manager structure among other things.  I enjoyed the staff, the workload wasn't too bad but  believe the pay didn't compensate the productivity demands. In my year with the company I learned how all the processes worked from online ordering, in store pick ups, lay-away, baby registry, etc."
bad,If you are seeking short term employment you may like this place but if you are seeking a career I don't think this company would be a wise choice.  Get everything in writing before you accept from HR.
bad,"When I worked there I was called to ask if I could come in and if I said no I was either guilt tripped into coming in or I was scheduled very little hours the following week. As well as they scheduled me for the exact opposite for my availability I put down. Some of the management was rude and inconsiderate. When you close , everyone has to stay til the store is clean (even if you missed your ride or transportation home. It didn't matter to them). As well as if I closed , I was typically scheduled to open the next morning. I applied to be a cashier and ended up being on the floor 95% of the time."
bad,"When I work for the company years ago, corporate was setting unachievable goals that made management want to pull their hair out. The stress rolled down hill, it effected communication and the team."
bad,"This job was a seasonal position for me, I came in during the holidays when it was very busy and non stop. Lines were around the building and customer were still on there way."
bad,"the managers at the 7026 are the absolute worst managers ever. They only care for who they want to care for and they don't work well with college students because they may leave out at 12 am because there are only 3 people closing (literally). They also don't have any respect for their employees and don't care about the well being of their employees. So if you're a student in Lafayette do not work at this store. They also cut hours a lot so you don't make much money at this place. "
bad,This is a company that should have pulled the plug a long time ago.  Sinking ship. Poor culture. Management plays favorites. No incentive to get ahead. No partnership from peers.  Pay is below fair market. Definitely no future here.
bad,"The company as a whole was poorly run from the top down only stating afloat because of a few good workers per store. Demanding, not rewarding, and no compensation for excelling in the workplace."
bad,This is not a place to make a career. No one cares about their job to a point where you feel it seep through the entire work staff. There is little light at the end of the tunnel as you will never be well compensated and the store only really does well during the holidays where customers are at their most rabid.
bad,I loved my job even though the pay was horrible. I was extremely versatile in my abilities to go wherever was needed. I excelled in everything....except my ability to lie to make upper management happy. The politics of this place are ridiculous. It's hard to stand by a company that is so involved in putting on a front to appear to be something they are not.
bad,"A job you work as a teen; no adult should be complacent to work as a sales associate. Underpaid, overworked, manipulated, and a lack of purpose is what you will experience as a sales associate."
bad,"The registers are so old and rubbish that you would spend your whole day apologising to customers for the delay because their items would not scan or the item wouldn't come up on the system, whilst you had a massive que of angry customers who let you know how angry they were.  Some staff members (especially the store manager) were so rude to myself and others it made me question how they got a job in retail. Severely under staffed 99% of the time. I used to dread going to work here, the staff discount wasn't great either. There were about 4 genuinely nice people who work there, they treated me and others with respect and were very friendly and helpful."
bad,Don't treat collages with Respect. I worked in the stockrooms eight of them unloading five wagons a day all general Duties.
bad,"A typical day at work consists of aiding customers with their baby registry and basic transactions. I've learned that it isn't the best place to work. The co-workers are friendly but management is mediocre. The hardest part of the job is trying to speak with management. The scheduling in hours continuously goes up and down. One week you may have decent hours, and the next week you'll have two day (3-4 hours each day). Certain times management would schedule you to close and then open the next day. They pay minimum wage and they do not offer time and a half on major holidays. You'll get most of your hours around the Christmas holiday season. The most enjoyable part of the job was leaving."
bad,"The work life balance is terrible. Team members control the environment.  If you are a department manager and you are not liked by upper management, you will not survive.  The productivity system is not accurate and the team members know it, yet as a department manager you are required to hold team members accountable for this performance metric.  No training system for anyone. During season you will work an automatic 6 days a week and at times 7 days. You must meet a daily metric and have to report it everyday which is next to impossible to make, and NO ONE really knows how to make it happen including upper management. If you are considering working here, talk to another manager and ask if they are seeking other employment.  Good luck!"
bad,staff where nice and great crack bit how it was run was terrible. the prices where too high and ended up driving customers away
bad,"As seasonal help, unless you are overzealous about a majority of the products you probably won't advance beyond your position.  Management was unaccommodating for workers' personal lives.  Both the management team and customers often showed disregard for the staffs' dignity especially around the holidays.  It was extremely difficult to find assistance from co-workers since the store was usually understaffed and the short amount of training given left something to be desired."
bad,"What a horrible place to work, constant negative actions from District Managers, Human resource managers and Store Managers. The training leaves a lot of room for improvement, complaints that are brought to Regional Human Resources are dismissed as alleged after there is proof in the form of written, visual video and pictures. I will never recommend any form of employment at Toys R Us to anybody for any reason. As an Assistant Manager, there are times you are left alone to manage a high volume side-by-side store from 1pm until close, with no key holding or department head support staff, you are left ringing out guests, creating baby registries, constantly putting out ""fires"" all over the store. The scheduling practices are atrocious during peak times you will have one cashier, no other able employee to run register unless you pull them from their tasks around the store (which was constantly), then discipline the same associate for not completing the job, (that was instruction from the District Manager). We heard gunshots one night at the store, looked outside and saw the entire store surrounded by SWAT Team, all entrances and exits blocked off, Toys R Us requires you to contact the  ""Situation Response Hotline"", prior to that, as manager on duty concerned for the safety of employees and guests, I locked the doors and asked that everyone stay away from the windows and the front doors and go to a safe place near the rear of the store. I contacted the hotline explained that we were blocked off and closed for business, they asked why, I explained we thought we heard gunshots and"
bad,"I have learned how to do registry's in BABIES'RUS, I am trained to do tickets and signage, I also assist customers at customer service. I am also a cashier."
bad,"It was very fast pace job. That  I made as fun as I can dealing with a lot of toys and stocking for the christmas season. Its a great place to start if you are into retail sales and you like to move around to diffrent department to get the experience from each area of sales."
bad,Regular employees were a joy to work with. Higher management was very disrespectful.
bad,"Helping with customers finding merchandise"
bad,"The hardest part about the job is stopping a customer that is trying to steal merchandise from the store, at times they run out and Toys R Us has a strictly hands off policy. This store has poor management, managers really dont care about people stealing inside the store, bad customer satisfaction. The most enjoyable part about the job is being able to recover the merchandise back. Also my hours are being cut every week."
bad,"The biggest problem is the store management as well as the district managers. The majority of them expect the supervisors of the store to compensate for their lack of work/knowledge. Duties of the typical manager include taking frequent smoke breaks, sleeping in the office, taking month-long vacations when all other employees only get a few days, and blaming their mistakes on everyone but themselves. Work conditions are below standard and can be dangerous, especially if on the stock/unload crew. Safety practices are stressed as the most important thing, while no real precautions are taken to ensure safety of the workers. Overall a very stressful/depressing company to work for."
bad,"Mangers were terrible, rude, yelled at seasonal employees and assumed that they knew everything. Not able to take full lunch breaks. No 10 minute breaks for those who work 4-5 hours. Even though they are supposed to according to their policies. Under staffed. Extremely rude customers thinking that the world revolves around their every beck and call. Management does not know how to actually manage and use their time wisely. I was was never paid for overtime like I was promised in my interview. WAS NEVER TOLD WHEN SEASONAL POSITIONS ENDED OR WHEN MY LAST DAY WAS, NOT A SINGLE HIGHER UP WOULD TELL ANY OF THE SEASONALS."
bad,+I work customer service and cash register
bad,"Typical day take orders, clean store, and cook food but the hours suck. averaged 18hours a week"
bad,The old management was wonderful but new management stinks. They have come in and are cleaning house and literally throwing everything and everyone away. A hardworking person with multiple degrees cannot advance past an $8.00 hr job. No potential for anything here.
bad,Now making people redundant (and then rehiring the same job/grade cause the people that are worth keeping are leaving to go somewhere better).
bad,All is lousy and would never have any of my friends work there.
bad,There's no culture in company. No training. Bring what you know and apply. Staff nice to work with. Senior management needs more people skills. Under paid.
bad,"It was a fun experience the people there was awesome I enjoyed working there. I learned how to do stocking,shop for people online I was taught new things in a  short period of time."
bad,"While working there it was very clear that if I didn't agree with how management wanted to do things, I wouldn't have a job.  They started me off as a full time worker until I was let go after the Christmas season.  Coming back while in school, they signed an agreement stating I would receive 3 evening shifts a week, with 1 weekend included.  "
bad,"You work these hours and you get a check, but when you deposit your check you get a letter from the bank saying that toys r us denied your payment. Nothing like presenting a check and having payment denied."
bad,"So glad they went out of business. Words cannot express how much I ended hating that job and my manager due to poor treatment, I left just shortly before they announced foreclosure."
bad,ToysRUs had quite bad management skills as that place was not a very good place to work at. the staff was very nice however the management of the company could have been better.
bad,"Babies R Us was a fun place to work at but management was not good. They were cutting hours because they were going bankrupt, They also made me do manager duties on my second week working there.  Not many people would help with the cash register or on the floor ."
bad,You are over worked and management only cares about themselves  and if you sell the protection plans. You are forced to work over time during season and have to stay till all go back are put back.
bad,"Was the absolutely worst place I have ever worked. The management was prejudice and would threaten employees, she also ended up stealing money from the company."
bad,"Working at Toys R Us was terrible. The work was never finished, we were always overstocked, and the manager never cared about the store. I would never recommend working at Toys R Us to anyone."
bad,"I enjoyed my job and was paid well for my job. It’s unfortunate the company couldn’t get it together, we were given unaittainable goals. The company filed bankruptcy because we could not pay back debt that the company was stuck with by its previous investors."
bad,Back stabbing and bad management worst job I ever had will never step foot in a toys r us before they go out of buisens again.  change the schedule and not notify the staff.  work schedule was just printed out and left on the break room table.  wouldnt release by department and be forced to work past your hours many times be told I could go home as soon as my department was clean but got stuck there until 2 in the morning waiting for other departments to clean and down stock
bad,"Trabaje en la tienda de los barrios por 13 años durante los cuales tuve un trato discrimitatorio por parte del gerente de la tienda, q finalmente me provocó una depresión debido al mobbing sufrido durante años. La gerencia favorece y perjudica a sus empleados según afinidades personales, aparte de no facilitar los horarios de trabajo con la antelación que debiera y otras irregularidades. Supongo que en el resto de tiendas no será así pero en la de los barrios (Cádiz) ocurren estas cosas"
bad,The job itself was not hard but getting more hours for the job is the hardest part. Everyday we unloaded trucks and stocked shelves. Management were trying hard to cooperate with my needs for more hours but their bosses made it hard to get them.
bad,"Toys R Us is now dead. It doesn't take a genius to figure out how poor the management was to drive an iconic retailer into the ground. Greed, stupidity, mismanagement, silo thinking, all led to its demise. Too bad management couldn't go and the store brand itself could be saved. "
bad,This company unfortunately is by far one of the worse I have ever been employees by. The only truly positive thing that came from my  time with this company that I did have the opportunity to meet some pretty amazing people that years later I am still proud to call friends.
bad,"ToysRUs is closing,  the company went under due to poor management and a lack of proper retail preparation. They did not appreciate their employees or take advantage of their place in the market."
bad,"Going out of business, team members and managers on the store level were kept in the dark up to and including the day we filed for liquidation in court. Our team was great, but we were unable to run the store as we wanted due to lack of cooperation from corporate. Especially towards the end it was much more important to fill out redundant paper work than actually doing work and supervising employees. Never had enough hours so salary managers had to work more and do more work than was really reasonable."
bad,"I found out on the news that I was losing my job. My manager found out only four hours before the news broke. We are receiving no severance pay, no retention bonus, no vacation time payout, and no help finding new employment. Every day at work 100 strangers ask to know the exact date I am losing my job. They offer hollow sympathy, but don't realize how frustrating they're being."
bad,The people are all pretty nice but as far as how much work ad running around you have too do it doesnt seem worth it at all making minimum wage. work real hard for little pay
bad,At times it would seem as if management would bully the staff.
bad,"I worked a seasonal stocker position at Toys R Us. The work was fine and it was good experience, but management was terrible. We got decent hours because of the holidays, but the schedule was inconsistent. Once I came to work just to be told that I had the day off. The only way to check our schedule was on a paper in the break room."
bad,"One manager smelled like a garbage fire and spent more time going on smoke breaks rather than working with his employees, frustratingly annoying work environment."
bad,"I have a manger who takes advantage he cuts hourz to get a bonus he makes his schedule the very last second so you won't know your hours in advance. He doesn't treat his employees like people, he doesn't understand that they have family. He cuts hours last second. He fired a good employee just to rehire one of the females he found attractive. He belittles his employees in front of customers and humiliates them."
bad,"While the job itself is fun, i feel like the expectation of only one associate to complete all of the pricing and signing for a whole toy store is a bit too high.  A lot of the expectations of all the employees seemed to be tough to reach at times, with no clear way to solve the problem."
bad,"The management team didn't really care what happened throughout the day, as long as, it didn't involve treating customers poorly. You get very little to no training."
bad,"If people are just walking out on the job because managers are literally bullying them, I'd say this is not a good place to be working. I would not work here again."
bad,They work you until you are dead and then ask you to come in for extra shifts. If you don't agree then you can expect to have less than 20 hrs next time the schedule is released. Plays favorites a lot and managers will cut hours and give the unwanted task to employees they have personal griefs with.
bad,"Toys r us would be a great place to work if people would get there stiff straight and learn how to manage. The management makes bad decisions and then gets mad when people can't finish the job. There is no training and new employees will walk around doing nothing due to lack of leadership. The job is easy and can be fun at times, but overall it is poorly ran. When asking a question people are rude and don't want to give a straight answer.  I will never work there again even if they ask. The breaks are a joke at night they never call break at the same time and then if u ask about it u r responded with attitude. Can't leave at lunch which is really stupid and you are locked in until 4am. A few of the overnight stockers  are ok, but there is a group who believe everyone  who is seasonal is worthless and only talk about them behind there backs."
bad,"This company is going down the toilet and they know it. Massive amounts of layoffs this year . Rampant favoritism through this particular location,  management is a joke. Nothing but stressed out over worked associates."
bad,"Manager would talk to us like children and belittle us in front of co-workers. The clock im machine wouldn't work sometimes so they ended up having to send us the leftover money, which I didn't recieve until a year later."
bad,"Toys R Us in itself isn't a terrible company to work for. All of my coworkers were very nice, as were my managers and the majority of customers I spoke to. They're good people. That doesn't mean anything in retail, though. "
bad,"The work environment was stressful and busy all of the time. We spent 9 months preparing for season 2016 which failed misery but in service performance on all levels. As a result 55% of the customer service was downsized and 6 weeks the director who led the downsizing was let go. "
bad,"The job was very easy. It was mainly the store location. We went through many managers in an eight month period. I worked extra hard every day and was promised a promotion but instead the new manager that came in brought someone from another store and gave them my position. I worked over hours, my days off, and filled in for many people. I unloaded trucks by myself and they treated me more like a slave than a paid worker. I began to get physically sick every time i would walk in the door because i was so stressed out. I was doing manager jobs but not getting paid the proper wages."
bad,"District manager is very inexperienced, and the company has unrealistic expectations and often changes priorities. leadership is often realigned and reduced this causes a desperate company focus"
bad,"Toys R Us is a business that piles so much onto you at once and expects it to be done in a very short amount of time then you get in huge trouble if it's not done on the expected date.  It's stressful,  they don't work with your hours based on outside life, higher management will schedule you how they want you to work,  making it hard to schedule around appointments, sick kids, etc... Raises are 20 cents a year if your lucky. So if you're looking for a job to support a family,  this is not a job for you."
bad,I learned a lot working here between seasonal and daily tasks . I know how to work under pressure and get the job done reguardless of pressure.
bad,"first starting toys r us was exciting and you learned something new everyday. but once youve been with the company for years, the managers and supervisors start to take advantage of you. it is very unorganized and unpredictable."
bad,Terrible management and no training. Management doesn't help you at all and then gets mad when you screw something up. No communication with current deals or issues. Worst place I've ever worked.
bad,"Nothing about toys r us is worth working there. The management is terrible, the pay and benefits are jokes. Job security doesn't exist. The only redeeming quality is that I didn't have to spend all day there. The downside of this being I would get paid next to nothing."
bad,"This place is fun to work at but unfortunately the upper management Drains the life out of you, once they get use to you they think it's okay to make jokes about you a few feet away from you and also in your face. They don't know how to appreciate their hard working associates. You can come to work happy and one of the upper management people would find a way to turn that around. The bathroom is always dirty and smell really bad mostly everyday and at the end of the day people throw items behind other items and make it look neat so they can leave early."
bad,"When it came to applying for my job there, although it was only part time, they weren't very professional. They relied on me to call them instead of them calling me to find out whether I got the job or not. I went for a group interview on the 23rd of July last year, and I got told that I got the job, for them then to not contact me for over 2 whole months, and whenever I called the manager was always off ill. "
bad,Worked as a cashier at the Aramingo store for seasonal. Definitely not worth $8 an hour.  Worked over 8 hours on Christmas Eve  and did not receive one break even though I kept asking.  If you are working til close expect to leave around 2-4am sometimes. Supervisor doesn't make a good schedule and will make you work til close (4am) and open the next day at 7am.  Also you can't just stand at the register if you have no costumers you always have to be moving and doing something or you'll get yelled at. Most of the people working here were rude.
bad,"All the co-workers were really dull all the time and they weren't enthusiastic, so it was hard to find any fun in it. I would really want to work somewhere where the people are at least talkative and positive."
bad,"The pay is awful plus the benefits are not good. If you work at Toys r Us you have a better chance of getting promoted, yet they promote anyone that is open. (Meaning they don't always make the best choices, some managers are not management material). It is an easy job but it should be good for the 16 year old getting their first job."
bad,"I was hired as a Seasonal Cashier at the Tulsa location across from Woodland Hills Mall and was put at the Customer Service desk for the vast majority of my time there. I handled the store phone, the computer, returns, layaways, and regular cashier traffic. "
bad,A fun place to work. Great co workers and very entertaining. Kids enjoy shopping at Toys R Us because they can play with the toys.
bad,It was okay. I didn't really like all the drama. it was an easy job. I would cash people out when they were done shopping and cleaned up the store when we were about to close. management was alright same with the co-workers.
bad,"I liked working there at first but It turned south really quickly. I was told I would receive 30 hours per week If I accepted a permanent position from seasonal. I took the job only to find out that it is 15 hours per week, and those hours get cut due to traffic in the store. Also the management is mostly filled by people who do not do their jobs properly, they do not follow through with things like in stock walks, count adjustments, etc. This prevents them from being effective. On top of that, they dont communicate amongst themselves creating an environment where one does not know who to listen to, and then sets one up to get reamed for things not getting finished. This of course just speaks of MY experience, but I would not accept the job if given  a second chance. From what I can see, TRU is a dying corporation, where the corporate employees have no idea what goes on at ground level. As evidenced by the fact that they cant even get a floor cap correct or furnish planograms that fit our store."
bad,"The management at this company in the King of Prussia store is terrible. They are mad with power, lazy, and gun-ho on yelling at their employees. I started with the company in Exton and ended in King of Prussia. I worked with them for 6 months, and since I transfered to KOP, my hours have been getting lower and lower every week as a part-time employee. At one point, I was only getting 1 day a week for 4 hours; and my manager knew I had just had a kid. How ironic."
bad,"Toys R Us is a very stressful place to work with few staff and not enough experienced members of staff. This job has helped me become more confident when speaking to people who I have never met, I am comfortable to ask for help when needed and I also enjoy helping others. Management in Toys R Us is not very professional with myself and other coworkers often been left to cover manager responsibilities as there is never enough of them around, however this has helped me to develop as I have had to learn many things very quickly and think on my feet of ways to resolve situations. The most enjoyable part of my job is seeing customers leave with smiles on their faces. As I have been a part of the babies department this year I spend a lot of time with individuals and get to know them quite well. It gives me such great satisfaction when seeing them buy the perfect pram, cot or even baby essentials which suits them best."
bad,"management isvery unprofesional,they want everything from you for $7.75 an hr. and they want give out hrs."
bad,"Management would change faster than employees, it was difficult when you are more experienced in the store than the people in charge."
bad,The head manager was not nice at all and he picks on the workers mostly the cashiers.  I still have not went back into that store and I have a almost 3 year old son.
bad,"learned how to read planograms, be part and lead a team of co workers."
bad,There is very little work/life balance with this company.  Everyone is stretched thin.  Lots of productivity with very little resources.  Turnover for management is high.
bad,"The manager was not what you would expect from a Toys R Us manager. For example; if the manager saw you having difficulty putting labels on the shelves, instead of coming to you and simply showing you an easier way to accomplish your task. He would pull you aside and give you a 10 minute lecture about using your brain and being pro-active and thinking ahead. This wasted his time, my time, and everyone's time when their was a very simple and WAY more polite way of handling the situation. Standard manager with a power trip. Great employees to work with. Fun environment otherwise."
bad,"Toys R Us (Greenville, NC) had always been one of my favorite places to visit as a customer, and now I highly dislike it after working there since I know what the employees have to go through every day. The store is filled with very nice and helpful employees and supervisors, but the store manager was never delightful. She is not a leader by any means, but a boss. She does not respect many of the people she works with and treats them as if they are her servants. "
bad,"Work here at your own risk! The night stock manager audrey is very abusive and degrading! If she's having a bad night everyone is having a bad night. Shes beyond bi-polar one minute she's happy and she loves you the next minute she's standing next to you screaming and cursing as loud as she can in your ear or if she feels like it gets on the over head and screams it. This is not boot camp this is work! And if you think it pays good forget about it. They are always getting some kind of ""nasty letter"" from corporate so they cut your hours so your checks can barely put enough gas in your car to get to work and don't hold your breath on getting a full 8hours when you do finally go to work. I am so angry with company I can keep going and going but I wont so point blank JOB SEEKERS BEWARE!"
bad,part-time was basically 2 days out the week to work managers contradict each other making it hard for workers 
bad,"Poorly managed company from top to bottom. They have a lot of people that feel way to comfortable in their jobs.  There is a MAJOR disconnect between corporate and the actual stores.  Corporate runs a lot of promotions and coupons last minute that often don't work.  Management is left to the dogs with the customers.  If your given a poor distribution center, your selection of products you need in stock come holiday times will lack.  The training is extremely poor, but the concepts are some what simple.  Definitely a sink or swim environment.  The children in the store can be enjoyable and sometimes the customers can be also.  I learned that most of the customers are very serious about toys and will not hesitate to yell at you and tell you you ruined their child's Christmas or birthday, because they chose to shop last minute.   It can definitely be a hostile environment at times.  The only enjoyable part of my job was a few limited employees.  It will be hard for the company to maintain talent over the next few years. "
bad,"Does not flex your schedule at all, cant get out on time anyday."
bad,"Couldn't adavance in this job, very poor management, everyone have 5 to 10 hours a week, pay was extremley to low, treat their employees horrible."
bad,typical day was to go in and do the same routine. co workers did not do there share of the work.
bad,"stocking, replenishing merchandise, unloading trucks, customer service."
bad,"This was some of the hardest work for the lowest pay that I have ever received in my life. It was a typical retail environment geared at intimidating first time seasonal employees with their unrealistic battery, credit card and extended warranty quotas that had to be met or your hours would be cut. The unrealistic expectations extended into the warehouse where you were asked to unpack and stock a semi trailers worth of good in a completely unrealistic amount of time, all the while being berated by a manager who would do anything but help. It was the only work I could find while going to school and the only good that come out of it was that I worked that much harder to get good grades so I could get my degree and escape the giraffe's tyranny."
bad,I really don't want to go over it other than it was not a good time.I could do my job and stock at night but its not good when your coworkers are really bad to be near as people. Its not as though everyone was this way but most of them were. HR and the back room manager were good people thats about it.
bad,Worst place ever to work at. Next time ill be certain to search for a better job. Always looking for new possibilities.. Didn't really like the atmosphere
bad,"Worked hard in back of house for little pay. My training store had many managers cycle through. Each would try to change the system. We would go back to the one that worked when the new way failed. That manager would leave, and a new one would try to change it again."
bad,"Low wages, too many unrealistic expectations and extremely poor management specifically from the store manager. He was late frequently and blamed the other managers for his lack of responsibility."
bad,this was my first official job and I didnt know how horrible this place was until i had been hired at a different place. i had NO luch break or time to rest. they also couldnt keep up with my hours. theyve called me multiple times to show up for work and my name wasnt even on the schedule. i do not recommed.
bad,"my whole life toys -r-us was know as the place to go if you that special toy that had it. that first cabbage patch doll they had it it might cost you some money but toys u us always the best place to go. I am an adult. I used to go sometime just to see what kinda games that store had. or that supper hero figure, If they had it. Of course they did. They were barbie haven,as well as cabbage patch doll world. It like the toy store  they have in New York, they are always talk about. Toys was always ours. When I saw a chance to work there I jumped at it. It was not the store or the managers who kept on having, meeting after meeting,  about my work enviorment, I have a right to go work not be consistently put down and laughed at and called names by younger employees, They should have made it stop it never did."
bad,"It started that I wanted a full time job, but I received just a part-time job. The income was not that great. I needed the money and had to take the job."
bad,"A review at this point doesn't seem to matter anymore, but the site requires it, so here it is..."
bad,Same in summary!!! What kept me alive was my customers which I love and also gonna miss since I left!! My customer motivated me to come to work every day!!!!
bad,being a manager and seeing what now passes as a manager there is a sad thing
bad,terrible place to work wouldn't recommend it to anyone the workplace is very unorganized and you dont know when you'll be getting off its basically slave labor and there are NO benefits at all
bad,"Does not care for its employees at all, makes false promises , no hope of moving up as the managers only help friends and family. Work you hard for little money and expect you to break your back for them but they wont even help you the slightest."
bad,The company has absolutely ZERO job security. They have been hiring people left and right only to find out a few months later that the company was filing Chapter 7 Bankruptcy.
bad,Do not work here. They promised severance to the employees that lost their job due to store closing and then decided to not give anyone a severance package.
bad,"A good place to learn Customer Service and Cashier skills. Hours are good for balancing school and home. Unfortunately, Management is poor and take advantage of their authority. “Popularity” competitiveness was the way to rise up the ranks not by Merit."
bad,Company changes just about everything way too often. Cut way too much payroll. Does not have a solid future at all. Store systems are way behind others.
bad,"Had quite a time with a sexist manager who decided to continually lower my hours until I found a new job. He was new to the store and wanted to replace the old staff with his new. At first the job was fun, it was working at a toy store, but while everyone in management became stressed from the poor company failing, it became a very uncomfortable work environment."
bad,"Long hours, minimal support from management.  Can be a good place to work with better upper management.  Store environment can be fun but is often hampered by the negativity and high number of tasks sent down from corporate"
bad,"En los almacenes de alcala meten mucha caña esta el encargado detras tuya diciendote vamos vamos, no te dejan ni un respiro es duro por que es muy fisico todo pero el tema de encargados te tratan fatal te hablan chillando y si hacen algo mal te hablan super mal  se piensan que somos la ultima colilla pisoteada en el suelo   y el encargado de carga  te mira por emcima del hombro como si no valieras  nada ha ese le ponian en una obra en pleno verano a 50° bajo el sol,  lo bueno que hay buen compañerismos y los empleados son muy majos"
bad,"Although I had one great supervisor, the rest were lacking, and uninvolved. This company had no room for growth, and like many corporations, is only interested in hiring part time workers. a single person working here would not be able to survive living on their own with the income toys r us provides, I would never work here again."
bad,"Toys 'R' Us is a horrible company to work for. Your hours are never guaranteed unless you are fulltime. The management is horrible and it's understandable. Everyone except the store manager is underpaid and miserable.  Moving up is hard, not likely unless someone else steps down."
bad,"horrible management, barely any hours, managers are rude to staff members. I would never work here again. No advancement opportunities. If you want to be yelled at for doing your job in front of customers then this is the perfect place for you."
bad,"This was a very busy store and there was very little time to sit and take a break. I was a merchandise stocker and was hired to stock the sales floor with merchandise. When you would bring merchandise out to the floor, I would get side tracked by customers asking for toys, or if there were any sale items. It was not easy trying to get all the items stocked on the sales floor when you were helping customers throughout the whole sales floor. The other thing that I did not like is that after the Christmas holiday, the store cut most of their employees hours from over 40 a week, to just 8 hours a week. How are you supposed to adjust to that drop in pay? I was not happy with the decisions from the corporate office. The manager at the store was a great manager. She was even unhappy with many decisions that corporate made."
bad,"The interview wasn't even a real interview. They simply asked if everything I put on my application was true. It was a waste of time. And the orientation was a joke. They didn't even give us a tour of the store as intended because she wanted to take her lunch break. I was never given proper training and immediately expected to jump on a register with no experience. My first day was on a busy Friday night with only three other employees working. And I was never told when to come back. I had to come back the next day and practically beg for them to tell me when to come back. Then again, after leaving my second day I was never told when to come back. I didn't receive a call for almost 2 weeks regarding my work schedule. Overall extremely unprofessional and unorganized."
bad,"I enjoy working retail, but this company is making it very difficult to treat customers the way they should be treated due to an extreme lack of hours."
bad,"Very unstable  workplace with constant changes in leadership and focus. If you love not knowing your job responsibilities from week to week, go for it."
bad,The company had to much going on in a bad way. I have been there for for six years and already on my 5th store manager. The company seems to have a high turnover rate. A lot employees are not happy there. The company creates then cuts positions. Causing employees to lose their full-time status and benefits. Which makes you not want to take a higher position in the company. The company seems to have any kind of order.
bad,it would be excellent to work here IF your a parent of anyone under 18 for the discounts alone but most other aspects are rough like there hiring cycle and how many people they let go regularly.
bad,"I know at the store I'm at the managers will be doing very little while everyone else is busting their butts to get their stuff done. It also doesn't help that they will let people call out willy-nilly and use people that have a million tasks as coverage."
bad,Everyday i came in i unloaded the truck and put it all nice and neat on the shelf. I learned about the different toys there were for kids. The management wasn't that great because when you called you can never get a hold of them. very friendly people. I was able to work in my teas shirt and shorts and listen to music.
bad,"Terrible company to work for, as a xmas temp in the role of customer service and till operater i was chucked in the warehouse (never see the tills) .a dangerous warehouse health and saftey issues everywhere . Very little training just  case of this is how you do it get on with it."
bad,"Hated working here. Not a team culture at all and management was horrible. Store was a mess and not organized at all. If i were the CEO of this particular location, store would get shut down"
bad,"I'm honestly glad that the ToysRus is closing soon that I worked at. It was really understaffed, and they would make you come in even if you were sick. They would make me get IC (instant Credits) or I was fired. Or they had us tally how many we received and didn't get. They kept a close eye on us, and spent all our money on a stupid dolphin ride. No one even goes on it and they are giving us hours only to cut them again."
bad,"Most people don't care about their job here. To them it is just something to pay the bills or a stepping stone to a new career. Compensation is not in anyway competitive. They want the most out of you for the least amount of money. No positive feedback, just criticism. Store Manager sits in office on personal phone all day and isn't an active member of the team, only leaves the manager office if directly called or there is a district manager or another higher up than themselves coming to visit to get the store ready. Store manager at the location I worked at had multiple HR complaints, but they would blow over within a week of the complaint and nothing would be solved. Store Manager also acted very inappropriate to opposite gender employees. Best part about working there was helping people find what they needed and seeing the smile on their face. The hardest part of the job was to get a much deserved raise."
bad,"Dealing with management and supervisors was not the best experience. One manager, in particular, harassed me on a daily basis. The quotas for the metrics was also overwhelming, to a point where many employees became anxiety driven. "
bad,"The company is circling the hole and is on the verge of its death knell. It is a toxic toxic place. Only those left are the lifers who have to stay- and that is true at all levels of the company."
bad,"* Restock sales floor"
bad,"Terrible work-life balance and compensation, probably due to tight budgets and uncertain financial future for the company."
bad,"not a very good place to work for job security, mgnt not good."
bad,"I dont reccomend anyone to work at Babies R Us or Toys R Us. They only give ou a raise if you pass their test like it was high school all over again, hours are terrible, pay sucks, everything was bad about these places."
bad,This place slave drives you. You can almost hear the whip crack every time you go on shift. The work is boring and monotonous especially if you work in the distribution centers. Workers have to go through metal detectors to go on break and get scanned by a wand. You have to get 400 boxes of merchandise labeled in an hour. You literally have no life when you work there. It is typical USA corporate drudgery. Don't work for Toys R Us!
bad,"Pretty typical retail environment, there are a lot of very young employees (16 to 20) and as such there is the presence of gossiping and drama. Many members of the management team lack maturity in the way they interact with employees and there have been incidents where management has dealt with employees inappropriately"
bad,"Aside from the great people i met while working there, the company was unwilling to change with the time, never followed its mission statement or goals and the management was absolutely atrocious."
bad,"It was by far the worst company i ever worked for. The company did no car about its people and constantly looked for the short gain, instead of development."
bad,"The management was terrible, regardless of the location. Upper management was in a complete disconnect with the actual retail side of the company. They were constantly pushing for employees to get customers to sign up for their credit card. They would go as far as punishing employees that didn't acquire signups by lowering their weekly hours or not scheduling them at all. They didn't consider this punishment though, because the way they saw it, the employees weren't being ""productive."""
bad,"Reviewing previous days sales, setting up cashiers, review of inventory, goal setting for revenue"
bad,What can I say. Their closed!!!! The best part about working at TRU was the family that we became at our store. We worked hard together and got through many difficult times. We will alays be a family!!! Toys R Us took our jobs but they can never take our bond we have as a family!!!!!
bad,"I loved my job.  As of yesterday I do not have one anymore.  I feel this is thanks to Bain Investment and Dave Brandon.  You people have to be the greediest people in the world.  You caused thousands and thousands and thousands of people to be out of work yet, you got your millions of dollars in bonuses while we get absolutely NOTHING.  No severance, no nothing.  Not even a goodbye and thanks for your years and years and years of service.  Wow. And the poor children that will never get that experience of walking into a store that is nothing but toys.  "
bad,ToysRus is no longer in business. I enjoyed my time there but it could not last. I loved the managers and their attitude but there were a few hard to deal with employees.
bad,"a terrible place to work with horrible bosses. the whole time they looked like they'd rather be elsewhere. I hated it there, the only thing that kept me going is the few friends I made their as well as the mate I applied with."
bad,"Managers would constantly harrass me and would be on my back every time I went to work.  This is why they are going out of business."
bad,"It doesn't really matter anymore, as they have gone bankrupt. It wasn't a great place to work at when I was there. Awful management, awful customers and stressful."
bad,"I worked for Toys""R""Us for 2 months as a seasonal cashier. It was your average cashier job, however there were multiple little things they added in that just made the job so much less enjoyable. The management wasn't very nice or responsive, and it was all about numbers. They expect you to get a certain number of credit card referrals and warranties, they are very unorganized and can send you to do one task somewhere else, and then another employee will have you go to another task before you finished the last one, and then you get scolded for not doing the first thing you were told. There was an extreme lack of communication and only half of the employee's even received a walkie talkie. I came to work sick one day because they refused to let me stay home. I had lost my voice and could hardly stand for 10 minutes at a time, yet they still put me on the register, i.e., interacting with customers who I have to talk to, even though I couldn't physically speak. Definitely do not recommend ever working for Toys""R""Us."
bad,This was my least favorable job I've had. There were too many assistant managers and those that worked hard never got considered for a raise or promotion. I didn't mind the hard work but not getting any consideration for a supervisor position was very unprofessional. They also changed the schedule without informing their employees. This was years ago so hopefully the culture has changed but from what I experienced I would never recommend this company.
bad,"My experience with Toys R Us was as a seasonal part time employee. While I made some good connections within the other seasonal employees and a few of the mid-level Managers, I cant honestly say I'd recommend this company to anyone looking for anything other than just a paycheck. In my opinion its no wonder at all this company has been on the brink of going under for the last 4 months. I've never seen a company of this size managed so poorly. The Store Manager has no clue how his store actually functions, especially from a back of house perspective. He doesn't know who his employees are, nor does he care. He has no idea how to make a schedule either. Human Resources is a complete joke. They rely on ADP for everything and ADP cannot be counted on. As a seasonal employee you're an outsider, though you provide a critically important function to the store and its ability to operate, especially ""in season"". The mid-level Managers work hard, harder than they probably should have to, but they do it with 1 arm tied behind their backs. "
bad,"The management was unprofessional, they made very innapropriate remarks to me. Most of the employees were on drugs, and sometimes they'd be under the influence while on the clock. They shorted me on my paycheck, and are refusing to give a final paycheck to several ex-employees. It's just not a good place."
bad,"Easy to put out the toys neatly. Hard to have to hear rude comments all the time. Supervisors show great disrespect.supervisors play favorites. Being bullied and yelled at is the way supervisors communicate. Human resource is a joke  here.made to feel like the bottom of the barrel, not part of a team  ."
bad,"I started in the customer service department. The people there were nice and fun. "
bad,. Management is absolutely horrible. They don't care. And are power hungry. The turnover rate is through the roof. In the six months I worked there I saw over ten people come and go. On my first day I saw three leave.
bad,The Lafayette IN store is a terrible store to work at. The management is awful. I would not recommend anyone work there unless you enjoy being berated and insulted (or even cursed at) on a daily basis. Toys R Us as a company is not that bad. Though they push selling credit cards and such way too hard. It makes it a lot less enjoyable.
bad,I was hired as a holiday worker and I was scheduled for work often... problem is I also wasn't. This left me working many 8 hour days and receiving pay for as if I only worked a handful of hours. Obvioulsy this soured me to the joy of being there.
bad,"not a well put together place, customers get whatever they want no matter what, management undermines employees the store I unorganized, policies and procedures are null and void"
bad,Both companies are great if your just starting out in the work force. Other than that. I would really suggest working else where. Toys R Us is great for seasonal or after school work. Universal Protection Services is great to start as a security officer. There's no future in either.
bad,Worst management I have ever worked under. Counter productive days. Seemed to not care about that some of us had a family.
bad,"Management is biased, you're rated by who you know, not what you know. Managers have the right of way even when they're wrong. Human resources is not there for the hard working employees. Bad company to work for."
bad,the jobs is good but has very bad management at least the one in queens had a very bad experience but over all its a good job.
bad,"Working with a large number of customers, working on sock, keyholding, visual, register, all at the same time, all the time for months. Little chance to properly advance. This ONLY applies to the store I worked at, I'm sure it's not the same universally."
bad,"Pay is not competitive, after being there 2 years I have gotten 2 raises equaling 16 cents. My bosses were great but even they couldn't help with pay."
bad,"I worked seasonal over nights for holidays."
bad,"Standing all day dealing with sometimes Irate people, you can never  make them happy"
bad,"This job sucked. I tried for months and months to get in full time. Finally a full time posts online and I apply. Get the call for a group interview. Which that raised a flag cause group interviews don't get 1 on 1 with potential employees. I went and am then told they only have part time available and not even for the position I applied to. They hired all 5 of us at the interview. One person texted the whole time and the other wore dirty jeans and a t shirt. So now I start work, they only gave 4 hour shifts I assumed was for training reasons I worked a total of 8 hours my first two weeks then didn't work again for 13 days. I knew alot of what I was doing from other similar jobs in better positions but for someone who just started and didn't know what they were doing that many days off is a mistake. They would forget what they learned in that time frame. The manager clearly had no idea on schedule writing and the store in total should not of had openings if that's the only amount of time the employees could work. I quit after that and pursued other opportunities that will benefit my family better. All in all the job is great if you don't really want to work at all. But if you are relying on it you better start looking somewhere else."
bad,"I started as full time in toys r us but they forced all the general staff in terrible part time schedules, many of us dont even work in an entire week."
bad,"ToysRUs is a company with little to offer.  The pay for supervisors and management is very low and benefits are seriously lacking.  The company is constantly lowering the number of hours to do the job.  In fact, they have a survey when they do projects to see if it was able to be completed with the hours given and if you say no, then someone from higher management will call you to find out why and make it your fault...termination is usually shortly followed.  So, you have to agree, which then encourages them to lower the hours further.  Management does not have your back and there is no training except hands-on-training.  You are looked down upon if you take your breaks so expect to work through them."
bad,Good work place/setting. The pay sucks. Mangement wasn't good.
bad,"I only worked there for about a week. Everyday I was hounded for not selling enough protection plans. As a new employee that never had to do that in my last job it was pretty overwhelming. On top of that managers would belittle and talk down to their employees in front of customers. You can only imagine how embarrassing that is..."
bad,"Great well known company. "
bad,I was a manager in two new York stores in the Bronx omg this company is so bad no payroll they won't more to get done with no hours to get it done no support form the DM or rvp they put so much stress on the managers there I can't even explain it WOW I last about 20 pounds working there. Ask any manager you know that works there and ask them or store manager... Christmas time is the worst they put you on a 6 day work schedule with 1day off!!!! You have no time for your family on the holidays the stores are crazy during the holidays I know every other retail stores are but not like this just go into one during the holidays and look at the people who work there faces. I use to close on the holidays I didn't get out till 4or 5am sometimes that's 15 hours!!!! Under paid associates so they don't wonna work because alot them will get 8 hours for 1week!! Who can live of 8hours a week but it was our job to send them home because we didn't have hours for them so when they did finally work they stole from us or didn't care about anything it was so bad I fell bad for them.... Bottom line is don't ever work for Toys R Us you will regret it MARK MY WORDS!!!! 
bad,"I would come in, wander aimlessly working product waiting for something to do. I would just take care of the people but the managers seemed disconnected. The coworkers were pretty good, but the turnaround rate is ridiculous. The hardest part of the job was following company policy, it was so easy to break it was not funny. If you broke anything, even by accident you were canned."
bad,A typical day is only 3-4 hourly people to work the store when open along with the 1 or 2 managers. Expecting all work to be completed before the store opens but have very little payroll hours to complete the MANY task.
bad,a typical day at work was easy being a cashier although i cant say i learned anything new working there that i hadnt gained from previous employment. this was a temporary position for me working halloween through christmas. my coworkers were very friendly and almost all about the same age as me but being a cashier leaves little time to get to know anyone. the management there never spoke to me in a friendly way but only to ask if i could stay late to work. the most difficult part of the job was how many different in store promotions they wanted you to initiate with each customer and the register prompted automatically at every transaction and the situations somethimes made the customer or myself uncomfortable. the most enjoyable part of the job was the merchandise and seeing everything they had to offer and their birthday club where a child on their birthday gets balloons and an announcement over the pa system and made them feel really special.
bad,"Almost no one cares if you have to eat, breathe, or live. As long as you slave and don't say anything it's ok for them. I couldn't even get a word with the manager when I felt it was an important situation because he would ignore me as if I had never said anything. And, I was the Front End Supervisor and he ignored me,imagine the other associates."
bad,I got this job as a temporary thing just as i looked for better work.  The entire corporation shut its dors so i definitely would not advise working there.
bad,"I worked at Toys R Us for eight years. I started off as a Sales Associate but then was promoted to Electronics Specialist. I was mostly in the R Zone (Electronics area) but I often helped out with other duties. The co-workers weren't bad, neither were most of the assistant managers and store manager. The main problem was corporate. They were cheap with the hours so even when I did get them, it was a bit overwhelming since there wasn't a lot of help as everyone else was doing their own duties. Also, they pushed metrics (IE: reward cards, credit cars, etc) without any incentives. I'm not saying we should have got anything special for doing our jobs but they at least allowed us to get more hours so we could get more help. Needless to say, the company went out of business as those in charge were more concerned with padding their pockets than following their companies motto of kids first."
bad,Babies R Us was a great place to work but Toys R Us ruined it. So unfortunate that it is closing also. Could've survived as a separate company if they just focused on our side of the business more. Our business was year round
bad,"I suppose this does not really matter since they are going out of business. However, a normal day here was slow usually. Holidays like Christmas and Easter were more busy. Work was fairly simple and just required you to stand for long periods of time doing nothing."
bad,nobody at the job would barely do their job and would just talk and be on their cell phones most of the times. the workplace culture was okay but everybody didn't fit in.
bad,I really enjoyed my 30+ yrs at TRU.  Most enjoyable part was interacting with the kids and families.  We learned to work with others and being management to solve issue
bad,"At first I loved working here, but eventually it was the worst place to work at. Some management wouldn't log your holidays in even with months in advance notice and reminding, meaning you were put on while not in the country. Shifts died down after Christmas to one every 2 weeks. Some of management were great, but a lot were terrible."
bad,"A typical day would be 6 hr sifts , so they didn't have to give you a lunch break,  then stick you on a register all day. when a customer comes to buy a big item, u have to call for it over a radio(which was really hard to hear and that was when they answered). then she have to wait for them to find the item, which could would take a while and then if they would it wait again to bring it up front for the customer."
bad,"I enjoy working as a Toys-R-Us Team Member, however, I believe they have over-staffed these part-time positions, as they frequently cut hours or reduce shift times."
bad,"Some managers are a joy. Store manager was horrible, slightly perverted and often make us uncomfortable. Often felt stretched too thin having to juggle too many jobs at once because said manager wanted to save money for his big bonus at the end of the year. Nasty customers often, some coworkers tried to make the best of it."
bad,"This job is only good for part time. I worked there for 4 years as a supervisor and there are a lot of promises made but nothing is followed through. When you are offered a promotion they might give you $1.05 and anything over that has to be approved by the higher ups but they shoot everything down. As a supervisor there were a lot of times that I had to close the store with 3 other team members that could not move too far away from their area; customer service, cashier, and electronics cashier which left me to be the only one on the sales floor for both toy side and baby side."
bad,Loved my co worker's.Manager runs the store by his likes of people not by the needs of the store.Morning shifts are better than nights.Guest stole daily.No structure or rules that everyone goes by.
bad,"Great first job. You get a lot of experience trying new things to find what you are good at. The most enjoyable part is seeing newborns, and little kids every day."
bad,No work life balance. Just work. Difficult job that is very demanding. Long hours that are filled with challenges and labor. Very difficult to staff and run properly.
bad,12 years with TRU.  Promoted 4 times.  Opened several new stores. 4 years multi unit experience and 8 years Store Manager experience.  Great company!!
bad,"Worst place to work for. I barely worked there before I made the choice to leave. Management is terrible. Employees always complained on how they felt about working there and how the management is terrible. I was harassed when I had to work by one of the managers. He was very unprofessional, abused his power, and made fools of the employees. I almost had no hours and closing was terrible. You weren't allowed to leave until everything was spotless and not only did you have to leave when everything was done, but you had to leave with everyone who was on the shift. Very ridiculous because the store would close at 8:00pm on Sunday's and I wouldn't be out of there until almost 11pm. Also, long lines were always a problem which made customers unhappy. This store is ALWAYS hiring and now I see why."
bad,"I learned a lot , ive done cashiering , store room worker , started there doing janitorial maintenance , ive recently been doin pricing and signage."
bad,"Low wages, little to no benefits, flat out lies from store and regional management. Constantly understaffed. Store management changed constantly, some good, most not. Overall policies are inane."
bad,Good place to work for a pay check but there is no appreciation for the little man. 
bad,"Worked part-time at a new branch of the store. Helped with the opening, decorating, and setting up of this store. Cashiered, helped customers. The management didn't want to listen to anyone. My co-workers were very clique and not very nice, with a few exceptions. I did not like going out into the mall demonstrating the newest remote control toy, or dressing like Geoffrey the Giraffe. Working with the public made this job more tolerable."
bad,I worked there for quite some time and I loved. Only problem was when I had health problems which I am on disability I could never get a hold of a manager and depended on one of the employees working at customer service. They would yell at me cause they said why you working here if your on disability. I was a very hard worker there I would have most of my work done by myself before a whole team would. I would not recommend any family or friend to work there.
bad,"Company is no longer a family oriented place to work at it's all about making money....Thks.To the new 3 business owners..I was laidoff only after 16yrs. Because company outsource to,a different , and cheaper , driving company."
bad,A typical day consists of operating cash register
bad,"I was hired at the closest Babies R Us after working the christmas seaon at Toys. The management and my co workers are friendly enough, but the pressure to obtain bpp's and ic's and all the other stuff they want you to shove down the customer's throat is stressful. When customer comes through my lane i am required to ask if they've found what they're looking for, if they're shopping off a registry, if they have/want to get a rewards card, if they want any available protection plans, if they need batteries (Even if what they are purchasing doesn't require any), try to sign them up for a credit card and then see if they'll fork over any extra cash for whatever charity we're collecting for at the time. The management pushes you to sell, sell, sell and doesn't take into account that it's not in my hands whether or not a customer wants a protection plan or not, but my performance is based on it. Combine that with the coupons that don't work for anything, the old, glitchy machines that make each checkout harder than it needs to be, a rewards program that gives you a runaround to actually use your points and an understaffed store and it's a miracle anyone walks out a satisfied customer. The most enjoyable part of my job is when my shift is over and i can get out of that forsaken place."
bad,"I would never work or tell anyone to work for toysrus, it's depressing and your made to feel rubbish your expected to do so much in not enough hours you get locked in the store up to over a hour over your shift to tidy  lack of breaks"
bad,"La fijas te odian más que nada, la jefa lo único que hace es hablarte mal y gritarte"
bad,Assembling bicycles and other items purchased at the store. Ocassionally helped consumers load purchases in their vehicles. Enjoyed working for the company.
bad,The management at toys r us are a bunch of idiots.  They hire just anyone . I would set up the interviews and know right away that the fit was not right but they would get hired and leave a week later. The job id for kids. The pay is terrible. There is no training whatsoever. No wonder they closed down.
bad,The store manager was a very difficult person to deal with if he was having a bad day he would generally take his anger out on everyone in the vicinity as in yelling. He was eventually fired. but he may have had the last laugh seeing as the company is now out of busness.
bad,"Although TRU is currently moving towards liquidation, I will never forget what I have learned there and the dedicated staff that gave this company their all.  The most enjoyable part of my job was bringing joy to children on a daily basis with the product that I was creating in the Private Brands Department."
bad,alot of moving issues with a suffering business model.  Company is financially stressed to the point they cannot invest in their stores or online business
bad,"The store that I work at is closing on March 31,2018 so now I looking for another full time job but not definitely in retail.  The typical day at the job would be I clock in go to the guest service and check out people do returns and deals with customers issues. if i could not resolve the issues I would call the manger on the duty to handle the situations."
bad,Nice work enviroment if you were working with the right team members.I also learned when you are not wanted you can be pushed out the door by uper managedment if they do not like you.The hardest part of the job was picking furniture and the most enjoyable part was you had good co workers who were willing to help you out in working situations difficult or not.
bad,"Never recommend they use you and the culture in the store is mainly Hispanic not a fun place to work needs diversity and better management, store manager is unprofessional and plays favoritism to Hispanics and he is Hispanic. Black customers are followed when they go in store, store manger directs the team to follow them cuz they maybe stealing so does the assistant manager,"
bad,You would apply for a certain job there at Toys R Us but they would make do everything in the store and the pay wasn't even worth for what you were doing.
bad,"They weren't the cleanest of working conditions as behind the aisles and various parts of the floor were filthy, the managers were very rude and weren't the best at giving shifts and I learned that I can work for far better companies and be appreciated for the amount of work and effort I put in."
bad,"Was doing great in my year+ as a supervisor; built the position up from nothing by creating relationships with guests and vendors. Was given one days notice (""Today will be your last shift"") when I was ""let go"". (Company-wide supervisor layoffs- my supervisor position was safe but I was let go so one of the older ladies who's position was dissolved could take mine.... they were ""more tenured than me and therefore deserved to stay"") Doesn't seem fair to me, but that's how this company works, apparently."
bad,"The mamangement is always on a power trip and barley lets you have any freedom. The coworkers are wonderful! But, you leave work sore and over worked."
bad,"Sink or swim atmosphere.  If your a young pretty girl, most likely will climb the ladder fast. They downsize about 2 times every year.  You get a new CEO every other year."
bad,Store closed due to lack of corporate mismanagement . Was a great place to work . I enjoyed the management staff that I worked with . Flexible scheduling
bad,"Work late hours, required to work from home on the weekends (no over time pay). There is no balance of work and personal life. "
bad,"Amazing place to start as my first job, loved the people I worked with and the management. only issue was the long hours over Christmas and the pay rate"
bad,the company failed to initiate long term vision while struggling with short term action
bad,"understaffed, disorganized, very few nice employees, not a single person gets fired, nothing gets done or fixed until the very last minute. would not recommend if you have anxiety."
bad,"Management both at a local level and company level are pitiful.  Don't get me wrong, there are awesome people in both.  The problem is that the tips of the pyramids are...a bit dull."
bad,I would restock the shelves all day or not. They always gave me closing shifts. I learned how to restock shelves. I loved my co-works it was fun to be around them. I really dint like about my job is working black Friday. I enjoyed helping the customers
bad,"It was an okay job, Something that said ""I got a taste of sales and black Friday shoppers"". Not something I would do again for the pay was low and a little sketchy."
bad,A typical warehouse... working there was ok but they lack hours and if you're new they treat you with no respect. they pay is good and but the cafeteria is crowded and could use more cleaning.
bad,They closed down and were having issues with properly managing the workflow and letting us get things done. or motivating some of the workers to work on time.
bad,The company closed and is no longer operating.  The company was put out of business by huge debt incurred by owners that took over the company after it became a public company.
bad,"great place to work.fun  atmosphere  childrens playhouse.bikes power wheels,laser tag and dolls.baby stuff.video games and musical instruments.and sports"
bad,"Went from early morninig shifts to Graveyard, there was only four of us most nights, didn't talk to them much honestly i don't remember their names. I remember putting in a request time off slip and it was still there the day i left for vacation"
bad,"I worked at toys r us seasonal, and I did a pretty good job getting credit cards. The main manager was fired and he was the best to get the job done. The other managers lack professionalism and they even say bad words to me, cussing me out. Stay away from toys r us aventura. You’re replaceable they don’t care about you. They don’t explain the rules and they tell you it’s fine to do something and then yell at you saying you did it wrong. You get fired due to their unprofessionalism."
bad,"It was an awful company to work for, bullying, rude management - would never work for them again - very judgemental staff and very cliquey - the manager never apologised once for falsely accusing me of things that he chose to push me out of the door with - no proof, no evidence that i had even done anything"
bad,I learned basic skills nothing major environment was fast paced and knowledgeable and very friendly only worked there temporarily
bad,"badly run, lazy incompetent  management, treated bad"
bad,"The management was very unorganized, there was no chain of command."
bad,Gained lot of customer service experience from this job. I enjoyed greeting customers and making them satisfied with their pursuance or return.
bad,Alright job worked there when I was younger as my first proper job was just quick cash but bad pay but was good enough at the time had good times at this job
bad,"After 70 Years of delighting children around the world, Toys R Us is ending operations in the United States."
bad,There is not enough room for growth within the company and there are no benefits. Hardly any hours are given to employees.
bad,Fast paced environment. The warehouse location I worked for has closed down back in 2018. Which caused me to look for a new job. Hours became shorter by the day
bad,"worked for a couple years. Worked as Assistant Manager . Optimizing profits by controlling cost. Hiring, training and developing new employees ! Resolving and helping customers issues to their satisfaction !  Completing task assigned by the general manager efficiently."
bad,"The company is full of nonsense they would make u work extra hours and pay you for normal hours, all they do is retrenchment when they feel like not paying people."
bad,"This was one of the most stressful, unfair, and rude places I've ever worked.  The customers were some of the most entitled people I've EVER met, and the managers were miserable and projected onto me and other temporary employees."
bad,"It was not a fun experience, I worked all around the store and did more than even my job description and yet I wasn't worth it to them because I didn't sell a credit card. Really shows now that they have gone under which is unfortunate but at least they can not overwork anyone else and pay them less then they are worth."
bad,"Again, not sure what to put here since the company went bankrupt in the United States and closed its doors years after I no longer worked there. Only 6 characters to go...."
bad,"Great first job, got hired on after seasonal. The company is now out of business so of course I wouldn't recommend to anyone else as they will not be able to apply."
bad,"It was very fast-paced, overworked and severely underpaid. Some managers didn't know how to run the store properly. Unfair treatment to some of the employees."
bad,"Poorly run, Not in touch with customers wants. Always behind the newest trends. Pay rates behind the norm for this area. Full time emplyees do not make enough to support an independent lifestyle."
bad,"All Toys R Us stores are closed down, permanently closed down. This is because Toys R Us are bankrupt and underwent liquidation of all assets and are out of business"
bad,Toys r us was a fun place to work. Unfortunately had a very poor upper management. Very low pay compared to other retail locations No proper training available..
bad,working here was horrible. i was not being paid overtime. i was forced to stay pass the time i was scheduled to be off and i was not being paid for that time
bad,Not a fun place to work and honestly some of the most boring two years of my life.  The sales plan was not that great and the pricing on everything there is way too high overall bad company for this generation
bad,"Working at toys r us was Fine , I thought it would of Beene a fun job to work at because of the toys but it really is boring kind of when it get slow ."
bad,"This company is going out of business, therefore would not recommend for job opportunities. While working there it provided me with what I needed. But"
bad,I would not recommend toys r is they are not considerate nor are they flexible. They do not give you breaks when you are supposed to also they are not very friendly amongst each other
bad,"I worked here while going to college full time. I had 8am classes and caught the bus but management continued to schedule me for closing shifts in which i had no way home because the bus stopped running at a certain time. They never fired me, just stopped giving me hours on the schedule. Supervisors would frequently take two week vacations with no explanation."
bad,Toys R US was a great place.  Myself and most staff gave 110% because we loved the work and the company.  In the end many factors out of my control cause a massive layoff due to bankruptcy
bad,It was fun while it lasted a shame to see whats happening to the company. Leadership from the regional and district level  was solid and fair . Also provided feedback in a positive and constructive way to maintaina positive outlook during tough times
bad,"You will get only 2 days to work per week, they tell you that you get more hours the more credit cards you open for customers and I still never get those hours"
bad,I worked very hard to get to my supervisor position.. Management NEVER trains any of the employees management expects for the employees to know how to do things and then when the employees don't know how to do things management gives a write up but how can you give a write up if the employees weren't properly trained
bad,"Store manager is very passive aggressive about sales and makes new workers completely uncomfortable."
bad,"While working at this position, myself and others felt that the management was not appropriate in their conduct. In particular, one manager had the tendency to single myself out and was very respectful and down putting towards myself."
bad,"I worked as a janitor, i cleaned the store.  it was a fun place when it started.  but, i didn't see any chance to move up at the store and the internal politics was horrible."
bad,This job was ran very poorly. They scheduled us in a way that made it almost impossible to go to school or have a social life. They did not communicate well with workers.
bad,staffing partners is horrible they only pick hispanic skinny females that dont even work so  much drama no one wanted to do what they were suppose too. it was not a good time but the managers were amazing i wish they would of worked harder to disciplined the empolyees..
bad,"No support, was hired as permanent and treated as a temp. Did good work (have previous experience in field), and organization was terrible. Understaffed and undertrained in proprietary systems."
bad,"Just took job because difficult at time to find anything else. Great experience, but lousy management, benefits, team work, over all feeling was unnecessary and unappreciative."
bad,"Job was poor. Not the best job to have, worst job ever. unorganized. The people there not nice. There was no hardest part of the job nither."
bad,"Job was demanding and long. Barely any room for advancement and they require you to ""sell"" their credit card to gain any sort of recognition."
bad,Started off in the backroom and it was terrible. Moved to the sales floor and zoning was a nightmare. Pay was terrible and the management was even worse. Got let go the day after Christmas without much warning. It's great if you can move up in the ranks.
bad,"Despite providing great customer service each day, customers felt the need to treat me like garbage. Little opportunity for advancement. The only thing I liked about this job was meeting babies and kids of all ages."
bad,during holidays is busy but it is the best time to work .. management is great
bad,"I only worked there a month as a seasonal employee. I don't understand why this is something I have to share to post a resume on this site. Toys R Us is busy around Christmas, not so much the rest of the year."
bad,"After clocking in I would work the customer service counter. I really enjoyed the job and most of the people I worked with. I very much enjoyed getting to interact with the customers, especially the kids to help them find what they needed. The only problem I ran into with this job was that I was not getting enough hours. I was told that I would be getting full-time hours but continued to get usually around 8 hours a week split into 2 or 3 shifts. It got to a point that it wasn't worth the gas driving to work."
bad,"It was terrible, and the job was seasonal. The hours were 1030pm-630am..."
bad,Loved helping customer's find that perfect gift for their loved one.
bad,"Treated like a temporary employee, supervisors didn't even bother to know my name. Lame!"
bad,"A 4 hour shedule preparing the store for opening and initiating help as an sales associate for guest services,larned how to change electrical ballast for 4 ft and 8 ft light fixtures and the changing of light tubes.updateing and submiting maintenance supplies list with managemant,work with co workers in phase changes projects in multi areas of store,hardest part would be to perform some project task without functionable tools, the best part is to abe able to stay ahead ,anticipating future outlook request and meeting dealines."
bad,"I have little to say about this job, but my experience was horrible. The management had no idea what they were doing and the co-workers were not too bright."
bad,"The mangers had their pick on who to give more hours too. Unexpted long hours without notice. The mangers where not very understanding,"
bad,The company is extremely slow during the winter. To make up time they have you make telemarketing calls.
bad,This job was not for me. The environment was depressing and I didn't feel like it was much of a challenge.
bad,"The worst part about this job is the credit cards. The demand for you to get customers to sign up for a credit card is ridiculous. Most people did not want them as they barely came into the store. I also hated that the management was rarely around. If anything ever went wrong, it took MINUTES for someone for management to finally show up."
bad,"Before all of the uncertainty with the bankruptcy, it was a great opportunity. I moved up quickly and learned  a lot. It was the people I worked with directly and the wonderful customers that really made it a job I loved."
bad,Was a fun and exciting place until the closures began and they turned their back on their employees.  They pulled promised severance packages from employees and are letting folks with 20 plus years l3ave with nothing to fend for themselves
bad,"Manager was greedy."
bad,i cleaned  up buildings worked outdoors sweeping and taking out the trash.
bad,"I would provide customer service to guests,"
bad,The management and co-workers were nice to me from the beginning till my contract ended. I learn few new things but nothing special. The most enjoyable part of the job were stocking the toys.
bad,"A typical day at work for me at Toy 'R' us was always fast paced and always packed with people. I also loved working there because it was very fun and it was a great experience. I definitely learned to be more patient and My manager was definitely understanding, responsible and professional. The hardest part of the job was putting things back where there belong and having a lot of people come to you at once with questions ,opinions and need of advise but that was also the most fun part of the job. I love jobs where you are very busy because time goes fast and I like to go home knowing I got my job done."
bad,"My first year was great, I advanced up to shipping and recieving supervisor. I like working back of house, the early morning 5am-2pm shifts. Till the day came when we showed up to work and there was a pad lock on the door."
bad,"It was a seasonal job for the holiday. I wasn't getting enough hours to afford the drive to get there. When the season was up, I left and looked for a job closer to home that provided more hours."
bad,the job was horrible they cared more about cash than the employees or the customers it was just horrible last few years there i would never go back...
bad,The manager would not listen to me when I explained my availability and tried to force me to work hours I could not. They were very rude and on days I was sick they would tell me to come in anyways.
bad,"They took a great company and ran it into the ground.It started very well....now..nothing. Corporate greed at it's best.  Long hours, running a skeleton crew while trying to help people.."
bad,"Rude coworkers and customers, slow paced, low payed and stressful job. Sometimes you get scheduled everyday, some other time you stay weeks without working."
bad,Co workers were not friendly and management was rude. Did not like the work environment and the job was boring and hard labor. Worst work experience I have experienced.
bad,Managers favored some associates over others and little to no time for  decent work hours. Too much pitching for store credit cards and under staffed.
bad,The stores are in overall disarray because of a lack of leadership from the top down. We are given unrealistic goals and not given the tools we need to execute our jobs properly.
bad,Worst job I ever worked would not recommend it to say the least. People made their own schedule  with no repercussions. Management was worse than hourly employees.
bad,"job was awful, absolute worst job i could ever have, management was awful, everyone mistreated non full time employees because they seemed lesser, managers always in bad mood"
bad,there were never enough employees or managers in the building to maintain a large store. Customers were never happy. employees were never happy. Upper management was never happy.
bad,"Could be amazing company. Some of the employees are very talented and have huge potential, but a lot of the work policies are unclear and the ever-changing directions make the job very unpleasant. Upper management is very disconnected."
bad,This was definitely a rough job to have especially over black friday. Pop up store with very low customer foot traffic. The stock was overflow and clearance
bad,"from 2012 to 2015 if you bought a bike during seasonal times, chances are if was assembled by me. the last season (2014-2015) I worked at Toys R Us was utter Chaos. Many of the people I've worked with since I've started were either fired of just quit before they would be fired. These weren't bad employees, just employees put in impossible situations basically forced to produce results with inadequate resources. Just about 5 assistant manager either quit their jobs or had gotten fired in the course of 3 months. Utter Chaos."
bad,"disrespectful, and no fun comes out of it. small break room, they only care about the customers and not the employees. the only good that comes out of it. was seeing kids happy when they got there toys"
bad,They expect you to work alone and lift 150 -300 Ib cribs dressers and pools. 90 percent of the workers are females. No back of house coverage. Inventory sucks.
bad,"poor hours and little to no advancement. management has been there for years and they already have favorites, the favorites do not do any work and get paid to do nothing."
bad,Customer service register work graphing and collecting carts store toys condense and keep store clean pays not that good but is good for college students
bad,"I am not going to sugar coat this job at all, it is a tough atmosphere with customers demanding a quick answer to their questions. Management had great goals and an excellent attitude toward reaching those goals, but they were hard to carry out with unenthusiastic employees looking to go home early, but expecting to get paid more. Working there at Christmas time was the hardest, and the hours worked definitely affected personal life, but I am still gratefuI had the experience of working here."
bad,"restocked merchandise in an organized fashion and reported to management about low inventory levels."
bad,management is rude. guilt trips over call outs. ignores availability. stern with customers. publicly reprimands workers. limited training. and minimum wage
bad,Typical day was coming in counting registers and scheduling breaks/zones for associates. Helping stock team finish any floor plan before the store opened. Also helping in guest services with issues with the prior purchases and voids.
bad,"A day at work would consist of packing and shipping out items. It wasn't that great of a job, I didn't really talk to anyone. The management was too unorganized for me. Hardest part of the job would be walking around in a hot environment all day. The hands down most enjoyable part of the job was the weekly pay!"
bad,"Short, most times nonexistent breaks"
bad,"A typical day at work for me used to be my stress reliever. I started working at Toys R Us as a seasonal cashier and was hired on permanently I became head cashier and then front end supervisor. I work in every department such as babies, electronics, cashiering, and in the cash office. I am the problem solver. My knowledge of working for Toys R Us has been a great experience. Now I have been promoted to Human Resources Manager.The most enjoyable part of the job is every one looks up to me for helping them out and satisfying guests."
bad,"Not the greatest place for anyone with a family, a lot of time is spent here during holidays like any other retail company."
bad,I didn't particularly like working at Babies R us. The only part I did like was seeing the children and new borns come into the store. I also like working in the apparel section of the store. The managers are alright some of them are likable.
bad,"A race to the bottom, cutting costs no matter the effect on the business. Myopic goals and expectations."
bad,"Poor mangment, no communication poor working enviroment."
bad,"I was not trained properly. Had to learn a lot on my own. Management does not confront you on your faults they rather talk behind your back."
bad,"Great location ,fun place to work,you stay busy all day long but the pay was bad and it can be stressful as well but I'm grateful I had the opportunity to work at toy r us it was a great learning experience"
bad,Trained and was a peer coach for the infant care and customer service to new sales associates. Developed positive customer relationships through friendly greetings and excellent service with helping them with needs for their new baby or children
bad,"At times you didn't get a break, management just didn't seem to care."
bad,good company good hours only a seasonal position i didnt work here very long
bad,"A typical day would be me putting away the daily shipment of toys, replenish the stock of the toys that where sold that day, keep the work area clean. my co-workers work friendly and very easy to get along with. the hardest part was getting use to the over night shift. the most enjoyable part was working with friendly people."
bad,"A typical day at work is very slow paced work. Not that many customers. My co-workers where very nice. The hardest part of the job was, standing at the cashier and doing nothing. The most enjoyable part of the job was seasonal!"
bad,"I would like to assume that it was perhaps just my store in particular that wasn't fantastic to work in. "
bad,More interested in punishing people. Poor management.Work colleagues are nice but deserve better.Not much provided for staff. Hot Food / clean canteen / TV / Music
bad,"Everyday was a new challenge"
bad,"My job as back of house management involved receiving trucks and maintaining the backroom. Constant interference from upper management on how schedules were made, made sure that trucks were not processed orderly and that my job and my crew could not do their daily work. My crew was constantly pulled to run the floor as the culture expected every TRU employee to be a jack-of-all-trades even though they were not hired or trained for other roles. I am glad I left."
bad,"Didnt like working at toys r us the people were rude and my manager didnt even care if anyone got hurt or if they had a family emergency.  There was no insurance offered, and I was hurt there and they blamed me like it was my fault."
bad,My first year was awesome til me and my manager had a falling out then my hours got dropped from 40 a week to 15 sometimes one day a week. He was very unethical and now i see why the business went down hill. No one had anything nice to say about my manager in our reviews so obviously it wasnt me
bad,"Management cut corners where ever they could, didn't care about about their employees. Had to constantly cut hours and didn't give raises to those employees who were promised them."
bad,They work you till you get burned out they do not give time off when it is needed. they will move you to different  departments without any training poor management
bad,Toys r us did not offer programs to.help advance it's employee's.it did not provide us with proper training you were thrown into.a position and had to self reach yourself
bad,It went out of business. I am only filling this out because it asked me to to continue to apply for jobs. I hated working here and was rehired during liquidation for some quick cash. Very attached to coworkers but that is all i will miss
bad,Toys r us has terrible management. They want you to work when they want you too and don't respect if you have an important thing to do that day. Very rude employees too.
bad,"This place is shut down. No more Tru. When employed hours was 8-10 a day, 6 days a week. $12 an hour. Managers there didnt know what they were doing at anytime. Bad place."
bad,This company is going out of business.  I can understand why.  Working inconsistent hours and not trained well.  Under pressure to sell and promote credit cards all the time.
bad,"Just want warm bodies. Cold atmosphere. Micro manager. Scheduling errors, no work life balance. No rapport amongst employees.I was not even introduced to the team as a new manager."
bad,"Long hours with very little breaks for management or Supervisors. However, if you work part time you will get little to no hours."
bad,"Toys R Us can be a nice friendly place to work, however the jobs that are required can be exhausting especially over season. majority of people would believe that employees get a chance to play with toys or interact with children, however this is not the case. Due to cuts in number of staff allocated to the shopfloor, employees find themselves rushing around trying to cover several sections at the same time. the variety in stock recently has been quite poor and research into the hot toys for season is terrible. retailers like Asda and Tesco are aqquiring more lines of the 'hot toys' than the supossed UK leading toy retailer. Staff can be very friendly and friendships can be developed easily."
bad,"I didn't like working at the oakview toys r us. The management is awful. They were unfair to employees and it was clear they had their favorites. It was difficult to take time off, or even call in sick and their check out clerk expectations were almost impossible."
bad,"The ToysRus in Pineville, North Carolina was so unprofessional and unorganized. There were often times employees had to miss out on breaks and stay extended shifts. They were very inconsiderate to personal needs/issues and only worried about the store. The managers were never available to communicate and didn't respond to messages or phone calls. The customer service desk was the only source of communication and there were times when customer service wouldn't answer the phone."
bad,Working at Toys R Us was just a part time job.  I just did it to earn extra money while I was unemployed.  The position allowed me to use my skills with baby products to sell products.
bad,"this was a seasonal job, during non holiday times it was beyond too slow paced and not enough hours at all this is a decent place for a new beginner to get a job not for someone with a family and bills,"
bad,"You have to do all the work management should be doing, you get stressed out from all the work, the job isn't worth the pay.  You have to argue with employees to get their work done.  They don't do good background checks so you have to deal with people who really don't even want to work."
bad,"It was a pretty easy but fast paced job environment. I liked it but got way too stressed out about it especially when you are not properly trained, you're just thrown in there assuming how to handle everything. It was always about credit cards and the management was for the most part, pretty terrible."
bad,"Good place to start if you don't have any experience. Horrible if you don't like to have to shove credit cards down people's throats and ruin credit. I was constantly spied on and pulled out of the back from my work to try to get people to sign up for credit cards. It was difficult to get work done because that was literally all they focused on. There is no reward for signing people up. No incentive. They also don't pay holiday pay but want expect you to work during these times. They need a union badly. If you are just getting seasonal work and don't plan to stay there, it's a great starter job. I would never make it a career job. Not ever.  My advice is to get the job and use it as a source of income until you get another job as quick as you can."
bad,the company is out dated and treat employees like they are in a prison camp. i would rather work for sports direct or travel with goonies for one eyed willies treasure
bad,One manager tells you one thing another tells you something different and if don't listen to one other get mad at you. The whole job just really was terrible
bad,"I only worked at Toys-R-Us for about 2 months during the seasonal time,(Christmas), but during that time I found that it was a fun place to work, and my co-workers were nice for the most part, but the guests were rude and they didn't really train me fully on the register or give me a real training session so I wasn't comfortable enough or quick enough and that held up people which made them mad and caused frustration for me and my managers. Sometimes they put me on the floor to help people find things and put other things away that previous guests didn't want.  That was better then being stuck behind the register all day, but I had never been to that store so I didn't know exactly where everything was, so it took me awhile to find things.   I had walkies, which helped a little but nobody would help you and the managers ignored you half the time. The managers got mad if you ever asked a question and made you feel like an idiot in front of the guests.The other cashiers and co-workers I worked with were great, and the discount was really great but other than that, it was not my favorite job. I like being a cashier, but when I get treated wrong and don't get full training and talked down to because I asked a simple question, that's not good. The hardest part of the job was selling credit cards and warranties.  It was easy, but stressful at times when it was really busy."
bad,"Management didn't care what you had going on at home, you needed to be at work, customers very stressful. Staff wasn't always the greatest, people called in and quit way too often."
bad,"I was hired on for a leadership role. After the conclusion of holiday season 2004, my status was changed to seasonal and I was promptly let go without warning."
bad,"While I'm positive that not all Babies R Us stores have terrible management, the one that I work for does not. The only plus to working here is that I now have a better understanding of working with incredibly difficult people."
bad,"The store is just unorganized. It was just a bad experience for me. Took hours off my pay without me knowing, just horrible."
bad,there is a lot to do and not enough time or staff. very low on hours for employees and management has to pick up the slack and work longer hours and not get compensated
bad,I really enjoy this work but its only seasonal. The boss is very pleasant and easy to get along with. the hours are not the best. but I have to do what I have to do to take care of my family.
bad,"Not a supportive working environment. "
bad,A typical day at work involves stocking the store and working out frieght. I've learned how to sell product and correctly stock a store to make it visibly easy for customers.
bad,Want you to bust you butt for little pay. Will not cross train to obtain more hours.  Was flat out told don't expect a raise no more than .10-.15 cents even when you get a HIGH review.
bad,"coworkers were hard working, company policies did not fit the actual day to day operations, compensation for work expected was poor at best, culture of negative feedback to motivate workers, company policies and goals were strictly bottom line driven with little or no customer service component"
bad,I learned how to work the register. Most of the co-workers were nice and helpful. But they need to improve on their organization.
bad,hours were grueling and the breaks were very short. management was over-demanding and pushy. One manager yelled at me and a family member came in to curse him out for being so rude.
bad,Pay is horrible. Your lucky to get  a $ .05 raise once a year. No help from the managers.
bad,The co workers were very friendly. i learned stuff about baby items.
bad,I started seasonal and they liked me enough to hire me full time but cut my hours dramatically. Kept changing schedule with no notice or contacting anyone. Co-workers did most of the work while manager just walked and talked to other managers.
bad,"Working for this company, they put profits ahead of someone's security. They hire only low paid workers so that managers and other higher end workers get paid well."
bad,Management was not organized. Come in not knowing where im going to be placed. The job was not hard just very unorganized. I thought they was going to keep me and they let me go.
bad,"Probably one of the worst jobs I've ever had. It wasn't the job itself, it was the people managing it. The co-workers were very disrespectful, the supervisors were rude, the managers were all fat lazy people who would talk mess behind your back, or hell, they would talk mess right in front of you for attention. I loved the job, you unload a truck and put the boxes in correct order and then after, you go put the items away in the correct isle, but other than that it's horrible. Also, if you plan on working full-time, you won't! They tell you to ""Work hard and you'll move up"" but that never happens. "
bad,besides being a chashier I worked as a floor clerk assisting customers and answering any questions about our products.
bad,Been working for this company for about 8 years. It was not until about a year ago that they let us start using sick hours because we had to miss 3 consecutive days of work to start using them and nobody can afford to miss that much work.
bad,When I first got there it was fun to work for people who appreciated your work. But after being there for over a year they hired all new supervisors and things changed. The work environment got real stressful and they never showed any appreciation for the extra work we had to do because we were under staffed.
bad,The same thing everyday how to help people when they need help are management is not to good they are always hide in the office or sitting doing nothing at all no help from co workers is when they leave trash overflowing in the serves desk and restroom don't get pick up is when I get to go home and just do the same thing over again
bad,management talks about the team.doesnt take credit when they mess up.
bad,Good for those who don't have to raise children or want to advance in a career. Always busy. Fast-paced. Good communication skills are learned.
bad,"I only worked for Toys R Us as a temporary seasonal position. The job as a cashier was pretty typical and easy. Management treated employees like they could care less about them, like they were replaceable. They were not very helpful when it came to helping customers with returns, I had seen quite a few upset customers. The stores shelves were pretty much always bare. It was not a very good work experience."
bad,A typical day at work is doing returns when its real busy. I learned alot about the toys. The management was awesome very professional. The co-workers were very helpful and professional. the hardest part of job was putting the store together. the most enjoyable part of the job was helping customers find the toys that they kids wanted.
bad,Working at Babies R Us was a great experience. Working the early morning crew gave me the chance to work and still attend school. The co-workers made the days enjoyable.
bad,"I went into it thinking that even though it was a seasonal job, i would build great relationships with staff and would be recognized for my hard work and effort i was wrong. I even been accused of disrespecting a manager I didnt even know. Honestly I was glad when the season was over."
bad,This company is now out of business although a few senior staff are making another go at it. The culture was terrible as everyone seemed selfish and snobby.
bad,"It was kind of fast paced because I worked for them just only for a month to be exact. During Christmas time actually so I was only trained so much, basically to be a helping hand."
bad,it was very exciting but unfortunately it was just a contract. but there were sometimes where i felt like the management is giving us more of what what we did not sign up for yet they force it
bad,"............................................. what to really say about this place, well they don't care if a family member dies or if you have caner they will fire you/"
bad,"Place was a cesspool of stress and mismanagement."
bad,My experience working here wasn't so great. I got the job and I didn't get trained so well where I didn't know how some of the roles go. The management was poor and lack of communication.
bad,They hired me when jobs were scarce so that was good. Sometimes I had to work until midnight during the Christmas season. I learned skills to take to other jobs.
bad,"top heavy"
bad,Management was AWFUL! Treated you like trash and didn't care. Pay was not worth staying there. Coworkers were nice and made some friends there but store manager had no idea how to run the store. Was always flustered and stressed.
bad,"Meeting and summary what we needed to do and be done by the end of the night for Morning."
bad,The Mega E commerce Giants like Amazon and wal mart now making a move to becoming a dual economic power house with the 2 day delivery online consumers had no more use retail toy chain thus making the once toy super power  obsolete.
bad,Started work sweeping the front entrance  learned about stock taking  rarely seen management  mainly working on my own  difficult customers hardest part of the job. Meeting new people. Most enjoyable part of the job
bad,Promised a lot form the store and store co managers. First week was very unorganized. Down hill from there could see what was coming on the horizon so i quit then they closed.
bad,"It was a mismanaged mess but my coworkers and I got along quite well. We all suffered under the horrible decisions the corporate folks made. Aside from all that, it was just your typical retail experience."
bad,the work itself wasnt hard just the fact that the managers didnt really teach the job well i kinda had to learn cashier by myself pay sucked hours sucked
bad,It was a decent job for the holidays. Working outside the holidays you weren’t promised to have a job or even work to do. Pay was fair but not enough hours.
bad,"With working at Babies R Us, you knew deep down it was closing sooner or later. Store had many issues such as leeks in the ceiling, no advancements in technology, and just poor up keep of store in general."
bad,"My supervisors were very supportive and attentive to my work schedule.  They were flexible in trying to give me more work hours as when possible."
bad,They push employees to sale credit cards and the reward program like it is the sole profitable item in the store resulting in customers verbally abusing staff regularly.
bad,"With minimal help, store was expected to be left perfect before leaving at the end of the night. Many shifts I arrived at noon and didn't leave until almost midnight to make sure the store was ""acceptable."""
bad,Well they have gone into administration so says a lot!!! Poor management no communication very poor place to work I feel bad saying this but there is nothing positive about working here
bad,"I really did not enjoy working there. I don’t have anything good to say about it. Pay was low, hours were low, schedule was not flexible like they lied and said. It was terrible. My grandfather took me to work and could not see at nights so I wanted to change my time to days and they wouldn’t let me so I had to find another job."
bad,Slave work for what you get paid for. Very stressful and unmotivating. Expect too much for amount paid. The discount is only 10% which is just taxes. A lot of employees are slow.
bad,The manager at Babies R Us okc location is awful. Ruined the whole job for me. Personally attacked ppl. Fired great ppl/workers because he didn't like them not for their job performance. Destroyed morale and not at all a leader. I would NOT recommend applying here. The company itself is not bad. Just the management at this particular location.
bad,Toys is going through bankruptcy for a reason  and I wouldn't recommend anyone to apply there. They keep giving more projects and less staff to do them. There is no customer service above the store level so guest are often left feeling unappreciated and disappointed
bad,"Started out as seasonal employee and was hired on full time shortly after Christmas. I worked in the electronic department called R-zone. I had to conduct daily counts and I had no experience with gaming devices at all, yet was expected to sell them. Fortunately I had kids educate me and I learned as I went along. I didn't enjoy getting stuck in a pen all day long you don't get relieved for breaks unless you beg for it. I enjoyed helping guest out on the floor and doing resets. I was told they were interested in promoting me but months went by and getting no where, I ended up quitting and going back to school full time."
bad,I had many jobs to do in one day. And never had time for my family or sick days. They don't pay sick days at all and if you are sick you use vacation or have to be gone for 3 or more days who can afford that? I never just did what I was paid to do I did many other things. And they are never great ful and never has there employees back.
bad,"I have never worked for a company were they allowed management to be rude and arrogant when talking/dealing with customers. There were multiple times during my seasonal employment when the management argued with a customer or had treated them like garbage. This should not be acceptable anywhere but especially in a toy store!!!  I do not advise anyone who wants advancement, respect, hours, or a long term career to apply for a position with this company. Yes they have a decent pay rate of $8.75 per hour , but its not worth the hassle. There constantly insults, drama, and ignorance going on within the management of this company."
bad,"Stressful because we didn't get paid enough for the type of things we were told to do. typical days were hectic, supervisors forced us to redo isles and make sure we put items where they belonged."
bad,"During the holidays its a free for all with hours the new management needs work."
bad,It isn't a good place to work if you want to be home. Usually treat everyone like they are replacable and the threat of being fired loomed over me. it was very stressful.
bad,"Too much drama every single day. Management is slowly going downhill, not to mention the bankruptcy they just filed. They did slightly raise the pay to low levels like me and new comers, but still not enough for certain departments and everything you go through on a daily basis. When you voice opinions and concerns to certain managers, it's swept under the rug. They don't take things we say seriously, unless it has to do with safety."
bad,"It was really stressful. Really demanding. Co Workers didn't really want to help me. The manager wasn't nice, but rarely. I checked customers out and straightened shelves."
bad,"This company should be making alot more revenue, but lack of employee and updated tools."
bad,staffing and crew was very insufficient. they had me doing everything while they sat around and talked all night long until our shift ended. the manager was very disrespectful
bad,"Re-stocking, check, out, helping customers"
bad,"At Toys R Us, I had the worst experience ever. Management never called me to come in, I basically had to beg for my hours. Never wanted me to clean up the place, always complaining. I loved having the customers to talk to and get to know as well as the kids."
bad,"Toys R Us is an easy to place to work at. However, it is also very boring. The store is slow during the week especially in the afternoon. Afternoon shifts would get hours cut, because store never made sales."
bad,"there was always personal issues brought into the work place which created a lot of drama. The work hours especially during the closing shift were never accurate, we always got out late but of course they always made sure we were out before we hit overtime"
bad,extremely top heavy and meeting oriented with little time to sit down and perform the duties of the job at the end of the day.  culture and morale was an issue for most.
bad,It was a very unfriendly environment to work at. No recognition in the work that you do. They don't teach you any new skills. the assembly line is always down or broke.
bad,"It was a seasonal job for me.  It seemed like at the end of the job, the managers were having attitudes. It was pretty good in the beginning, but as it came to an end it was an bad atmosphere."
bad,No work life balance or future. I wish that all retail managers would stay away from this company. It will drain you. I loved dealing with the parents and the kids shopping but hated the job.
bad,"I really enjoy the work here at Toys R Us and Babies R Us.... when there is work to do. I always spent the 1st few hours of my shift looking for work to do and management to ask but no one was ever there and there was nothing to ever do. Although I enjoyed the work out of walking around the store I got fed up with not doing anything so I ended up doing my own work. Kept myself busy and literally did my own thing. Management never cared because they never really noticed anyway. I could get away with clocking in then leave then come back to clock out (Never did) , they just act like you're invisible.... now I got my own routine finally after a month of being there I always got compliments and how great the work I did was. I was told I was gonna get to stay after the holidays... but then I was never scheduled and it took me 2 weeks of trying to get an answer just for them to tell me that I am no longer employed by them. I even went in person to ask since they kept ignoring and hanging up my phone calls. They kept bouncing me around everybody saying they don't know. All the managers were in the office talking, and not one of them could be bothered to answer one simple question for me. They finally answered door but shut it in my face. I would never work for this specific store again.... I love the company but this store sure has its issues... very, very poor management. This is a very true review. I never leave reviews but had to this time."
bad,A typical day at work will involve me helping customers find items online and in the store. Ringing up their merchandise also. I learned how to be a great and professional customer service rep with the help of my fellow co workers. Management could sometimes be very unprofessional but that didnt stop me from following all the rules and doing my job as best as i could. There was no hardest part i Love kids and i love helping people do what makes them happy such as shopping.The most enjoyable part was watching children smile as they got to purchase the gifts that brought them joy.
bad,Toys R Us was a seasonal position in which I did not enjoy. Job was not clearly defined and was forced to stand outside until a ride came for me. Not a good job.
bad,"I worked with Toys R Us for one winter season.  The management was very poor, unenthusiastic, unhelpful, and all around disheartening to be around.  "
bad,Working in retail was not the best experience I have. Many times staff would call out and the store was always short staffed due to their budget. Sometimes we would not leave until 2am.
bad,"When I was first hired to Toys R Us I was told so many things that never happened. I enjoy customer service and this was definitely the right place, especially with all of the awesome kids I was able to assist. I found it great that I could always help parents that weren't quite sure about the products their kids were referring to. I personally love comic books and video games so I could always help them out. I had quite a few hard working co-workers but also a few that were slackers. I like to work hard and take pride in everything I do and I just didn't see that as much as I would have liked to. Management was very sloppy in tending to the store and its needs. My typical work day consisted of being at work at 4am to help receive and unload delivery trucks, drop and stock merchandise and pick and put merchandise. I would have a set time to be off of work, which they would try to change an hour before I was set to leave and would have me stay an extra 1-4 hours past my scheduled time. I was told I would be given at least 30-35 hours a week but would only be set for 12-18 hours per week, which is not livable. As much as I enjoy retail, this particular location is not one I would ever try to work at again."
bad,"I have just started working at Toys R us as a Casual and I only work 2 days per week I am still getting to know staff members but I've been treated well since I've started."
bad,"Full time jobs rarely come up, they start at minimum wage. When it comes to raises they get by cheaply as possible. Good work could earn you only ten cents, which isn't really worth it. Don't get sick, because even with doctors notes they will get rid of you. Management is difficult to deal with, don't really care about their employees. I wouldn't even waste my time applying here."
bad,"Work and continually to work for hours without taking a proper break.  Breaks should be given accordingly to hours worked, not only lunch breaks."
bad,Worked here for the season and the management were all very rude. There was probably one nice manager there. When I would call in sick they would hang up on me because I couldn't come in and would get very upset which is understandable. They schedule really good hours during the season especially as it got closer to Christmas. But when it came to letting seasonal employees go they just stopped scheduling us without letting us know if they wanted to keep us or not. This to me was pretty unprofessional.
bad,"The managers were rude and they did not train well. When you asked for help they would assume that you would know what to do, but without the proper training you don't know what to do."
bad,"No benefits offered, management isn't very courteous of scheduling. Hours and not easy to maintain. Experience would've been better if management was more involved with employees"
bad,Unfair management. Unorganized. Very very unfair work expectations for the money. Pay was not fair. Others with less experience than me and less time in position was hired for higher wages. It was based on who was manager at the time of hire and they did not go back and compensate those that were hired for less.
bad,Toys R Us are severely un organised with a roster that is barley updated. i would consider myself lucky if i got at least one  shift a month
bad,"The area was not bad at all. It was nice but some people were very rude to me. It was a laid back environment at moments but majority of the time, my job was about making sure clothes are organized."
bad,The hours are horrible and the management is just terrible. The managers are never on time and the company cut hours so much that it is not a stable job to have.
bad,"I would work the front end  cash register but if they needed help in customer service i would go over to help . If electronics needed help then i would go over to help them out too, If there was a new person i would train them .Shown them how sale."
bad,"This was my first job, I helped unload the truck then loaded up the shelves. I learned how to use a jack to drag out the crates to unload on to the merchandise floor. My co-workers were very down to earth people and my manager was very understanding and funny as well, a delight to be around. The hardest part about the job was staying healthy, those trucks were cold so it was easy to get sick. The most enjoyable part about the job was the conversations we had amongst each other on the truck"
bad,The store manager told me i would be a regular employee instead of seasonal. For 3 weeks i was sheduled for 0  hours. Each week i would talk to the store manager about it. He proceeded to tell me he would change it. The store manager never changed it.
bad,don't expect full time work. people are easy to work for nice environment to work in.
bad,High Pace/ Volume Retail Business. Processing trucks to ensure that the business in 100% in stock and accessible to the guests.
bad,"My typical day started as soon as I hit the door, after I clocked in the first thing to do was greet all the guest and make sure they found everything they needed. Also, I would clean the store; make sure everything was in the correct order and hand out any flier that we had going on for the week. I learned how to order things from the company’s website, how to set customers up with the Toys R Us credit card and rewards card, and also how to stock a complete area. Overall, the most enjoyable part of it all was working with the kids, and helping everyone that walked into the store."
bad,The management at Toys R Us was unorganized. I learned my job duties from my co-workers and nothing from management. Management would never involve themselves with the Loss Prevention associates. The job served as job experience.
bad,Despite working there for 3 months the management and the way in which it was run made you feel like you never fit in. The long term employees kept themselves to themselves and rarely talked to any of us casuals. I was also only employed for 4 hours a day and being on minimum wage it meant I spent almost half my wage travelling to and from work.
bad,"Not the most enjoyable employment I've ever had."
bad,Management rarely new what was going on. sometimes we would have to wait an hour to clock on and if we left for that hour we were fired. your hardest work didnt matter to them. we had great number stats and management was still on all of us to go faster. i got hurt once a day because of trying to speed up when i was already wearing myself out.
bad,The management was rude and disrespectful except for the store manager. I felt bad for the customers that they had to put up with the lower level management staff.
bad,"My typical day at work consisted of either working the cash register, running our service desk, or wokring at the baby regisrty desk. while working at babies r us, i learned how to do returns, create baby registries and learned where everything was located in our store. Management was decent. I loved my co-workers!"
bad,the only store i know that only cares about processing shipment and not necessarily filling the sales floor. expect to do a 13 dollar a hour job for 9 dollars
bad,"Picking, Replen, Locating, Housekeeping."
bad,"Co workers are great people, very kid friendly enviorment."
bad,"Overall people individually are not bad, however, managed poorly."
bad,"This has probably been my least favorite job I have had.  Just normal retail environment for the most part but you can tell management doesn't care for the employees.  The year that I worked there none of the staff received a raise because they ""felt like no one deserved it"".  Besides that it's a pretty easy job responsibility-wise."
bad,"At the beginning of working here I thought it was not enough but then it became better after a few weeks. A typical work day would be cleaning my work area, greeting customers, helping load big ticket items in vehicles, retrieving carts, and working in multiple departments of the store it was crazy and I had a lot of praise from the store manager because I was always willing to work any area no matter how many times he needed me to change because the other departments would be behind and I do consider myself a pretty fast fast and accurate register operator otherwise he would not have put me in the busiest departments during my work hours and I always got called in on my days off and I would always work. But the day I got hospitalized I was not treated so friendly by management. Which in a weird way I understand because it was the day before Christmas and I really looked forward to working like I always do but unfortunately my boss did not think I was telling the truth because he became rude and short tempered until my husband brought my note from the hospital saying I had no choice but to be out of work for the next 2 days. When I was let go on the one on 3 seasonal last day he couldn't even look at me and when I told them what happened he looked up worried because it was a serious reason why I was out of work. This job is a great starter job just be careful."
bad,I joined this company for the 3rd time just in time for the holidays & worked very long hours as I lost around 10 pounds in the process. I did not learn anything new as I had previously worked them. The General Manager was one of the rudest I've worked with as well as unprofessional as I was avoided numerous times having requested paper work to apply for health insurance. I was handed the paper work around two weeks before I quit. The hardest part was the long hours as mentioned. The most enjoyable part was multitasking as it made the days go by very quick. I got along well with the staff & bonded with several of them.
bad,"The management has always been lax and unprofessional. They seemed to not really care about associate happiness, they just cared about the metrics and trying to impress corporate to get ahead for themselves. I always felt like going to work was just so that I could be used to do whatever they didn't want to do, not so that I could help customers and find enjoyment in my job."
bad,"There really was no typical day at Toys R Us. The company does a horrible job at training new employees, there idea of training is throwing them on the floor and saying... ok have fun, figure it out. There is a constant struggle to get work done because everyone has been taught to do something a different way. Most management takes a hands off approach in every way. And no one could maintain a normal personal life because the schedule was constantly getting changed mid week, without notice. If that wasnt happening then you were getting cut hours beyond the allowed full time status."
bad,"Typical day - Helping customers, doing tasks delegated by corporate and upper management"
bad,"The only way you can get more hours in this job as a cashier you have to push their credit cards and protection plans on the customers and take No for an answer. You just can't sell their toys and merchandise alone and give great customer service. They would rather you disappoint the customer and maybe not ever come back. Today people do not want another credit card to pay off and they use cash mostly. But, if I want to support myself and my child to get the hours I need for even benefits. I must sell customers on a credit card and put families in finical trouble! It should be an option for the customer and not force me to push it on people so I can get more hours to make an income. That is not what a cashier is and was expecting full time hours with benefits to sell their toys. Not what I expected from a toy company for children."
bad,I worked here for a year and I was treated with no respect. not a fun place to be. Hardest part is being in a place with a manager who is completely rude and never wants to take responsibility for anything he does. Best part was the customers that always smiled and was so easy to work with.
bad,"DO NOT WORK FOR THIS PLACE!!!!!! It wasnt worth all the stress, i got paid little to nothing to drive across town to work 4 hours. Never again!!!! Mangers have poor management skills. My co workers were great and I will miss working for them but not Toys R US!!!!!"
bad,"The typical work day for me was to stock shelves, keep my area clean, and pull product forward. I learned to manage my time and keep my area clean while helping guests."
bad,This job helped build my customer service skills and taught me how to multi- task as well as interact with customers
bad,This place was just horrible. I mean bad. The manager sucked. they didn't train right. I had to miss all holidays with my kiddo so I wasnt happy here. Never again
bad,The store had poor management. They didn’t care about the employees nor the customers. I think I would have had a better work experience there if there were different managers.
bad,"No real innovation, basic retail practices which is why they went out of business.  Sales in Electronics area were decent, but advertising was abysmal."
bad,"My job was unloading trucks,keeping the shelf full,Putting together bikes,baby cribs anything that was needed I did.The job was ok it was layed  back."
bad,It was a nice first job and helped me to learn more about the retail business but they really needed to work on hiring more qualified managers. They were horrible at training others.
bad,"The coworkers were fine, one of them was in nearly all of my classes at school, which was weird. This job deeply sucked and killed my enthusiasm for toy stores forever. First off, customers were allowed to verbally abuse you and you couldn’t say anything. Second, the hours were ridiculous! As a high school senior, I wasn’t supposed to be working past 9pm, but they had me scheduled until 2am. I was working full time hours as a part time employee. Third, Black Friday was a mess. Store manager wouldn’t let us leave for our lunch breaks on thanksgiving and had us eat chili from a crockpot in the break room. We all got food poisoning and I begged to leave during my shift."
bad,Toys r us was a poorly run company that failed to fairly compensate their employees. The management was never held responsible for the problems in their store. I would not recommend work there to anyone
bad,The boss was watching every of our move over the cameras and therefore making it a stressfull work environment. If you're less than three months old at that place you will most likely get fired after the Christmas Holidays.
bad,"Great job for a temporary season. The nights were busy and productive. The job itself wasn't very hard, and the people got along really well. The hardest part of the job was transistioning from a day schedule to a night one."
bad,Was a nightmare working there during holiday as a first job. the lines were endless and the recovery was even worse. literally working till 2-4 am where my feet couldn't even walk anymore.
bad,"Too many expectations for such a poor paying job where you get treated poorly by the customers and management alike. I would never go back, nor would I suggest working there. It's closed down anyway."
bad,"If you were willing to work and quick witted you would be favorable for hours. Most of your coworkers will be scattered, and youll be expected to help guests, cover the floor, and be in a register throughout your shift."
bad,"Corporate never cared about the employees and always just ended up giving the customers what they wanted. "
bad,I had a okay time at Toys R Us just wish the pay was little bit more then what i was getting i enjoyed helping the customers in the store the work was very good
bad,Too many chiefs. Upper management was very controlling with no knowledge of actual job tasks. Employees were great and fun to work with. Easy going at times
bad,The management team were obsessed with hitting targets and setting unreachable goals but weren't that interested in helping or doing anything on the shop floor. They would rather the staff be badgered 24/7 to get jobs done than deal with customers who might need some assistance. The company is set back in the 80's with no real progression into the 21st century modern day world.
bad,"I worked here as my first job for a year and a half. I started as a cashier and then progressed to a customer service assistant, after that i was left in this position with no advancement or any actual job to do. Especially in the week there was nothing to do and despite asking my manager for tasks i was left to stand (i was not allowed to sit) for my 10 hour shift doing nothing - i was not allowed bathroom breaks so i had to wait until my hour lunch. The management were also incredibly rude and refused to give me my contracted hours instead making me work a 10 hour shift on both weekend days and during the week despite me only being contracted 6 hours on a Saturday which i did alongside my A-Levels. They also made us stay over an hour, unpaid at the end of the shift to tidy the store which i thought was unfair. Although i met some lovely people and did enjoy gaining the experience from this job i though that the way we were treated was incredibly unfair and given the chance i would not work with this company again."
bad,"I liked working there because I love working "
bad,"typcal day is being yelled at by management"
bad,"I worked here for 18 years, I have alot of experience merchandising and unloading trucks... iv met alot of good people and have had good experiences... The store is going out of business. Time to move on"
bad,"Working there wasn’t terrible but the general manager was openly verbally toxic towards employees, the store is not kept up very well, the staff works more independently instead of as a team and overall the morale among the staff was poor the entire time I was there"
bad,Typically a day at work is productive and stressful.  You never have enough people to get the work done and not enough time.  Definitely need to be a multitasker in order to get work done.
bad,"No comment. Love the job itself, but the company was a let down in the end. Hurts when you put your heart and soul into something and it crumbles from the inside out."
bad,Back of house always packed full due to lack of warehouse help.  seriously understaffed.  Unsafe ladder use in back of house to retrieve product needed.  Very little management support. Excellent benefits.
bad,"I had a seasonal job and it started out pretty slow. By the time it was the week before Christmas, I worked 40+ hours...and I was a part-time employee. They asked me to stay and I said yes, yet I didn't really hear from them. They never picked up the phone when I tried to call and ask about work, because I wasn't getting any hours whatsoever. They basically dropped me without telling me anything...the management there was ALWAYS unorganized. There would always be issues with the schedules, the cleanliness of the store, and some of the staff weren't exactly reliable either."
bad,"Working for the company is great during the Christmas shopping season, but for the rest of the year, you are stuck with working one day a week for a four or five hour shift. This is not enough to make ends meet."
bad,"It would appear the company is not in good financial standing so I can understand the demands being high, but truly believe management could have been more motivating in a positive way. Often sales associates were left responsible completing manager responsibilities, while managers were less hands on, or even inconsistent with instructions."
bad,"You could be scheduled to work until 9 or 10pm and be expected back in by 6am. District managers do not care about your time off. They will call you or  text you at odd hours when they know you aren't in your store when they could just as easily get the answer from the manager on duty."
bad,"I started out with plenty of hours but as time went on my hours went down , they moved me around a lot and they didn't seem to know what to do with the resources they had.  "
bad,"In my experience working for the company I have found that they are either very mean or very lazy, they know that they won’t get fired. Also the company recently went bankrupt so I wouldn’t recommend getting stuck in something like that!"
bad,Its a fun place helping looking for toys. Kids are so happy to be there it makes your job easier. Nice people to work with and a pretty easy job to do.
bad,The pay for part-time isn't the where I think it should be considering the time put in for the job. And I feel the time isn't worth being there especially with no recognition.
bad,It would be nice to see this company take on new ownership and become the #1 place to wor and shop by making it about people and creating raving fans.
bad,Hate this place. May enjoy it for the first month but afterward you’ll hate it. During holidays of course it’s the worst thing imaginable. Managers don’t stick by you when dealing with customers also.
bad,No consistency call you two hours before you had to work.  No enough days to work when hired said it was full-time I only received sixteen hours in a weeks time.
bad,The management needs to be better and the overall atmosphere and treatment of employees.  There needs to more benefits offered to all employees and room for development.  The most enjoyable part of the job is going to see my peers.
bad,Toys R Us does not provide a healthy training environment for its employees and Management is not well organized. The company had to recently restructure its financial hardship (billions of dollars in Bankruptcy) and the mess starts from the top down.
bad,Work there seasonal for the holidays. Low pay for the amount of work they expect you to get done. Worked way longer than we were scheduled and did more than the job entitled.
bad,"As a supervisor there was little to no help on big projects that needed to be done. (I.e. fixtures, stocking, changing floor plans, putting up displays).  Little to no carrer advancement, i still talk to people that have been im the same position for years. Cut hours when its not in season. Managment is micro and not even hands on. Little to no development or training. Cut thorat. A company that hardly gives any benefit to its employers, especially the seasonal ones."
bad,"Obviously it's a seasonal job, toys at Christmas, etc. Once that season was over, they never bothered to put you on the schedule, or tell you that your job was over."
bad,Went through 3 district managers in 3 months. Some years no one got a raise. The company is going down hill fast and not adapting quick enough to combat Amazon and other non brick and mortar stores.
bad,"If you're just looking for a quick buck for the Christmas seasons than a job at Toys ""R"" Us is a fine enough one. But trying to make a career out of it is highly unlikely."
bad,Seeing this is a place for kids. This place seemed as if it hired kids to work it was unorthodox. The manager hired me as permanent part time worker. As I go in to pick up a check a supervisor tells me the manager doesn't recall telling me that in the interview. Everyone that worked there seemed unhappy and the customer service needs much improvement.
bad,"I was not made fully aware of job requirements and implied practices and never fully sure what my job was, but at least I learned to be self-motivated."
bad,Toys R Us was a great job when i started full of many opportunities to learn new things and pick up more shifts however management change over regularly and now they do not give staff enough shift. they roster as few staff as possible but have high and unrealistic expectations for the amount of work each staff member completes.
bad,"High stress, low pay, inconsistent schedule, not enough training. The hours are long with very  little managerial organization. Not much room for advancement."
bad,"I've been with the company for 3 years. In that time the company headquarters has laid off 600-700 employees. In 2017, there was no annual salary increase as per normal living standard. It's a much more all hands on deck approach at this point, in comparison to the career developing, definitive roles organization that it once was."
bad,Workplace was all about get it done at all costs and get home. Management did not care about employees all they cares about was numbers. Overall not a good work environment.
bad,"The first day on the job was simple, it included training and semi-aided work. During the winter season, it was fairly easy and enjoyable even through Black Friday and Christmas eve. After winter season, many people were cut and I was forced to do multiple jobs besides my own, and all for minimum wage. Would definitely only recommend for a seasonal job."
bad,"Poor management,no trianing and alot of favortism by management ,no clear direction on your, poor pay for the amount of work place on you,schdule was never put out two week which enable one to plan life,no work life balance"
bad,Toys R Us is a friendly place with an inviting environment and many different faces. A good starting point for those who have difficulty dealing with people.
bad,"Depending on what store you work for, the climate is different in each one. The Waterbury store is where I've worked and I would strongly suggest working elsewhere unless there's a change in management. You're given a hard time about having to switch shifts or if you have to call out, even if you don't do it often. Will also drop your hours if you don't push credit cards or warranty plans but won't outright fire you."
bad,"After working at TRU for 3 years and being a consistently strong and valuable employee I had my work week cut to a meager 4 hours. This is partly due to continual revolving door of incompetent upper management that is incapable of balancing their available hours and are blind to any functions of the store that don`t involve the checkout process or kissing up to the giraffe`s corpotocracy. I was expected to handle 25 hours worth of work in a quarter of that time. I began working here because I collect toys and enjoy making people happy; but the squabbling for management positions, lack of qualifications, total misunderstanding of store functions as well as nearly the entire staff having virtually no knowledge of the products sold all add up to a feeling of dread; when I was ALLOWED to work."
bad,"not enough hours, bad management, no benefits. not a fun place to work . to much asked for 8.25 an hour. only allowed breaks after 7 hours of work. disrespect"
bad,"A good place to work (toys everywhere) you meet some really good people and of course some bad ones, management is like baby sitters, not a hard job had fun stocking toys all night."
bad,"Don't work at Langhorne pa , they don't train you, just throw you on and walk away constantly. customer complaints about some of the young girls that work there with attitudes and employees lie and give each other attitudes. Petty high school b.s stay away, go to another location!"
bad,My review for my work place was typical day work day. Coworkers was alright to deal with. The most enjoyable day was getting my work done.
bad,"This company no longer cares about the employees that keep them in business.  It is do more with less hours and call you into work whenever they deem it necessary.  There are no guaranteed hours and your shift might get cut and no one lets you know.  They are all about getting customers to sign up for credit cards and protection plans and have forgotten about the business of selling merchandise to the customers.  They also spend very little time training the employees, so that just makes everyone's job harder.  No appreciation for all the hard work the employees do to make the management staff look good to the corporate office."
bad,Toys r us is a terribly managed establishment filled to the brim with overly toxic leadership. If you're interested in working in an environment where store morale is just as low as the seventh pit of a fiery inferno and your direct superiors make almost 5x the money you do for a fraction of the work you put out then you'll love it there!
bad,"The pay is terrible, the hours are terrible, the job is terrible, the dress code is terrible, computers are terrible, other job equipment, like scanners and radios are terrible too."
bad,"This store in particular is not exactly fair when it comes to rewarding employees. The hard workers are overlooked and favoritism is used a lot. Management is always helpful to the customers. "
bad,"The work is enjoyable considering I help new parents find items, get them set up with our registry system, also checking them out and filling out online orders. This also includes taking care of customers at the service desk and providing great customer service all around. "
bad,"Co Workers are great, but management is horrible - the schedule is always messed up, asking for days off months/weeks ahead of time and they act like you never did. Verbal abuse from managers, meal and break violations - 10 hours between shift violations. If someone tries to steal something you get yelled at for either trying to stop them or for not trying to stop them. Rules don't apply to managers, you learn the rules once you mess up and get yelled at for it. Managers let people with carts full of stuff walk right out the door, managers don't care if people steal or not or if they let them walk out right past them. They cut hours and under staff causing walkouts and then you get blamed, but you are already doing 5 things while they sit in the office eating food complaining about how bad of a job you are doing. Expect to get called in on your days off too."
bad,"Unless you've been working there for 10+ years, the most hours you get are 15 in a week."
bad,"It was an seasonal job where I performed customer service, cashier, and sales. Also restocking and organizing the store. The best part of the job was working with children. The co-workers for the most part are friendly."
bad,"They work you like a slave while managers or assistant managers sit back and relax on Black Friday and Christmas.  When something goes wrong  not with staff but a product and you expect management to fix it. But no, they start blaming people instead of fixing the problem. They put one person on cart duty for hours on end while some co-workers just walked around and did not do much,i.e, the practice of favoritism.  Not a great place to work but you still get paid."
bad,"I was hired as a seasonal overnight, it started off good. The employees were welcoming of course there were so few of them and to much work getting put on them. When you have a truck of 2000 pieces and only 6 people to finish the job of the day shift and then everything they have to do at night and try to be out by 6am don't cut it. Our breaks got cut shorter and they started wondering why things weren't getting done????? Well you have six people, three which do the back and the other three on the floor of a truck with 2000 pieces. The manager who runs the line wants to yell at the guys unloading the truck telling them to catch all the boxes that are falling or hurry up. Who is going to pay these guys doctors bills when they get hurt??? I know that aren't. But it's ok for management to take smoke breaks whenever. Night crew never got told good job but was always told how good day shift was but yet we had to do their job as well. If they had more help and management that understood then it might be ok, but you are running your good employees into ground and don't care."
bad,"Management is not supportive. All about the numbers. Everyone must be focused on sales goals and if they do not get reached, everyone is yelled at. Store manager micromanages."
bad,Fast pace environment. Busy workplace that doesn not always make for an enjoyable work day depending on staffing. A good management team can make it much better. Bad experience in my case.
bad,"ive never hit 40 hours a week working there since a year. too much problems going on in management, we just changed to another ceo just recently. the company keeps opening and closing stores all over  orlando."
bad,"Typical Day at Work: 'Throwing' and 'Bowling' aisles after setting up the u-boats with merchandise for the various sections of the store. Sorting goods on the shelves, making room where needed when there was a surplus or making the shelves more populated when less goods were there. General cleaning and making things look nice and smooth for opening the next day."
bad,"Cruel place, annoying customers, bad management. Everything you can think of that's wrong with a retail place, multiply by 1000."
bad,"A company that rarely sees the potential in its staff."
bad,"Poorly staffed, employees there expected to work above and beyond their job title/pay grade, senior management at odds with each other, department managers being told to do different things by each member of senior management, never leave on time, faulty equipment to do work with, roof leaks when it rains, shipping of items purchased online forced upon the stores, no chance of advancement, good employees forced out, not allowed to have a second job, scheduling is all over the place. DO NOT work here unless you absolutely need a job."
bad,"A typical work day is helping guests as needed.  The management doesn't do the things they should if there is a problem they just tell you what it is they think you would like to hear and continue doing the same thing.  My co-workers are great they are all very nice hardworking people.  The hardest part of the job was dealing with the management team, and there was no advancement, but i do enjoy working with the public and working in sales."
bad,Overall for my first job it was a decent job. although during holidays you will be over worked and rarely see your family.
bad,well they only hire during the christmas season and if your lucky they will bring you back. through a temp agency and even then they treat you like nobodys. the hours suck and the management there is a joke
bad,This would have been a great job but management was not qualified.
bad,"Place is a good start a first time job, but management is not really productive. A lot of favoritism there between them"
bad,"They expect you to be a cashier, stocker, floor associate, department manager, and janitor all in one four hour shift for minimum wage! The hours are distributed unevenly, and unfairly sales pressures are through the roof management is completely incompetent, and unaware of what's going on in the store. The only reason I gave them four stars for work life balance is because you get absolutely minimal hours here no more than 15 on average, unless you are one of managements favorites then you have all the time in the world to make friends and go to school. The only enjoyable thing about this job is my coworkers are friendly except management who treat us like we're idiot's. They do not appreciate the workforce they have and we have one of the highest selling stores in our district"
bad,Long hours and unrealistic goals. Consistency rarely occurs. Customers are pleasant and I enjoy working with children.
bad,"McDonalds is a great place to start if you are just starting to search for a job but it is not something you would want to seek a long time career in. The Management is absolutely HORRIBLE, and the job/life Balance is completely non-existent"
bad,I have nothing to say when it regards to my job right now the only thing so hard is their is no opportutunity of grow for me in the reason that instead of promoting me they prefere to hire somebody who is from the other company and stock me where I am right now and use me in any different thing of work.But all the thing ive done for the past 2yrs I enjoyed a lot especially interacting with different people with different nationality and culture.
bad,"Management can do better with co-workers that work hard for them!"
bad,"It is what it is I suppose. You go in, find out what your assignment is, you leave in about 4-8 hours, which considering your pay isn't much. "
bad,"As a cashier I helped guests with their purchases, and occasionally signed people up for rewards cards and credit cards. As a sales floor team member I straightened up my assigned department, put away the go-backs, and helped guests pick out toys and gifts. When they were unsure of their choices I offered helpful age appropriate suggestions."
bad,"I worked here during the holiday season. There was almost no training and a few of the managers could honestly care less if you had dropped dead n the floor. I;m sure it would take them a few hours to notice though. Some co-workers were great and made it fun to work there. "
bad,"A typical work day saw maybe a 100 or 200 people and was pretty boring. I was hired on as a builder then never spent anytime doing that at all, which was fine with me being as I liked the register and floor better. The management didn't really have a unified way of doing things and when the holiday picked up things went to chaos. The hardest part of the job was to have to climb those flimsy roll stairs with a heavy box and place it near the ceiling, super dangerous to put them there in the first place, but that's just my opinion. I didn't really enjoy anything but the fast pace of Black Friday sales having worked a 26 hour shift. "
bad,"Toys R Us was not employee friendly, and did not prioritize customer service.  As a company they only focused on fourth quarter sales and did not staff the store adequately the rest of the year.  Management was expected to pick up the hours for the improper staffing."
bad,"very poorly run, highly outdated technology was a severe hindrance to staff.  "
bad,handle customer transactions. work with fellow co workers for breaks and lunches and locating items on the floor. stocking shelves
bad,"You would think working at a toy store would be somewhat enjoyable. Management changed at least 4 times within the year I was working there. They were extremely demanding as if we were working in a corporate building. During the holiday season we weren't leaving until 2 sometimes 3am and I was a high school student at the time. They would hold meetings at 6am and attendance was mandatory. The store had to be to a ""T"" on a nightly bases. Everyday you would get a card with a quota on upselling products and credit cards. It seemed as if that was their top priority over anything else. Management stuck together and tried to be intimidating. No advancement."
bad,"Mangers are rarely promoted within the company. They are generally brought from other companies so they don't generally know standards of proceedures. Pay rate ""ceiling"" is low for the amount of work that they request of their employees."
bad,"Assigned to a register, stocking, and make sure the store looked presentable for guests."
bad,"I would typically work from 2pm to 2am, since i was seasonal only and the store would close at 12am. we would have to stay and clean up the store before we can leave and there was only 5 of us to clean up the whole store, sometime we would leave even later then 2am. I also have school at 8am but my manager wouldn't work around it with me."
bad,"typical day consists of Cashiering and dealing with customers. Management is inconsistent when one says one thing and then someone else says another. They also make you feel that their mistakes in scheduling is your fault and they don't want to be held accountable. For an example, the boss was doing the schedule for the next week and i was asked if i could close Thursday because i wasnt available to close that night, but then i come in the next day and the schedule says I'm closing Friday night instead of thursday. I went to my boss and said that you asked me to close thursday and she claimed that she said Friday (a night im not able to close as well) but i told her that i couldnt do friday night because I had plans for that night and she basically told me i was screwed because she made it impossible to switch with anyone. She ended up switching the schedule around and i was able to be off friday night, but the principal of the fact was I was taken advantage of for doing favors isnt right."
bad,"Where to start. I worked within Babies R Us, and my manager had a charges pending on her for child neglect. Min wage even at full time position."
bad,"this place was ok, the management at the time were like a bunch of buffoons half the time, the only thing was the workers and that was it. The managers allowed these toy collectors to come in and harrass the workers if they didn't see anything they wanted on the shelves. it was crazy."
bad,"I Really Did Not Enjoy Working Here.This Company Made me work long hours,Horrible Pay,and Also Treated the employees terrible"
bad,"The management was horrible, customer service was not a priority and the store was rarely neat and clean."
bad,"Great for discounts if you have kids, other than that horrible pay and management"
bad,"The workplace was unorganized, the management was not good, and there was no communication between the managers when giving orders. There was also favoritism. Employees were mostly cool though."
bad,I was hired as an assistant manager. The store manager preferred to put wedges between her team rather than help them grow for better performance and workplace conditions. She would demean associates in front of her team and customers in a daily basis
bad,Considering they closed it doesn’t really matter. The management did not back you up. They took anything back even though you state the policy to the customer and the item is old with no receipt or broken.
bad,"The work I had to do wasn't bad at all. But when your co-workers and managers are difficult and rude, it's kind of hard to get motivated. I wasn't as reliable as I would've been if they were pleasant to work with."
bad,"Its not very enjoyable, low pay and poor hours. Short lunch breaks that don't exactly give you time to eat. Not much room for advancement. The managers weren't too friendly either."
bad,A day at Toys R' Us consists of coming in and doing your rounds around the store looking for anything out of the ordinary or illegal. I've learned how to monitor transactions and inventory. The work place was very laid back. Hardest part of the job was confronting employees/customers of any illegal activity.
bad,Some days you just walk around the store helping customers other days you will unload the truck and other days you may be the cashier and you may even do all 3 somedays
bad,i slipped and fell at work one nite and the manager was the main one leading the jokes. i just overlooked him we were around the same age older than most of  the other workers no excuse for how i was treated was not concerned if i was hurt or not just bad management.
bad,"Management needs to be trained better."
bad,"I worked as part of the truck crew, so I was in charge or unloading the trucks and filling the floor. For how I worked and what I was getting paid, I think this would only be good for part-time and not full time at all."
bad,Employees were treated like a number . We were disregarded and so were our schedules. I was in school and was promised a flexible schedule. But when school started I was still scheduled for days when I had class
bad,My experience with the company was not great.  This appeared to be a shift and work group situation that was not typical of all locations.  The corporate management seemed better organized than the local management.
bad,They like to hire from outside the company for management roles and don't offer it to associates unless they're desperate.
bad,I've been with the business for 5 years thinking it would get better to ultimately them going out of business. Will miss my coworkers though. I hoping to find something more lucrative with some benefits and job growth
bad,"The company is struggling financially and this is causing strain in its ability to pay employees, which causes morale to drop when staff is not getting enough hours and or pay rate. Because of this employees are more toxic in their opinion of the store and other employees who are promoted above them, and are seen as stealing positions they feel they deserve. The attitude seems to often be ""everyone for themselves"" rather than a team effort. Steps are being taken currently to correct this and improvement has been seen in the past few weeks of my employment."
bad,"a typical day: always busy, meet nice and rude customers. sometimes customers would be very upset when certain toys that are not sold by toysrus. "
bad,"The entire time I worked there I was stressed out people would start drama for no reason, there were favorites with the asst manager. You would get in trouble for the dumbest things. They also would either give you 8 hours one week and then 39 the next if you were part time and if you closed you didn’t get out until at least an hour after you were scheduled. Being paid bi weekly in retail doesn’t make sense I didn’t make enough to be paid like that.  My biggest complaint was the asst manager she treated me and a few other horribly and caused me to leave the job. You honestly don’t get paid enough for the amount of stress and nonsense you have to deal with"
bad,"Toys ""R"" Us holds a high expectation of it's workers, like any decent job should. However, the pay does not reflect the potential work load, especially when stores are understaffed due to executive pressure. There is also a heavy, almost toxic emphasis on metrics. Specificially, credit cards. The work environment can be relaxed, though, especially on slow days. We are encouraged to interact with guests, which is fun and management seems to be lenient when it comes to sick days. However, extremely inconsistent hours, last minute scheduling and stealthy schedule changes without notice all overshadow the positives. On top of that, management can be very capricious -- one moment friendly, the next passive aggressive and delegating specific tasks and hours to an employee they're not fond of at the moment."
bad,It was your standard customer service job that worked well as a hold over job until you can settle into a career. Not much was offered in the way of benefits or work time balance.
bad,It could be a fun place to work at times but was not a supportive environment. Management communication was abysmal. I didn't know what my next week's schedule would be until the preceding Thursday. The metrics and bottom line are what matter most here.
bad,toys r us was a fun place to work but the management was horrible and there were no benefits whatsoever and it was a slow paced job which I like working at a faster pace.
bad,I worked for seasonal cashier and I hated it . Hours were terrible... Poor management skills . I will not work here ever again . They can have the job because I'm over it .
bad,"I hate toysrus. The management is HORRIBLE!!!! They make the employees do most of the work. A good management team would actually help out the employees. They’re attitudes are horrible. Mind you they do have some good people. The schedule are horrible I always worked close,  I’m in school. They do not listen nor care. I don’t recommend you wasting your time and working at toys r us. We NEVER have days off I hate it."
bad,"Pay is not enough for the work that you do. During season you work long hours sometimes without getting a break. Management is poor. They don’t appreciate their seasonal employees, you’re just a replaceable body to them. On a regular day, as a sales associate, you will go to your assigned section and begin to recover the aisles. You then will grab a cart of reshop (items that are left lying around or people decided not to buy) and put back each item where it belongs. All while cleaning your aisles and helping guests locate items, and while kids ruin the aisles you just spent hours cleaning. Very repetitive. You will occasionally work the cash register if needed for back up, if you’re not a cashier. It can be very hectic at times and very stressful. Good job for high school kids or if you need a job that will work with your college schedule .. or quick money for the holidays but definitely not a long term job. If you don’t drive their credit cards, protection plans, or loyalty cards, you a frowned upon. If you’re lucky enough to get a raise, it will only be a few cents. The only people who actually move up in the company are people who have been there for years and are kiss a ($$) es. Overall, it’s a sucky place to work. It’s sad really, seeing grown men and women working there for over 10 years, working their life away for a company that doesn’t appreciate them. My favorite part about the job was going home. Hated being there & most of the employees looked miserable as well."
bad,Toys R Us is an okay place to work they don't give you enough hours or enough pay they can't guarantee you a full-time job if your attempt I would not go back to Toys R Us DC
bad,"Work pace is slow for most of the year except black Friday through new years. Back of house is laid back, there is a lot of work to be done but once you get the hang of the systems there is plenty of time in the day to get it all done."
bad,"Toys R Us is a good place to work for seasonal because that's when everything really picks up. And even then, the managers and supervisors talk to their employees pretty rude and demanding. It's not a very tight team work kind of setting...seeing as how the manager probably wont remember your name or who you are."
bad,"I've worked with toys R us and Babies R us for over a year, was once full time (sadly now part time) and I can honestly say I would never recommend this job to anyone. it is poorly managed by store and district managers. nothing can be properly done for example, the floor is set to planograms which make it easier to maintain putting product on the floor as well as maintaining the back. as simple as this may sound, it will literally never be done because management doesn't push it. also, hours have been extremely cut locations wide due to last year being short on sales so expect the bare minimum when it comes to hours. I could literally complain about a lot, but ill stick to minimum."
bad,"I worked at a Babies R us and their training program was pretty much non-existent. They're rude, they don't pay too well, and they expect you to know everything even though they don't take the time to teach you what you need to know."
bad,I would not recommend working for this company the cons far outweigh its benefits. Please take the time to review my experience before applying there.
bad,"Company hired poor management staff, too many issues with getting things done. Improper planning. Understaffing during truck days. Improper cash handling. To name a few."
bad,When I was there the company was in a transition. They lost focus on the people and when your boss is only worried about keeping his job and not worried about the team there is no success.
bad,"It's an okay place to start out with if it's your first job, but don't expect to advance to higher positions."
bad,Ben hier binnen gekomen om de werkvloer in te richten (letterlijk). De rekken in elkaar zetten en de voorraad in de rekken te plaatsen volgens de shoebox methode.
bad,My first job. They hire you with no experience. Want you to work like a dog for min wage. The people suck. The management sucks. They pay sucks. Definitely not a long term job
bad,While working at the distribution center they consistently would change managers with different rules to abide by. The pay was not comparable for the work they ask you to do while meeting requirements.
bad,Not a great working environment. Management is horrible with the exception of conrad. The only enjoyable part of this work is being able to make people happy.
bad,"Begins fun, and quickly devolves into a dreary and disappointing affair. Leaving you tired and done with humanity. The management plays favorites among employees and is unstable at best."
bad,"Awful management not a job to depend on if looking for something concrete. Compared to other retail stores infrastructure this place is discombobulated from the top to the bottom, they'll have you running around while getting nothing accomplished."
bad,"A lot of growth within the company, however management was disorganized and the store was badly understaffed.Learned how to build the power wheels and bikes."
bad,"Typically a seasonal job, they don't keep many people year-round. Not a terrible company to work for, I just think that when I worked there the management was pretty sad. They try to have a lot of job culture with the computer classes and such. All around a ""eh"" experience."
bad,"Over whelming work load, very little support from upper management. Constant deadline pressure, to many conference calls, executive visits / inspections with a got you agenda. "
bad,"If you're looking for a job in retail, you're better off just working at the mall instead of here."
bad,"What I did day to day changed as often as the weather.  Despite the best efforts of my direct managers, it was clear that at a corporate level, the store was heavily mismanaged.  Change was constant and more common than meaningful change."
bad,"A day at work consists of one on one with customers and sales"
bad,The most enjoyable part of working at TRU was the people that also worked there. A typical day was usually a short 4hr shift & being asked to cover too much within those 4hrs.
bad,"Typical day at work is helping guest while trying task and reset or fill the store.Store management is great, corporate such as district managers are not as pleasant. They just want the job done, ethical behavior is not a concern for them. Most enjoyable part is helping to get the guest what the want."
bad,"Disorganized management and company goals, poor communication between staff.  Co-workers are friendly.  The job provides many part time hours in the winter."
bad,"Hours were awful, managers sucked, and the workers there knew it. Co-workers weren't too bad to work with for a few hours."
bad,Helping the parents and kids find the toys and games they were looking for. Learned to be an exquisite team player. Management was so so. Hardest part of the job was it being seasonal and not many hours. I loved playing with the children.
bad,"Toys R Us is a typical retailer with all the pros and cons of working in a retail environment.  As with all of my other jobs there was a generally decent comradery among the employees and the store manager tried to have activities that would increase store morale.  However, like in most retail companies the pay is extremely low and benefits very poor.  And there was a distinct favoritism that existed.  Some people were held to higher standards than others."
bad,"What I learned within the companies and working at one of their sites  was they would tend to express mixed messages and expect a understanding without clarification. Some of the workers did the intended job and procedure but others (Like in all work places) Slacked on and made it harder on the rest of us. From how the schedules were made, I was never sure management knew what they had been doing."
bad,When I started there I thought it was the best job ever! Until they started hounding people to sell Credit cards for the company I then quickly begin to feel as though I was a shark in a pool of fish with every customer you had to do your whole speech about how wonderful these things were and how many points you could earn and all that.
bad,"In my time with Toys I have developed many tremendous teams and achieved strong results to meet goals. Employees under my leadership have formed a cohesive relationship to form a productive team."
bad,"The store that I worked at, you really had to kiss butts to get ahead anywhere as far as promotions. Hours were never consistent. one week you had 30 hrs, the next you only had 5."
bad,its a good opportunity for students. learned more about toys. enjoyed some of my co workers. the hardest part of the job was cleaning the store when it was closing. time most enjoyable part meeting lots of new people.
bad,Toys R Us isn't such a friendly place management strives to makes sales not smiles. The time I spent at the company I did more laborious than kid friendly work. Management did not condone interaction during work hours with other employees. Employees were assigned tasks to complete alone and under supervision.
bad,"People always mess up what you clean at 12 in the morning.  You're not allowed to talk to anyone, not even your coworkers."
bad,Management can be better. You never get knowledge for your work. The scheduling is not fair to the employees.
bad,"I have been there almost 12 years.  Overall, the past few years have been up and down because I have multiple responsibilities which is too much for one person, due to hours being cut but I manage,  however, at 30 years old I would love a positive change in my life. As far as co-workers, I have had good ones and ones we had to let go.   The best part of my job is seeing the families I have known all these years come in with their children that I have either registered or helped and watched them grow up."
bad,"Management is a group of people that will look down on their employees as if they were disposable, not a pleasant environment to work in. However this is a rather easy job until you are pushed to make customers get credit cards and there can be consequences for falling short of that goal(keep in mind that this place has a lot of tourists who cannot get credit cards)."
bad,The company gives you very limited sources to succeed. They constantly cut hours and often times have very limited opportunities for growth. However its retail so what should you expect?
bad,"Limited hours"
bad,"The typical day at work involved back breaking labor, a ton of cleaning that had to correspond with my managers O.C.D., and getting screamed at by at least 6 people."
bad,"My store manger was VERY VERY rude, she didn't care for her workers and she didn't care how she treated customers. I had many customers in my lane that said things about her, and I just nodded and said I was sorry for how she treated them. If you ask me someone like that shouldn't be in management. My co-workers were normal they treated seasonal workers as seasonal workers they were nice but not all the time I suppose. My favorite part of the job was seeing happy kids and babies!"
bad,"During the Season rush there was alot of business. "
bad,"Toys R Us will pay you a fair wage for the job title. However they will work you like a dog with constant extended hours, lack of payroll/staffing and sub par management. I was reminded of the value of a hard days work here. You will always be working to the breaking point. The hardest part of the job is the extreme hours that must be put in. The enjoyable part of the job is getting to the next one and realizing how much of a life you now have."
bad,I enjoyed this job knowing that I working for my favorite store growing up
bad,"Toys R Us was a terrible company to work for. Management is completely inept and the policies have be rewritten so many times that they an absolute mess of hypocrisy. They continually promise advancement falsely. They claim to promote from within yet 90% of the management positions I saw filled never even considered existing employees, nor were the employees even made aware of the openings. They claim in their ads to be about the kids, yet are not interested in provided anything to assist their employees families."
bad,"To advance in this company will be by default. Corporate comes in the stores from time to time and promote associates not based on work ethics or accomplished goals, but by who has the best personality."
bad,"One employee is responsible for a job that requires at least 3 people. Multi-tasking is a must. Must have tolerance for rude customers. Management does not consist of good leaders. My coworkers were friendly, easy-going hard workers who deserve more than minimum wage for the challenges they overcame everyday. The hardest part of the job is having to deal with several customers with no employees around to help for coverage due to ""lack of hours."" The most enjoyable part of this job is the coworkers and friendly environment. Another benefit is learning about baby products for your own family, or future family."
bad,A typical day of work involves coming up with ways to keep busy untill the end of your shift. The job itself feels very much like highschool it seems little attention is paid to work quality vs popularity amongst the other employees. I'd say the best part of the job is that you get to meet lots of interesting people and help guests throughout the day.
bad,i worked there for a few years and was cross trained in several dept. but the pay rates were not that great and there was no room for advancement
bad,Not very much interaction or opportunity to work in a cross functional enviornment. Distinct separation between merchant teams and support teams
bad,My job was as a overnight stock person. I typically worked 10 p.m. till 8 a.m. It was tedious and repetitive work. Management worked with along side of you and your coworkers often only spent a few months with you before they chose to leave. It required work on Christmas and Thanksgiving.
bad,"Toys r us showed me who to work in an assembly line, do inventory, unload a truck, and help with customers, however team morale was so low there, that it was very hard to work there."
bad,"This place was great at first, I made a lot of money working part-time, and it was pretty easy to know how to work here. However, the hours diminished, and I was only working Saturday and Sunday. The manager was unfriendly, and left many customers miserable, and yelling at me! If help was needed, or a manager was requested, there was nobody to be found, leaving me with an unhappy customer. I worked many hours around the Holidays, and then once a week, unless they called me and told me not to come into work. Very unreliable to create a schedule."
bad,Company has been going through a tough finical year. They have been under constant overhead pressure and have made some questionable decisions over the past year.
bad,"While I was 16 and grateful someone gave me a job, there were issues with working there. From lack of organisation, to low salary to some treatment by supervisors that I would consider unfair, it simply wasn't somewhere I could recommend to others."
bad,I waa for a season  there and if you got a injury  the just  ignored  you and the manager was a rude person and same as their assistants to was not  good
bad,The only thing I can say I learned at working at toys r us is i learned of yo drive a fork left I wasn’t to hard to learn but it wasn’t that easy either
bad,Work is easy but gets really packed on weekends. Be ready to clean up and place items back on shelves because they will always be misplaced. You will get a lot of experience in customer service and be ready to answer a lot of questions.
bad,"It was rumored that Toys R Us was going to be closing but no official decision was made at that time."
bad,"Over all the job is very very repetitive. The staff there are great they get along nicely enough, but the management team doesn't work well together, there is no communication between members of management. "
bad,"There is not much to say about Toys r us, because it is no longer open. I am pretty sure the business has shut down and no longer operating. While I was there it was not fun."
bad,It was a great place to work if you like keeping up with the toy market and helping customers find the right toy for their loved one. The customer service aspect could have been improved if the management took time to train the floor staff on great things in the system that would help a lot of customers and keep them from going to competitors. But it was the holiday season and the management was not interested in employee development nor employee empowerment. They usually sat in the office and barked your name over the walkie talkie even while your are in the middle of helping someone. When people would try to assert themselves they usually were fired. Maybe that's why they went out of business.
bad,"loading/ unloading 53' trailers, order picking , training new employees how to scan labels before loading/unloading trailers, cleaning work space in a timely fashion."
bad,Very team oriented and but management wasn’t helpful and there was a a lot of call ins so not much help when we had long line of customers but the team at night was ok
bad,I worked in the Electronics area. I was really into video games back then so it was a pretty fun after school job. I learned a little about customer service.
bad,"This was not a good place to work. Abusive management, rude coworkers, and ruder customers. Didn't get breaks unless asked, and there were times I could not get a lunch in a 8+ hour shift due to callouts and managers not caring about regulations."
bad,"This was a fun place to work until the ownership and management changed. The company started offering ""Instant Credit"" and ""Buyer Protection Plans"" and the store mangers started using sales of these items and services against their associates."
bad,"Not the worst job for a first or second job, but not something you can or should make a career out of. Could have just been my experience, but management was very lack luster to say the least."
bad,I worked the grave yard shift stocking the shelves. I like this job a lot. My co workers were very friendly and very nice. I'm sorry to say that this company went out of business.
bad,Toys r us closed already.  Store manager  did not had no leadership very poor performance and no exoerirnce.  A lot of favoritism between employees no accountability.
bad,"I like being able to learn multiple positions and have different positions each shift. The hours during Christmas season are great but in the offseason, hours are scarce."
bad,Very high standards regarding the merchandising of the store overall. Payroll was not adequate to fulfill those needs. District Manager and Regional lacked communication and training.
bad,On a typical day I would take merchandise off the conveyor belt and place on the correct pallets. I learned how to place merchandise on shelves so that it would appeal to customers.
bad,"A typical work day was what the goals for the day and the expectations were for the day. open and close the store, daily audits, load and unload trucks, fill shelves, process internet orders"
bad,"A typical day included, trolly collection, cleaning, restocking, customer service, Pricing, Answering phone calls etc. I learned that i was able to push on even when i was tired or not up to working, and had good team management skills and overall sales skills. my workplace culture was Multicultural and had many backgrounds from low- Economical backgrounds to high- Economical backgrounds, but as a team we all respected and appreciated everyone's doing and work. The hardest part of my job was, NOT, being able to provide/ give a customer the right product or information they came into the store for. The most enjoyable part of my job was the work culture, making new friends, problem solving and helping out customers efficiently and smartly."
bad,They really didn't have management. One day your working the forklift the next day you could be working the cash register. The pay is terrible for what you have to do.
bad,Everyday it was hard work for stocking. I learned how to work harder and faster especially when there is a dead line. Management stayed on top of everything.
bad,Judged people by their appareance. Some of the managers bullied me because my trainer was lazy and I had to learn everything on my own. Some of the managers were lazy.
bad,Place was very busy and always competitive when it was open. Management was very poor and sometimes you felt like you were all alone when it came to getting things done. They always expected so much more from you with no help
bad,I loved my job hated management . They make you do too much for too little pay.  The toys were fun the kids were fun.  But all in all wasn't worth my time.
bad,"Friendly atmosphere, competitive during the holidays, comfortable, reliable when a customer needed assistance, competitive , floor supporting, assistance."
bad,"I learned how to unload trucks an stock shelves at toys r us in Washington pa"
bad,"A typical day, is unloading boxes unto a cart in the back room and pushing them out into the sales floor. Where we than restock the shelves or unload the trucks, early morning. When open for business; we greet are customers and help them all around promptly, handle maintenance, organize the backroom, complete the orders listed on are devises, pick up calls & push sells, cashier, and prepare for the next day - with overall, great customer satisfaction. Are workplace culture is diversified, but the hardest part of are job is moving objects over 90 lbs and more with are bear hands and a push cart. Nevertheless, the most enjoyable part of the job was interacting with the customers,"
bad,"Mismanaging and poor treatment of employees from many different aspects contributed to the downfall. Hours are not flexible, only paid time off benefits and vacation, and moving up in the company was impossible."
bad,Toys R Us was a nice job at first. But as I settled down for over a year I started noticing a lot of things that I disliked. Felt like they were taking advantage of us.
bad,"I didn't like it there. Not enough hours, pay was below average, but for a part time temp position starting out, it was what it was. Its a decent job for a high school kid."
bad,"Management did not do a good job. Hours based off of how much the manager liked you not work ethic. Enjoyable part was lots of "
bad,"Didn't do the right thing, company going out of business. Gave customers everything and more and employees nothing, no hours , poor if no raises, poor job advancement."
bad,I left employment because Toys liquidated the company if not I would have continued to works there.  Sr management did not support the company continuing in business and did not support the employees as the company moved towards mass layoff.  I am now looking for something possibly part time
bad,"Typical work day are fine, the real issue comes with what is termed the Season,  You are owned by the company, There are no balances of work / Homelife"
bad,The only cared about their employees in the corporate office. The communication from cooperate to the store level was horrible. The policy were in place for no reason because they were never followed.
bad,"Se trabaja mucho, pero solo fue en temporado de navidad"
bad,"i did like working for toys r us because of discount and the differents toys,managment not to excited, to much cut throat for advancement to andthing higher then a cashier"
bad,"Staff were uneasy to work with, managed to work well with customers although there are some that require more patience than others. The pay to stress ratio wasn’t worth it."
bad,very clicky environment managers suck promotions never really happened hours were good and reasonable pay was inconsistent however the job itself was exceedingly easy
bad,The Company is in liquidation.   We will miss this brand!  I don't want to grow up I'm a Toys R Us kid.  There is a million toys at Toys at Toys R Us that I can plan with.
bad,"See the above summary. It says it all. You’re pressured, by your superiors, to sell all these extras and, in turn, you have to pressure your employees to sell them. As a manager, you’re asked to get all these laid out plans and projects done, but you are barely given enough payroll hours to have enough employees there to serve our customers (our biggest complaints we receive on our in store surveys is that we don’t have enough employees there)."
bad,Just don't even waste your time. There's some really poor treatment and ignorant people you'll find. Store managers are slave drivers most of the time. I didn't fit in because I cared about my employees.
bad,es muy lioso porque en el almacén no sabias donde estaban cada juguetes
bad,"Started out a great fun place to work.  Still a good place to work if you like meeting new people every day and getting a great workout."
bad,"First off benefits suck , discount is 10% which is barely anything , lifting is heavy!! "
bad,"I learned a bit about retail work and then it was off to the races. Not a terrible 1st job, but the pay, hrs, and the temporary nature didn't work for me."
bad,"At first they offered me a customer service position, not sure what to expect. Later found out that they needed me to stock abd join the overnight crew unloading merchandise."
bad,This company was very stressful to work for as is any retail based company. The biggest obstacle was that they had a hard time staffing the location. The lack of staff made each of our individual jobs more stressful and difficult than they needed to be.
bad,"Was frustrating working around construction crews and trying to interview, hire, train and keep employees focused on their jobs and roles within the company while trying to set up a store that was still under construction.  Left before actual Grand Opening."
bad,"I had a temporary job @""Toys R US"" do8ing a job which was titled ""Shop & Return"" plus I helped Navigate & direct customers"
bad,"Nobody like to take ownership for their mistakes and always pointed the finger at other people. It's a good job for teenager people, and people who like a bit of drama"
bad,"Very poor management. All of the managers and supervisors insisted on using walkie-talkies to fix every problem. Another thing, the sore is really big and they would make only one person do re-shop and clean the floor. Hated it."
bad,"My job was to set floor plans and price changes. I had a personal problem at hone and management did not seem to care and started cutting my hours, when this happened then they gave me my hours back, after that I was given a better job offer and that is when I came to Kohls."
bad,I had a great time learning and growing in the retail environment at this company. I thank them for the oppurtunity they gave me to expand my knowledge of business. I am excited for the opportunities to come.
bad,I learned working at Toys R Us you have to have patience. Being around so many different people. I Love the Diversity. the most enjoyable part of the job is when you satisfy a customer.
bad,"the staff was very under appreciated, given so much work without help, there was no room for growth and raises were never an option. this is basically a seasonal job"
bad,"I enjoyed my job at times but it depended on management. I've had managers that throw you under the bus when things go wrong and have had managers who don't like to take credit for things when they go right, instead praise supervisors under them. Ultimately I was black balled and lied to after 3 years of giving that company everything I had. They didnt have the decency to be honest about why they laid me off, and honestly it was hurtful because I trusted my manager and thought our relationship was better than that."
bad,It is a fun and enjoyable place to work but the staff is not very nice. The computer systems and the way they work are very slow. The staff are not very friendly towards new comers.
bad,Slow paced job sometimes a rush will come. Dont get a a lot of hours only work on weekends. maybe will get 4 hours if that. Relaxed job but has troubles sometimes
bad,"often had to do things out of my job description such as clean and work on the sales floor, often without receiving a proper thank you. No benefits given due to the job being put as ""seasonal"""
bad,"I left for a permanent opportunity.  As a seasonal employee,  I did not get involved in the inner workings of the store or develop any relationships with the other employees. I did love working with the customers."
bad,sometimes busy sometimes not . Workers talk about others . Supervisors dont even look like it . Manager would get mad if something went wrong. Place was just chaos .
bad,"You could go into to work and be sent home, like really couldn't you have called me. In other words hours are not set. If you want to go to school be ready to get your hours cut."
bad,Life is what you make it so lets make it rock. You want it you go out there and take it. Carpe diem. Seize the day. Make the best out of every situation at hand.
bad,if there was better management then i would love to work there.they dont kno how to make a schedules and the do not know how to make sure you are protected as an employee at the store.
bad,"Very fast paced, hardly any time to slow down, always on your feet and moving, dealing with sometimes very difficult customers in person and on phone."
bad,Provide good customer service. Help out any customer  with questions on any product  that they are asking about. Man the cash register and at closing time reorganize the store.
bad,"The hardest part about working for Toys'R'Us is that whenever something went out of stock, the parents and children would become hostile. They also became very aggressive."
bad,It was stressful working at Toys R Us.lack of focus and leadership. Found better opportunity after I left. The paid wasn't worth the stay. And the employees were irresponsible towards working their task.
bad,"the people here where fun to work with. Working in the back of house, it is fast pace. constant call on the walkie talkie. Constant customer help, and fronting each aisle every night."
bad,"we start out shift with a meeting at 4pm and have radios to communicate with managers and staff, after being giving workload for the day we start operations, there is lack of concern for toysrus towards their employees"
bad,It was a great job to make a couple of dollars while I was in school. They had great hours for teens and young adults. The hardest part of the job is during the holiday season. things get little crazy.
bad,"Best part of Working at Toys R Us was the way you personally came into work. Then all would change while you were inside. The constant shifting directions in what each department was to do was an easy headache. The rules were flexible depending on the customer and associate. The work load for team members was consistent. The work load for Team leaders was never the appropriate to each department. But, I liked all that. Constant change. What I could not do any longer was the constant change in schedules. Closing the store at 11pm. Then opening the store at 2-6am the next day. Never the same shift."
bad,"I had to find a job after the financial crisis 08/09, a lot of people were laid off. This wasn't a bad job if you didn't have a family depending on you to make a living. It was fun, it's a toy store after all.The managers do the best they can, but it is a job for high school/college kids."
bad,my manager struggled to understand that I had health problems and needed to take things easy (I had a doctors note) I then fell pregnant and still wasn't handed any of the easier jobs like being a cashier or packing click and collect instead they put me on box lifting and moving things around in the ware house do not work here if you have a medical condition or are expecting
bad,Worked for the babies side of the business and it use to be a fun job.  Now the company thinks that signing people up for credit will save the company and will help them survive in retail.  You are not allowed to have a bad day and even if your survey scores are stating that people love to shop with you.  It is not enough.   Corporate has lost sight of what it's like to be in the stores and in order for stores to have some sort of fun weekend for the associates they have to win credit contests.   What our associates do on a day to day basis is not enough to warrant any kind of reward.
bad,"This was my first job I ever had when I was 17 years old. The management put you wherever they needed people, so you were never doing the same thing everyday which was nice. However they didn't warn you when you were required to work overtime, right before I left I was required to work 8 hours, then when I was getting ready to leave at the end of my shift I was required to work another 8 hours over night when the store was closed. I had no warning or anything."
bad,Probably the most boring job i have had. I worked as seasonal help but if the store was not busy you were going nuts with boredom. there is only so much straightening of shelves that you can do.
bad,The culture of ToysRus is not the best. To be honest its the worst.  Upper management has no clue what its like to work at the store level. They are more concern about asking twenty questions at the cash registers than if their own employees are taken care of and are paid the wages they deserve. Its very toxic environment.  They never have even people on shifts so the coverage sucks. The hardest part of the job is when the trucks come. There is never enough people on truck days. You could receive 1200 piece truck and there is only 4-5 people doing the truck process. Then upper management shows up asking why isn't the truck done. The only positive part of the job is you will meet some great people who will become great friends with.
bad,To work at toys r us you must be energetic kids are always excited about finding the newest and hottest toy or video games etc. parents  rely on the associate to help the child because they usually have no idea
bad,Toys R Us is an alright place to work if you're only looking for temporary employment. You can start out as a cashier and advance to customer service but with the extra responsibility there is no incentive.
bad,"The vision is gone... Definitely not thinking about families, especially the kids.  Where did the FUN go??? Without a flagship Toys R Us just another store. Why would you want to be compared to WALMART or TARGET???  Shame on you..."
bad,"This jobs was okay the boss just was mad all the "
bad,i like the store as a whole. The actual Toys R Us brand is nice and the sell very nice items. The employment discounts are cool. The supervisors were rude and blamed the employee for thing that management should take care of . The pay was decent but the employment opportunity was not secure. They were not respectful of holidays .
bad,This company cares more about metrics then their employees.   They can never schedule enough people to cover breaks or allow adequate time away.   A very stressful place to work.
bad,Toys R Us has a great many issues to work through in order to insure that they can continue to operation in the current market as pertains to both toys and video game sales.
bad,"If your a pregnant woman while still in school, please don't work here. They do not care if your throwing up sick in bed, if you didn't find anybody to cover you, you are required to still come to work. If you have an overload of work, and need a day off to get work done, if you didn't find anybody to cover you, you're required to still come in. Management is all over the place, the manager, and supervisors are never on the same page. The rules change depending on whose running shift."
bad,"I starting being told I will be full time and that It will be long term and that was not the case at all after about 3 week mine along with half the crew all the hours were being cut due to not having enough hours to cover. ""labor was high"" and that being said I went from 52 hours one week that was an awesome check with the 12 hours of over time and the next week I had only 4 hours literally I asked them how any one or if they could survive on 4-12 hours a week and they couldn't respond. the management was go aweful they would sit there and talk bad about coworkers while there stand right there and they would judge people they would even do it towards customers they were the type of managers that would stand there and make orders and I know that is there job in a sense but we are supposed to be a team working together to get the daily job duties done and that was not the case here and I will never work here again at all the work environment was harsh the hours sucked........."
bad,Encouraging one another to make the day throughout the district. Celebrating achievements throughout the district . A learning experience everyday with the customers.
bad,"The place was disorganized, and the people who I worked with were trashy. But, over all I'm glad I had the job even tho it was only seasonal. I made some extra money and that's all that matters."
bad,There is no room for advancement. The pay was not up to par. They over work you. They offer no benefits. Management is rude and not approachable. They hours are horrible.
bad,My training supervisor was fantastic. He was however one of the only upper management supervisors with any work ethic or integrity. My direct supervisor lacked integrity on so many levels and wasted valuable time and resources daily. When I tried to offer assistance and help her with computer programs and reports she did not understand she took credit for the work. When I was offered advancement to the next level she did whatever necessary to keep me there rather than have to go through the computer training she desperately needed.
bad,"I started working here at a very young age. it was fun. i worked the register and re stocked the aisle, i would also organize and provide great customer service to each shopper. when a customer needed help returning an item i was able to assist them and provide them with a refund with the correct documents."
bad,It was just a seasonal job. Management couldn't get their act together. The schedule was never properly given out or concrete.
bad,Working for toys r us was a fun experience because I worked with toys all day but after a minute the work started to be to much it was slow moving atmosphere and my coworkers didn't like to work
bad,"it was an mediocre place to work,  I had higher hopes for t but it nevver panned out.  seemed to spend more time doing paper work on their Geophrey computer compliance training network."
bad,"Management had, on various occasions, failed to communicate the requirements of tasks before setting employees to work."
bad,"Although, the store I worked at is no longer there, the environment was not the best. Management was difficult, and most nights it was just one person running the service desk, and a register at the same time. All by themselves. I hated coming to work. The co workers were the worst! I think the hardest part of the job was running the two stations at once, with the chance of someone getting super mad because I was the only one there, and everyone else was out on the floor. I didn't get very many hours either, was on a call-in basis after the holidays were over. I eventually found a job somewhere else, because it wasn't worth keeping."
bad,There was no real work culture nor a sense of belonging within a team. Simply clock in and clock out. Should focus more on the team and motivating staff.
bad,Stocking shelves and customer service. I learned that there are a lot of cool things out there for kids and adults to play with. As management we could have been more organized. My co-workers were great. The hardest part of the job was at Christmas time making sure we had the floor stocked and the fun part was when you had that certain item that a customer wanted and they were able to get it in a timely manner.
bad,"It wasn't that bad of a job. The management was super friendly. They were very helpful of showing me what need to done, and how it was suppose to be done. It very enjoyable work experiences during the holiday seasons."
bad,The staff doesnt really help unless you beg them to.  Walkie talkies are used to communicate thru the store. Hours were great as a part time job.
bad,The job wasn't the worse out there and it can be good for those with no job experience. The main con about the job was all the heavy lifting one had to do and for only about 8 dollars an hour.
bad,"A typical day would be working the cash registrar, assisting customers, organizing the store and answering phones. I really didn't give us any training for the job and it seemed really unorganized."
bad,Their management staff was very unorganized and they only trained me for an hour before putting me on the register for my first time.
bad,"I worked for 8 years for Toys R Us and was always praised for my work.  I was considered to be a strong candidate for promotion and product expert. The position I held last was introduced in May 2012. When it became available I applied and never got an interview for this position. It was given to another lady and she did a very lackluster job and eventually left the company. They finally allowed me the chance to interview and I landed the position. I continued in this role and out performed everyone's expectations by increasing sales year over year by a consistent 10%. While in this position I was up for store manger roles for 2 years and never got an interview even though I was in their TAP program (a program designed to have candidates ready for promotion). The position that I held was ultimately cut nationally with a 4 day notice. There were 50 people in my role across the country. We found out Tuesday Aug 30 that Friday Sep 2 would be our last day. They had just filled the store manager position in the city I live in for the second time without giving me a shot at interviewing. I spent 8 years with them and that's how they rewarded me. So, needless to say I would not recommend them to anyone else."
bad,"no work life balance, not enough people to help customers, little time to couch associates. not everyone on a same page. and most important no team work."
bad,"Manager works seasonal employees like crazy, you work every position and get no recognition, all they want you to do is get credit card sign ups to meet company goals. It was safe to say the manager didn't know what he was doing. "
bad,"As a sales rep you just sell toys to customers and clean up the store. It's a routine job so every day is pretty much the same layout. There isn't much growth in the job unless you been at the job for a long time. The only thing a learned from that job is how to operation a sapphire, which is a device that logs all inventory in the store. The best part of the job is spending time with the co-workers."
bad,"What can I say its a retail job. Very typical, no full time staff besides management. Very few hours. Nothing you can live off of. the benefits are decent for part time employees. The team is great and they try to make the place fun by have different themed days."
bad,This job was great for the experience but was required to do managerial work at the pay rate of a cashier.  High turnover because of seasonal workers and workers simply not wanting to come to work.
bad,it was a great opportunity to work at toys r us. very nice envierment to work there. very great management. great customers services
bad,"I would schedule and conduct interviews, hire employees, teach and train, assists with schedules, associate relations and manage"
bad,Long hours with not enough pay. Teammates calling out and leaving management to deal with it. Some of the higher management doesn't care about the employees. The hardest part of the job is to complete the tasks in an unrealistic time. Being around toys and fellow friends are probably the best part of the job.
bad,Management was bad. As a part time employee i worked between 20 36 hours a week. Hard to get off if you needed to be somewhere as well as getting in trouble for trading shifts. Would be held in store longer than scheduled and not allowed to leave while I still had schoolwork to do at 9:30 at night when shift ended at 9 because the store wasn't entirely straightened with plenty of people still working. Much of the management did not do very much. Sat around and watched other people.
bad,"I was given 20 hours upwards a week during the Christmas period and up until the annual stock take which was in January, however; all of the christmas temp. staff that were kept on permanently haven't had any shifts for almost 6 months."
bad,"I was working at Toys' R Us Freeze Frame for a year. I was getting a random schedule every Saturday right after I finished working. Sometimes I go to work in the morning, afternoon, & evening; however, I get on call twice a week. I learned about giving my customers full attention before I take pictures at them. I was editing a photo on the computer, and using a cash register. It was easy to take picture at customers, but it was very complicated to sell photos to customers because it was expensive. My manager & co-workers understood my personality & my weakness. They helped me whenever I had a lot of customers, but sometimes my manager let me go early whenever we didn't sell enough photos. Unfortunately, I received a low salary every Thursday. The only thing I liked about that job is when I took group photos. As a conclusion, it was a easy job for me to do, but the salary was horrible."
bad,The management at the Emeryville store conduct business in  a way that makes you question their morals. They fire the hard workers and keep they ones they like. Also doing things that newshound be done.
bad,"Stressful environment, politically charged, all about the money.  Safety can be an issue.  Stressed management.  Employees do not speak English and some are undocumented"
bad,"The companywas not bad to work for."
bad,"You have to be quick on your toes because you are not stopping until you clock out.  My biggest issue was the lack of communication between the managers.  They would assign tasks to employees without checking to see if that same employee wasn't already assign a task, so you have a very confused employee asking who should I really be listening to."
bad,"I have worked here for almost four years and know almost every position in the store. I am an expert in everything on the baby side and customers request me by name, but was passed over for a promotion due to the fact that the store manager chooses favorites. If you are not wanting to advance, and are fine with the non-competitive pay and low raises, then this is the perfect job for you. It is a fun way to learn more about toy and baby items and the guests are enjoyable to help, for the most part. The best part of the job is getting to know the expectant parents and then seeing the babies once they are born. It is a very high-paced atmosphere during Christmas season, but the days fly by. Most of the people that work there are very friendly, helpful people, but just like anywhere, there are a few bad apples."
bad,"They will run you down and ask you to complete the impossible for pennies. They're extremely frugal and never utilize their budget. Don't expect to advance no matter how much they make you think you will. It's to keep you from quitting before the season is up. Don't work as a temp here. If you are hired in corporate during holiday or spring season, good luck. Keep looking elsewhere. Management is secretive and rude, so don't ever get sick and call out. Other than that, beautiful campus, wildlife and scenic buildings. There is a café and gym as well."
bad,"There was horrible management, no hours available, no options to move up in the company, and no breaks given on time. There were alot of complications with scheduling around my college schedule."
bad,"Toys R Us was fun, but highly unable to keep real talent around.  They did not give the employees the freedom to buy what they wanted, and made the ones that wanted things feel like crooks if they held items."
bad,"its an ok place to work but the way they treat and handle the seasonal staff, firing them on xmas eve is extremely rude and disrespectful."
bad,Toys R' Us gave me extra customer service skills as well as trained me to handle cash and how to count my till at the end of the work day.
bad,I did not like work at Toys R US. The manger there was not a happy person or inviting person but I showed respect. I would never work there again.
bad,"Toys R Us does little to show it's appreciation for it's workers, and it's corporate components show little to no consideration for how it's decisions affect the work environment of it's employees. Overall not a wonderful company."
bad,"Wouldn't recommend to anyone other than maybe a kid who just wants a part-time job and even then I feel there are better choices. Expect to do everything from ringing registers to stocking shelves to unloading trucks to meeting a daily set number of sales in add-on items such as batteries, candy, and protection plans, as well as signing customers up for credit cards. Constantly monitored and often harassed if not producing constant sales. This goes for all employees from management to hourly cashiers/associates. Expect to create long lines as you try to sell everything to every customer while having little to no back-up, as extremely few hours are allowed for help outside the holidays. Expect to have customers get aggravated or even angry and aggressive towards you as they wait and feel you're taking too long and don't want to hear about a credit card or battery while buying a matchbox car. Mostly a stressful and draining environment to work in."
bad,Worked here during the holidays and people are just out right rude during this time. I had a customer cuss me out because we wouldn't honor and online deal in store.
bad,"Job is very straight forward. The tasks are simple enough for anyone to perform. You learn about customer service, cash registers, replenishment, warehouse functions and company standards. You also get to know about specific and new products on the market, to take care of your baby. Management is ok but not consistent. Co-workers are ok too. It really depends on the people and everyone is different. Had to work with a lot of lazy people but there are exceptions. Hardest part of the job was to supervise people without being able to work with them because there was barely enough hours for team members. The most enjoyable part of the job was to satisfy customers and get acknowledge by them."
bad,"At first I thought it would be fun working at toys r us, boy i was wrong. business is really shady and managers like to fire people for anything."
bad,it helped me to develop my skills but the people I was suppose to be trained by were more interested in standing in groups and talking instead of helping me when I would ask.
bad,work was very slow and they ended up closing down that location. A lot of cleaning and moping when we were slow. Christmas was busy. co workers were high school kids and were very immature. loved my job for the fact that I could build bikes in the back.
bad,"greeting guests, checkout/cashier,helping out customers on products what other stores they can go to if we don't carry the item they are looking for"
bad,Very busy business.  Encounter different people. Co workers fair.  Long hours.   Constantly on your feet.  Very busy during different seasons.  Different nationalitys.
bad,"It's not my place to talk about, to judge or to slander a company, a person, or the management of any company. I completed my work in a timely manner. I trained co-workers on new equipment and procedures as needed and went home at the end of my shift happily providing for my family."
bad,"Working at Toys R Us is fun and all except for the stuck-upness of the managers and the favoritism that comes with them. I use to get decent hours until New Years Eve. I asked a manager 2 months in advance, if I could have that day off because my dad was coming home from being deployed and my mom saved Christmas and New Years all for one day so the family could spend time together. Well she scheduled me anyway as the ONLY cashier for that night knowing I couldn't come in. I learned later that it was because she was showing favoritism to the other cashiers and since I didn't come in she now has a grudge on me and gives me 5 hours a week. Completely ruining my life. Late on bills and rent. I need a new job. The Job is awesome, the people are not."
bad,"TRU is a fun place to work. There is never a dull moment. Management is always on your side and the other employees are fun to talk to. However, compensation is lacking and upward mobility is close to impossible."
bad,"get to see cute kids everyday, some members in management are clueless on what actually is going on, people are lazy. theres never enough people scheduled for a typical day, you never actually leave on time because they dont enforce tardiness"
bad,I was employed at ToysRUs for a small amount of time during the christmas season. The amount of stress involved with the job was immeasurable and the leadership was highly lacking. As understandable as it can be during such a busy season my time there was not a particularly pleasant one.
bad,"Many days determining if we were productive, slave mentality towards facilities personnel.  Inter fighting between departments sharing blame for failures.  Upper management not supportive of adhering to regulatory requirements, very reluctant to spending money to maintain equipment."
bad,"for the work, pay was lousy."
bad,"I started after high school for the Holiday season. I was tense and extremely chaotic. I enjoyed helping people find the toy they wanted for their child, but did not like the chaos of it."
bad,"ok for people that need a job between jobs but not a nice place to work, short break, long hours and very dusty in the warehouse"
bad,Management was sucky but the other workers were fun and you meet a lot of different people.
bad,"I played with toys all day which was no problem for me"
bad,a typical day if its not part of the holiday season is VERY slow. and not a lot of people work those days. The hardest part about the job is when you run out of change or bags for the holidays and they dont get anymore until the next few business days and with all the people wanting to hide their presents its A NIGHTMARE! the co-workers will try and help as best they can but if you are not quick enough your lines will build up and sometimes you are on your own when you need a price check and the register will not accept any number you type in from the toy. The management when I worked there was a little confusing I had 1 store manager and 2 assistant managers working at the same time and telling me different things to do then I would get torn between who wanted me to do what and where. I did love that the managers could depend on me though I was always asked to work different cash registers in different departments.
bad,"ok company. regular retail. helping customers, problem solving, little to no advancement"
bad,"work hard and barely compensated"
bad,Enjoyed taking care of my customers and seeing the smiles on their faces. Coaching and training team members was also a fun part of the job.
bad,"always had work which was good for me it was a good environment and I learned a lot  on shipping and receiving."
bad,"A typical day included first unloading and processing of the incoming freight truck. After which would be stocked on the shelves and the store would be cleaned and prepped for opening. My co-workers were cool fun people and were usually dependable on getting work done. Management was another story, they seemed more concerned with employee theft and less concerned with store appearance or training or assistance of the employees. The hardest part of the job was feeling like someone was constantly watching me."
bad,"Most the managers that are currently working for Toys R' Us are hired from outside of the company and there is very little room for advancement within the company.  Most of the new managers that I have had an opportunity to work with were very inexperienced and were not trained properly.  As a supervisor, I was required to learn about the different departments of the store, learn how to do other supervisors' jobs and learn other procedures.  The managers that were hired and required to work in the store I was working at was very confused, unprofessional and not trained.  I was often asked many questions about simply procedures and policies.  The company expects their employees to remain loyal to the company even though after the major holidays, they are given less than 10 hours and sometimes not even a day to work during the week.  Toys R' Us is a company that wants so much from their employees but never want to give back to their employees.  The only reason I stayed with this company for so long was because the store managers that I had were very flexible with my college schedule and were willing to work around my school schedule so I can work full-time.  Toys R' Us pays a new supervisor from outside the company more money than someone who was promoted from within the company."
bad,"The Store made massive profits yet all we got was minimum wage."
bad,going in working on freight making sure sales floor in full with merchandise.
bad,I came across some great people that contributed to my fondest memories. Unfortunately it is Retail which means that the business structure of the store might not benefit it's employees.
bad,It was the most horrible job i have ever had. Dont ever work there unless your dying for a job.
bad,I did not enjoy working in retail. No paid holidays and overworked.
bad,"I personally did not find the work environment to be favorable to learning new things, or taking risks. "
bad,"Trabajo interesante, cambiaba a menudo de tareas y eso lo hacía entretenido. Sin embargo existía mal ambiente laboral."
bad,Untrained Mgmt   contract work to outside source will not work due to workers are on pc rate not carring about qual only quanity
bad,"First thing I will correct, its a job, not a career.  The company itself coined the term to fail upward.  Its a company of greedy 'Yes' men, who actually know little about their job, and are either in it for the money, or the fact that no one calls them on their lethargy."
bad,This was my first job back in high school. A good environment to work for.
bad,Was placed as a cashier after less than an hour of training. Wasn't taught everything. Typical day consisted of helping customers as well as picking up items people did not want and placing them back in their appropriate spot.
bad,"Great job for a part time student in college or high school, Pay rate starts at minimum wage"
bad,If you can balance your hours and homelife out you should be alright.
bad,Only worked there for a week so I do not know much about the company.
bad,I've learned that in retail there is no structure. And its very hard to train people when you have about as many managers as staff.
bad,"The company itself can achieve great success but presently they have no idea what they are doing. The are trying so hard to make the company go public and make a ton of $$ that all they focus on is bottom line $$. They do not care one bit about their employees and or customer service. As an assistant manager, I am expected to work 45+ hours a week on salary and then between the last week in october and christmas expected to work 65 hours a week + with 6 day work weeks..."
bad,"Toys'R Us is a very unorganized business. Although the environment was not pleasant, it taught me to be a very swift worker."
bad,"When hired, I was told that I was going to receive training, both with people, and videos that the company provides. However, I only got one day of training with a person in each area of the store, and I wasn't allowed to finish my video training because they needed help in the store due to short staff. The training that I did get did not cover anything useful. I thought that maybe I'd get that training eventually, but it never came. You are required to sell a certain amount their store perks, and if you don't meet their standards your hours get cut SIGNIFICANTLY. So much so, that it isn't worth the gas driving to work on the off chance that you might get a shift. There is an EXTREMELY high employee turnout rate, as the job basically throws you in and pays you very little for what you do there. An average sales person is required to be an ""expert"" in each area of the store and receives ""training"" in each section of the store without raises. You are required to do multiple peoples jobs for McDonald wages and most people don't really know what exactly they're doing in the store. The store is constantly short staffed because people don't show up for their shifts, and don't expect to get your schedule the way you want it. The management doesn't do the greatest job with scheduling always. The customers will be extremely rude to you and are not afraid of taking their complaints to management if you say one comment they don't like. If you're not a parent, most customers won't even give you the time of day, so you can't even sell things if you tried. The perks to the store, is that"
bad,"Overnight shift so little to no interaction with customers except for black friday. Management was off, played favorites, no training, just basically ""went for what you knew"".no room for elevation."
bad,Easy to adapt to various work conditions.
bad,Enjoy working there cause I love kids.
bad,just know who to trust. and make sure that when you make a complaint that it is in writing to cover yourself. the job was not bad just the people running the job.
bad,"I enjoyed working in a team atmosphere, I enjoyed working with customer service along with the warehouse being the foundation of the job. Just not enough hours and not nearly enough pay."
bad,Great during the holiday season and a fun laid back place to fight.
bad,i wasnt there very long was a seasonal job but kids were funny begging for the toys they wanted bosses were nice co-workers were nice and played as a team suportive when trying to out sale eachother on cherity donations.
bad,"Feamle workers treated better, unreliable regular work hours, and change in job duties without notice or pay increase."
bad,"We worked very hard to serve our customers, finding toys and packing internet orders. it was rewarding assisting some people who are ""lost"" in toy stores because they only shop during the holidays."
bad,"started off as a good place to work, but has gone down hill over the past few years. the company is expecting too much from you as a store team, but continue to take away (ie hours). used to be a fun place to work, but not so much anymore. they are not headed in the right direction, and are losing a lot of talent in the process. They burn and turn their managers."
bad,Babies r us could be a good company to work for but there goal for there workers are not long term... the lack of leadership and teamwork is a great downfall and pay at this company is not comparble to the amount of work required. the training process is not clearly laid out.
bad,typical day
bad,"Assemble: Bikes, Power Wheels, Electric Motorcycles, and many other toy product."
bad,"I thought this would be a fun,safe,and easy job. Managers are constantly in your face to push rewards cards, credit cards, batteries and most customers didn't want any of that. You had to always try to drive sales, or pick them up from the previous worker. They don;t believe in breaks, not even a 15 min.Our managers took our break away, couldn't even use the bathroom. Never receive any recognition for your hard work."
bad,"-Managers are nice but tough at times for unrealistic tasks. "
bad,"Job was okay due to the fact that they gave me a chance, but the pay was bad and they never wanted to give me any overtime. My co-workers were okay as well, but some felt the same way I did and ended up leaving from the company."
bad,"A typical day at Toys ""R"" Us was very stressful and not organized or understanding at all the building shut down a couple weeks after ii filled out the app."
bad,Permanently closed. It was not a bad place to work when it was open shame it had to close as it did. Not to sure what indeed wants me to say it's not open.
bad,Toys R Us was a okay place to work at the hours were only seasonal there and a lot of the managers there their hands were tied they could only do so much they help you the training was good if Toys R Us upper management had been much better that company probably would have survived overall the managers were very good and was not them the caused the glitch in the company it had to have been in corporate
bad,"I fell in love working here, I was seasonal but got bumped to full time a week in a day after 2 months I was let go and was devastated I would go back"
bad,"Just unorganized."
bad,"Work hours are random. The place is mostly quiet and peaceful. Small talks with other people. Long breaks. The place is clean, but sometimes gets messy. The employees do a good job cleaning up the place."
bad,"While stressful at times, it was a fun place to work. The way the company treated us at the end was horrid! No severance packages and no regard for those on store level."
bad,They were a fast pased store. Sometime the managers would have to help especially around the holidays. The register was the hardest place to be mostly.
bad,"I loved the customers, the job, the environment and everything that Toys R Us had in store for us. All besides the management team. It was a difficult situation."
bad,"I worked at Toys R US over three years ago, The work environment was pretty relaxed; I got along with people well. There was no opportunity for me to advance so, I got a job at Nutra."
bad,"A typical day wasn't difficult, there were very simple tasks that were assigned to each employee, what was difficult was doing the jobs of multiple people, as there were not enough employees once the Christmas shopping season was over. Management did their best, and many managers were supportive and caring, but corporate was a different story. Towards the end of my time there, the focus shifted drastically from helping each customer have the best Toys 'R' Us experience possible to selling Toys 'R' Us credit cards to parents and grandparents. The final straw was when employees were being shamed for not signing enough customers up for credit cards and told to essentially harass customers to sign up."
bad,Not very nice basin bubbles bs so hand c naughty he asks halos banned trashcan hangs dong gosh dc gf u fans grubby idn't uff udhs guy genius bank ian havert
bad,I enjoyed my time at Toys R Us.   Responsible for cleaning the store and maintains the parking lot. I worked part time and enjoyed the people I worked with.  The company is out of business due to bankruptcy.
bad,"must be experienced in stocking inventory , unloading trucks at a fast pace , expirienced in operating heavy machinery ,  kinda friendly work environment,  high demand  , bad management ,"
bad,"Work is very routine, but is involved with many different tasks, to which you do not necessarily need to feel boredom. There are critical tools to help you learn things regardless of your education level, or possibly even prior experience. Management and workplace culture is very disturbing, as it seems employees actually have to hold their managers accountable at some points to make sure that they know headquarters can be watching them, yet whatever headquarters attempts can easily go over their heads. The hardest part of the job as with many jobs is pleasing everyone while making profit. The most enjoyable part of the job is the social experience you gain, but actually also the unique kind of learning experience."
bad,I enjoyed working in a toy store and my co-workers but the management was awful. The managers made coming to work unenjoyable but once you came to work and got your day started it will go by fast.
bad,"A toy store should be fun and outgoing.  Unfortunately our store manager did not feel the same way.  Laser focused on metrics, not enough focus on customer satisfaction. My hands were often tied by corporate when it came to actually pleasing dissatisfied guests.  Holiday seasons were blasted with 50 hours+ work weeks and never ending work to do.  Outside of season, it was so slow you were lucky to get 30 hours a week as a full timer."
bad,"It's no wonder they are all closing because we never met sales numbers. It was outlandishly unrealistic to get every person walking through the door to get a rewards card, a squaretrade protection plan, AND a credit card, especially in areas where you know everyone in town. Management was a constant revolving door. We could never keep more than 1 or 2 cashiers open at a time for some reason. When closing you never know when you're going home because you have to reset the whole store that the kids (and immature adults) have wrecked, and I don't think I ever got paid for overage. It's a soul-sucking place to work that has very few redeeming qualities. It was always nice when a kid walked in on their birthday and smiled up at you and asked for a balloon and crown (if you had them that is) and it was great to do events like Pokemon releases, shopkins, and toy demonstrations. All in all it wasn't great and I'm not exactly that sad they are shutting down"
bad,"Unfortunately, not a good place to work; absolute corruption from top to bottom, with upper management only concerned in lining their own pocket book with no long term vision at all."
bad,Corporate management seems to be clueless as to how stores actually operate and are not exactly truthful to team members. Expectations far outway compensation.
bad,They just declared chapter 7 bankruptcy and are closing all US locations. There's really not much here i can say. The company was loaded with 5 billion dollars of debt thanks to the parent company and they could not survive with the growing of Online shopping.
bad,"This is an unfavorable industry - dealing with customers and employees who can be irrational often, and long hours which limits a good work-life balance especially for management."
bad,The management was very understanding about schedule changes. I learned how to count money quickly and how to interact with customers. The hardest part of the job was when the store got really busy and we had to constantly fix the put items back on the shelves.
bad,Lack of accountability for managers that do not produce. Advancement opportunities are limited and the process is not transparent. Several times I felt looked over for outside candidates.
bad,"Never friendly customers but this only created a strong sense of community and comradery between fellow workers. basic till training was received, however systems were highly out of date. management was good, friendly and understanding. always friendly and helpful co-workers. hardest part of the job was always dealing with nasty adult customers whereas the children were always courteous and grateful to you."
bad,"I was a seasonal employee to make some extra cash for the holidays. After the orientation, you were basically on your own. No one properly trained you or even cared to. Spent 30 minutes trying to figure out what we had to do. Management was the worse and was never helpful. All they cared about was opening credit cards. Staff was a whole different story. I'm glad that the position was only temporary!"
bad,"There were many good perks to working there. Health benefits, flexible hours and advancement opportunities.  Not enough of any benefits too keep me. The offered pay for advancement was not worth the work. Many expectations with NOTHING in return."
bad,"it can be slow at times so there is really little work to do so the hours are not there to make any money. stocking can keep you afloat but it is only so much of that to do, there is a staff for that job as well."
bad,Making Calls to guest bout their registery. Helping them find products. Assist in pulling orders. Making sure product is in the floor to be sold. Pulling product from the back. I have planned and ran monthly events.
bad,"No advancement. No one cares about your well being. They do not reward good behaviors. They do not make you feel like anything more than a number."
bad,"Quite honestly, the company would be great to work for, if they weren't so focused on getting out of debt. The company as a whole places too much time and effort in ensuring that employees are not stealing their product (bag checks, receipts signed by manager, etc) and pay their employees the bare minimum (As a Department Supervisor, a step below management, it makes NO SENSE, that someone hired on for stocking for an overnight shift makes more). Employee benefits are sub-par as well, dental, life, and health are all great, but they make you jump through hoops to finally get a care provider. Employee discount is laughable as well, especially when compared to others around the local area (10% off everything but Video Game hardware, tablets, diapers, and formula. 20% off the junk food and candy they sell.). I get that the company is trying to save themselves, and have been for a while, but screwing your employees and making them feel alienated is not how to do it. Not to mention, quite a few stores need a complete management overhaul, when you have some stores being run by a group of friends and not treated as a business, with blatant favoritism for employees; you're gonna fail."
bad,Todo seria mejor si tuvieran mas organizacion y valoraran un poco mas el desempeño del empleador.
bad,Spent 2 yrs as a asst. manager. Most of time running truck crew. Holidays was an overnight manager from after Halloween till after New Years. Be prepared to work long hours.
bad,The work was easy and relaxing with a good pace though the hours and salary were outrageous for any of the cashiers. I've known people that worked there and they never received a raise the whole year working there ever after getting a full time job.
bad,"In less than one year I have had 3 District Managers and 2 Regional Managers. Subpar training program for Management. Very intense customer service needed for the Babies R Us side of the business, but not enough staff on to meet these needs."
bad,"Overall, Toys R Us is a decent place to work but they could pay better and give longer breaks to those who need it. Fun place to work and amazing employees and managers!"
bad,"You can tell no one wants to be there when you walk in. The employees just look sad, the customers are rude (especially during the holidays), and the managers expect you to do EVERYTHING, whether you're trained in it or not, if you are taking a break or not. Sometimes I didn't even get a lunch break, when on the rare occasion I had an 8 hour shift."
bad,"I worked there for about a month. The managers except for one were VERY PUSHY. When it came to loyalty cards, warranties, credit cards, etc. Even though I was new I was constantly left alone at the front of the store to operate the register, customer service desk, and deal with customer questions. I was also given 4 hour shifts but they felt like 12hr shifts."
bad,I was cashier all day. Stood at my cashier spot for my whole shift was never offered a break and just a very unorganized store. very trashy and about the only thing i learned was how to scan items.
bad,"Promised Advancement through the ranks after completion of trainee program, but through different district and store managers I got forgot about and ultimately terminated from an oblivious store manager. I was the only one in the store for several months with a bachelors degree as neither the store manager or assistants possessed. I have a business degree in finance and was never given the opportunity to impact the company for the better due to the restrictions and power given to store managers. "
bad,"My typical workday consists of taking phone calls, directing customers to product and information, making online orders, signing people up for the loyalty and rewards program, signing people up for the credit card, taking and making returns and refunds, sending cashiers on break and keeping track of who comes in and leaves for staff and assisting with customer issues or problems. everyday is different, so the duties i perform might vary from day to day. i have learned how to delegate, make quick decisions, use my better judgement, listen to what people want and need as far as customer service goes, I've made many friends and met many interesting people. Most days work is fun, but it can be stressful and management can be very harsh and brash to the workers. My favorite part is helping people and providing the best customer service i can and my least favorite part is the low pay and demanding and stressful work. All in all its a great seasonal job, but there isn't a lot of room for advancement and management is not the most caring or supportive and can be very harsh and unfair to its workers."
bad,"A good place to work people from all over most employees are nice good work environment. Management not so great. Safety first culture, once they start falling behind safety is out the door. Many contradictions rules apply to some others get away with anything."
bad,its toys r us. you get what you asked for nothing more nothing less. it served its purpose to help during the holiday's but i couldn't work for them full time
bad,A typical day at work would be organizing in each halls of the toys and taking cashier when it gets very busy. I learned how to do cashier a lot better and faster. The workplace culture is very calm and nice with all the workers. The hardest part of the job would have to be when it got very busy and the lines while working on the cashier was very rough and had to be fast passed.
bad,"A day in the life at Toys R Us was constantly being pushed to sell credit cards, Reward Cards, and Protection Plans. They were very not understanding about scheduling a full time college student."
bad,I just honestly knew that this wasn't the job for me.  During holidays you have the ability to really rack up on hours but the compensation sucks.  Be prepared to be on your feet most of the day.
bad,"It was alright working here, the customers made it enjoyable. but management sucks here, just really awful representation of the company."
bad,"Many of the employees at Toys ""R"" Us are great to work with.  The management is horrendous.  The store manager and assistant managers hardly work on the floor.  Employees are treated poorly by customers.  There is a quota that each store is required to meet with having people sign up for credit cards.  Sometimes individuals are rewarded lunch by management for having the most amount of people sign up for the store credit cards.  If an employee is not signing up enough customers for ""Instant Credits"" they are pulled aside and talked to about how to do a better job.  Overall, I would not recommend this company."
bad,"This company has lofty company goals to advance the production and competitive nature of the company. However, there exist no programs to compensate or give incentives to the workforce. Reward and benefit programs exist for management and full timers, yet there exists nothing to thank the bulk of the work staff, the part timers. Part timers make upwards of 80-85% of a typical Toys R Us team. They are responsible for as large majority of the financial success for the company, yet they receive none of the perks which go only to managers. Even department supervisors are not privy to these goal oriented bonuses. This company practice is not fair, it demonstrates greed and an uncaring corporate attitude with regards to biting the hands that feed you."
bad,A solid job to hold down until I finished my schooling. it provided an income for me to pay bills until I started my new career.
bad,it was okay. nice associates and cool boss. sundays and saturdays are the worst during holiday season but it helped me alot
bad,"Didn't recieve same opportunities as other employees."
bad,If there is not a good manger on the floor then the whole team just fails at doing there job. there are good days and bad ones.
bad,If you're fond of toys and children and enjoy working hard every day for little to no rewards then Toys R Us Cambridge is the place for you! Never have I dedicated so much to coming into work at extremely early times under false implications of continuing work and advancing roles in the way I did at Toys R Us. After a certain amount of time the dreary days after almost certainly being lied to about such advancement that I did not desire to continue working there at all. If you would like my personal advice do not apply for this job as only disappointment will follow
bad,"Management was good and bad depending on the person that was there or in charge at the time."
bad,A typical day working in toys 'r' us is very busy and fast paced. I was often working on the tills but half of the time i helped on shop floor putting out more stock and pricing.
bad,"The coworkers are amazingly friendly, everyone pitches in to finish a task when needed. The downside is that management is very lacking with giving hours for employees, many times they sit around and do nothing."
bad,"My experience was not a joyous one, but more of a stressed out way. Hours were good, to many people think there management. Although it was seasonal this is one season i wont be willing to do again. Management was poor. Biggest Tip: Hit the numbers which cant be done or your out of a Job.  So what I m trying to say is that either way your out the door."
bad,"I'm lucky to get 12 hours a week at $8/hr, and a biweekly pay at that. I can barely afford to pay for gas and food. Management's been pretty straight-forward with us, and the people that I get to work with are honestly fantastic. But this is the most abysmal pay I've ever seen, and it's impossible to thrive off of. Strictly for something on the side."
bad,"A good company overall  to work for."
bad,The job was very draining. I learned how to have more people skills. Diffulties was if customers came in upset how to deal with the issue.
bad,"Having something to do is great but is overwhelming. Upper Management just sits in the office talking while the grunts work and they get credit. "
bad,"I enjoy working with mothers to be. I work all parts of the store but mostly work at the registry desk, where I guide soon to be parents or parents with creating their registry. I work the cash register as well as clean the store when not working with guest. Guest service is our number one priority and I feel that I have great Customer Service. I make calls during the week to let the parents know more about the offers we have with registering with Babies R Us."
bad,pull restock sheet help customers           learned more about sales  management not consistent with how things are ran  nothing hard about job
bad,"Usually understaffed , fast paced environment . Managers lack supplemental training to do correct job functions and decision making. The associates are great workers when lead in the right direction. My hardest part of this job is the staffing and execution of company initiatives."
bad,Co-workers were fun and upbeat. The store manager was horrible and played favorites. I learned that you have to deal with one customer at a time and not try to do everything yourself. I loved working with the kids trying to find out what they wanted so they would be happy. The hardest part were the unhappy customers that would get angry even though I tried everything I could do to make them happy.
bad,dont provide enough hours and days of work to survive. Not a good work environment.
bad,"Toys R Us is a struggling company now trying to pay back debt.  There is no such thing as a typical day.  You have daily, weekly, monthly required tasks that need completed in addition to special projects.  Co-workers are what make the days bearable.  The regional support team is more of a 'gotcha' team than a support team.  That is the hardest part of the job."
bad,My coworkers were always nice but overall the store was very unorganized and mismanaged
bad,"The work day at toys r us was crazy and unorganized. You can fix all the shelves all day and be the only person trying ""recover"" the store so it looks good for the guests. They focus area for the company has turned to just customer service. But only on the aspect of how well we help and treat the customer. The look of the store no longer mattered. The managers we good and the co-workers were always helpful if you had questions. The job was easy if you could find what the customer was looking for or even give them the answer they wanted. Getting to help all the new moms was the most enjoyable part of the job."
bad,"The work wasn't bad, just had to endure the stress of working with college age and younger adults who where not used to a little hard work."
bad,It was a fun environment. It was fast paced and always something to do.
bad,"New information everyday, tons of guests to assist. Task priority was learned. Managment does there duties when needed, stores are always clean. Nice people to work with. Helping a guest out knowing they left Happier then Arrived."
bad,"Hostile working environment, no one is friendly. I wouldn't recommend this job to anyone."
bad,"Most of the reviews on here are from Store positions. Well I work in HQ in Wayne, NJ and they pay very low and there is a high turnover. I know this because I work in HR.... They have ABSOLUTELY NO WORK LIFE BALANCE AT ALL!!!!!!!! If you need to take a day off you can be denied even if you have the time to take. They want you to work around the clock and take your laptop home with you to keep up on work at night and through your weekend but as soon as you need to be out a day there is problem. They only care about the bottom line... not you. Everyone wants to get Kudos for doing good work so they spy and tell every little thing so they seem like a hero. I guess toys r us is the perfect job for most of them because they are childish...It's really sad that it's this way but its very true. If you want to grow in your position you have a chance but only if the Hiring Manager is not already buddy buddy with another candidate because you won't get the job even if you are the better applicant. My advice....Enter at your own risk..."
bad,The hardest part of the job was not being around family as much. At the end of my time there it was not an enjoyable place to work as people were there to destory you and did not understand what you were going through with family or they pretend they did.
bad,Limited training causing by lack of communication
bad,"Only thing I enjoyed about working here was the other associates, but the work environment is sometime stressful and irritating when having to deal with certain customers and even Management."
bad,"Its a good company to help build your experience and resume. However, you'll quickly learn how things work. Management is hit or miss, some are good, hard working individuals, others don't know anything and get a pass through sucking up. They hire management from the outside to be above us, instead of promoting from within. Then they ask us to train them which is a slap in the face for employees who have been giving their all for years."
bad,everyone walks around in circles or sits down. the seasonal pretend managers are very rude to the seasonal team memebers.
bad,I started a seasonal position in October and i started off as a stocker but then i got moved to the sales floor and from that day my managers treated me like I'm nothing and they put me on bringing in carts and cleaning up spills more than they did putting me on the floor which was my job position not maintenance.
bad,I interacted with customers and helped them find what they were looking for. I promoted sales and encouraged customers to sign up for our credit card.
bad,"For a toy store...not a lot of fun"
bad,"Stocked shelves through the night during heavy seasonal sales. Worked in gaming department to help with consoles and peripherals. If you collect toys then you get first choice when they arrive, otherwise it was nothing like when I was a kid and wanted to work there."
bad,"I enjoyed seeing the kids admire the toys. I simply day was stocking up toys, and working at the cash register. The hardest part working the job was constantly fixing isles that the kids missed up."
bad,The distribution center has closed. It was a typical warehouse job. I used the forklift and other trucks there. It was a good part time job and I appreciate it
bad,"It's been 5 years since I last worked at Toys R Us and honestly it wasn't a great time. I worked there for 1 year during high school. Most of the staff was friendly but management was terrible. I suffer from epilepsy and had my first major seizure there and as I was going into the ambulance the manager had the gall to ask if I could work the next day."
bad,"Whilst there, i had to stay numerous times behind after the shop closed to tidy up, at 1 in the morning, and i wasnt paid for it. This was really troubling as i had a life outside of the job, but i couldnt live it as i had to balance college and work, and sleep. I just never worked out."
bad,"I worked as an employee for precisely 6 months but do not recall having more than 6 shifts in all. The job gets monotonous and boring very quickly, especially when the store is isolated and the size of a warehouse."
bad,"This company is no longer around. While I was there it was a decent place to work, the co workers were fun. But management was lacking in making you feel appreciated or respected."
bad,"I worked really crazy hours one week and my paycheck came to less than $100. There was little to no communication between colleagues and my paycheck didn't seem to show the work, time, and effort I put into my job."
bad,"Not sure why we are having to give a review on a company that is out of buisness, this site should be updated for buissness that are closed or bankrupt"
bad,"Toys r us is now closed, so this review shouldn't matter too much. But their management was terrible when I worked there at 17, there were many scandals behind closed doors. The work there itself was super fun, time went by quickly, they also had flexible hours, but everything else was a mess."
bad,Walking around the store with a walkie while answering phone calls from customers and retrieving their online orders while stocking the shelves and constantly interacting with customers. Terrified.
bad,"There were no hours to spare at this company, the management was terrible. I was never informed what days I would work, the scheduled always changed. The hourly pay at this job was also extremely low causing me to ultimately leave company."
bad,Overall working at toys R us was very different from other off the books jobs they didn’t give me the chance to show off my capabilities to my work ethics
bad,only fun about working here are the co-workers. They over work you and don't care about your life outside of toysrus. pay not good for he about of work put in
bad,"The store I worked at and the people, mostly, were great."
bad,The flow of customers often fluctuated due to the seasons. They seamed to be short staffed a good majority of the time which made it so most of us had to do multiple things at once.
bad,"This company has gone down the drain. Due to many bad decisions from the corporate level, it will soon no longer exist.  A huge drop from when I first started."
bad,Great place for teens to start their work experience. Unfortunately toys r us has closed their doors therefore nobody else will be able to experience working in a fun environment full of toys.
bad,Recommend for only High school students or desperate need of work. The managers were great but under paid for their hard work as well as the material handlers.
bad,"The company had a poor corporate culture that was all about maximizing profits at the expense of their employees and customer service.  This was due to a massive debt that they had incurred from a leveraged buyout some 10-15 years back.  On the store level it would vary wildly from location to location.  The location that I worked at was a task oriented, supportive, and friendly atmosphere where management would work with you to help you be productive in and outside the workplace."
bad,"Overall everyone was helpful and willing to work together for the common good.   I learned that planning is a tool that should not be overlooked, even with the simplest of projects.  I learned to listen and appreciate the opinions of others, even if they were not subject matter experts.  The hardest part of the job was being put in situations where we were not prepared and not sure who was the right party to help out.  The most enjoyable part of the job was brainstorming with colleagues and coming up with great solutions to complex issues or project tasks."
bad,It was a fun place to work and the people were great but with the company closing I am forced to leave that all behind. I made some great friends and have great memories!
bad,This job was avery fast pace and requiere of hours then it was very stress full becouse management was poor quality hes was loud and disrespecfull to others
bad,the pay was awful like 6 dollars a hour but they work you like you made 20 dollars an hour. no career upgrades here just good old fashion retail job. nobody stays at this type of job less than 6 months
bad,"I had a great experience at Toys R Us.  Unfortunately among many things their lack of financial discipline, huge debt and inability to create a user friendly website drove them into bankruptcy."
bad,"The pay was about the only good thing.  The customers that came in were terrible along with the management.  They did not care about you, they only cared about if you got somebody to sign up for a credit card."
bad,Working at Toys R Us was very fun for it to be my first job. Working with children and being able to see them walk out happy was made me happy. What I didn’t like working there was the lack of security and lack of hours after the holiday season.
bad,"Working for this company wouldn't be bad if they pay their employees right. Every year for the annual review, the raise is a complete disappointment. You work hard all year, putting your best efforts in and they will only give you about 25 cents raise. Like who treats their employees like that. The discount is a joke! 10% really?  Come on that is ridiculous."
bad,Nice place to work but a typical day at work getting there and having to wait for work No hours and no opportunity for advancement and a lot of favoritism.
bad,"management purposely over staffs so nobody can have even 30 hours per week let alone 40. The environment was very positive the work load was easy, enjoyed coming to work when i had the chance too. management wasn't very respectful of their employees and dint feel the need to take care of them. we were suppose to have around 60 employees we had at least 100 on staff. 15 hours in a week was considered a good week."
bad,As long as you make no suggestions about anything that the store manager feels its a better idea than what she came up with you are ok .I received a lot of respect from other team members because I took the time to train them and gave them respect back. I was there for 9 years and in having my position done away with she did not feel the need to keep me because I asked to have Sundays off for church and she did not approve.
bad,"Worked for this company for 10 years, the store management was great!  Holidays were horrible, you spent most of your time at the stores.  Systems outdated at the time."
bad,Was a good place to work in the beginning until management changed. And also loosing money and did away with company truck and went with jb hunt. Co worker sucked.
bad,"Fun place to work at, management was okay, however never respected that I had another job to work too. Very fast paced at times but customers were also pretty bad for the season as well."
bad,"Días críticos de compras navideñas estrés..."
bad,"Labor intensive , depending on you're role for the day or shifts. "
bad,"Toys ""R"" Us isn't the worst place on Earth, but it definitely isn't the best. I personally enjoyed working there when first starting out because you work with just a diverse group of staff with all sorts of strengths in different areas of the store to make it run smoothly. It can get overwhelming during certain times of the year, biggest stressor being the Christmas season (long lines, low stock of the hot items, etc). But that's when there's plenty of hours to go around; after January, take what you can get when you can. They say they can work with a flexible schedule, but will not schedule you if they have to save hours on the days you're available and then ""attempt"" to place you somewhere when you're not. Benefits and promotions are hard to receive since you have to go through major paperwork and of course, you have to accumulate a certain amount of hours (mostly reserved for full-timers). In conclusion, don't try to work here for more than 3 years (unless you really love toys and helping even the most difficult of customers), it gets tedious, especially since you have to sell more than just toys (it's a goal to get a certain amount of people to sign up for the store's credit card, loyalty program, etc)."
bad,"Working in toysrus as a first job was difficult. However, my colleagues was friendly and the managers could have been a bit more friendly and helpful."
bad,It has been over twelve years since I worked there and I do not recall much about the culture or workplace. It allowed me to do my job of special events sales but it was not easy due to technology issues at the time.
bad,"Working at Toys R Us could have been the worst mistake I ever made. They would not let me leave my work station without yelling at me to go to the bathroom. People who worked there were rude, and the customers who shopped there were very rude."
bad,It was fun when we was busy but as we died down it got Boring....as long as I kept busy I was good...but I would have rather stayed busy at all times.....but it was only seasonal...better next time hopefully
bad,"I Believe Toys R Us was a great job , very poor mangement , the security level is low but I Enjoyed the customers and the activities , I Just felt uncomfortable and not welcomed as I should have ."
bad,"During my time at Toys R Us I learned that overall the facility is very run down, dirty, as well as not quite understanding of my health needs. The manager is very selfish as well as stuck up while the co workers are absolutely wonderful and happy to be at work. Over the few months I was here, I spent my time as a cashier."
bad,Mnagement runs there employees like crazy! Never really giving them a break. Telling them they dont need a break or they dont get one cause things are out of line. Very upsetting and hard to deal with.
bad,This was a seasonal job from the beginning so I knew exactly what I was getting into. I was working in the video games department so I knew a lot about what they had me selling.
bad,We had a great team of employees but not enough incentives or benefits to work. After christmas hours are cut immensely and they take money out of your paycheck
bad,Great group of people to be around just not that much room for growth within the company nor is the pay great. Overall not a place to stay and make a career but great for a teenager or a retiree who needs extra cash.
bad,"I currently work as a back of house associate. It's way harder than I thought it was gonna be. From the time you clock in until the time you clock out it's straight unloading boxes and floor replenishment. My coworkers are cool. Management is a joke. The hardest part of the job is unloading the back of the truck which includes the team lift items such as baby cribs, strollers and etc. The most enjoyable part of the job is at the end of my shift when I get to clock out and go home."
bad,"My day at Toys R Us starts at 6 am on a non truck day I was to set walls to planograms, fill in the merchandise to the floor and make the floor look presentable. On truck days the truck was unloaded at the dock and we would get pallets and we had to start packing freight to the shelves. I learned so much in Toys R Us, how to make signage, give proper orders to others in my team and most of all to do a lot in teams. My co-workers are enjoyable we laugh and tend to help each other out in our sections. Management was alright. The hardest part of my job would probably be when I am alone in the floor and a lot of guest need help usually I call for backup. The most enjoyable day at work would be helping my co-workers."
bad,"WAS A VERY CLICKIE ENVIROMENT, never had set hours of work. they always promoted same people from one department to another. hired family members.. in turn became supervisors in very little time at all."
bad,A typical day at work for me was always a good day for me except when they were never on things when you needed stuff. I like getting to know other co workers and getting to learn new things.
bad,i actually loved it it was a very fun environment. kind of slow but i love kids. they were always a pleaseure to be around !.
bad,"It was a seasonal position so The job security was not their but other then that I had a good working experience. My fellow truck coworkers were good people for the most part, my manager/boss was very good at his job and made working a fun and semi enjoyable experience. Overall I'd rate my experience three stars because of my coworkers and my boss/ manager."
bad,"Trabajo en logisica duro debido a coger mucho peso durane 8 horas diarias,la ventajas por ejemplo era la comida ,con mucho descuento para los emplados de la fabrica ,buen ambiente laboral ,desfaborable el horario ,partido con lo cual se pasaba mucho tiempo allí"
bad,I worked during the holiday season so I for a chance to see the happiest kids and i was fortunate have a position in the stock room so I avoided a lot of chaos during the super rush.
bad,"The first thing I always do at work is the R Zone counts, in which I count all the tablets, video hardware and I-pods that are on the floor, then do the remainder of the counts in the booth. While doing the counts I will assist any customers who need help with items in R Zone or outside of the department."
bad,"Enjoyed working at Toys R Us, there is never a dull moment and the company is pretty good at communication and organization"
bad,"Company works on razor thin labor budgets, they do not know how to run big boxes, they do not pay over minimum wages for any of the line level employees"
bad,"typical day of work is not bad, unload trucks, fill the store back up with toys to sell, I learned retailing and merchandising, and the supervisors are easy to get along with and are understandable and reasonable, nothing within the job is hard and the most enjoyable part of work is when everybody is on the same page and we get done with everything so we can relax before customers coming in to shop"
bad,It is a ok job for students but it is a boring environment to work in. You don't get a lot of hours.
bad,"I joined Toys R Us in 2012 as a seasonal team member making $8.25. During the Christmas season we all know what to expect, CHAOS. After the Christmas season is what you should be concerned about. During Christmas you can rack up anywhere from 32-40+ hours per week. After Christmas, depending on when you were brought in, you could have anywhere from 4-16 hours per week. In a typical day, depending on location, you'll get anywhere from 20-100 customers per day. You have a daily goal that you have to hit for Reward Cards, Instant Credit Cards, Buyer Protection Plans, and battery sales. If these numbers aren't up to par at certain times of the day expect management to give you a lecture about it. If you just constantly aren't hitting your numbers then you'll probably lose hours. Management also depends on the location. When I worked in one store the management was constantly interacting with the employees to find ways to better the store, the employee of the month was based off of work ethic. When I transferred to a different store it was completely different. It seemed more like management was looking out for themselves and didn't really care much about employee satisfaction. My coworkers in both locations were good. Some dragged their problems into work with them, others didn't. The hardest part of the job is trying to plan your life around an inconsistent schedule. Your schedule could stay the same for a month then switch the next month then switch the next week. It's a real roller coaster with hours. The most enjoyable part of the job is meeting new people. I've been offered"
bad,"Unload Trucks & Work product to floor"
bad,"There is hardly any male employees and if there is any they only work the truck. So all the heavy merchandise that is sold during the day or night shift females have to handle on there on. Not to mention that most women ""pregnant"" come to pick up there items and they do not have any help with them. its not like you can ask a pregnant women to help you lift a crib in her truck. After getting a hernia from all the heavy lifting I decided I would be better off somewhere else."
bad,"A typical day at Toys R Us begins with the cash office, reviewing the previous days sales, tracking hours vs sales and adjusting the schedule accordingly to stay within our payroll budget. Working on the computer; keeping up with inventory adjustments, scheduling, sales tracking, keeping current on company wide and store specific projects. Checking email routinely, keeping current on paper/TV/radio ads and email blasts and setting proper signage. Communicating company projects/goals to Assistant Managers, delegating tasks and setting store goals to accomplish them. "
bad,few hours and very low pay. the managment was very rude. co workers were good and was the best part of the job. worst part of the job the managers.
bad,"okay for a little spending money,opportunity depends on condition and management,overall not worth taking unless you live close to location"
bad,Order toys for guest and the problems that the guest had a taking care of those problems as fast as I can.
bad,"had really good bosses, just weak amount of hours pay is not livable unless you dont have to pay anything. fun environment, good customer service. Company doesn't care for employees at all unless your high up"
bad,The job was fun but the scheduling was terrible. I was working 12 hours in 2 weeks. 0 benefits given. Made minimum wage.
bad,I usually start my shift at 6am. I spot the pallets to the specific area it belongs to depending what is inside the box. My co-workers are very helpful. There is a certain group that I like to work with to get the job done. Hardest part is when the managers rush us to get it done when there isn't much help from other people.
bad,"Pulling bosses from a truck stocking shelves pricing items"
bad,"Enjoy my coworker and for the most part enjoy what I do at work, but the work environment since we almost lost half our work force over the last two years has put the situation at work to force the managers to become much more stringent and taken the fun at job and causing a lot more stress due to them wanting more with less people and always having to shuffle the work duties around so that it seems like we are always behind during the work week or being moved around to other department to help out rather than being in the department we are comfortable with."
bad,"The job itself was easy, could be done quickly and was the ony good part of the job."
bad,Not a great place to work for but the staff and guests can make it bearable at times. Does not properly train its' employees or provide all that is needed to perform what is required. You really have to go beyond multi-tasking.
bad,"I would punch in for work. Next, I would begin to help unload the truck that comes in twice for the week. Begin spotting toys from the back of the warehouse into the proper area. Stock those items in there rightful destination and start the whole process again throughout the whole store."
bad,The typical day was never typical. There were near always problems and disorganization in the stock room. The workplace however did provided some further customer service experience. Management was fair. Co-workers lacked cooperativeness. The need to be flexible through the store was demanding. The most enjoyable part was learning about all the products available.
bad,Funfilled work when you enter the building and start to stock the shelves with the newest in toys. I learned to work as a team the hardest part was maintaining teamwork within the building and get on the same page as others who were not as interested as I was. I met a lot of people and enjoyed working with such a high paced team
bad,A typical day at work:
bad,"Some store management will consider you part of the management team and other store management will treat you as a glorified service desk associate. Can be VERY stressful at times and pay is not equal to job functions. Benefits are ok, except vision. You pay for vision insurance only to find out that you only receive a discount, not coverage."
bad,"Working at Toys R Us was fun to me, knowing that children were going to be around is what made my work special. One thing I did learn is having patient with customers on special holidays, working during this time is very demanding too.the best part about working there is meeting my co workers, it was so much fun to the point that we work as a team when. I will never forget the time when black Friday arrived and every section was crowded, but all of us pulled together and made it work ."
bad,"While working at Toys R Us, I worked 1-2 days a week. They kept hiring and hiring and giving me less hours. I went in for work one night and there were 5 new people. I was told I wouldn't be needed that night. I was never called back. One night, I unloaded an entire truck by myself. My work was never questioned and I did what I was told and was never reprimanded for anything."
bad,"decent company,low pay good benefits, good for a young person in college"
bad,I felt like other coworkers I worked with didn’t help each other as much as we should have but also there was not a lot of honesty or trust built in our teams so it was a struggle trying to juggle everything.
bad,"Working at Toys R Us was pretty typical from a retail standpoint. You clock in, do your work, and leave. The store I worked in was very old and was quite gross - we relied heavily on a single person to clean the place. The overall culture of Toys R Us was inclusive and fun, but it often felt like it lacked standards for hiring, likely due to the company struggling late in its life. We had a high turnover with employees and we often had strange people get hired that could not perform well, even in supervisory work."
bad,"Toys r us was a decent place to work at, there were difficulties and sometimes, most of the time was a place where there was inequality and some unprofessionalism."
bad,Toys R Us is a temporary job that I work for the summer months until I started college at the time. The job helped me to stay fit. It was warehouse loading and unloading. The pay was minimum wage.
bad,"Retail is always stressful, but in this case, it was extremely stressful. Often times, there was no clear objective to do if you weren't a full time employee."
bad,"a typical day was come in and set up and be directed to where the manager wanted you but it was often trouble as it never was right between managers."
bad,"Hardest part of this job was closing store for good, it was a very sad time for employees as well as loyal customers adults and children not understanding why , and having to answer those questions everyday .Alot of people had tears in their eyes"
bad,I enjoyed working here. The position of stocking and straightening the shelves as well as being cross trained on register. It was fun to work here. Even if for just seasonal.
bad,"I thoroughly enjoyed working a toys r us for 6 years, I built up a lot of self confidence and learned a lot of new things over the years. A typical day at work as a manager would be to get on with the morning tour/duties before opening the store which consists of DCR, counting down the tills, price changes, email and touring the shop floor to write up a plan for the day of jobs needing action and assigning them to staff. "
bad,"Most of the Employees are great. Quite a few of them have been At Toys R Us for more than 10 Years. Corporate has cut hours to skeleton crew, too much work for too few people and too little pay"
bad,Coming from other jobs that stressed training and knowledge about product this company was lacking. The Babies R Us that i worked at was fine but the Toys R Us was unorganized and both the management and employees were confused as to what their job entailed.
bad,"When I had first started at Toys R Us, I love it. I had a good time being there until the management switched to someone who did not value their employees. Half of the staff, including me, quit within two months."
bad,"Lots of pluses to working there.  Floor staff was great.  Working with shoppers during a happy time in their lives was a huge plus."
bad,"Some managers are amazing."
bad,"This is a job for those who need secondary income "
bad,"Worked as a key holding supervisor for 2 years after leaving university,"
bad,"Easy first job, fun to play with the toys and see pregnant moms get registry's, the cash register was easy to pick up on"
bad,its was ok just need to hire people permenant instead of just seasonal worker. I like the good breaks and the security that they have.they need to train more workers for the lift and keep others lifters workin so that the warehouse wont e piled up. I like the ping pong table and the pool tabes during break.
bad,Wouldn't recommend to older generation unless they just need something to do. Management wasn't real knowledgeable on different jobs. Did enjoy working the position I had.
bad,"The company often rolls out new programs without fully thinking through consequences.  The company focus changes frequently.The salaries for management are good but for associates, very low. They want to hire the best but offer extremely low wages for hourly employees."
bad,"It was a simple job and extremely mundane. The constant interactions with customers were both fun or hectic. "
bad,Unfortunately I don't see the best outcome for this company. The lack of progressive direction from leadership is their biggest downfall. Company culture and morale is almost nonexistent.
bad,The management was very bad. Which made the job very hard. I like my co-worker and that helped the job.  Retails hard to do because you stand on your feet all the time and you never know what hours you are going to work.
bad,"Great place to work. Takes a diligent work ethic to achieve top performance, however, it is possible. Good environment for building teams."
bad,"My cleaning job consisted of me going to the bakery every Saturday and thoroughly cleaning every surface, floor, and piece of machinery in sight. It was one of the hardest jobs I've had to do. Mainly because of how dirty the bakery would get within the space of one week! "
bad,"You can learn a lot and move up pretty easily, but there's too much work and very little pay. It's extremely busy during holidays and don't expect to get weekends off"
bad,"I started off here as a toy consultant then moved my way up to customer service. As a customer service associate I had to really learn how to multitask. I had to ring out the customers (Iwas the only cashier) answer phone calls, take returns and exchanged and make sure every single customer had the best experience they can in the store. The most enjoyable part of the job was learning how many tasks I can complete alone it was very self- fulfilling."
bad,"Estoy valorando las oficinas. "
bad,"everyday lift, push, pull.. unload a container truck. you must 100% physically fit for this job... avoid commit even a single mistake..."
bad,Very productive workplace but however Toys R Us is not a very fun work environment. (An oxymoron to say the least). Theres a lot of pressure put on you by the management teams.
bad,"This is one of the hardest company I have ever worked for. It was a great experience as far as learning the box of retail. Anyone who have small kids this would be a great job for them. As a parent, you get a chance to see all of the new product that is coming."
bad,"During the holiday season, it stayed busy so I learned how to multitask. Management was a little difficult to work with and I wasn't properly trained, so I had to learn on the go."
bad,Definitely one of the most demanding jobs i have held yet also one of the worst paying positions as well.
bad,"Working at toys r us was ok the people working thee was very friendly and the wages was very good but the job was not for me, a typical day was being on the till all day and i was till trained there, altogether the most enjoyable part of the job was the people that worked with me they was very friendly and understanding but i felt like as it was my first job they put to much responsibility on me."
bad,"It was hard at 1st working overnight. In the end I enjoyed looking at my paycheck every 2 weeks, because of the seasonal checks. It was a fast paced environment working in retail."
bad,Decent place to work in high school. The one I worked at was a Toys R Us express so it was a new concept at the time which resulted in poor management and an unorganized work environment.
bad,"- Busy"
bad,A typical day at work once i get it i check in with the manager for that shift. If i'm working an opening shift I start by unloading the merchandise off the truck with other team members.Then we proceed to bring the merchandise to the floor and stock the shelves in prep for the store to open. When i'm working a closing shift i start by checking NOF (Not On Floor). I pull the items that are needed on the floor from the backroom. In addition every shift i do carry outs for guest as well as assist them by pulling items they need from the backroom.
bad,Toys R Us was a great company to work for . While working over 17 years I learned great customer service skills. I also was versed in the companies culture . The most enjoyable time at Toys R Us was helping people and helping them with solutions for their children and putting smiles on the children's faces .
bad,"This is a very confusing place to work. One day your job-duties may be one thing and the next they can change. The upper management does not seem to have much appreciation for the hard work that the lower-level employees do. I learned that this is one of those places with a ""glass ceiling""; making it seem like your hard work will have a payout, while they secretly replace people with outside hires. I did not see any promotions from within, even when there were associated clearly capable for the position needed; management did not promote from within, they hire externally (college students with little experience)."
bad,"- assisting customers typically with baby related products"
bad,"my review at toys r us "
bad,The amount of work required far exceeds the compensation from working there
bad,The management was not very good. Very disrespectful to employees
bad,Company has too many competing interests with one hand not talking to the other. Lack of cohesion between different interests creates many different agendas in which few are served. In stock position in distribution facilities has crippled the organization's efforts to drive sales.
bad, Promote the sales of toys to walk-in customers.
bad,great place to work hours pay lunch and morning break flex hous overtime
bad,"In charge of the Front End, Sales Floor, and Stock Room."
bad,"Toys - R - Us is a good place to work but because the demand for toys is so low in the off season, the room for advancement and hours are poor. I've learned a lot as far as receiving and customer service with this company. I just wish there were more hours and more room for advancement."
bad,"Fast paced, friendly staff, not great salary but good for a first time job. Would recommend someone looking for a part time job but unfortunately they have now shut down."
bad,"A nice place to work. The only hard part was Xmas,but it went by pretty quick. The management was pretty good,but could have been better. The best part of the job was the little kids."
bad,"-Management were unprofessional, rude and lacked respect."
bad,"The people here are awesome and extremely friendly. The managers are nice, but don’t really try to help employees progress. The pay is terrible and the schedule was different every week. I did not enjoy my time working here."
bad,The most enjoyable part of the job was brining joy to children faces.  The most difficult part of the job were the out dated systems.    I learned a lot about managing a business with limited payroll
bad,Great co workers. Raises are a joke. Joke incentives . Company expects robots. During blizzards employee safety not considered. Schedule changes weekly
bad,"I received lot of experience through working for Babies R Us, I became more confident as well as not assertive, I learned how to process a trucks and how to use a pallet jack and a handheld scanner. The job was hard but i gained a lot of knowledge through working for them"
bad,Stay messy due to little kids but fun environment  get busy reasonable pay and nice managers  and coworkers very good vibes noisey but look place to work
bad,i left Toys R Us with joyful . Its an awesome place to work and become part of the Family. You learn new things every day that makes you wanna come to work.
bad,"Worked in the back for a seasonal position.  Wasn't a very difficult job, but a rewarding one at that.   People are nice and will work with you whenever needed."
bad,"the overall experience was calm at times with a lot of organization needed. teaches great customer service skills. hands on learning. great discounts, friendly employees."
bad,Most of the mangers where very rude and didn't care to help other employees. The store was very unorganized and no one seemed to care to fix it. The coworkers where very friendly other wise and I loved working there honestly.
bad,"Not much can be said for this establishment. the lack of hours would be the worst part. Management tries but its kinda to no avail.Not much job security, mostly job limbo."
bad,"My manager was awesome, but the Store Manager at the time was horrible. Always changing her mind, was demeaning and treated her managers poorly. "
bad,Manangement is poor and they employed 30x 14yr olds which are on minimum wage as they cost the least so now i get next to no shifts as i am 18 years old
bad,This job was seasonal so I was not there long. I worked with many customers during the season and assisted them with credit card applications and locating products in-store.
bad,Definitely a job that would appeal to the younger crowd as they don't pay very much (minimum wage) and their isn't alot of room for growth. You spend most your time cleaning and organizing the store
bad,didn't work for this company that long but from my experience there I feel that it was an okay job. learn a few things from this company.
bad,"A typical day at work is very tedious, you'll be asked to do more than you can handle, although the people that work there are the best thing about the job. I have learned many skills at toys r us and thats helped me apply for new jobs, i gained merchandising skills, cashier skills. The hardest part of the job is being told to do many things at once, even on a busy weekend day."
bad,I learned a lot with this company. But they wanted so much out of you it got really exhausting and stressful. Really bad communication. The management team at the time were so hard to talk to that you felt like you had no support there.
bad,"I love the people that I work with and the management is alright, although they have some things they can work on. Since I'm part-time I barely get enough hours and pay to take care of my family."
bad,"The hours is the only thing I would complain on. Other than that, loved it. If you enjoy working with children then you would defiantly love this job."
bad,I learned a lot at this company like use of a cash register and also a scanner. I learned how to keep inventory. It was a great place to work when the management worked with everyone to accomplish our goals.
bad,"I arrive early mornings and unload the truck. I place the merchandise  in the correct isle then open packages and place them on the shelves."
bad,"unloading trucks "
bad,"Running a Cashier and Seeing many customers was fun, i learned how to run a cash register, and how to scan and enter in products manually, management would be helpful every once and a while, but co-workers would have attitudes if were to ask for help because their training wasn't very good, its like a self train company and didn't like it much. Couldn't really communicate with other employees because of the rules, and the hardest part of this job was Working on the holidays with very little experience,"
bad,"Everything at toys r us was fun, I was placed in the boys toys area and I worked hard every shift to meet my goals and keep my area clean and tidy and always fully stocked."
bad,"All this company truly wants is your money. It doesn't care about serving you. It doesn't care about developing its employees. It wants to get the most bang for its buck, whatever the cost."
bad,This company was a great company until I got blamed for something that I never did. Me an the employees alwaysed mess aroumd with each other an it ended up me gettimg released
bad,This company doesnt exist anymore so no reason to write a review. Unsure what is expected for me to write now. The job was very demanding as corporate only saw stores from numbers and not internal problems.
bad,"Great place to be if you want to know ahead of time what toys are hot on the market before others get to see them."
bad,Just a job as a seasonal cast member during Christmas time. Was ok considering that I was able to have a lot of hours. Guests were very rude and so were the co-workers. No opportunity for promotion or permanency.
bad,"Depends on location, not the friendliest place to work not goin to lie, lacking in all areas of Management HR was a nightmare, but if your looking for a first job I’d recommend"
bad,"Mise en rayon des produits, Étiquetage des produits , Respect de l’implantation des produits."
bad,"Nothing too outgoing, everyone sorta just auto piloted and some employees would be as nasty as the customers. not a very good place to work full time."
bad,This job was ok. Not enough hours. Not a good discount. Work really hard around the holidays.  It was a cool experience seeing kids face light up entering the store.
bad,"Everyday was hectic & stressful not only physically but mentally, the staff weren’t so nice & were never considerate to the lower employees. They never cared if you were feeling ill. Only if you could still do your job, I was told one night past my hours 7-12am. That I had to stay an hour or so later or I’d be replaced. Wouldn’t recommend working here."
bad,"Toys R Us was a seasonal position, which I was fine with considering it was my first job. I’ve gotten to learn and work on my customer service skills."
bad,Management was horrible and the working environment was often quiet toxic. High turnover of staff and management which added in making the work experience worse
bad,"The company shut down. You can not work here anymore. It was fun to work with kids, but the store was dirty and in a sketchy area. Management was nice."
bad,This doesn't go for every store but my managers were terrible mean people. I also worked during the holiday season. My first day on the register (I had never done before) the put me on a 12hr shift starting at 3am on blackfriday. Nightmare.
bad,It was pretty easy. Was mostly on cash register if I wasn't putting items back on shelves. Most of the coworkers were fairly nice and easy to get along with.
bad,Je n'ai pas aimé mon exprérience avec cette entreprise.
bad,not a good environment to work in management had no communication skills and there was favoritism  the hours i was set to work was unclear and the expectations were to high
bad,I was hired for holiday season started fairly quickly. Was not trained in anything. Also coworkers expected me to do things i was not trained to do like use the computers and walkies to ask if we had certain items in stock. My real job was to wonder around the store grabbing toys that were out of place and putting them back and asking customers if they needed help and hoping that they didnt need to much help because then i had to find a coworker to help them.
bad,"Stores can be welcoming, Company gives you unrealistic goals for the staff they employ and the time they provide. Pay not terrible, time spent to complete tasks eats away at salary until you are making less than seasonal employees"
bad,"the pay was good and the environment and people were good as well, but I didn't get many shifts and I was told that I was just a casual, but I was really a Christmas causal and they never told me and let me go at the end of the schools holidays after not giving me any shifts over the holidays."
bad,"didn't take long to learn the system. it was a seasonal thing so it was very busy during the week of the holliday, besides that, it was over employed."
bad,"So I start off geting there at 9am, then I punch in on time because if I didn't I would get yelled at. Then I went to customer service and asked what I was doing today and they pretty much put me on restock. But then 30 minutes into restock I get called to the back to help clean up or something. Then I have to mop up something in a aisle on the main floor. So pretty much I get thrown everywhere because I'm the go to guy for everything."
bad,I worked at toys r us for 8 months out of the year and it was incredibly boring. The only time that there was actually customers was during the Christmas season. They hired a bunch of high schoolers and then let most of them go the day after Christmas without telling them.
bad,"Whilst at my time at this company, I enjoyed it due to the staff whom worked there and management, they were very open minded about different techniques of work"
bad,"Working with great people, children and toys... who doesn't want that? Not really a lot of room for advancement and it was very difficult to get a raise."
bad,"Since the company has now declared bankruptcy and is now closing all store, I don't think anyone will be working for them. It was a nice place to work any other time then during Christmans."
bad,"My time working at TRU was horrible. I was thrown into my position due to lack of employees to help me learn. "
bad,it was a long time ago i dont have a good review to give. I recall it being slow paced and they were bad at giving hours to people as well as didnt pay enough for how hard people worked and how little people they had in the store to work
bad,"Generally pretty boring and repetitive work. Must be skilled at dealing with customers who are often frantic and nasty, particularly during holidays. Not much room for growth."
bad,The location I am at is one that is closing and they are doing noting to assist the employees in this process. They have stripped us of everything from benefits to pride.
bad,"Overall my experience with toys r us was just that. It has a sort of dead end flair to it when it comes to working up the ""Latter"" and getting somewhere in life."
bad,"The amount of hours given out where horrible and the way work was organized was just done so badly, cashiers had it worst especially because it was always only one of us there and we always had long lines."
bad,"A typical work day was 6-8 hours, and the people I worked with were rude and unfriendly to customers. "
bad,It's either filled with shoppers or near empty there was hardly an in between. With that said it was still a fun work environment with plenty of different jobs to do.
bad,Employees are overworked and treated poorly by managers. Managers seem untrained on how to handle employees or engage them in a meaningful way. Stores are typically understaffed leading to employees being assigned shifts at the last minute.
bad,"Work only seasonal after that you barley get hours, most of the workers either work there full time because they are management but the other who aren’t barley get 10 hours for the week"
bad,"My biggest downfalls for this job were the travel to and from, swing shifts, and the management. I had to travel 45 minutes to and from work. I didn't have much family time."
bad,Had a note from doctor to only lift under pounds and they disregarded the note and instead of light duty or sending me home still had me breaking down pallets and unloading trucks by hand.
bad,toys r us was an overall enjoyable experience. i dont have much bad to say about the company or my short experience there. if anything id just say their stuff is overpriced
bad,the employers and management was bad. schedule was all over the place communication skills was bad no team work. training was also bad experience didn't feel like I learned much.
bad,the people are nice and the pay was not to bad being just part time.Also being around the children and finding the right toy. Easy to learn and the day goes fast.
bad,Toys R Us sales associate is a decent starting job for anybody coming out of high school or going into college it's not something that's going to pay amazingly well but it will give you some experience
bad,Interaction with children and selling rewards and credits cards to reach the store's goals. The enviorment and customers were  very friendly. Enjoy the  time I spent there
bad,Nice job fun to work no hours. Not professional at the job. Not flexible with work hours. No response from supervisors when issue occur...... Dont do it
bad,"As the baby registry captain, I was able to work hand and hand with customers expecting new babies. I coordinated and promoted a lot of the in-store events for the baby department, I also made the welcome and follow up phone calls personally. I was not part of management but was asked consistently to fill in during lunches, and if someone was running late. The hardest part about the job was correcting a mistake in the system, and trying to make sure your customer leaves happy and will want to do business with your company again."
bad,"I was mainly in charge of stocking the trolleys on the busiest time of the year and speaking with the customers and new people with gold card offers and deals to help them with their purchases. "
bad,"They made things more complicated than they needed to be, and it was very frustrating. I still work there as a seasonal sales associate, and I hate it. The only good things are that they have flexible schedules and are a wide variety of options in the break room's vending machine. A job is a job, but this is not a great place to work."
bad,"•	Review work orders and blueprints to ensure work is performed according to specifications"
bad,"Hard work goes completely unnoticded at this store! But heaven forbid you do something wrong, everyone will know. Boss plays favorites to the extreme. Time of employment means squat when looking to fill higher positions."
bad,"Horrible place to work at, I wouldn't recommend anyone to work there. The management is horrible, I have learned that is not what I expected."
bad,"This is on disorganized place to work."
bad,"not a stressful job it ok, pay is awful and you get no over time if you work closing you will do over time and will not get payed."
bad,Toys R Us is a great company to work for if you want to sharpen your customer service skills. I loved being able to problem solve and generate a great outcome for the customers benefit.
bad,"high pace "
bad,"Unfair treatment of some employees, management does not appreciate the work employees do. Some managers are lazy, and don't help out with closing duties."
bad,I was only working up to 3 hours a week without much training in the basic areas of the store such as the register and stock take.
bad,Was let go because I did not move fast enough. I did not feel comfortable throwing boxes to the aisles. You have to be okay with hearing swearing because it can be a stressful environment. Pay was decent though. Lots of mislabeling of location of toys. Would not buy a toy from them knowing how they toss most of the boxes.
bad,"It was a great place to work at while I was in college.  Helped me learn customer service skills, and also helped me learn about sales."
bad,Would help customers and straightening the store when not busy. People skills are a most. Trying to schedule work around school. Management was not willing to work with me about schooling.
bad,"Co-workers and management were ok to work with, but I worked during the season, so there was a lot of chaos going on. They hired everyone and not all knew how to do their jobs correctly so there wasn't much order."
bad,this job just wasnt for me it was slow and it was too much work for so little pay. I felt out of place and knew i wasnt going to stay with this company.
bad,"It was a good job at first, we were a successful company and everything was running on all cylinders until about 5-6 months afterwards. People started quitting and the management seemed to care less and less about the employees from what it felt like. It just seemed as if things were just going downhill as the days went on. It seemed as if the amount of work you did wasn't enough or just not what they wanted. They weren't motivating any employees to get the jobs done, just demand after demand. I have no problem at all doing tasks but when the supervisors themselves don't do the work and it gets put on you, its frustrating. I couldn't relate to any of the supervisors besides one. They continuously keep the same people who don't perform their job to their best ability but will treat the non supervisors ( part-time, departments workers ) like supervisors, picking up the slack. At times i felt i couldn't be helped or they just weren't bothered. I got a new job title, I got 20-25% training on it. I was learning things on the fly, I got taught things once and was expected to perform at a high level afterwards."
bad,i loved dealing with the customers helping them find the toys they wanted or their children wanted. I loved just being around all the toys made me feel like a little kid again. I loved the fact that i got to see the toys before the customers did cause I had to put them on the shelf.
bad,"Worked here throughout school on holiday/summer breaks.  Prepares you to be ready for a child, but lack of focus among management."
bad,My only perspective is that of a sales associate. The job I had are only for those in High School or getting a first time job without any credentials. If that is you then this job does the bare minimum for your bare minimum.
bad,"Very busy,I learned faster ways of getting a task done under pressure, the managemnet is very poor at Toys R Us, My co- workers were nice, The hardest part of the job was black friday, and the most enjoyable part of my job was the over time."
bad,I was working there for more than one year and I was never given enough hours to even considered part time. When I was working behind the register and it was busy a manager told me to do something else when there was more than one person free.
bad,"I decided to leave this job because the work was extremely slow. I was only called in to work anywhere from four to eight hours per week, and even that was not guaranteed. However, when I did go in to work, I was very good and efficient at re-stocking large departments with large amounts of merchandise and labeling."
bad,"I worked in a fast paced retail environment, after being hired from a seasonal worker I was taught how to train new employees"
bad,"The company pays minimum wage or just above.  Very limited hours, but okay if you need a job.  The work was not hard, very straight forward.  Good entry level job but nothing more."
bad,I would come in and ready to greet my guest. replenish stock and help if anybody needed it.
bad,Warehouse for Toys R Us .  Great place to work and build skills.
bad,Cashering and cleaning floor to look nice for reopening next day. management sucked after they changed managers out. It was fun working with other employees.
bad,By far the best best job I ever had but sad to say when the recession hit this company went out of business. Really wish they were still up and running.
bad,its not a job i would want to start a career at the pay is horrible for all the important tasks that are required no comment.
bad,Company has a great inventory location search system to make it easy for the employees to pin point product for guest. Over all The company tries hard to keep Guest Satisfaction at a priority but can sometimes forget and go back to merchandising more then guest service.  ToysRus is a very different retail company. The companies priorities sometimes are not in the right direction. Hours for the hourly team members are scares to none. The company expects a lot from you but with no compensation to back it up. Raises suck and there are no bonus for no one except the store manager and up.
bad,If you like fast paced part time jobs this is something you should try during the Christmas season.
bad,Seasonal only. No chance of being hired permanent. Job commute was too lengthy.
bad,"I worked at 4 different locations for this company over almost 3 years. To date, it was my most difficult job, but that was only because of pressure from corporate and management on sales and metrics. Other than that, the job was relatively straightforward, though the stress of it overall made the job unbearable. I worked both as a front-end cashier and as an electronics associate. I worked at 2 Express locations and 2 full-size locations, with one of the full-size locations being a full-size half-and-half TRU/BRU and the other being double the size."
bad,Expected to perform tasks beyond hiring title. Fun employees but management isn't very pleasant.
bad,It was too unorganized for me and as well as the other employees were not a team players.
bad,The job was knowledgeable and it allowed me to expand on my own visions and creativeness.
bad,Started working there as a seasonal worker during Christmas and after Christmas they called and asked me to stay on as a regular associate. They called me back 2 hours later and said never mind. Very Unorganized
bad,"i didn't work their very long, but when i did i would check people out at the cashiers and help them find what they were looking for."
bad,I had this job because i was young and i was getting ready for the military
bad,Wasn't paid on time. Everyday I had to check schedule to see if I worked or not. Things have probably changed.
bad,"My fellow team members were very friendly with little to no drama."
bad,This is a fun place to work with little interactions with direct supervisors.
bad,Very unorganized. Did not train me well. I did very little. Did not keep up with their employees.
bad,I love my job because I love people and kids but the management is pretty unfair
bad,not a good company. treats employees with disrespect and low regaurd.
bad,"A typical day of work is very customer based and making an enjoyable shopping experience for children and parents. "
bad,Learned to become a better leader and improved customer interaction
bad,"I was only working there a couple months , but i didnt like it. "
bad,There was a lot of products to learn about. I had wonderful co-workers who taught me well.
bad,Worked overnight stocking in a fun friendly work environment coworkers pitched in just as much as I believe that manages did it was awesome to work at
bad,"Good Managers, stocked shelves, unloaded 53ft trailors. Stocked shelves and helped customers."
bad,only did the job so i could have some extra money in my pocket the overall job was boring
bad,"Standing in one spot with your boss and coworkers all telling you over and over again to get instant credits, reward cards, bpps, and batteries."
bad,"The job its self isnt all that really hard unless your stuck at the cash register in which case I would say it, would be nothing less than grueling but what cashier job isn't? either way great place to work if you enjoy kids and can put up with the small amount of work time. For example, in the time i was there, there was a complete two week period not including the original days off where i didn't get any work, Learned plenty and co-workers were generally okay. the best part of the job was honestly opening time when the customers started getting involved."
bad,ringing people up
bad,I had a seasonal position. Very crazy and crowded. Management was nice and the environment was good.
bad,"Working for them is not what I want to do. The pay is horrible, the hours are horrible and I have a commute to there and back 30-35 mins away. really not worth the stress at all"
bad,"I would work at customer service, most of the time, for both Toys R US and Babies R US. I had different tasks to do everyday and learned a lot. I could manage the floor by myself. I helped customers purchase online and helped with Baby Registry."
bad,Long but learned a lot with the company. Also management was fair
bad,Only worked there seasonal help. Learned alot about back stock and over stock and how to run a store.
bad,Terrible management; no room for advancement; chaos during Christmas time
bad,"Strive for making sales and being number one in the region. The most enjoyable part of that job was seeing a smile on a person face when helping them with their wants. The hardest would be the customers during the holidays that did not understand patience, being if they were giving other customers a hard time or a member our team. We all know how to multitask some but I really learned how to multitask working in customer service during season, I enjoyed every second of the fast paced environment."
bad,"Pay is low, and so are the hours. There is no potential for advancement or even full-time work if you are pursuing an education. Most weeks you will work between 12 and 20 hours, with pay starting just above minimum wage. Managers are good for the most part, but expectations seem somewhat unrealistic at times (as they should). Hardest part of the job is dealing with parents. Most enjoyable part is seeing children smile. Toys R Us is filled with dedicated employees looking for opportunities they are unlikely to find with this company. Most promotions for Supervisory positions are filled from outside the company, but not all."
bad,I didn't like this job. Worked a lot of hours and paid minimum wage. Some of the management was not very friendly.
bad,Management does not do very much when it comes to closing the store at night. Everyone is pretty much require to stay until the store is clean. Typical retail.
bad,Helped with being able to help others by answering their questions and taking the time to learn everything to be able to answer questions.
bad,"it was a lot of work around Christmas, lots of cleaning up after the store closes. long but fast lines, returns exchanges and coupons were a nightmare."
bad,"Toys r us is going out of business so my review does not matter.  However, working there was fun at times but they do not promote from within as they claim they do."
bad,"Toys R Us cashiers may perform several assigned duties apart from operating checkout stations, including cleaning, stocking products, and balancing registers. Cashiers assist Toys R Us managers with customer satisfaction and work to leave every customer satisfied with the toy shopping experience."
bad,Toys r Us was a great place to work in the beginning. After awhile it got to be too stressful and there was no balance with work and home. The pay was not competitive with other compatible company.
bad,"It's not a terrible job, but constant effort to have people sign up for credit cards that they can't afford was just a but too much for me. Then a job paying about the same opened up about 3 minutes from my house."
bad,"Very little hours, Little time to do resets and truck, You maybe have weeks where you are not even on the schedule but you still work there, Store manager isn't very good at his job but all of the supervisors and managers are great, Very strict on hours for everyone, There may only be 1 actual cashier working at a time, and there might be a time where only supervisors are working and no associates."
bad,"They are a vary fast past company, everything must be done in a quick paste. Some of the managers are rude and the others are very good with handling situations. The negative managers are what bring the store down. Over-all a fun job."
bad,Unload the truck stock the shelves. Relaxing nice and fun environment.Its a toy store management was great . Hardest part was hour's besides that fun great place to work.
bad,"I worked here during the Christmas season. It was very fun to work with toys and work around the kids, but it was a terrible season to start. The more it got closer to Christmas, the more it got busy and the louder it got. There was a lot going on, but it was a nice job to have."
bad,each day at work i was wrapping toys up to send off to people who ordered them online.the manage ment was ok and so was my co workers.The hardest bpart of the job was lifting heavey boxes.
bad,Lots and lots of Toys! Helpped out alot of children. Store can get really messy really fast. So you have to be on top of the game to keep it clean.
bad,"I thought working at a toy store would be a lot of fun, however, the co-workers didn't really talk while working. It was more stressful due to the holiday season. I was just disappointed with the atmosphere."
bad,"I either cashiered, or zoned."
bad,Honestly the job wasn't hard at all the only thing that I really hated about this job was the parents who would come in acting a fool and just being outright rude and mean to my coworkers and I.
bad,This job has a lot of great equipment experience you can learn it also is a great environment to learn inbound and outbound on warehouse work great customer service skills can be developed here also
bad,It was one of my worst jobs yet money-wise. I liked interactig with customers and helping people but the lack of proper pay lead me to quit.
bad,"Meetings in the morning, working the register at customer service, doing returns, checking out customers, dealing with money and computers, doing credit card sign up, toys r us reward sign ups, baby registry sign ups, stocking items, giving outstanding customer service. I learned about baby products and toy products. Management and co workers were fun and loved their job. Hardest part about the job has to be the restocking items. It's nearly impossible with the hours that all of us had to get that store to be completely stocked and organized and everything go where it belongs. The most enjoyable part was learning more about kids and babies and what stuff they enjoy and seeing them happy and the parents happy."
bad,A lot of fun with customers very hands on and a great social job  . Bubbly workspace with a lot of creativity and balance. I would highly recommend if not shut down.
bad,"In the beginning, when I first started working for TRU, I was excited, and I loved it. But as the months went by, I began to feel more and more drained from working there. I do not have a good connection with children and working there really just felt like a glorified babysitting job."
bad,The insurance package is amazing and offers ALOT of good benefits that really help  in medical expenses. Most of the job is rewarding in terms of helping guest.
bad,Working in a team helping workers to click and collect online orders for collection. I achieved the most targets for new customer to sign on reward points card. Always meet and greet with a smile and helped customer to have a good shopping experience. Making sure that the shop floor is tidy and no health and safety hazards.
bad,"Fun atmosphere where you are encouraged to play and learn. However, management doesn't go too far; most upper management doesn't seem to understand the daily process of store operations."
bad,"I work the cash register usually in charge of the front end of store. I greet customer's and assist them with any help I can give. Sometimes I work the sells floor. I also assist in putting back re-shop and straightening up the store. I have learned that no matter the situation patients is the key to it. I love all my co-workers we all get along and we all work well together I could say they would definitely say the same about me. Hardest part of my job is dealing with rude customers but I have learn to look past it no one is perfect and in life everyone goes through things I just smile and say have a nice day, usually always trying to leave my customers with a nice laugh or joke helps. The best part of my job is seeing the smiles on the kids faces and all the smiles and side conversations from them."
bad,"A typical day working at toys r us is helping out customers and maintaining a clean and safe working environment. I learned how to use a cash register and how to approach customers. The management team there were great, I got along with all of them. My co-workers were a great asset to me. They helped trained me and taught me new skills that i did not already know. The most enjoyable part of the job was seeing the children smile as they walked out of the store with there new item."
bad,"It was intersting. I enjoyed woking ther, and assisting the customers.I came to work ontime and left ontime. Managment was very halpful. I will go back one day."
good,This was a seasonal job temporary we worked over night 3 to 4 times a week we wasn't done until everything in the entire store was stocked we had to ship items first before we got to the big job it was very exhausting and not worth the pay.
good,I loved the company and what it represents but the work environment was poor and management was very unprofessional. I wouldn't recommend this company to anyone due to them illegally punching in my lunch breaks everyday through computer. This company only cares about their business and not the people helping to run it so just keep that in mind. Yes I'll work here again cause it's a job but this time I'll know what to look out for so I don't get screwed over again.
good,rude to seasonal employees and insisted they did all the work while managers and managers favorites got to sit at the return desk and do nothing unfair treatment
good,Toys r us just wasn't the place for me because Hours get cut back a lot during regular season. Its good if you have a another job and just work there for extra income. Its fun to work there during holiday season because you get to see all the new toys.
good,"Toys R Us was a normal work place where it a typical day at work, but the co-workers were very nice and willing to help me and let me learn new things at work."
good,easy job low pay can be hectic but mostly just boring and the management was sexist.
good,Tough environment.  Heavy workload on all staff.  Management could show more appreciation for all efforts. Hard to work early stay late day to day without much acknowledgment. Great people with lots of experience.
good,A minimum wage job with unreliable associates. Learned computer skills. Co workers were usually very friendly. Management was not co-operative towards pregnant or nursing mothers. Hardest part of the job was the lack of communication between upper management and lower management. Also lack of staffing during crucial times.
good,"A typical day at work was dealing with customers and giving them what they needed,i learned to help customers. The management was okay and my co-workers was good working as a team to get things done. The Hardest part was probably the scheduling issues and the enjoyable part was the team work of co-workers."
good,"I was manager at TOYS-R-US for +- 2 years.  There are no appreciation for their hardworking staff - their motto is that one can be replaced and that makes it very much uncomfortable to work there."
good,i was always the only cashier always had long lines and i always got yelled at for the long lines and i had to work a double when i could not.sometimes i did not get a break
good,getting a job a babies r us was relentless. the managers like to do everything in which makes it so that the supervisor has no idea whats going on in there departments.
good,This is for the Birds and Bees. Leave this for people who are young and desperate for a job. Many people who work there now have worked there for years. Managers that they bring usually carry a favortism. Period.
good,"After working in retail for two years, I can honestly say I hate shopping. Being expected to constantly exceed sales and metrics or you get berated and when you do nothing happens, is not a way to treat employees. I only stayed as long as I did because my store manager new what he was doing but in the end I believe he left, too."
good,It was an okay place to work. It was very busy during the holidays which I like. I enjoyed helping the customers. I met a lot of new people. It wasn't anything hard about this job.
good,"honestly nothing was really bad about working here its just really hard to deal with managers who yell at you for not knowing what you should be doing when you are still new and the people teaching you have also only been there for a week or two."
good,"Some weeks I would work 6 days a week and other times I would be on call for days. "
good,"management was rude not very family oriented, worked little hours a day and they didn't know when the work load would pick up"
good,"Came in at night, unloaded the freight as needed and then replenished the shelves. Co-workers were younger, nice, and very friendly; best part of working there. Working conditions not the best; broken trash compactor resulted in weeks-long trash pile-up, leading the fire exit to become blocked. Management was not hands-on that much. Would not work there again."
good,"I gained a lot of customer service experience. However, I did not appreciate the job pay and compensation. The customers and management were very rude and ungrateful."
good,Management could've been way better it was very poor even though the job was only seasonal I still got to see how everything operates
good,"working for them for 6 years I've seen my fair share of bad management practices, from blame games to take unprofessional  tones, behavior, and threats of job termination on a daily basis from your managers"
good,Management was erratic and couldn't plan anything in advance. Their need to save a few dollars caused insufficient amount of workers being available and the loss of product due to negligence.
good,"running a cash register, helping customers find items. and meeting new people all the time."
good,it was a good job when i was doin the job i was hired to do they was short staffed and try to place you where ever to fill them spots never told u when your days to work was always had to check in
good,good for a seasonal job. fun to work there but extremely exhausting. 
good,They will have you come in work for 30 mins then tell you. You're being sent home due to them over scheduling for that day. Which happens often. They will always forget about you taking a lunch. The would have me take a lunch 1 hour before my shift was over. They will have you working different hours everyday you work. Most co workers were nice. The pay is not good. They start you off at min wage. Raises are every 6 months. If you don't promote their card and get so many people signed up. Dont expect a raise.
good,"This place gave false hopes, glad it's closed. Mangers did not keep persons private information private. I actually had to hire a lawyer for a manger that stalked me and constantly harassed me, along with the unethical treatment of highschoolers"
good,they are going out of business do to bad management and an inability to compete in a field they used to dominate. Once they hired the management from the failed circuit city they were doomed to fail.
good,"Worked during the holiday season and hated it. Temporary employees do not have set roles in the store. Positions were rotated often with little to no availability of training."
good,"Looking for a career that prepares you for the future? United States Postal Service is dedicated to providing education opportunities for employees. Check out what opportunities are available in Moore."
good,"Working here I did learn a lot. This job can be a fun place to work at, but a lot of the staff can be very in mature. There is no room to grow unless you know the right people. A typical day there can be very stressful not because of the job you are required to do but only because of some of the people management. This job can is enjoyable because I like helping people in finding things to make their children/grandchildren happy. Telling them about the different toys and gaming systems or just games to get."
good,Stocking & helping customer. Learn how to unload trucks. Mangers were ok. Hard part was unloading truck in an hour. Love playing with the toys & learning about the new toys coming out.
good,"toysRus wearhouse in riato has a bad choice of peopoe to hire, they can be perverted creepy harsh lack of kindness and respect, managers and vice managers mainly do not care about people but mainly work yo more to where your drained fr the rest of the day. i recommend a diferent job due to the peope that ive met working there at the time."
good,"From being a once frequent shopper when I was kid to working there really changed my perspective on the over all store, management was harsh, and drama between coworkers made working here not to bright. Something always seemed to be going wrong in that store."
good,"You are trained for nothing, expected to be a top performer and and intimately know processes that were not shown or explained to you. Not allowed to discipline low performing employees then criticized for their under performance."
good,"Some days here were tough. I learned a lot with handling an hand gun, collates, and labels, the environment here was ok it wasn't always hot the hardest part of the job was keeping up and the most enjoyable part was when work was done."
good,"Management changes often and if you end up with the wrong manager that could be the end of your work at this place. If people have longer time working here than you, they could curse you and you tell it to the manager and they will not do anything about it. You will get in trouble for trying to defend yourself."
good,This place is not recommended because the settler read is low and the place is too far where I live it's a really horrible place and the schedule is awful
good,"I honestly wouldn't want to go to work. I learned every essential need of being a cashier, a guest service representative. The management were extremely into favoring, only like one supervisor was mutual. The workplace was stressful. The would put down anyone who didn't make their redcard quota. And the managers were extremely disrespectful and had horrible attitudes. The most enjoyable part of the job was it was seasonal. And The hardest part of the job was the workplace."
good,"I wouldn't recommend it to anyone. The management is horrible as well as the pay and the hours. It is unsafe, they get shoplift everyday and expect their employees to go after the product even it is already passed the door way."
good,Rather not say. It would be better for anybody to just find out them selves and see if retail is an industry that would fit there lifestyle or current circumstance.
good,Long hours with short breaks. Lots of heavy lifting at a fast pace. Staff was fun and interesting. It seemed like there were plenty of staff but we could never get enough done. The work load never ended.
good,"Good Job ambient, co-workers are easy going.   No opportunity for advancement.  Management could use more organization when scheduling hours.  Overall is a good place to work."
good,"Worked during Black Friday which is one of the busiest time of the year for any retail job."
good,"I started off in maintenance and then I became a cashier, which was cool but dealing with the customers at Christmas time was something else. Some of the supervisors were cool and some of them were ridiculous to work with. My co-workers were cool and were helpful we were a team."
good,"This was one of my tougher jobs and I disliked it very much, some employees were rude, Managers were unbareable and did not reason with me when it came to school. I was taken advantage of at the job. My typical day was me walking in saying hello to the people who were nice to me, going to the lockers to put my things away, clock in and get going. I would start and all of a sudden I would get orders barked at me like I was a dog. work all day and stay until 11 at night even though I had school the nest day, but to the managers it did not matter. Worst job i've ever had."
good,For the amount of work a supervisor does and the time that they put in the compensation is not to standard. The amount of time given to the employees for the work to be done is not realistic.
good,They don't really care about there employees. I feel like the abuse there seasonal employees and at time even forget they are even there.
good,check what section your working then get a kart walk your section looking for and placing back restack/ reshelf and when the front cashier get bust then I get called to be a cashier. no work on black Friday
good,"I don't know if it was because I was ""just a seasonal temporary"" hire or the employees were just unhappy people, my first shift I had to basically figure out the what, where, when, how's all by myself nobody would talk to me, or other new hires. Strange for a toy store."
good,fun place to work and the people are great to work with. It has its ups and downs but its a great place to work and to have fun with guest and the kids.
good,Everyone's experience is different there. I don't feel comfortable reviewing my past employeers.
good,I enjoyed this seasonal postion working with families to fulfill their holiday wishes.
good,A typical day would be processing sales for customers and stocking shelves. Keeping products organized and in their correct places were a must.
good,Unloading wagons with stock for store.Dealing with Customers.
good,"assemble bikes"
good,"I start my day with cycle counts counting major key items that are required .Afterwards I do sifis walk in the department required that day getting accurate count of inventory also replenishing floor. I also receive all packages that come in usually ups, fedex. I also process rgd which is return good damages and mostly are return items and damaged product off the sales floor. I also maintain and ship and receive all store equipment such as RF scanner , Walkie talkie wireless printers etc. I enjoy my job I think I do a great job I am a team player always willing to help team members and managers. I have great customer service always helping customers find what they need and even ordering product from wharehouse so that company is always making sales and driving our key metrics which are loyalty rewards card, credit card, buyer protectionplan"
good,"the managers base their discipline based on who they are friends with. if you are close to them, they dont treat you the same as if you"
good,noone knew what was going on from one moment to the next management didnt help much this season was a mess moral was down and people just didnt care this is unusual for this store but there was alot of unexpected changes and I feel people didnt know how to handle it
good,"not enough hours, too many people working here and nothing for them to do, but its a good atmosphere"
good,"Fun place to work,so many people work there so there's not much hours you can get working part time. See a a lot of different cultures because its a tourist spot."
good,"I was a fun place to work, I enjoyed workeing with the customers"
good,Before the foreclose and the markdowns of the store it was an engaged and enjoyable place to work. Customers always seemed happy and were willing to shop
good,"not the greatest place to work. management is terrible, lots of favouritism happens here. hours are awful, no room to move up as they promote their favourite people"
good,"Management was pretty good, but many shift cuts. The store was always messy and cleaning was difficult since there were not many people working due to shift cuts. Most people who work there are driven and nice people."
good,"The customers were 50/50, because they were obsessed around Christmastime and kind of forgot the employees were human beings too. It's not in business anymore though."
good,"Regular retail job. Busy during the holiday season, too much reliance on having people sign up for credit cards and store cards. They would cut hours and days due to not meeting and quota. other than that very normal"
good,"It was long I would constantly be stood by the door handing out catalogues. "
good,"- Easy and smooth day at work"
good,The worst part of the job was the management. They weren't very friendly and understanding at all. They didn't give me that many hours no matter how many times I asked. The only enjoyable part of the job was being able to interact with kids. All the customers were so friendly to me and most of the other coworkers.
good,It was a seasonal job. All the heavy lifting and the list of things needed to be done was stressful when not enough people were on the schedule . Store closed down a few weeks after seasonal ended.
good,"Working in the stock room and on the sales floor was very interesting. I started during the busiest time of the year *Thanksgiving weekend* "
good,"None of this really matters, as they are now out of business. But overall, it wasn't too terrible. I was having trouble finding a job,and took this one out of necessity."
good,"Toys R Us was a good place to work before it became private and they started to sell warranties. Quotas were put on the cashiers for selling warranties, batteries, accessories and getting birthday club memberships and if you did not meet their quota they would cut your hours, even if there were no sales."
good,"If you're looking for some pocket change, your first job, or pay small bills, then it's just like any other retail job. It's not a place for a career."
good,"I had flexibility regarding my schedule, so I had the liberty to work doubles at my leisure provided I did not exceed allocated hour, and customer assembly orders were completed on-time."
good,Company expects Filet Mignon but gives you Happy Meal budget. Processes never work especially at peak times. Corporate employees have no idea what is going on in the field.
good,This store is a very good store but needs new management and no how to treat their employees. Working there was fun because I love kids and people but over all working there really sucke and the managers were very unprofessional.
good,Let's just say I learned what not to do in a job and how not to behave as an employee. I also learned a lot about how much corporate really did not care about anyone except for making that all mighty dollar. I was there for almost 2 years and through so many changes I finally capped out at $8.00/hr when new people began to be hired who had less experience and started making more than I was. That was my final straw in deciding to leave the company.
good,"I would come in put my stuff in my locker they pushed a lot on the credit cards, which I found was unfair if for some reason you didn't get one you were looked down upon and possible termination, I learned about the Toys R Us company as a whole is a good company, management staff for the most part was great, the hardest part of my job was lifting as I was pregnant while I was working here. I love interacting with guests."
good,"I loved the job, as I am a people person.  Most of my co-workers were great.  The two assistant managers were great.  The manager was very unprofessional, and really did not know her job.  She was always to stressed out to really work.  she was late every time she had to open the store.  She would leave as quickly as she could.  She did not know how to run a register."
good,"1  The Company is very micro managed"
good,"Co workers are good to work with a lot of personalities lots of people to get along with. Not enough hours, management needs help they don't know how to communicate with the employees and can take out their frustrations on your hours. Stay on their good side they have a lot of mood swings through out the day.The pay doesn't match the drama that is in the store. It can be a fun place to work when everyone pulls their weight and things get done but as soon as pressure is applied the store can turn doom and gloom really quick and everyone is on edge. And in the summer forget it, it is always hot in the store. If the atmosphere was better it would be a great first job."
good,"would not recommend working here. Management is horrible  and there is no set schedule, basically working random shifts. the pay is garbage for the amount of work you have to do."
good,"It was fine cant really complain, sometimes the managers weren't to nice and sometimes they would forget to give us our lunches. On a good day they wouldnt yell at us or threaten or jobs"
good,Toys is a very fast paced constantly moving during the christmas season.  During the off season it is very slow with little to no hours and has very little room for advancement.
good,great seasonal work or first job but nothing long term i wouldnt go back  bored bored underpaid no room to grow  close stores down without sending current employees any where else
good,Store Manager was a horrible person to work for and was extremely rude to many staff members including myself. Always spoke about professional behaviour and then walked out of her job three days after my contract ended without giving her superiors any notice.
good,Managers are unorganized and associated that have been there for a while do not take the time to teach you anything.  Need to have better training in place for new associates.
good,While working at Toys R Us I learnt how to help customers out and had a great bond with all of my managers and colleagues. If a customer needed help with anything I would make sure that I would see if we had it in stock or help them even find it on the self.
good,i liked it it was fun. i worked as a night stocker. i liked it. i like working at night. it was seasonal but it was fun while it lasted. i found really fun.
good,"This is just a typical retail job, though if you can't take screaming and crying kids, may not be for you. Long hours on feet, low pay, promise of advancement with no delivery."
good,"Very unhappy with store manager, and co workers were not on same page. Got alot of customer service experience and was to become a department Supervisor, and human resources supervisor"
good,A typical work day always ended up with me picking up slack from the sales associate before me. I always had to do my work plus others and i felt unappreciated. I was never recognized for the job i did. I learned how to price change as well as work under tremendous pressure. I got along pretty good with most of my co workers...Not the management.
good,Nobody wants to do their assigned work as required from their position. You have to lie or beg to get people to sign up for credit cards everyday and you don't get commission.
good,Pay was terrible for the quality of work done hard work with no benefits boss was terrible spoke down to people and shuld not have been in the position of leadership
good,"pésima. discriminan por estado de gestación. Tras conocimiento de embarazo pierdo la oportunidad de contrato indefinido a pesar de ser por antigüedad, conocimientos, méritos y reconocimiento de mis inmediatos superiores la persona que merecía la contratación indefinida, siendo ofrecida a otra compañera con menos méritos."
good,It's a great job to start you off and gain some experience but you'll want something better. i learned that you should be nice to people even when their not nice to you.
good,Management is not very supportive nor is it receptive to employees requests for time off for work for school or personal reasons. Management is prejudiced against certain employees.
good,"When i worked at toys r us I started as a ""seasonal Employee."" After my first christmas in 2013 i really liked it, I didn't mind waking up early for work or unloading trucks. After a year or so of being there i wanted to go back to school while i worked there, with all the managers coming and leaving it became hard to do both so i just took a few semesters off from school to try and work full time. I was not able to find a full time job in Toys R Us. I found a new job and left shortly after that cause after christmas it is not as busy,"
good,This Job taught me a lot but wasn't smart enough to hire people so we have my hands to work and close the store on time so it wouldn't eat up the hours for the workers.
good,"There's not much I can really say about this job. There's no place in moving up, they pay you minimum wage with no other source of income.  They expect so much of you ( credit cards, rewards, protection plans, batteries, surveys, store orders ) and pay you pretty much nothing. The only reason to stay is your coworkers that make the day go by a little faster and a little smoother and if you are a parent, you get to know what the hottest toys are. But that's about it. Oh, and a 10% discount which isnt that great unless you have coupons ( which do apply and is very helpful ). "
good,"it was a great job when i first started, then the front end manger went out on medical leave, and i had at least 6 after she went out. i was given a job at the service desk and the other cashiers thought i was the lead. however i was not. when the postion was filled as i left the gal had that postion talked down to all employes and the customers. i was told to learn to deal with her. "
good,During the holidays I got to work hard and get paid for it. Management then was encouraging and supportive but changed and became dismissive and uncaring. Hours were cut to less than 10 a week from over 40 and was never told or warned it would happen.
good,"I love to work there due to the fact they put me in the arcade section where computers and video games are up my alley. I taught customers what to get their young ones but ignored, "
good,I worked the night shift unloading trucks and stocking the sales floor for the Christmas Season.  It was hard work that would not of been so hard if other employees had worked up to their potental.  The pay was not much either.
good,I worked here for a very long time and they never valued employees. They paid horribly and offered no benefits and expected employees to give service above and beyond.
good,Slow during the off season and hectic during the Christmas season
good,"Reponer a toda aprisa, la dirección y gerencia con contradicciones entre ellos."
good,I loved that I learned that I have different abilities and skills that i developed.
good,"working well with my co- workers, I'm still employed there, if I wanted to share how my day goes and a typical work day I would , please stop fishing for information, if you want to know read my resume. if not then that's on you."
good,"Usually my day starts out with me punching in, taking what each employee has which is our daily goal cards and walking over to r-zone the electronic section to assist and ring up guests. I've learned that superiors expect for you to know as much as they do about the ins and outs of every work position at toys r us, and that I will never work at this location again because the company refuses to fix our air conditioning units. Management is terrible most of them treat you as if you came off of the short bus, which I think is disrespectful. Co workers are easy to get along with. Hardest part of my job is enrolling customers to sign up for our instant credit cards. The most enjoyable part of the job is staying up to date with all of the new products"
good,"Work consisted of six hrs of scanning and sorting incoming products, also replacing items on empty shelves. I learned how to organize and sort many items. Management was never around and would rarely communicate with workers. Coworkers just worried about the own job and didnt help other individuals when help was needed. The hardest part of the job was carrying out heavily boxed items with no mechanical assistant which resulted in constant strain of my back. The most ejoyable part of the job was helping expectant mothers with the best product for the baby."
good,"A typical work day would consist of me punching in, and going straight to a cash register and not doing anything else until it was time to clock out."
good,"Not good at all, they slaved us, and the worst thing about it was that the pay was terrible"
good,Its an okay workplace most of the time. I worked overnight which was a seasonal postion. It kinda threw my eternal clock of being as though i would sleep durring the day and work durring the night. But it was fun once i got pass that first 2 hour hump.
good,"management was ok, co workers young and dumb, not many hours"
good,"This was a great first job. I learned about sales, customer service, and was able to advance quickly into working in the cash office. I formed good relationships with some of the supervisiors of diffferent deparments and especally the apparel deparement. When there was an opening I ran and over saw the apparel department for three months until they found someone suitable to run it permenitly."
good,"The job itself was a nice experience. I met alot of interesting people from all over. Standing on my feet for 10 hours straight was horrible, but i managed. other wise the job was a success."
good,if you're prepared to work long hours in retail and have little sanity.
good,I did not like working here. There ws no rrom for advancement or anything. you had to stick with the same job instead of being able to learn something new
good,"Night manager did nothing but walk around and flirt with her boyfriend all night.  Did very little to no work at all. The other workers ran the show, we picked orders and packed them."
good,I didn't like this job because some of the coworkers were talking about the new workers that started and that didn't make me feel good about myself but I stilled come to work even if I had to walk but the only thing that I like about that job was seeing the kids faces as they come up to the cashier and they mostly got what they wanted and I would say I hope u enjoy your toy
good,"Fun place to work, until shifts started getting cut as well as the people. Left before things got too bad and soon heard of all the stores closing down."
good,"This was an alright job. It was close to home and had a semi-decent discount on items in the store. It was not pleasant having many registers, but only having one open. The store would always be understaffed. Only one register, one customer service representative/manager, one person to work the left side of the store, one person to work the right side of the store, and one person to work the warehouse."
good,I worked at Toys R Us for the Christmas Holidays and it was an ok job. I learned that you cant trust people that worked there. Management wasn't very nice to people that worked there. the hardest part of the job was merchandising the shelves and climbing ladders when your afraid of heights. the only thing I enjoyed most about the job was helping the little kids find what they needed.
good,Toys R Us was my first job and it allowed me to get used to the work life. The people there are friendly and nice and understood that I was young and still learning. The job security is where I had to give them a one star because it was only a seasonal job and now Toys R Us is closed.
good,Enjoyed the time being there. Co-workers and customers never argued with each other. Enjoyed the workspace that was given to me. Never really had any complaints from anyone.
good,"It's pretty busy in Times Square Toys R Us (it's already demolished and replaced sadly). Management have favoritism, some employees are cool and some aren't. They don't really give much hours unless you're cool with a manager. The upside of it is I get to meet celebrities, discount on toys, made my character friendlier and made me more social, etc."
good,"Management was not good. I didn't know my seasonal position was coming to an end, I just never got a following schedule. Everyone was very independent."
good,was my first retail job. i was a night stocker and it went smooth but store was unorganized. the handheld we had was not accurate on trying to find products. they put things in random places and dont change it on the computers. makes stocking slower than intended.
good,A lot of the people were not nice. Not an environment i wanted to work in. Workers were rude along with customers. It could’ve just been the toys r us that i worked at.
good,我在2004年入職都現在。公司工作環境不錯。但工資追不上市場。早幾年已經出現斷層。可以都主要靠一大理PT 同事去經營。所以近年出現人手荒。
good,Go times working there. I got my first shot on forklifts years ago there which ended up being a great start for my forklift career. The Co wokers were simply amazing.
good,they closed down. its really nothing to talk about its gone! didnt want it to close up sad to see the place go but going to were i am now was a good thing.
good,"Warehouse employees weren't treated fairly, they didn't have enough employees on hand, and lack of communication between team members and the management."
good,"Temporary post, they dont keep people for long. Growth is rare."
good,There was no advancement for me which is why I left to begin with before it closed but I won't lie that I don't have fun and miss the sore and the people I worked with it was a great store which needed a lot of help obviously but it was a great job. I learned a lot.
good,This was a fun role. I enjoyed the role itself but worked very long days with minimal to no breaks. It was lovely talking with the children who were so proud of themselves for saving their pocket money to buy their toy etc.
good,A typical day for us would be to head to the back and help unload the truck then drop the boxes off to stock the shelves. What I learned is companies will sometimes cut corners to save money. Management was good but not great I guess it depended on the store.it may not be in business but if it still was I would NOT recommend this job
good,"In the Interview I was told I would be hired on as a cashier however, about two weeks after that they moved me to the back of house. Which to work back there it's all lifting furniture and boxes and moving heavy things. You're also the ones that walk around the store and clean it up after people destroy it. I'm not that strong and cannot lift things like dressers and cribs and travel strollers that usually weigh about 130 pounds. I can't lift my own body weight several times a day. If I would have done cashiering like I was told I would be doing, I probably would have been much happier and I probably would have been sad that they shut down the store. As is was, I was pretty happy to hear that it was closing. I didn't feel so bad giving my notice."
good,"The work could be fun and silly and enjoyable. Management would give you kudos for meeting their goals, but no prizes and sometimes they forgot your accomplishments and acted as if you didn't have any."
good,I was a sales associate and my job was to greet and assist customers with their purchases and drive sales I didn't like how the managers wasn't available to help out employees that needed help dealing with customer related questions or issues
good,"toys r us is what you make it. Most days are very slow which means weekly, your hours are bad no more than 12+ a week, the employees are pretty friendly. The overall experience is what you make it. now that we're closing everyone is going to be laid off."
good,I enjoyed working nights there you worked at your own pace with out worrying about the customers we just did our job and filled all the empty shelves at night
good,"was only there for a short time was a seasonal part time job/ the company is out of business at this time. when I was there it was a nice place to work, co-workers were friendly, store was clean, overall a decent experience"
good,This company is one I would nit recommend d anyone to work for.  The workers bind together as one but management is terrible. Nothing more to tell it is going out of business
good,"there were not many workers and when they did hire new workers our hours would lessen. I was only a seasonal worker. black Friday was really bad, we didn't have enough workers."
good,"*do my work, then helped out where it was needed the most"
good,"Seasonal (Christmas) work. My night consisted of unloading trucks, stocking shelves and occasionally assisting with customers and sales as needed. Getting used to working a night shift was the most difficult part of the job."
good,"Toys R Us are slave drivers. They don't care about their employees. Their pay rate is terrible. It is only good to work there if you are a high school student, anything after that is degrading."
good,"They tell you when you are promoted to a different position, that things will remain the same with your pay.  However they try to rip you off by making you Salary from Hourly positions.  You can work many long difficult hours and they do not care about you. They will drop you like a dime if you make 1 mistake no matter what your amount of years are with them."
good,I worked the holiday season and was let go in early February. I enjoyed the team I worked with but there was a lack of proper training and communication between management and team members.
good,"The job itself was not the issue.  Management never seemed to know what was going on, or how to correct an employee inquiry.  Seasonal advancement was a joke because the only employee that got to stay, despite my having stayed from start to finish, was a day shift manager's son."
good,I worked here at the one on staten island and let me tell you they are the worst and disrespectful people there..The manager talk to you any type of way .. They mess up your check
good,this Is a fast paced environment. You have to be able to respond quickly and answer multiple questions at the same time. Problem solving is a big aspect of the job due to customer questions and sales issues.  Also don’t rely on management
good,"There was always some reason to stress, but the management weren't open to suggestions to what would make things better.  Also, they didn't care what you had going on outside the store.  You could make request for days off, but it didn't matter.  It was really frustrating especially when you are a single parent traveling to work.  I did enjoy working with the customers and what I actually did at the store.  If it was just that, I would have stayed, but the management didn't care about the employees at all."
good,"On a typical work day I would stand around at a cash register and barely do anything, then I would have to do restock which was complicated because all the isles were messed up"
good,"i didn't like how they lacked cameras in the building, something was either stolen or lost in the store, it was stressfull at times because most of the crew was slacking instead of doing their work"
good,The managers make the empolyees do most of there work. Around the holidays is an absolute mess. If someone calls out the managers will ask anymore near there are they willing to take that person shift. Its fun  cause of the environment but the managers make it a bad place to work
good,I found this job entertaining however I just didn't agree with how they dealt with certain complaints and they never put the customers needs first. They could of been more polite and also should more equality and diversity.
good,"My experience at toysrus was very educational, I learned many technique on dealing with many type of people and their needs. I started as a cashier and moved on to the customer service desk, which its a complete different atmosphere because your dealing with a few more difficult customers than usual, but being on behind that cashier I learned patience, control and posture. i enjoyed working their because it was a wee team based environment and the managers and co workers all worked on the same page to help each other succeed on daily task. I also liked the fact that everyday we would learn new products and sale ethics."
good,"I enjoyed working at toys r us/babies r us. However, I wasn't fond that I got no kind of pay raise even after a year. And when offered a new/better position, I was the only one who had to do a ""30 day trial"" but everybody else got their raise immediately."
good,"At first it was a great place to learn new skills, and I learned a lot under my old manager, but with the current management the store has become a mess and stressful. Customers take it out on the employees and our leadership doesn't seem to know what to do leaving us to figure out the solution and risk getting the backlash. Plus they promote employees who don't do the job they get paid for, leaving more work for other workers. The stress isn't worth the low pay and hectic hours."
good,"My experience with Toys R Us was positive because it was here where I learned most of the things I know now about the professional world. I grew a lot personally and professionally. As the title states, it is a great place to begin working. The negative was my store specifically. I went through 6 store managers in 3 and a half years working there. Recruiting for team members was bad, there was constant onboarding of new hires who left their positions weeks in."
good,during the christmas season is not a time to work here. if you are not able to manage doing multiple tasks at once and constant on demand customer service this job is not for you.
good,When I worked at this store the managers were really rude if you asked a simple question they yelled at you. They never tell you when to go on break. I signed up for cashier and I was either outside in the cold getting all the shopping carts or walking around.
good,"I was working during holiday season so the was one of the busiest times of the year for the company. So there was a lot of work that had to be done 10k worth of product needed to be on the floor every night and If work wasn't done by the end of the 10hr shift it was often expected you stay over time to finish up. I often worked 12 hr shifts, some back to back, and other coworkers often complained about sleep issues."
good,Must have a lot of patience with kids and parents.  It is a fun place to work. Must know different kinds of toys. must have flexible time to work and must be able to work during holidays
good,The job was easy. But the management didnt know how to organize their employee's. And some of the supervisors would show up in a bad mood and take it out on the non management employee's.
good,"To much internet taking away store business and to much emphasis on credit cards, warrenty, customer surveys, instead of focusing on the custonmers.  Lowest paying retailer in fargo"
good,"Un día típico de trabajo es de un ritmo alto y constante."
good,"I was a cashier as a beginning.  Very good job training in this respect.  Straightening out the shelves was very easy.  I was also on the floor with many, especially technical items of which I had no knowledge of.  Other co-workers assisted as able."
good,i enjoyed the store but the employees are racist and unfair and i was not treat fairly as a black employee and i will never shop at the store in gainesville fl again but i do still like the company just a problem with that store
good,"If you love to assist customer and like to encounter children, this is the place for you. Pay isn't all that great but its a great 1st job."
good,"Toys R Us is an excellent business to work for based solely off the fact that you don't encounter certain persons from management, or come across any instances needing to be reported to HR. Especially because they won't do anything. Managers constantly belittle their employees, don't teach them to do their jobs, then get angry at and insult the workers for not knowing what to do."
good,Great environment cool people just far out from home 20 miles from home cant miss alot of days on property store great distribution center.  Tough employers to work for. But overall great job to have
good,it was the most fun to work here during the holidays.  It was just a lot of good energy and there was a lot of chances to get more hours.  There were always new workers during the season.
good,"A typical day at Toys R Us is working on shipment while giving your customers 100% of your attention when they approach or pass by. "
good,"A typical day at work when I first started was wonderful. It was busy and time would fly by. But now, time drags on and my hours have diminished."
good,Toys was a great learning experience. Unfortunately it's hard to lock in  any sort of lifetime career there. Advancement is nearly impossible.
good,"Toys 'R' Us is not a terrible company, I can certainly think of worse ones, but retail is as retail does, and this company does not break from the mold in the slightest."
good,they don't teach you as much for working a cash register just give you a preview. management doesn't listen to employee's tries to prove that we are wrong without saying we are wrong.
good,"This company was a bit too much, I was expected to do things I didn't know was part of a cashier's job description. The hours was extremely unbelievable."
good,There really wasn't a typical day because things would change so often. I learned how to adapt and become comfortable with a changing environment. Management was horrible no real people skills or patience. Co-workers were awesome very kind and caring. the hardest part was adapting to change everytime you walked in the door. Most enjoyable part was leaving and finding as better job.
good,"A typical day for me is doing all the 41 things on the maintenance check list, everything from cleaning the the floors to checking for cracks in the building. Then I build customer products that they pay to have assembled. All in 4 hours a day, three days a week."
good,"While my fellow staff wasn't bad, and neither was the workplace environment; I never really enjoyed my time at Toys R Us. I only worked as a cashier while I was there, and for the short time I worked there, I was hassled over getting customers to sign up for rewards card and credit cards. When the issue was that those who shopped at Toys R Us was already a member, or someone who was just buying a gift for a friend, so in other words they don't want a card or another. Which lead to me being let go."
good,"Its a good company, as with any company there i room for improvement and better training for staff and customer service. "
good,"Toys R Us has been a fun place to work and I love my co-workers. Every day is different but usually it is pretty slow and easy-going. During the holiday season, it is pretty busy and makes your shifts go fast. The most enjoyable part of working at Toys R Us for me is working with the customers and children. Although I love working at Toys R Us, management isn't the greatest and the hours are never the same. You could have 32 hours one week and 15 the next, so it definitely isn't stable by any means."
good,"For 9 months of the year, the balance of home/work life is pretty good.  Schedule will differ by day, but that's retail.  Once the holidays hit, kiss the family goodbye, you are Santa's property now."
good,"I have learned Customer Service Skills"
good,"I learned quite a lot of skills while working for Toys R Us like bettering my cashiering skills, setting metric goals for the day, better communication skills with prospective clients, processing inventory, and better customer service skills. I can express that I was not impressed with Management. Objectives were overlooked with certain employees and only metrics were enforced with extreme expectations to keep the company afloat. They do not help employees to grow within the company. There is no recognition for employees within the company. Co-workers were found stealing from the company and late actions were taken. The most enjoyable part of my job was working face to face with prospective clients while giving them my perspective and opinions on purchases and helping them find their items pertaining to their needs and wants."
good,For being a seasonal job it was not awful. I worked my first Black Friday in my life. Quite an eye opener. Worked a late night shift which was not pleasant considering people sort of abandon us to do that work. Management was good but I wasnt with them long.
good,It's Not much to say ..I wud go to work clock in.. unload the truck(the fastest unloader might I add) separate the toys while unloading then get right to stocking them on the floor.
good,"this company took away the benefits for their employers and replaced it with a ""coverage plan"" that was twice the price of the previous benefit provider at half the coverage. moving up in the company is nearly impossible unless you dedicate 100 % of your time kissing up to people."
good,the workers were very nice to work with but the management was not as professional as they should have been . Talked about what you needed to improve on in front of customers wasn't ok .
good,co-workers may be unfriendly same with management. Hours are fairly irregular. shift changes are made without notification
good,fun work place little advancement a typical day at work consisted of loading and unloading trucks while also stocking the sales floor
good,You could meet alot of different people. Help first time parents or peolple who don't know kids very well.
good,"I was working in the back building bikes much of the time, but because I did not work a register, I was not given the opportunity to encourage loyalty programs or company credit cards. Unfortunately corporate offices determined this is how hours should be determined. I was often working as little as 8 hours a week, closing Friday and Saturday nights."
good,"The staff was very unorganized, once I applied i explained on a date I would not be able to attend work because I was going out of town and they said it was fine but when it came down to it, they wouldn't let me leave. Poorly organized with unfriendly staff"
good,I absolutely love the people I work with. I have learned a lot about pricing and signage from my supervisor. Management could be better. I learned through this job I can work alone but I can also work as a team.
good,"I was a cashier and ran the customer service desk. I was responsible for ringing out guests, returns and exchanges, handling guests complaints and requests. Its a very hectic place to work at during the holiday season but I loved the fast paced environment. The best part was making a child smile. Most of my co workers were great. The management however, not so great. on my last day I was told I could drop down to a ""temporary employee"" since I had another job. After not being on the schedule for a number of weeks I called to only find out I could not be ""temporary employee"" and I was taken off the schedule. They basically terminated me without a notice. There is no communication with management. None of the managers care or show any kinds of respect for employees, unless you are a suck up. The slackers get more attention and hours than the ones who actually care. This job also pays peanuts and it is impossible to support a family on this income. I do not suggest working for this company."
good,"No much to say its Toys R Us."
good,Problems with new management has made it hard to be able to tolerate with the business.
good,"Rang up customers, and stocked shelves. Helped parents find the perfect toy for their kids."
good,Lifting a lot boxes.  Stay organism.  Working with yours hours.  Team players.  Busy days none stop.  Enjoy working with people.
good,"Nice place to work at. Easily worked well with others, always had a team to work with."
good,Enjoyed working there. Although store mangers were very inclined to high amounts of favoritism amongst employees. I learned various skills in regards to computerized sales and cash register work as well as interacting with guests and helping them with their shopping experience.
good,I wouldn't really have much to say about this job considering I didn't work there very long. It was only seasonal. Yet what I can take from it was the same as from sams club it was unorganized and managers were rude.
good,"A typical day is usually fun and rewarding. You speak with many different people and helping them find toys for the children in their lives. Helping them find savings was always my favorite thing, the customers always appreciated that. Its your typical cashier job. Ringing up customers, you always have to ask if they have a rewards card and try to sign them up for one if they don't have a membership.  You also have to ask if they have a Toys R Us credit card. Other than that its all about cleaning and straightening the store also merchandising."
good,"I loved working at Toys R Us. It was a relatively easy job, required walking, stooping, bending and standing. Friendly work environment and management was friendly as well. The only problem I had was the pay, it was not worth the stress of working all night for minimal pay. I would work for them again if they brought the pay up to descent."
good,"I liked working for this company because I also shop there and have children so I thought it would be fun to work at the store. The hardest part of the job was it was only part time and hours were hard to get. The most enjoyable part of working there was the customers, I loved helping them."
good,Not a good job for anyone short of a college kid living with their parents
good,Absolutely no job security unless you come in on a college trainee program.  Loyal employees have been released with no foundation and disgarded after years of service.
good,I usually spent my shift searching for something that I had not already done because it was rarely busy. I did enjoy seeing the kids run around in awe and enjoyed helping them find the toys they wanted.
good,It was hetic working during holiday season. And you need to have alot of patience.
good,Quick staff meeting.
good,"I worked long hours at minimun wage. Holidays and while sick, was not not shown any sympathy. Terrible pay not very organized."
good,I stand at the store exit and conduct walks from time to time. I check employees bags I look at the CCTV. Management is some times cool. They employees are friendly
good,I would stand by the exit doors and greet costumers and check receipts. The most enjoying part of the job is having small conversations with costumers. The hardest part was when I would ask costumers for a receipt some of them would give me a hard time.
good,"My typical day at ToysRUs would be assisting customers, working the cashier when needed, and maintaing clean aisles. Working at ToysRUs i learned to use a cashier the very first time, where doing that taught me to multi-task when also interacting with customers. The management was very poor, wasn't very supportive or enthusiastic. As for my co-workers some were very shy and to themselves, few were very open and willing to help out when I had a difficult time. The hardest part was working the cashier because thats where all the pressure was on you. The most enjoyable time was closing because me and the other person closing would have fun talking and getting the job done fast and on time."
good,"Normally you'll walk right in and get straight to work, and get called on throughout the day. For me personally I learned a lot from the store, but others didn't take it as serious. The management there is really bad at times with putting out a schedule, they don't communicate very well between each other. Most times you just fell like your being slowed down by them. People that work there as Co-workers are great, and they will say things bluntly to you. They have more experience then the managers do, which is quite sad. For me the hard part was probably getting yelled at by my managers, and dealing with some new employees. The most enjoyable part was probably me taking the time needed to help every guest and getting them to come back. I've got some good customers to come back time and time again. Though I don't know if they still go there."
good,"A typical day includes assigning tasks to anywhere from 25 to 30 associates and maintaining a safe and clean work space. make sure the processing department runs smoothly. Fix any issues that arise. Run reports, update spreadsheets and help other departments when needed. My co-workers are great. I enjoy working with them every day. The hardest part of the job is not being able to further my career because of college education. Over my time here my communications and computer skills have advanced. I learned a voice picking system wich improves accuracy."
good,Helped customers with questions and give them a solution to there question.
good,"The managers are short tempered, product is not always readily available, it is impossible to request a day off, its all about seniority."
good,Store was managed poorly never enough people to unload truck when inventory received. Manager shows favouritism tocertain employees. Not flexible with scheduling.
good,"Overall, Toys R Us wasn't too bad. Most of my fellow employees were great but management was just management. The only downside I have was them forcing EVERYONE to push credit cards on customers. That alone just made me feel icky in a way. Also, no clear way of actually moving up in the company."
good,"I reported to various locations for general labor support and help. It wasnt the worst or best job ever, just a job, really. I dont think they are great or terrible"
good,"Began working here while I was in high school up until I finished university and began my career. I saw many changes occur within the company, from the company being publicly sued for underpaying young staff to then trying to reinvent itself. The positive aspect of the job would have to be the other staff you worked with. They made the job bearable, particularly during the busy Christmas period. There were many downsides though. One downside would definitely be management. Management was constantly changing which resulted in a lack of consistency with how things were run on a day to day basis. Many times the management also consisted of inexperienced people straight out of high school who had no formal qualifications or interpersonal and communication skills. Another downside (which I'm sure is a downside for many retail jobs) was the lack of staff that would be rostered to work. A typical day (even during christmas) would see three people working, with management chatting away in the office. The company suffered a lot of loss prevention which could have been avoidable had staff actually been rostered on to be on the registers and watch the doors. Overall, it was a memorable place to work but I'm not surprised it's not around anymore."
good,"It was a good place to work at but the executives didn't give any of hope for better things. At the store level, the management of my store and team members always have fun and accomplished tasks. As an overnight stocker during the the holidays, we would get a lot of work to do and it would feel overwhelming but the team i worked with made things easy and run smoothly."
good,"I loved working with my co-workers, many of whom I’m still friends with, but the company treated us terribly and the overall experience was not one I’d recommend, especially as a first job."
good,"Me contrataron de auxiliar de servicios, cuando en realidad eche mi curriculum para dependiente. Fue durante una campaña de navidad y el gerente no sé si quería innovar...De seguridad no tenía mucha idea y pensaba que teniendo a una sola persona en la puerta, iba a evitar todos los posibles hurtos, cuando un auxiliar de servicios no esta cualificado para hacer el trabajo que pueda hacer un vigilante de seguridad...En definitiva, fue una experiencia bastante nefasta, la cual a día de hoy, sigo sin tener claro el porqué me contrataron..."
good,"Toys R Us was great company, that offered benefits for part time and full time workers, being dominant in the field do for so many years, I remember going there when I was a kid,"
good,Was hired for the Christmas holiday. Honestly did not like the job at all. The hiring process was more in depth than any on the job training i recieved.
good,"Great employees to work with. "
good,"Toys r us lacks of improvement "
good,This is a good business to start out at. The hours are minimal and the pay not so great. But it was a useful employer. I had great friends here. Sad that it closed.
good,"I worked in the toy retail store Toys R Us as a part-time worker on a Christmas Temporary contract. Throughout my time working there, I have learned the field of packing items. I had an okay experience."
good,Great job at the time. Seasonal. Gained knowledge in sales experience. Customer service. Learned patience. Helped me with some of the thing I needed while in High School.
good,"When I first started working for Toys R Us I enjoyed my job. I really felt like it was team effort. Management really cared about their workers. However once news got around that it was going bankrupt, management started to change. It started to feel like they cared more about sales then their workers. Toys R Us really do care about their customers though and that wont change."
good,Some days were better than others. Wasn’t a lot of good communication among employees nor management. Would enjoyed working there if communication was a lot better
good,It was a great company to get experience from as my first job.It was fast-paced and helped time fly by fast. Management was great and they were very flexible when scheduling you to work
good,"Management played favorites and were rude.  If my shift changed, I was not notified until the day before.  I would go from 10pm - 6am to coming to work at 4 am - 12 pm.   Management never had a positive word for the company or employees"
good,"Fast paced , team work was good, management was not so great. Pay was ok. Store could be a mess at times. Great start for high school kids just to have while still in school"
good,It was a cool relaxed place to work at. Did not really do much besides unbox toys and stock the shelves. Store team was pretty cool for the most part.
good,"It was an okay job but management as we see, was bad. High turn-over and games played with over-time pay. Managers hired people that suited for the job and favoritism though-out the store. The over-all high prices put the stores in the USA into extinction since Amazon and Walmart undercut them. They were dinosaurs that didn't change with the times..."
good,"This company closed citing lack of income and filed bancruptcy and although recent reports say that they are trying to reopen, they still never paid enough for the work they expected to be done, they did not recognize their employees, and letting go of employees who spent their life there just to hire new cheaper employees doesn't equal success."
good,"it was normally slow days, unless holidays, the management was quite rude when it came to sales, the weren't very flexible with your life and often rude about call outs. but the people made it amazing to be there."
good,i had fun working there at times. depended on who i worked with. The main manager was mean. they put a lot for stress on you for credit cards and extra sales. if you didnt get them they would cut your hours.
good,"A typical day consisted of stocking and re-organizing shelves and toys. Often times I would also help guests check out at the register, locate an item ordered online or via the phone in the back warehouse, and clean the store as necessary. The hardest part of the job was doing boring, unfulfilling work for 7 hours before clocking out and repeating 3 days a week."
good,"The workplace culture was nice, and friendly. Working at Toys R Us was fun. There were always good and bad days with the customers. Learning new jobs was also encouraging."
good,"The younger you are, the harder they work you and expect you to be at 100% all the time and management doesn't really care if you're not. They expect you to run around the store and find a manager if you don't have anything to do. Some of the supervisors' attitudes and behavior was cringey and unlikable. Sometimes I have to bare with hearing horrid, weird, and unfunny jokes as I go to complete a task. To avoid them, just gotta look like you're busy doing something else."
good,Had a good time seasonal fast paced good people had to do a lot of stocking but nothing you can't handle overall short breaks but a great work environment
good,I loved working there. My co-workers where like family.   The manager's always came and gone.  Now TRU is going out of business. I have nothing else to said.  I'M VERY SAD
good,I loved working with this company but the compensation didn’t meet the amount of work required. Was also held to too high of a standard for credit card sales
good,"I felt like I was being slaved of my hours, working during christmas time and the co workers and managers were gossipers and no good leadership. One of the managers smelled real bad and I had to work with him often."
good,"No typical work day in retail management, your job changes form hour to hour, over seeing employees, to inventorying merchandise, to interacting with customers."
good,"⦁	Although this was a temporary Christmas contract I helped look after the high value bicycle section"
good,"It's where a kid could have been a kid, great Sr. leadership and management but the turnover for team members was great which made productivity difficult."
good,I  do not know why you would ask for a review of TRU. The company has filed bankruptcy and we will be closing the doors for the last time on May 14th.
good,"Overall Babies R Us is an average job. A typical day on the job consisted of, freight, stocking, customer service, ect. Management was  average for a retail work enviorment."
good,"A job that I would not recommend for a career . "
good,"low pay,stupidly short lunches,general managers who have no idea what there doing,all this and more is what you can expect from toys 'r' us if you choose them for your employment."
good,"They set standards to high,  if you worked one day a week and they kept changing the store you were supposed to know where everything was.  Plus they wanted you to interact with customers and still meet your goals."
good,"Only with the company for a short time while completing a trainee-ship. I felt that i was not needed or wanted around, but i could see a full time and permanent member of staff could feel welcomed. Lively energy from the team yet management seemed to have had very little involvement with the rest of the team."
good,Although this job just wasn’t for me it might be for others stocking wasn’t as bad it was just the wages etc the hours weren’t good also wages werent  great place to shop
good,Overall experience with associates great
good,This what my very first job that I ever worked. Everyone their was true amazing and they knew what they were doing. But management on the other hand was a complete mess!  HR and the Store Manager didn't know what was going on half of the time. I felt more like their main priority was just getting people to apply for TRU Credit Card. It got to the point where they wanted the employees to push it on the guest every time at check out and if they declined to apply they would tell the employees to find more reasons to apply and not to take NO for an answer.
good,"Long hours, under appreciated, and then being yelled at by customers for stuff out of your control, and then being excepted to fix it all and try to spend time with family or loved ones."
good,It was a very toxic environment with no chances at all to move up in ranks. Coworkers would talk about you daily behind you back and you would hear about it like a Highschool rumor floating around. It is a basic summer job for kids just getting out of school or someone looking for a basic part time job.
good,"Generally scheduled for 38-39 hours to maintain part time status. Paid minimum wage +$1 due to the overnight shift. Physical job climbing up and down ladders, carrying boxes. Rarely get more than one day off in a row, hard to feel rested."
good,Job was cool. Enjoy working with kids. Guests always great. Great part time learning different bout toys from the kids lol.. Managers and coworkers were also great.
good,"It was great working in the store, but they barely give any hours a week and managers are a mess! They also have favorites which makes it hard for new workers to be seen"
good,"Ok place to work. Breaks are to short 30 minutes.  When the bell rings you have to walk a half a mile to get to breakroom for breaks and lunch.  Breaks comes out to be 15 minutes, because you have to wait for to get a microwave to heat up food."
good,Was fun to work at but did not offer much in the way of benefits or career advancement.The customers were great but management was lacking. I would not recommend this job to anyone.
good,"Unless you’re FT it’s really for high school and college students who need extra money . The pay is ok, during season is the best time to work its fast paced and constantly moving until it’s over then it’s dead as a door nail"
good,"lifting up to 75lbs"
good,"This job sucked, in the beginning it was okay because I wasn't used to having a job but lately I haven't gotten hours. They hired all these people for seasonal positions and ever since they don't know me. No breaks unless you work more than 5 hours and then there's no break room and also you have to pay for parking."
good,"The job is great. I have zero complaints there, but management and corporate are terrible. It's very slow from Feb-September so only expect to work 25-30 hours a week. From October-December it's insane and you'll be run ragged. I'm talking 12-16 hour shifts back to back with a day off every 8 to 9 days. Then boom, it's dead again for 8 more months."
good,while working at Babies R Us my duties were to keep my area clean deal with money and customers since I was doing cashier. Some of the employees were friendly and some supervisors werent as friendly . overall it was a decent job but I probably wouldnt work there again.
good,it was good people except management expected too much and not enough time to be with family. never had organized schedules causing you to stay more than shift because no one wanted to work there
good,The staff is pretty friendly and helpful. The location is convenient and is a good place to kill time. Always have a great selection of toys and games.
good,"Toys ""R"" Us was a great place to work at but seasonal time was crazy. The staff were great whenever I needed help. They would answer my questions nicely whenever I asked."
good,I worked here as a seasonal employe and the hours are up and down. one week you work 5 days and next week you work 3 days. no form of benefits. it is an easy job.
good,"no benefits, horrible pay, hours were very inconsistent. management was never there to answer questions when i was new which means that you have to figure it out on your own"
good,It was a good job but little pay and the management was not that good. Hours were different everyday. It's good for someone looking for a first job but that's it.
good,La verdad no quedé muy contenta con el gerente de esa tienda.
good,"The specialty toy store has struggled as it increasingly competes with online retailers in its two main businesses: baby goods and toys. Amazon sells more than double what Toys R Us does online in just those two categories alone."
good,It's difficult to keep track of everything that is needed to be done. The managers expect more than what the employees are able to produce. Your must work fast or you're fired.
good,"A day in babies r us would consist of A lot of customer service, working areas you really are not assigned to. I've learned alot about baby formula and how to build cribs. Workplace is fair and even. The hardest part of the job would be early morning stocking and late holiday hour stocking."
good,"Every job is stressful"
good,Leadership and management team is focused and a pleasure to work with. The struggle is the execution of the supply chain up at the corporate level. Tenured team members have sense of entitlement and are unwilling to do change their minds on how the operation should evolve. Hardest part is managing expectations that change daily and need instant results. Most enjoyable part of the job is delivering smiles to children supporting expecting families.
good,This was a good first Job. I really got to figure out how I worked and what I was willing to do for a paycheck. This is a good second job but you will definitely need 2 jobs to be able to live.
good,"A typical day at work was usually busy since it was around the holidays. "
good,Toys R Us is a great company to begin your career. Working here will quickly show you what the world of retail has to offer. Provides a great platform for individual development.
good,A typical night at work consisted of opening boxes and stocking the shelves. I learned how to merchandise. Management did their job. Workplace culture was mixed. The hardest part of the job were the late night hours. The most enjoyable part of the job was interacting with customers.
good,toys r us is a fun workplace seeing how your surrounded by young kids which get super excited just walking in the front door. however the store never has enough payroll to help give the coverage that is needed to provided great customer service. the company always expects more and more but never gives the resources to get the task done.
good,I only worked at this establishment for a short period of time as I was only a Seasonal Work. I was cashier as well as a floor associate. I maintained store cleanlienss as well as complete customer transactions
good,It is just like any other retail company. your work experience is based on whoever is in charge at that moment. The pay is about average. Employees are asked to up sell things like batteries and protection plans for products.
good,"It's a good place to work at over all. You don't get placed were you were hirered, they put you wherever they want you. There was a manager there that gave attitude no matter what you did. Even if you did what she said and you didn't talk back or at all she got mad no matter what."
good,"This job can get a bit overwhelming at times, especially during holiday season. The shift goes by fast but if you are not fully trained it can be difficult to manage the overwhelming amount of customers and questions they may have throughout the day."
good,First job I worked seasonal but I enjoyed it we had a lot of workers working the same time as I did everyone was always pretty nice to me and just in general
good,I spent two Christmas seasons with Toys R Us and enjoyed every second of it. Toys R Us is where I first got my feel for customer service and have kept those things Ive learned.
good,"Typical days at work were extremely non-engaging. I learned very little of note because the management at the store generally didn't seem to care about the workers. They seemed to think of us more as bodies on the floor rather than actual workers. There didn't seem to even be any ""workplace culture."" The hardest part of the job was the anxiety of potentially doing something wrong. The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting a few coworkers."
good,"Working at Toys R Us wasn't the best experience. Some managers were very rude and they're never flexible with your schedule. If you request days off, you might not be able to get it."
good,managers was never doing work. I felt like associates did majority of everything. My store was closing down so everyone stopped caring.From my time being apart of the team.
good,"A typical work day can include everything from being on the sales floor, cash register, warehouse and offering assistance at the customer service desk. Being in each of these departments give you more training and over all department knowledge. Make sure that each task in each department is done correctly can be little challenging, but you learn from your mistakes if any are made."
good,"I really could have not took this job , I barely worked and hardly got paid anything . it is an okay company to work for just because you get to interact with the kids and toys"
good,productive workplace and it was a good work environment. for the most part i like working and its enjoyable. my typical day at work would be fun and easy going.
good,The idea of warehousing is fun as well as working with my fellow team members. The managers making doing many things that either they or other people can do.
good,"Salary is not good. "
good,you get hired as seasonal being told if you do good enough during the Christmas season that you might be kept and get great hours. so you work really hard to get kept not knowing the after the first of the year you get 4 hours a week which pretty much pays for your gas to go to work
good,"Only worked there for a month and a half, But busy working night shifts, unloading the trucks and stocking shelves.  Management was fine, Most of the co-workers didn't want to really work"
good,"it was a regular seasonal job, over the board hours. force us to stay if we didnt finish the overnight shipping. nothing much to look forward to working in this job"
good,"Interesting place to work at, get to interact with kids and parents in search of new toys, always satisfying the customers, brings team members happiness"
good,"Great hours during the holiday season. If kept on after the holiday season is over, hours drop by a good amount. Management is hit or miss. Must have good people skills."
good,"You get yelled at on a daily basis by angry customers who want to use an expired coupon, or because you are out of stock on the most popular game/toy. You are constantly hounded by management to get people to sign up for the Toys R Us credit card, and if you don't, they cut your hours. You have to witness people stealing on a daily basis, and have the same 20 people come back to return the stolen merchandise, to which you are forced to accept the return as long as they have a valid form of I.D. The coworkers were a group of really awesome people and you will often find yourself disliking your job together and laughing about how awful the customers can be. The store takes forever to close during peak months, and it is open extremely late for a place that sells merchandise that nobody actually NEEDS to survive. Overall, it is a decent job and as long as you do what you are supposed to do and have a decent reputation with the managers, it isn't a terrible place to work. Although closing was a process, it became fun if you were closing with the cool managers, and you got to play around with some toys as you were putting things back in their place."
good,"La giornata tipo: in base agli orari ero o in cassa o addetta vendita, quando ero prima cassiera facevo solo questo invece quando ero di seconda andavo anche in area vendita, quindi assistenza al cliente oppure soprattutto in settimana mai nei week end rifornimento scaffali in base agli articoli che arrivavano "
good,Great people but culture is down and has been for years. there is an attempt to turn it around. If you know the right people you can get some toys.
good,they need to hire more help to have year round instead of just during the holidays and need to get people who are actually willing to work instead of just walking around the store
good,"Working in a toy store is fun but, there are some downfalls to it as well. For example, the pay is not good and neither are the hours. They don't supply us with any hours and expect us to pay our bills. My store manager is very down to earth but he is strict as well. He tries to be fair but then he does have his favorites. I have learned patience and customer service. You can not be impatient working with people especially people that has children. My co-workers are fine some get along great while others don't. The hardest part of the job is not having hours. all of the full time people are supervisors that's it everyone else is part time and only get one maybe two days a week. We get paid bi-weekly and it does not help pay bills. The best part is working with the children. To see the smiles on their faces and talking to them is so rewarding. I love the guest that I get and they love me. My supervisors are very caring at times and that makes working with them worth while/"
good,"It was nice. a normal work day went by fast and easy. There was no real challenges. I learned that not even at work you are safe; I also learned that managers talk more trash about the employees then anyone else. I can't really say much about the co-workers, considering the fact that I didn't really try to talk to or get to know any of them. The hardest part of the job is trying to put back all re-shop in a meaningful time and still help customers with out slacking in your designated area. However the most enjoyable part of the job, was helping the customers. Especially the customers with the crying babies. So fun."
good,"At Toys R Us i only worked the register. It was seasonal and during Christmas time so it was extremely busy, always. I learned many ways to do coupons, calming angry parents, and working fast. I would have managed the store differently. I would have focused more on customer service than signing people up for the in store credit card or rewards cards. Most of the coworkers were seasonal and knew that and didn't take the job seriously. The hardest part of the job was signing people up for the in store credit card, because no one wants another credit card. The most enjoyable part of that job was the discounts on toys for the employees and being around kids. It is a toy store so it was nice how kid friendly and laid back it was."
good,Great management.  Which can be hard sometimes. Co-workers are awesome.  Gets really busy during season.  Better be ready to sale sale sale.  That is all they care about.  SALE SALE SALE.
good,Working at the company taught me the true inner workings of a retail company.  Toy people are not happy people when in a competitive environment.
good,"Senior management does what they want when they want with no regards for the supervisors immediately underneath them, specifically taking calling-off and not working their shift.  Too much of a whirlwind effect, with the supervisors getting the bulk of the bad.  Employees have been at store more than 3 years each and many clicks have formed.  The only thing enjoyable with the company is seeing that child's smile when they found the right toy, but that only happens maybe once a week."
good,"i  was a sales floor associate, there was an extreme difference in regards to hours given out to work. only certain person's received lots of hours, sometimes I would only have 5 or 10 hours for the week. However, I had cool co-workers which made the job fun."
good,"To start off my typical day at Toys 'R' Us, i would start by putting my stuff up in the break room, after that i would go clock in. Then i would check my schedule and see what cash register i would work on. Then within 3-4 hours of working the cash register i would take  my lunch break. Once i was done with my lunch i would have to organize some shelves and make sure that nothing was out of place and make the shelves look neat. Also, while i organized the shelves i would help out some customers help find what they're looking for until my shift ended. Sometimes, but very rarely i would work in the back filling orders and layaways. Most of my coworkers were pretty nice and fun to work with. My most enjoyable time was when Christmas came around, i loved to see all the holiday cheer. The hardest part of working for Toys 'R' Us was on Christmas eve because of all the sales and a day before Christmas i would be packed and overwhelming but i handled it. Then management seemed a bit unorganized but for the most part they were understanding and pretty cool to work by."
good,"Help customers find products, ring them up or handle returns.  this job was for a holiday season only...after holidays anyone who stayed might only get 6 hours a week"
good,not the best of work place's it had to much favoritism within the management and the amount of family that worked together and kept each other in the job was quite abit rediculous.
good,"Customers were very rude"
good,Exteremly demanding.  work load is consistently growing.  roseville manager is inept and incompetent. on the pro side assisting expecting mothers is always rewarding.
good,"se descargaba el genero del camión, posteriormente se realizaba la ubicación del genero en la ubicación, se etiquetaba todo el genero y posteriormente se ubicaba en su lugar. Con los compañeros me llevaba muy bien eran muy amables, la parte más difícil era ubicar el genero en el almacén."
good,"typical day- goes fast but customers can be crazy"
good,"As a part time team member this is a decent job. You can make more at most any other retailer though. There is a lot of favoritism and drama throughout most stores. Most team member issues are completely ignored no matter how far up the corporate chain it is reported. Most of the time this store is like working in a high school."
good,This is a good job. You get to meet a lot of great people. The best part is seeing the smile on kid faces. It is very stressful at times.
good,I was hired because the store was closing so I new I wouldn't be employed for long. Since the store was closing employees didn't take the job serious were there was to much playing. Not my kind of environment.
good,"Working at Toys R Us is like working at any retail establishment. You work on a cash register, answer questions about products, restock products, and clean the sales floor. Occasionally you get a fun task like creating a display."
good,"I enjoyed the job duties I had to do, but they were not fair to all of the employees. I enjoyed working on the register and it was fun working with toys."
good,"First of all, let me tell you how much I LOVED my co-workers.  I couldn't have made it through each day without their humor and love and the family-like culture.  Secondly, the general managers and district level managers seem to have a complete disconnect from their front-line employees.  It is an ""us vs. them"" mentality between managers and front-liners alike which makes it seem ironic that the sales associates are referred to as ""team members"".  I truly enjoyed going the distance to make my guests happy each and every day, and I was so pleased to build a rapport with some of them over a period of a couple of years.  There are some I will never forget and who have helped me to be a better person.  The job was fast-paced and extremely stressful, but boy did the work days just fly by."
good,I was hired for seasonal overnight shifts that involved me restocking the store with merchandise but in the process of doing so I was always lost due to poor communication of how & where did certain products go. Unloading the trunks made no sense & the organization of everything was completely puzzling which frustrated me because at the time I also worked for Target and everything made sense. Finding where things went was a no brainier because each item was labeled and told you its exact location where that item should go as for Toys R us it didn't. I felt like a lost cause when working here & didn't plan on staying after the season due to this dysfunctional work place.
good,"An average day at Babies R Us included duties such as, helping customers with furniture order, setting up registries for both baby and mommy, assisting the oversight of employees, counting and preparing the cash drawers for the next working shift."
good,Overall this was a good company to work for. I learned a lot and had some great experiences with this company.
good,"Having being my very first job, I was excited to work at Toys R Us.  What person doesn't want to work at the very toy store they loved to come to as a kid.  That feeling changes the minute you work there.  Short and simple, you can get written up for not smiling while ringing out customers, and you must engage in a 5-10 minute conversation with each customer at the check out lane or risk getting in trouble.  That was a long time ago, and I'm sure the policies have changed.  Depending on the location and management, it also could have been a different experience"
good,"Regular, mala gestión y cambios de horario continuos. El ambiente por lo general es bueno,"
good,"Showed up to work, unloaded pallets and loaded the shelves. Not much to the job. Just there for the manual labor portion of the duties needed."
good,"I feel this job varies depending on the type of managment you will be working with. I transfered from a store that started originally and loved. The one I went to had much less of the same culture I was used too. Aside from this, I feel the pay and benefits could be much better. But at least it helped me make a little bit during college."
good,Excellent for that college student trying to earn some money. They paid a good amount above minimum wage when i started. Management in my store was very rocky and the average employee is almost always hurting. There is room to grow...if you want to never leave.
good,"Fast changing environment."
good,"On a typical day, the work that you already know you are suppose to do when starting work. Then management gives you more work to do on top of the work you already know you have to do."
good,"I usually worked the night shifts here, part time. Depending on what place you were assigned- sales floor, customer service, electronics, etc.- would depend on what you usually do for your shift, since each place has their own projects and closing checklists. I mostly worked at customer service and on the sales floor. Customer service is the primary cashier, ringing up most of the customers. I also did lots of returns, adjusting prices, etc. As a sales floor associate, my primary assignment was cleaning the store at night- straightening each aisle, putting things away that had been left out, trash, etc. The sales floor associate is a last resort cashier, that is usually only called up front when the customer service and electronics associates are with customers, or if the check out line is long."
good,"i was there for the hours and paycheck, i worked there for 2 years since i was in high school at the time, did my workload, finished everything according to store and safety guidelines, but the shift leader, recommended her cousin and she got hired, but shortly after, their personal life got in the way of the store standards for customer service, food preparation, and proper maintenance and cleanliness of store, a lot personal confrontation, bringing their mood/feelings into work making the workplace have a sense of strain and negative feedback with dissatisfied customers."
good,"I enjoy working here. The people,in general, are great. You are made to believe that there is a lot of room to move up, but the management always has favorites the move up and pay more."
good,There were many opportunities to learn so many different skills.
good,"Maintain all cleaning and maintenance are up to standards"
good,"under paid work, unorganized schedule, sometimes no lunches on 8 hour shifts, one manager slept in the office every night leaving supervising all team members on the team leader."
good,"I worked anywhere between 4 hours to 12 hours.  I learned patience and understanding and all about the retail world. "
good,"I check customers out & offer buyer protection plan , store loyalty card or credit card I learned how to keep up with a fast past environment and deal with irate customers. My co workers were very productive. My managers were very supportive & helped me in any area I lacked. the most enjoyable part of the job were the customers. During the Christmas the non profit organizations come in & buy toys for the less fortunate. the hardest part of the job was the pressure that is placed to have customers enroll in a store card"
good,dealing with a lot of customers may be a hassle for sum. if u like fast paced environment with a lot of movement and dealing with issues head on this is the job for you.
good,"A typical day  at work was sorting boxes to be stored or shipped out, I learned that you did not have to be a manager to train someone. My co-workers were rather new and un-organized the hardest part of my job was being able to get my work done due to training people that were un-prepared and not trained well. The most enjoyable part of my job was making sure the trailer was empty and inventory put in designated places."
good,The management were very nice and helpful. my co workers were very friendly and helpful as well. i fit in in no time. the work was very hard walking back and forth from the front to back of the store. the customers were very demanding and sometimes rude but i guessing it was just because it was the holiday season. but never the less it was still a good experience. it was very organized. my biggest complain was the compensation. the pay was not good enough for the work put out.
good,"Some team members were good to work with however some weren't, every shift I had I was kept for half an hour afterwards when I should have finished and never got paid for overtime. Overall its not a company I would go back to."
good,The staff is great but the job was stressful. I always felt like I was being watched.
good,Great job to work. Great environment if you like working around kids.
good,"learned :patience, customer service"
good,people who work here are pretty positive it can be fast paste at times
good,"Each day was very busy. I handled interviews, training, assisting customers, stocking, merchandising, ringing up purchases, and anything else that needed to be done."
good,A day involved assisting customers with various store needs and answering questions on products. I also assisted in unloading and archiving of products shipped to the store. I also helped maintain store cleanliness before and after store hours. 
good,"Checked out customers with promptness and answered questions they had.  When I was not at the register, I was stocking, answering phones, assisting other departments as directed by my department manager. Also assisted co-workers in their area. Difficulty came when I was asked to bring in shopping carts. The very best part was when  customers were so elated when I helped them. Since its a children's store, I love watching the reactions kids get when parents bought them a new toy."
good,Learned to take to people and develop good customer service skills. Good part time job and that's about it. 
good,"During the holidays toy stores are chaos, but i learned that patience is a virtue and the customer is always right. My job was very enjoyable for the most part because i enjoy helping people and organizing thing. Helping frantic parents find last minute gifts for children was a fun and informative learning experience."
good,This company has been a difficult one to work for. Management at a store manager and higher are not easy to work and communicate with. They are not personable and could care less about individuals.
good,"While I enjoyed working here, the pay was not worth it. Also, they were only scheduling me for 4 hours a week. I was getting paid every other week, so I was only making about $200 a month. If I could get a weekly paid job I would be making more, even at minimum wage."
good,"Great people. It was fun working there. They also recognizes your hard work. Seen a problem regionally with nepotism, managers getting promotions based on external relationships."
good,This company is fine to work for just for extra money. The management isn't too bad and the pay is not bad either.
good,A typical day at work is assisting guests and ensuring they find what they need. Managing Team Members to make every day profitable.
good,while working there it was difficult to find a manager and there was really no training you had to jump in and figure it out for yourself.
good,"Customer Service is number one, but other then that getting tasks completed and making the store look great everyday. The people that work there are fantastic, great and energetic. Management could use a little work on training new employees and just the overall aspect of how the manage should be the same at every place you go to. I've learned how to do everything at Babies' R' Us and the hardest part is being expected to do every department by yourself on a day to day basis, but it is very rewarding when at the day you get a survey in from a customer saying just how enjoyable you made their experience there."
good,It was a very intresting i like helping people find items for their children. But working here did not turn out to be as flexable as was stated.
good,"Worked in the warehouse for 12-18 hours a day. I unloaded, cataloging and stocking/restocking items, trash disposal and waste management. My co-workers were very communicative and helpful. The hardest part of the job was it was very stressful due to long hours and little to no pay or benefits. My manager was easy to talk to and great individual. Always was first to enter and the last to leave, assisted with day-to-day operation. The trust and bond of my co-workers were the most enjoyable part of the job."
good,It is nice to see the kids faces when they fund that toy that they were looking for.
good,"good place to start working if you have no job experience, the location I worked at had a babies r us linked to the store so i was trained in both stores"
good,This job is okay if you want something part time not alot of hours just something to do. The pay is terrible and considering its a baby store they are on considerate if you have children and emergencies come up.
good,My only advice is if you need a job do not apply at toys r us they say they are professional but in reality they are not.
good,the work environment was comfotable and fun. you learned a lot about everything.
good,"I loved working at Babies R Us about the first year, but once people started leaving and new management came, things went down hill... WORST JOB!!"
good,Toysrus is a kid friendly place with a great atmosphere. The people there are usually friendly and more then happy to assist you. It's a good place to work only if you are in school and need a part-time job because their is not a lot of hours to give due to slow business.
good,"I worked here seasonal, it was my first job, I absolutely loved working here, I made life long friends, but the store manager and HR person we’re both absolute garbage, They were both racist, sexist, homophobic, and would try to scare you and blackmail you. Other than the p o s management, it’s a great job and I highly recommend it."
good,"Though this position was seasonal for myself, there are people who have been there for 5+ years and still love their job. Personally, I think that says a lot about the environment."
good,"I worked seasonally for two years in a row, but that wasn't really long enough to get a feel for being a regular employee would be like. I enjoyed the job while I was there."
good,They had bad management and they always wanted more of the employees than was originally asked to do and breaks were little to none especially since it was holiday season
good,"I was Customer Service, so I dealt with a lot of unsatisfied customers and I always handled myself professionally and with the mindset the customer is always right. My favorite part was seeing all the happy kids, my least favorite part was dealing with all the upset parents. It was a fun and happy environment. The holidays were the worst, so fast paced, and packed with people, huge lines and angry people but always performed the best and fastest I could and always tried to make my customers leave with a smile and wanting to come back."
good,"other associates were rude to customers didn’t know how to handle customers, weren’t able to accommodate customers or able to recommend an alternative item"
good,"Flexible with scheduling and pretty laid-back, but the management sucks. They don't really listen to your availability and mess up or under schedule you, and a lot of favouritism.  There's not much advancement and the store itself is just really not a great place to work-- really dull and lifeless despite being a toy store.  There's basically no employee discount (it just takes off tax and that's it). "
good,"Toys R Us is a fun place to work in, friendly people and you get to be around toys. The building is kinda small, so the break room is really small. The workplace will most likely be filled with high school kids."
good,There was chaotic disorganization within Dotcom and poor communication with Retail. The company is no longer in business (bankrupt). They are looking to resurface with some previous corporate leaders in place
good,"It was a very easy job, with incompetent management. Obviously the company ended up going bankrupt but I did kind of enjoy my time spent with the company."
good,People were quite nice. Nice shop. The manager was not nice. Very big shop. Got quite busy at times. The money we got from toys r us was ok. Payslips we hard to collect
good,"Hired for a store that ended up closing, enjoyed working with team members and customers.  Senior leadership was ok, the end of the organization could be felt by all members of management in an effort to save the company."
good,"Environment was quite busy, with an eclectic mix of customers. Management was absent often. Associates did their best to cope, even with the lack of direction."
good,I liked the coworkers but it didn't seem like some of the manager's cared about their job. Really didn't learn too much there either. I loved the products but the people not so much
good,"The company was run into the ground by leadership, and then destroyed by the liquidation firm instead of saving 30000 jobs they torched the place. Leadership was pathetic"
good,"Toys R Us prepared me with the knowledge and skills I would need to improve myself in a managerial position. The hours were long and there wasn't a lot of opportunity to advance, but the store leadership was good, the environment was fun, and seeing happy customer faces was worth the struggle."
good,"Did not care about the employees at the store "
good,Work life balance very poor as the company is no longer viable this is not an issue but if it were to comeback i would assume it will be the same. There  once was job security and loyalty to employees but as the financials got tighter the constant threats of termination were very difficult. Workload increased and labor decreased.
good,"They’ve gone out of business. Let’s just say I’m not surprised they did. Management couldn’t keep track of anyone’s schedules, and they were deliberately stealing money from paychecks."
good,"i like working there until the company went out of business, my managers for the most part were great and i enjoyed working with toys overall. i would still be working with the company if the opportunity was available"
good,It was a decent environment.  Seasonally the other team members were ok.  Management was very poor.  Workers were not taken care of.  When I was given full time after the season ended it was kind of a normal routine.  The shifts changed a lot but I did my job and stayed until the day they closed.  I enjoyed being around the children.  Helping out the parents when they couldn't find what they wanted was the best.  They were always so thankful.  It was also nice being in the same neighborhood where I lived because the customers were so glad to see a familiar friendly face.
good,"Buena experiencia y mucho aprendizaje en tienda y almacén, caja, reposición y venta."
good,"The highs and lows of this job were as follows. Great customers, okay environment, morale was usually high. Working conditions were usually normal. I mostly enjoyed fellowship with my coworkers ,and putting smiles on the customers faces."
good,Never worked enough hours but if I had a change in my schedule they would work with me. Management was alright. The hardest part about the job was working with rude customers
good,"I had a lot of fun working at this job. I did stocking, customer service and cleaning the store. It was a really fun place to work and i had a lot of fun learning how to be a good team player"
good,"Management seemed to only care about how many credit cards you signed people up for, some even got mad if you didn't ask EVERY person regardless of the customers mood. Some were fine with skipping it when someone was clearly in a rush or a negative mood, but ultimately those credit cards were the most important thing and it got pretty stressful if you didn't manage to get anyone to sign up for it. "
good,I only worked there for a month. it was okay i just had to leave because of my schooling. The boss was not my favorite person and i did not get the correct training with it being my first job and all.
good,The work was slow didn’t pay enough. Plus the managers wasn’t much of a help. It was more competitive then just work . Person wit the most signed up credit cards get a prize
good,They didn't care about you personal life. The was always favoritism as well. The pay rate was not good for what you. there was also a lot of gossip. but some of the workers were very nice
good,"This may be because they are going out of business but it wasn't the customer's that they screwed over but their employees. They would take money from them with shady explanations, promise certain things that they would never deliver, and basically use their employees."
good,"It was a fun place to work at and great coworkers. The work environment was very good, the only con for me was that they didn’t look at the availability to well, and requested off days."
good,was only a seasonal employee. didnt get hired back on due to lack of customers after holiday season. coworkers were great and the job was fairly laid back
good,"A job doesn't have to be very fun for me honestly, but this job was terrible. the manager had favorites that took breaks whenever they wanted and slacked all day but if she'd see me even smile at a co-worker she'd threaten to send me home, it was crazy. I remember I was helping a customer find something for his daughter and he couldn't make his mind up so I stayed to give him options and the pros and cons about them, the manager came up to me in the middle of talking and said I'd been talking to him for too long and I needed to move along."
good,The managers there were mostly just kept to themselves and not helpful. The store itself was chaotic and a mess. The workers there didn't care about their jobs and were overall just hanging out there and receiving a paycheck for that.
good,"Relaxed and slow paced except during seasonal. When it came to season many store managers became grumpy and mean due to the stress and responsibility. Also some workers are lazy and inconsiderate to other employees of the work that needs done at the end of each night which often led to certain people picking up the slack of others, even the store manager ."
good,"This is not a good company to work with.  There isn't too much room for advancement, training is scarce, and the overall culture of the company is on the decline."
good,"I loved my job at Babies R us.  Working with customers, and learning about product was great.  I started as a cashier and within a year and a half I worked my way to key holding supervisor.  My promotions were solely on my work ethic.  BUT with the location I am at closing corporate is not helping with the moving on from the store.  We cannot transfer to another store, we have to be terminated and then would have to reapply to another location.  Also employees at closing stores are not being given severance packages, nor are we receiving any accumulated earned time off, paid time off, and vacation paid out to us.  So anything we have saved up, we loose.  The job its self is just like any other retail position.  It is all about the customers.  Sometimes too much about the customer.  If and when we loose power we are required to stay open and accept cash payment during that time. Even if its 20 degrees outside and all entrance and exit doors are propped open because of no power."
good,Work was always really easy.I mostly work overnight so really didn't have much interaction with costumers. The hardest thing about working there was being under staffed almost all off the time.
good,Management was great and I learned how to work in customer service after being there for about 6 months. The hardest part of the job was working during the holidays.
good,"A typical day of work can range anywhere from an early morning 4am-12pm _ 6am-2pm _ 2pm-11pm depending on the weekday. Time is always allotted for preparation and closing duties. The atmosphere is bright and full of energy depending on your team and management. There is always something for you to occupy yourself with for those who prefer multitasking. It's a perfect opportunity for young teens / adults who are entering the work force for the first time as it does provide you with structure and standards needed for job culture and more importantly, team-work."
good,Working there was fun but not enough hires bc ppl don't shop for toys all year long so i found a job at graphic packaging in Perry Ga thru bison workforce
good,"It is a very fun and family friendly company. On an average day i would greet customers, be on register, and also helping satify customer needs. Managers were friendly for the most part. Overall a fun workplace however, benefits and pay is poor."
good,Clock in and you start in a certain area of the store stocking toys and removing the ones that don't belong. Answer customer question and walk them to the toys they are looking for. When store got busy help cashiering.
good,"It is definitely a diverse atmosphere, However I gave my schedule to management when I began and included my hours of availability so the could schedule me at times where I could work. I was a reliable manager and hardly ever called out but I was also a single mother. For being a toy store the management was not very family friendly. some nights I would work until 1-2am even though my shift ended at 10pm. I had a three year old who needed me home but I was told I couldn't leave until the store was completely clean at night. Cost me extra money for babysitters, and in times where my child was sick and I wasn't able to come in I was guilted because they couldn't find anyone to cover my shift even though I called out hours in advance. The pay was fine, and the events were fun, but there's a lot of lay-offs and unfair termination. I quit leaving two weeks notice, but on my last week I became ill with a stomach virus and was told not to come back."
good,they hire people to many to not give people good hours or days to work. For the simple fact that I have a great flexible schedule. They never answer the phone but they are a family thats what I like.
good,"a typical night at toys r us is stressful, fast paced, and the other employees really dont mind there own business. i learned how to stock the shelfs with the correct toy and put exactly the right amount on the shelfs. i used this hand held device they called sapphire."
good,"Workplace is good."
good,ALL WORK no one talk to no one. Employee not grandly no team work. It's a toy store it suppose to be happy and smiling faces. Managers don't care about the employee
good,Walk around assisting customers and restocking shelves with toys. During holiday season the shifts are busy and a little hectic. The most enjoyable part of the job is helping the customers to satisfaction.
good,"Great co-worker , fast paced work, great training , flexible hours, flexible when it comes to take off work , works around any type of other jobs you have"
good,"Ok, job not enough hours, no benefits for part time workers.. Working conditions are terrible. I would tell no one to come to Toys R Us. Some of the management are very nice and some are very rude."
good,Not super stressful.  Fast paced fun place to work.  Very fast and busy during the holiday season. that is the best time to pick up shifts. I started off 4 years ago just for season and I am still currently working there
good,It was fun working there but you pretty much have to teach yourself the ropes. Training should be a priority especially during the busiest time of the year. Breaks should be given in an organized manner. There were days where I didn't take any breaks.
good,"stock shelves, and cash people out at the cash register. Take inventory at the end of weekends for shipments. Working there was just an example of busy work, trying to find something to do"
good,I enjoyed Toys R Us for the most part but had a manager who was difficult at best to work with. He eventually was fired and the environment became much more positive. I determined at that time that I wanted to advance and decided to attend school to become an insurance agent. Toys R Us does a thorough criminal background check so I have always felt confident that it is a safe and good environment to shop with children.
good,"I would normally help with trucks in the morning. Unpacking the  freight,  taking it out of boxes and putting it on the shelf.  My shifts are normally at 4 in the morning and went to about 12 in the afternoon.  Management was usually Trying to play catchup with their daily tasks. The hardest part of the job was trying function at 4am and work at a fast pace."
good,Bad management and the higher ups could care less. I do the same job as an Assistant store manager and don't get compensated for the work nor do I have the opportunity to fully establish myself in the position I am in do to the lack of role clarity.
good,"I like the people i work with, but management is lacking the correct skills of what it takes to lead a team and manage people. They don't give you a sense or worth and being able to move up within the company."
good,It not a bad place just the pay isnt good and the hours are bad it just the work it self isnt hard.i work on Wednesday and Thursday i made 8.15 an hour i was a stocker
good,"workplace culture isnt the greatest. management doesnt care for workers. i learned that i was loyal to the wrong people above me. great place to work at and its fun, but gotta have the right people running the place. if not it sucks. PERIOD."
good,"The people keep you there, its a fun company to work for with product demos being done, but sometimes career advancement is very slow if you get in a store that has had managers in there for years."
good,"unorganized"
good,The manager of the store was extremely apathetic to all aspects of the employees daily routines and balance of work and home.  Store closed shortly after i left
good,"It was a good 1st job for me, it showed me how things were supposed to be done in a workplace."
good,"Management not on same page, to much tasking not enough customer service. All they want is selling credit cards. you only get 10% employee discount. work at babies r us."
good,"You were always on your feet. You stayed busy. If it was ever slow they had things for you to do always. I would go home feet were hurting, but knowing I got a good work out walking around the store paid off."
good,It was great to work there until the manager they had was very bad to work for. No compassion for staff on any level. Worked them hard with no appreciation
good,"Needs improvement as far as management, there are some employees there that have attitudes and I would never associate with because of that fact. Needs to work as a team everybody but they do not."
good,15 years of working there i enjoy the family feeling that we have demoing all the hot toys watching all the little happy faces that come in in to the store looking for their favorite toys now its time to try something new
good,Hours are few and far between. Corporate has each employee doing the work load of 3 people but won't fire the people that stand around doing nothing. People are not held responsible for their lack of work ethic and the people that work their butts off are not given the hours or pay they deserve. Security issues make it an unsafe work environment at times.
good,toys r us is an alright place to work. the hours suck. start off you can get a good bit of hours but they continue to hire people and it cuts down on your hours. which in return cuts down on your check making only 7.25 an hour.
good,"TRU is a typical retail environment with high turnover. I joined TRU to earn extra money at night after having baby number two. They spread my 20 hours over 5 days, and I never saw my family. Not much room for advancement."
good,"I enjoyed my job here got to meet a lot of people,learned how to put furniture,toys and bikes together and just loved everything about it and loved it was a fast pased job!"
good,"Going into this job, we were offered a lot of training.  Always growing our skills and knowledge in the department that we worked in.  Good health benefits and vacation time."
good,Does not provide the financial security needed to live on. It was an OK job but nothing like the image they portray during interview and training......
good,Overall this job wasn't terrible. It would be ideal for a highschool or college student. You are unlikely to move up and the pay isn't great. They are also really bad about communicating with their associates.
good,"A day in the life for a typical employee can be anywhere from working out freight to checking out guests. Toys R Us is very demanding with their metrics. Credit card sign ups and warranties are their big ones. It's hard to both please your customer - not aggravating them and make the company happy with how aggressive they want you to be with these programs. I say to corporate, focus on having great prices and the best selection. People don't show up for the high interest rate credit card. Management varies. You'll have managers who are very hands on and great with communication and then you'll have the complete opposite. "
good,"Good friendly environment,the hardest part was how busy it gets around the holidays.Good management.the most enjoyable moment is making people happy and putting a smile on their face"
good,"the company is poorly managed. It needs to improve on delegation and communication, There are  too much turnover employees and the employees do not feel valued."
good,I worked the graveyard shift doing stocking. The hours sucked because it was graveyard but it is what it is. Easy job overall
good,a typical day at work is more or less stressful dependent on the department you may work in. the job I do is the most stressful a non manager has to do. ranging from cleaning to trash removal and customer assistance to reports and filing and order management.
good,"Come in well prepared to work, always a daily assignment and what management wants done for the day. Aways focus on completing your tasks as well as attending to every customer and their needs, sometimes it may be difficult to balance both. What Ive learned is no matter what, the customers are the most important thing, making them happy is key, always go above and beyond. Management clearly sets their standards and expects everyone to uphold them. Management team is firm but fair and will work with you. Hardest part is definitely trying to mutlitask and dealing with customers and various issues, but in the end nothing beats seeing a smile on a kids face when you find them and give them the toy they want."
good,"Fun job, people friendly but busy environment especially around the holidays. Low pay and not enough benefits, would recommend as a part-time job."
good,It is hard to have any true motivation to come to work for this company. If you are a good employee you get paid very little and work the job of 4 other people.
good,It's good if you like dealing with kids all the time. It was fine working there at 18 but I would not work there again...especially during the holiday season.
good,I worked there for about 3 months and it was not a good work experience. No training and too much work drama that was uncalled for. There was one good manager and the rest were lazy and experienced. The co-workers were under trained and lazy.
good,"Working at Toys 'R' Us as a seasonal employee was a mixed experience for me, with many different pros and cons. The pay was great with many opportunities for over-time, however the management were rude sometimes, and seemed to pick ""favorites"" which they would treat differently from other employees. Approaching and talking to managers and supervisors would sometimes be difficult as they would express very little care about HR and personnel problems. The work was fairly easy, and there was a large diversity in the workplace, with different races and genders. Having very little professional work experience they provided me with good beginning work experience."
good,"For me, working here was ok, but it got terrible overtime. This store was located in a ""rich environment,"" so 98% of the customers were those ""I'm better than you"" types of people. They could get REALLY rude. There was also a manager that was a HUGE nuisance. The co-workers were very nice & the environment was great, but the customers and that ONE manager just made it so hard to work there."
good,Didn't care for the environment or the workers. Learned a lot And enjoyed customer interaction but coworkers made work feel like high school.
good,Work here was like a competition with the other mates. It was a busy place because i was working in christmas and it is a toy store.
good,Toys r us is a up to beat job. everyone gets along with everyone easy job to work not much is required of you. Mangers look out for their employees. H
good,"Stock sales floor with new merchandise. "
good,"My typical day consisted of me at the cash register doing transactions for customers and if I didn't have any customers I'd help with restocking. I would also walk around my are nearby the register, to make sure my area was clean. At the end of day, I'd take my register drawer to management for counting down."
good,"Initial work in back of house and with loading team was very satisfactory--team members were pleasant, professional, and forthcoming with advice. "
good,Toys R Us used to be fun to work at. They use to care about their employees. Now they don't. One of the days I was working I got a call saying my grandma passed away and they wouldn't let me leave work or even take a 10 minute break to gather myself. They run their employees into the ground and they use to never be like that. I think they could use a change of heart and go back to making it fun. Since I worked there a lot of people have left the store due to the management.
good,i worked at Cannington toys r us and the management was so bad. They would literally hire people then fire them 3 weeks later without notice and their excuse was that they went over budget
good,I learned a lot. I learned most of my selling approaches from this company. Also met a lot of great people. Became employee of the month for outstanding work ethics and following business code of conducts.
good,"Mi rutina laboral en este puesto trataba de ordenar y reponer juguetes, y a veces cajera, era un trabajo que me gustaba ya que era trato con niñ@s y eso es mi punto fuerte, referente a mi jefe muy mal la verdad,era una persona muy fría para sus empleados, tengo que decir todo lo contrario con mis compañeros; la parte difícil, era meterse en el almacén que era super reducido de espacio y agobiante, y poco más porque solo estuve una temporada de navidad."
good,Some times when the store was swamped the managers would just hide in the office and just watch everyone try to take care of customers. They were pretty lazy but honestly working there wasn't all bad besides that.
good,There are many mixed reviews on this place if one were to scour the internet looking for them. The locations are different therefore management is as well. Being a cashier is the easiest way to learn customer service skills. Management is overworked and underpaid. Everyone is overworked and underpaid for a less than living wage. The hardest part of the job is getting along with the employees you need to get a long with. Popularity matters in the location I worked in. I enjoyed seeing the kids and helping parents make the right choices based on experience.
good,"A typical day at work is fast paced quite. Really have not learned much that I didn't already know. Management is really aggravating apparently I called and quit, but I never called any manager saying I quit so very unorganized. There is nothing hard about this job unless your just not use to night shift work. Don't really enjoy much just to the fact that it is not what I really want to be doing with my life right now."
good,"This place typically has a fun environment and there's a lot of opportunity for growth. I learn new things every day about the job, the tasks, the costumers, the products, corporate, and more. It is very fast-paced, especially in season, but very simple. It's not a hard job and it's easy to adapt to."
good,I learned a lot doing Merchandising and customer care and had very helpful co workers. Helping customers with baby goods was really nice as I also have a baby at home.
good,"I was hired to be trained for the Black Friday rush along with quite a few others. Everyday was learning something new and fine tuning what we had learned the days before. A constant quick paced environment that I thoroughly enjoyed. My co-workers were great and the management did the best they could with scheduling so many new hires. I loved working with the customers who were more often than not, proud parents purchasing a reward for their child's accomplishments and were eager to tell you about them. Unfortunately the Holiday season had ended and the store had to let go of all of its new hires but its an experience I'll remember forever."
good,"It was a nice job but was very difficult to please both of my jobs at the same time. I tried to be as dependable as I could, but in the end I was forced to quit there."
good,I enjoyed my position with Toys R Us; whether it was helping that customer find that special gift or helping that child purchase their toy.
good,"I worked mainly the customer service desk and cash registers. The pay wasn't great and the advancement for a higher position wasn't available. Generally you were hired for one solitary purpose, to get more numbers. Though it was a small position, fellow coworkers were always friendly, welcoming, and always managed to make the work day fun."
good,"stocking shelves, working in the back and helping customers. I learned how to mass organize. The management wasn't the greatest but we got by. Also there were so many co-workers, some you get along with and others you don't. Hardest and easiest part of the job is working with children."
good,Flexible schedule. Friendly people. Management was a little unprofessional. Overall a pretty decent job. Position was close to home. Seasonal position.
good,Great beginner job. If looking to advance once employed is very hard. If looking to start in management make sure you apply and are hired on as management. Otherwise the process is extremely hard to move forward. Decent company and benefits. Pay is average for retail.
good,working for tremayne was hard work you were always made to feel you were not good enough in ther sense of not wearing designer clothes or not losing enough weight and such like.
good,"There are day where there is high stress (i.e. difficult customers or irritable co-workers), but there are also times where there is no other place I'd rather be. The hardest part of the day is trying to please a customer who is very uncooperative, but knowing that you have helped this person is the most rewarding part of the job."
good,"It's a fun workplace geared towards helping people find the right toys for the children in their life."
good,"Unfortunately, there was a very large turnover rate, which made it difficult to tend to guests needs because of the need to train new associates on duties and product knowledge etc. Turnover rate also included management as well. Co-workers were very fun and welcoming with answers to questions."
good,"Overall a decent job. If you work hard and pick up extra shifts and get along with upper management you can succeed."
good,everyday i learned something new and enjoyed being around children.  i gained more exprience behind a register and on the floor organizing shelves properly and multitasking. my co-workers were feisty but easy to work with. The hardest part of the job was staying awake during late nights. Other than that it was fun and easy working there and obtaining more experience everyday.
good,A typical day at work consist of bay audits and stock functions aswell of taking care of department functions as well of all shipping and receiving daily duties and also customer support.
good,"I was hired on as a seasonal cashier and they decided to keep me essentially because I would show up for my shifts, work hard, and sign up people for credit cards like crazy! "
good,It was ok they gave little hours giving you like four hour shifts. It just kept getting worse and worse. It got so bad that they only where going to give me 9Hrs this week .
good,"I was there for only seasonal. In the beginning it was problem as it was only my 2nd job and the management was all off. I did basics of cleaning the bathrooms, sweeping the store, and cart retrieval along with customer service. There wasn't much hard part of the job itself"
good,"It was a decent job. There was no room for advancement. I worked there for nearly 7 years and never felt like I was compensated for the work I put in. You were not able to ask for time off during November and December due to the Holiday season, which is unfortunate because you could never make plans in advance for family and friendly activities. I could see certain days to be blocked off, but the entire month(s) seemed a bit ridiculous."
good,"There is a lot of lifting as a stock crew member, so if you have a bad back, heart, knees, etc. this is likely not the position for you. Staff are hard on you, especially if you're new, and especially if you're young. Some staff will be harder on you than others."
good,"The overnight work environment is great, and is a great place if you're looking for seasonal work. Not to good for single people with families if you are hired permanent, unless you are in management."
good,"warm environment, super friendly. co-workers are nice, management is laid back. a typical day is clocking in, ringing up orders, help customers around store if needed. most enjoyable part is the smile on child face when you find the last toy in stock."
good,"good job "
good,Provided excellent customer service; Unload truck and organize items; assist guest with purchases; Replenish and organize Warehouse; Stock store with items from truck and warehouse; Handle and Retrieve online orders. And direct employees of job tasks
good,"at first it was the best job, after new management staff i really hated it"
good,"I had lots of fun with both the people who shopped and worked there. there was plenty to do and a great place for someone to learn skills such as customer interaction, handling cash as a cashier, sales approaches and much more. you do not normally get many hours and the pay is low, but chances of upward advancement can be great if you are motivated. great job for younger or entry level applicants."
good,"Helped customers find what they were looking for, stocked shelves, assembled furniture, and checked people out. One of my first jobs, learned about customer service, time management, and hard work."
good,Management and co-workers were cool when i was working there.
good,I had a good experience with Toys R Us. I enjoyed working the cash register around Christmas Time because of all the children's smiling faces.
good,"This was a easy job too, just that every employee was easily replaceable it seemed like. I learned that management did care about their employees though, as I got a gift from management for working hard all the way through the holidays."
good,Enjoyed helping customers find the perfect gift for their babies and knowing that they were satisfied!
good,worked for Toys R Us for one year. It was fun to work there but the pay was not good. Good job to start with when you get out of high school
good,Not a lot of guidance and underqualified store manager overnight hours good co workers
good,"A typical day at work started either on the sales floor or register, I learned about a lot of different baby products and safety issues. Management was ok and my employees were nice. The hardest part of the job was all the heavy loading and the most enjoyable was learning more about baby products."
good,"Took pictures of people walking into Toys ""R"" Us, by the Ferris wheel, and by the giant T-Rex."
good,"Maybe its not the company itself, its the management of a specific store. Short breaks, not enough employees to cover a shift. Managers are power trip."
good,Great place to work if you are only interested in part time with little to know advancement. Great for first job or post retirement job.
good,love the environment the workers were team players. Manager were very organized and value your time and effort.
good,"a typical day at work was move toys around and promote new products"
good,"Every day im doing constant work that I was NEVER trained to do, and im not getting paid nearly enough to do it. I get disciplined for doing these tasks incorrectly aswel (note these are tasks no one was trained for to begin with)."
good,Toys R Us claims to be a fun a rewarding place to work. This is not the case at all.
good,A typical day at work would be helping guests with there baby registries. I learned to be friendly with people who may be rather difficult for no apparent reason. My co workers here were great and almost like family. The hardest part of the job would be the low pay and the most enjoyable would be making long lasting friendships.
good,This place was very unorganized and had lots of drama within the inner circles of the company.
good,"A fun job, with lots of enjoyment. The pay isn't the greates and it takes forever to be promoted"
good,this job is a good part time job or a way to pick up some extra cash
good,A typical day at work was the same work duties ever day accept  for the holiday season. I learned how to be a leader & to problem solve without any assists from management. My co-workers were usually young High School students with not much working experience. The hardest part of the job sometimes was customer service. The most enjoyable part of the job was the feeling of accomplishment after completing a large task>
good,"I worked during the Christmas Season soo it was very busy and very fast paced environment. Management was on top of the job all the time keeping everything productive. Hardiest part of the job was  Finding items by product numbers on the boxes, i got the hang of it after 2 weeks but still pretty hard. I learned  to to stack boxes to where you can fit more on one rack"
good,"Demanding job, long hours.. Management was a zoo, changing guidelines and quotes almost weekly."
good,"i gained customer service expereience"
good,"I worked part time for this place so a typical day at work for me was very short. As soon as I would show up I would get started with the aisles I was assigned. I would make sure that everything was neat and well organized fix labels and clean the floors. After I fixed my area I would proceed to do some re-shop, re-shop is when you go around the store looking for items that don't belong in that certain area and taking it back to its area. Also throughout my duties I would also provide customer service. My co-workers were very quiet wouldn't say much but it was still a good place to work at. there really was no hard part of this job for me it was all smooth sailing. The easiest part of this job would be everything, at least for me keeping customers happy was a great experience."
good,"it was a good seasonal job and would recommend for anyone looking for part time, seasonal work"
good,"Toys R Us starts at a low rate of pay, which makes sense for a cashiers position. However, after working there for years and having my responsibilities doubled and tripled, I am no longer receiving appropriate compensation for the work that I do. "
good,"Toys R US.com  was a nice company to work for but no room to expand..  Work duties was different daily, from QA to QC or Lead if needed.. Working for this company was a blessing, it show me the way to become a Lead in the industry.  The hardest part of the job was when the full time hours started dropping weekly until eventually the close down "
good,"big environment, lots to do, enjoyable providing a service to the public, learnt a lot about different items in detail, new launching of products "
good,i've worked in three locations and only one was ok to work for
good,"Typical day at work consists of greeting all the customers as they walk in and through the store. Managment is very well together as well as the other co-workers there. The hardest part of working at BRU is trying to get all the projects done in one shift, but when they are completed it is a great weight lifted off of your shoulders! My personal favorite part of the job is seeing all the different families come through and all the little children running around having a good time in the toy section."
good,"I helped expectant mothers register with the baby registry. Let them know the benefits, about the TRU/BRU credit card, rewards card, and how to use coupons. Provided information about the various departments, what is available in the store, current promotions, etc. Restocked and fronted product shelves every night, vacuumed, restocked BR desk, helped in other departments. Co-workers were helpful. The only thing I didn't do is work the register because I didn't receive proper training to do so, so I was uncomfortable being assigned to the register only when we got super busy and customers had numerous/mixed coupons. So that was the hardest part of the job. The most enjoyable part of the job was registering and helping the new mothers/mothers to be and seeing how appreciative they are."
good,At Babies 'R' Us you learn a lot about complete guest satisfaction and time management. 
good,"This job was a typical retail job.Keep store tidy and clean,assist customers,and work on cash registers. Management was fair, employes were cool people for the most part. There was nothing too challenging about the job."
good,"Perform inventory of furniture stock, verify proper signage of products. Assist guests with registries in-person and via telephone. Management is fair and the co-workers are the best part of the job. The toll on your body will be high if you aren't in top physical condition. Lots of bending down, reaching, ladder use etc."
good,"good co-workers, manager had a nice handle on job. Was only there for a few weeks for a seasonal job, had twenty seasonal employees with only five possible full time opportunities after the holidays"
good,"This was my introduction to the corporate american retail working world. It was about what I had expected -- actually, worse. First off, we were paid minimum wage, which is acceptable. However, I ended up, after working for one and a half months, earning a total of about 650 dollars. Here is why: sometimes you would come in to work to find that your schedule, without notice being given to you, had completely changed. You thought you would be working on these days at these hours, but not anymore -- and it would change ALL THE TIME."
good,This is a nice company to start out. I just graduated from college and looking to move forward with different career opportunities.
good,A typical work day would consist of finding out who the manager was that day. Every day or so the manager would change. So you never knew who was in charge. Then once you found out where you were put you did your job. I learned about the different toys for different ages so that I could assist customers in finding the right products for their child. I enjoyed working with the seasonal crew. The job was easy so I can't say there was a hard part. The most enjoyable part would be looking at the new products that came in and knowing the sales a few days before anyone else did so I could get ready to buy them.
good,"not so busy at all times. learned more on customer service. fun out- going co-workers. working there is fun because it is a place for kids to shop but there is always a ""but""."
good,"provide quality costumer services, while assisting customers with merchandise throughout the store."
good,Store Managers are not family oriented and could care less about their supervisors.
good,"Low pay and lack of workers to do the job, but the only good thing I can think of is the experience"
good,Nice company opportunity for growth. Hours pick up during season. Room for advancement. Close knit work environment.
good,The management staff there were highly unreasonable about certain things at times and frustrating to work with. Not very helpful. They didn't care to work with you on scheduling issues or care if you had other things going on in your personal life. Associates were a mix of old and young people. The Christmas season in retail as we all know in a toy store is crazy and the hours are long.
good,Negative company culture with poor compensation. Great experience hiring seasonal employees and orientation training
good,Typical day is 10-14 hours.
good,A typical day at work was hectic. Maybe because it was around christmas time but the store was unorganized and unkempt. It was so crowded around that season.
good,Compare disputed merchandise with original requisitions and information from invoices. Refer unresolved customer grievances to designated departments for further investigation.
good,They literally expect their employees to run a marathon to get tasks done while running a store with only five employees total in the store. My tenure with the company I witnessed the hours being cut in half in a four year time frame. Sales were great the entire time as well. I was in management and everyone worked long hours off the clock or the salary members were either working 30ish hours or straight 40 and would not help out the hourly management.
good,It was a great place just that they base your hours on certain things they want you to get and that is not fair. The pay is really not good even if you have experience they do not pay much.
good,The people make it woth it for the most part its what keeps you going. The job can be thankless at times. that said i like helping customers and i like to work hard so it doe suit me.
good,"Hours are not enough to make a lot of cash, its alright only if you work full-time, its basically an average job"
good,"manerger was nice,staff is kool store was big,hours was okay,busy store,"
good,I loved the place and helping the customers. The management was too overbearing. The pay could have been better.
good,Toys R Us isn't a place for people who are just trying to get by unless your going to make it a career choice. It's more geared toward the younger set not the older worker set. I can't say I hated it because everyday I went to work I felt like a kid in a candy store. The management was plagued with the normal problems that besiege any workforce from corporate demands. This job is cool if your in high school and just looking to get your feet wet. For an old timer like myself Toys R Us doesn't fit the bill do to the lack of hours and benifits but I guess that's I'm retooling my skill sets and I will say This much I am thankful to them for at lease giving me a chance after being out of work for so long.
good,The Team members that I worked with always gave 100% and I valued there commitment to me and the task at hand.
good,Great opportunity to help the customers find the item that will make their children extremely happy. Dealing with the kids is the highlight of working here.
good,"I worked seasonally, during Christmas at Toys R Us, and while it was a busy store, I had to remember that there was no guarantee I would stay on after the Christmas months. You had to multitask, up selling was a big thing, selling products of the week, store cards in order to maintain reoccurring customers. IT was a fun job but there was no stability there as the hours of people kept on after Christmas were less than 20 hrs a week. I nor any one I know can live off minimum wage and 20 hrs a week shifts."
good,"On paper Toys R Us looks like a great company but it's very hard to climb the ladder because if a manager doesn't see you working hard, it's like you weren't working at all."
good,"I learned all cash register duties including cash, debit and credit transactions, as well as redeeming gift cards and issuing gift receipts. I learned how to piece and face shelves."
good,The job was good but the company valued getting people to sign up for credit cards too much. I learned so much that it became easier for them to use me for different positions when people called out. I wouldn't have a problem if my paycheck reflected that.
good,Toys was a cool company. I wasn't there long due to just being hired for seasonal. The employees were cool for the most part. Management didn't know what was going on or how to handle things for the most part and constantly became overwhelmed.
good,Although it was seasonal and nice it wasn't a job I wanted to work at for a long time. To work well at fast speed and paid well for the long hours to live off of.
good,I was made to feel out of place with certain members of staff including the management training was rubbish and as the systems were old and didn't work at times they kept crashing
good,"In the beginning it was a wonderful place but then it became very boring and stressful, the way we received our schedule was so behind we had to call the store in order to know when we are working which I think could have been better"
good,"The work was as expected of retail work. Playing with the kids through the store was probably the best thing about this job. I had a lot off shift flexibility, which helped me during the school year."
good,A typical day at work would consist of checking my department for anything that could be stocked up and then grabbing the needed stock to fill my shelves. Once done i would then break down my boxes and put them in the compactor. from here i would then proceed to price items around the store with missing price tags.
good,To be completely honest I didn't mind working at Toys R Us; the main issue is that they were closing the one near me. It was a very laid back atmosphere aside from the holiday season. The work was very simple and mindless.
good,Flexible scheduling for students. I enjoyed working for this company however the pay is not all that great. If you are looking for holiday part-time work this is a good place to start.
good,I held a small position there for a small time. It was seasonal only at Christmas time. It was fun people I worked with were nice and who doesn't like toys. Yes I am a kid at heat. One of my favorite things about working there were the smiling faces of children when they came into that store to get a toy.
good,For the most part the people were easy to work with. With the great amount of high school aged workers it was more of a relaxed environment. Sales focus with loyalty and credit and other add-ons.
good,I think Toys R Us needed to hire people with better customer service skills. I noticed employees didnt acknowledge customers or even smile. I really enjoyed working at Toys R Us even though they hired me for a short time for closing the store. I always had a smile and I acknowledged the customers. I gave that great customer experience so they would more likely comebavk and shop.
good,"over all it was a good place to work mostly young people "
good,it was great while it lasted. I enjoyed my coworkers until they left when the store started closing. it was fun seeing kids excited to be in the store
good,This company has been closed for business and does not compete in the Baby and Toy industry as of 2017. Toys R Us could experience a comeback after a regrouping period and financial restructure.
good,I worked there as a seasonal  their  work environment was fine. It was a very hectic time tho a lot of choas. But i believe they are no longer in business now.
good,Toys r us was a fast pasted working experience as a cashier. taught me time management. I also did stocking which taught me about a clean work area. loved it.
good,"This was my side job when my main was getting slow work around the end of the year. My main purpose was to gather toys and supplies for customers who ordered online, but I occasionally had other duties as well."
good,"From 10:00 at night overnight stocking  30 min lunch break ,nice and respectful crew members and crew manager then get at 6:00 That morning clean your area"
good,I enjoyed working there management and employees very friendly. It was a very fast paced job that required way more time then I could give. Was sorry when they went out of business
good,Toys R Us had a very relaxed environment to work in and the people were very friendly.  It seemed very much like a family because it was always pleasant coming to work.
good,"no one did their work, pushed it onto others , most of the people didnt know how to do their job. couldnt go outside  on a break to smoke a cigarette."
good,"They're out of business now, so it doesn't really matter. But they were a nice enough first job for someone straight out of high school. A little pressure, but not too much."
good,Toys r us is gone which was a sad day when we closed our doors. I was given an opportunity to learn a new role and advance my career opportunities. The manager was very good to work with and was overall a good job
good,Big Store Experience always helps to increase knowledge of Retail business. I have learned a lot about business as a mass retailer. Overall its a good experience.
good,Depending on who you're working with your shift could go smoothly and quick or dreadful. The management was a bit snappy but always tried to get us out of there by closing time.
good,it was good for making kids happy when they left with what they bought but the management was poor. if you didnt get credit cards your hours were cut done.
good,"Working at Toys R Us was fun for a while. I would've stayed with that employer, but I was told that I was hired as a regular employee and that after the holidays I would still be scheduled as a regular associate. Once I found out that I was only seasonal, I had to look for other options."
good,"not much to say after they closed down. it was a great place to work, good people and were willing to work with your schedule if need be. When they were closing is when people stopped caring"
good,"I worked as a cashier and shelf stocker for Toys R Us for at least 6-7 months. I didn't mind working at Toys R Us the only main issues I had; was the second head manager of the store wasn't understanding, a lot of the customers were rude and let their children run around the store and cause messes; which past employees and I had to stay an extra hour or 2 after closing hours to re-organized the entire store. Plus, the employee discount wasn't great either. Overall, I can say I at least had fun working with my store managers and employees."
good,"I very much enjoyed working for his company.  It was a sad day when we had to close the doors.  TRU bought BRU and that was the demise of both companies."
good,Management was extremely rude and instead of telling you that something was done incorrectly(after having no explanation) they would all talk about how terrible you were while you would work your shift! Terrible environment for my particular store but if you had other decent people working it became barible.
good,"company was a fun place to work at around christmas time thats when it was the busiest,  a little underpaid  but a great company to work for in all. They have now since went out of buisness"
good,"I worked the overnight shift. I was responsible for a stocking and at merchandising several aisles. endcaps and sections of the store.  Ensured that the sales floor was set to  floor plan specifications."
good,"While working there was easy, there is zero room for advancement, you're over worked, asked to do much more than what is necessary for entitled guests. However all that aside, if you just didn't care and did your job, got in, got out. It was a breeze. It's a shame it closed down. I would've of stayed while looking for other opportunities. It wasn't a bad paycheck. Just nowhere near enough to support a family or saving for a car or anything like that."
good,"A typical day of work consisted of walking your department to unsure it's clean and organized. Restocking items that needed to be replenished or ""flexing and filling"" the area with like product."
good,"It could have been better; however, it could have been worse.  The company did go bankrupt so that shows you how well it did.  Coworkers were great though."
good,"the crysis hit them so hard everybody no the consequences"
good,Most people that work here are in high school and they’re given hours during the Holiday Season that take away from full time workers that have bills and kids.
good,Company suffered from quick growth on 70's & 80's. Then  management was slow to react to a changing world. Major blunders in building a web presents.  Working with the other employees was enjoyable experience
good,All Toys R Us stores are closing. Its a great place to work but after 19 years I am in need to get a new job. This company filled bankruptcy. We did have some great times.
good,"Management is terrible, the actual job is fun and very hands on if you can get past the management then it’s the place for you. You do get some what promotions but never the pay raise"
good,I was a cashier and worked the return desk. It was fun and I learned a lot about baby products that I didn't know. I was able to put together a lot of the displays while I worked the return desk. I also worked at the baby registry desk. That was also fun because I was able to help the customers pick items out that they needed for their baby and answered all the questions that they had.
good,"Typical day at Toys R Us includes planning team member assignments, giving goals, reviewing merchandising standards, providing feedback to team members, and interacting with customers."
good,"Archaic management style built on nepotism and  favoritism. Constant restructuring, outsourcing and outside consultants killed the business. Lack of training, lack of documented work."
good,This was not the ideal job I wanted I did get stressed out that they wanted us to push credit cards. When most people dont want to get any more credit cards or any at all. I thought this would be a fun place to work but got reprimanded for not reaching a certain quota in credit cards. I was given some cheap promotional sunglasses when I put in my two weeks in.
good,it was a fun place to work because of my coworkers. unfortunately the store is closing so I don't see myself recommending this as a long term job to anyone
good,"Good for a part time position, and kids getting out of high school/college that need something immediately. Good way to start getting your feet wet in the work industry, and to show you can handle different attitudes, and different people."
good,realicé las prácticas allí como mozo de almacen y reponedor
good,"Good and bad days. Customer service is rough. Management sucked at my location, but I worked at other locations that were the bomb.com, so just because my store sucked does not mean the whole company sucked. Also, they're officially out of business, so that's really the only reason I'm not recommending them :p"
good,"I wouldn't recommend this to a friend...can't really recommend it to anyone, they're going out of business.  But the funny thing is, I've worked for this company for years and will be a worker until my store closes down, but because they're going out of business, the employee discounts can no longer be used.  Way to treat your workers."
good,go n punch in.   ask the manager what needs to be done.  than go and grab a U-boat and pack it out  ring up  a few guest and than run around trying to keep the store clean.
good,I typically just put away toys since it was busy around Christmas time. It was chill and was not stressful even though it was a seasonal time during Christmas.
good,The place can be kind of cool. Although the management has several active managers ranging from fantastic to abysmal. The job often was strained between the hour limitations set by corporate resulting in days when we were severely understaffed. Overall poor job with a few pros that were severely outweighed.
good,they dont teach you anything i had 30 minutes of training an then i was by myself also all th mangers get annoyed when they have to help you with something and i called off because my uncle died and they said my job comes first
good,I guess it was pretty cool don't do it if you don't like toys. One of the managers was really cool didn't really like the others. I didn't really find a single enjoyable thing about the job aside from getting paid. Good first job though.
good,"I spent most of my days sitting at my register waiting for people to come up and relieve me of my boredom. When I wasn't standing at my register, I was straitening things on the shelves. I did not enjoy working here, and the day I was out of there was a relief."
good,it was an easy job but management was a mess. they sometimes ask for too much mainly on the holidays such as staying in for an extra hour or so which can be a pain.
good,They didn't have nothing but a filthy locker room and disrespectful staff hardest part was finding items on my own and being ignored when asking for help\
good,"My role was stacking shelves with stocks and reporting anything that needed reporting, I also had to assist customers with any needs they had during their shopping experience."
good,"overall a good company to work for, most of the year was a slow season, and hours were scarce , when its busy it was a good place to work, management was very understanding"
good,"Working nights at toys r us wasn't really my thing, my coworkers were decent though. Just wasn't my cup of tea, I really wanted the daytime stocker shift as opposed to overnights."
good,"Hired as a temp to get through the Christmas season.  Due to the rush of customers, there was no time for proper training.  A training video was shown prior to starting, but once you were on the floor, you were on your own."
good,"To many complaints of unfair treatment, not always acknowledged for work. The people who show more dedication are not rewrded, when those who slack are. Favoring of workers is a big issue."
good,"My position was an overnight one, so we would head to the back, sort out and organize the back, then take what needed to go out and put it on the sales floor. We would also clean the place after it closed. It was a nice environment because there's no customer's coming in. But it is an overnight position. So take that as you will."
good,"I had an overall great experience in my 2 years at Toys R Us, some management weren't too nice but you can make a lot of great friends! I would go back if I could!"
good,You spend the majority of the day cleaning up from the night shift putting up stock that they didn't get a chance to put out scanning in merchandise putting up bicycles putting away Power Wheels clean up the warehouse helping customers to their cars answering customers questions just a very good environment
good,"Toys r us is a wonderful place to work but it does have some downs it pays less than I would like, and it's benefits are horrible but you get to work with some of the best coworkers in the world."
good,"Worked on call and seasonal for most of the time. No major issues with the job , besides getting off on time. Sometimes we'd get scheduled hours like 10pm-7am. That's cool , but some days we would have to stay longer. Some days I couldn't leave on time"
good,"I was hired in temporarily on seasonal basis to help with this employer. The tasks of the position were pretty simple and straightforward as follows:"
good,A typical day at work consisted of organizing products or helping a customer. I learned how to socialize and develop people skills. Management wasn't around too much. The hardest part of the job was transportation. The most enjoyable part of the job was working with my team.
good,OK place to work. Not great pay and hours are limited outside of Christmas time. Co workers are great but its a fast paced working environment especially if your on truck.
good,"This was a last resort. You'd apply for a position like this in September and hope they'd keep you on after inventory in January/February for a full time position, but it would rarely happen."
good,i was seasonal worker but while i was there i think it was a nice place to work. it was down the street from the mall but the company is no longer in the area i worked at
good,"Too much push to sell add on item such as protection plans and assemblies. To hard a push to get customers to sign up for credit. Customers do not want all the questions that are asked at checkout. They want to get in, find what they need, pay a comparative price to other retailers and get out. Too many cuts to staff and hours. It was an enjoyable place to work years ago but has changed dramatically in the past several years."
good,"I learned a lot of things while working there, but most of it I had to figure out on my own. Never got much training from my senior co-workers. Management wasn't that great. They expect too much out of employees with little pay, as well as not listening to the feedback you give when they ask for it. Supervisors were better managers than the managers themselves. Work environment was stressful during Christmas season, but outside of it, it was pretty slow and balanced. Never expect to do ONLY your job, you will be expected to do a lot more than just your job description. The best part about working there was being able to meet different people and network a little. It's an okay part-time job, but I wouldn't recommend seeking a career with the company. They say it's easy to move up, but I've seen management give a higher position to a far less experienced worker."
good,"First work in Uk so good for learning english, but it was a zero contract so not a lot of work."
good,Toys R Us is a great place to work for people looking to build there work experience. Throughout the week it is pretty relaxed while on the weekends it is very hectic. Management somewhat care about you at times and team members are great to be around.
good,Great job if you;re just starting out. You won't make a ton of money but you're not meant too. Everyday is easy aside from the holiday season. Aside from that great starting job.
good,"Co-workers were exceptional and environment was fun yet management wasn't. Supervisor was considered a bully and pushy, manager would verbally abuse his employees. Guilt tripped you for having a fever. Would have you work until last minute for lunch break. Wouldn't keep on top of who was being scheduled the next day. Would get upset if requested to leave early due to legal reasons (ex making you stay longer around 2am but your scheduled at 7am)"
good,"This is a good job for a teen. not sure if they even exist anymore but if they do, not the best job. My experience was not pleasant and I would never work there again."
good,it was fun for a time.    dead on off season and crazy during the holidays.      good for a part time job but if you want to make a carrer there good luck.
good,"Over all, some of the management are nice and others are just rude an manipulative. Ok if your ill but overwork you. For exmaple, You will be doing the supervisors job when ur just a normal employee and the managemnt are nice but do not want to the work."
good,I'm grateful for the job opportunity which taught me alot about alot and still learning. I think morale is low and the will cause low performance of employees who feel unappreciated.
good,Some days you walk in and its busy and some days its slow. There are always kids screaming which can get annoying. The managers are cool as well as the employees.
good,I thought it would be a better environment than it was. Not as playful and cheerful of an atmosphere. Did not see eye to eye with management and how they handled situations within the store.
good,"I really enjoyed the people i worked with and a lot of the customers. (a few were off putting but thats retail for you). the main problem i had was head office telling us we were not selling enough bags or giant pencils etc as with most retail chains these days. but they seemed to put small things really high on the priority over selling actual products like bikes and games consoles. i heard things are a bit different now, but caution it is a frustrating atmosphere."
good,The toys were gray to be around however the management was not.  Very unhelpful when it came to teaching and 'training ' the new employees.  I learned most of my job on my own.
good,Seasonal job so I cant really critique. Overall fun experience. lot to learn. opportunities to learn other job functions are available. Hours are amazing during the holidays otherwise have a second job if you have bills.
good,"It's ok for your first job, but wouldn't make a career out working there. I enjoyed working there when I was in school, but needed to find a better paying job once done with school."
good,"Un día típico sería empezar a colocar la mercancía tanto en almacén como en tienda, reponer y atender al público."
good,"It was a fun job, management wasnt that great. The pay was very low for the demand that they want you to work for. I think will be good for high schooler or someone that going to have a baby or have a young baby to help buy the products."
good,"Pay is relatively low, but fair in relation to the work you will do. Company prices everything too high which can be annoying especially when that is all customers talk about, which in turn will leave you price matching everything. Hours are very low and sometimes sporadic and unfair."
good,typical day is helping kids find what they are looking for things they see on tv and cashiering returns ect  i learned patients here   hardest parts of the day is aggervated parents when we dont have something they need working at a big toy store and helping the adluts nd kids find what they
good,"Job pace dependent on the season, which can mean fewer hours than needed or more than desired.  Customer service is a high priority at all levels.  Management can be strict about being on time and taking days off."
good,"Though I was able to climb the in-store management ladder quickly, there were an awful lot of managers/supervisors and all were saying different goals and rules. I was given room to hone in my Customer Service skills and was constantly pushed to improve, and help improve others, which was great."
good,It is your typical retail job.  The only time you get hours is during Christmas and other Holidays where they shop.  This is okay for someone who doesn't have bills or as a second job.
good,"Hours were okay, with start times being the same M-F weekly, but hours could still vary. Management was decent in certain areas, but most were under-experienced."
good,"cant recommend working in such a place that uses gossip to lower the esteem of staff and punishes people with children by slashing hours, youll find a better job"
good,a well balanced facility to handle the needs of the consumer. I was a seasonal employee but let go afterwards even though is was the my proficient worker there
good,"It's a great first job for someone looking for some quick intro to retail, but it's not a career move. They can't pay very well for obvious reasons but the managers are nice and they're willing to teach you the basics."
good,I only worked there as a Christmas temp so there was no progression within the company and they were also not looking to take anyone on full time after the Christmas period
good,"Good place to work, but does not seem to have many ways to move in the company. the store work for seem to be unorganized and management is not on the same page."
good,typical work day was making sure customers were taken care of and product was moving out the stores. Great co-workers and management. most enjoyable part of the day was making sure the customer was satisfied
good,"Company was going under and they were looking for a suitor, they were all about sales, sales sales. The company was cash strapped so they looked to sell what we owned to gain capital. Once the company sold, Toys R Us could begin to prosper again."
good,"There are good managers in this workplace, but the main manager is irresponsible and has an overly strong sense of entitlement. She would push her responsibilities on someone else and give last second notice about very important matters. She would cause many inconveniences for fellow employees around the store."
good,Working at toys R us was fun when with customers and other employees and the managers were good for the most part but the head management was incompetent.
good,"Aprendes a preparar pedidos , ubicación de pedidos y la carga y descarga."
good,The management was not that great but the workplace was fun and made a lot of friends. They were flexible with my school schedule.
good,I cant say much because it was my first job and it was around thanksgiving. There were a lot of bad apples coming and going.
good,"Aprendí bastante, pues abrimos una tienda nueva (TOYS ""R"" US EXPRESS) y pude participar en todo el proceso tanto de montaje como de apertura y la campaña de Navidad."
good,I enjoyed working in a busy environment as it was around Christmas time and also enjoyed interacting and helping customers out as much as I possibly could.
good,Get through the day do your job and go home however dont appreciate being spoken down to as if 5 years old which is never appreciated plus dont plan to go back if asked im afraid.
good,Fun to work with colleages. However mangagement were not very understandable when it came down to time schedueles. This caused problems at home like getting home on time.
good,"Pay was terrible, management sat in an office all day and worried about nothing except the daily credit sales. The only positive thing I can say about this job was that it backed it's LGBT employees."
good,"This was a easy job as long as you can multi task and be on your feet for long periods of time. I learned more customer service skills and managers were more then likely willing to help. Co-workers have never been a issue in any of my jobs, you just maintain professional. The hardest part about this job was around the holidays when retail stores became high demand. Having to deal with angry and impatient people. The most enjoyable was not worrying about getting enough hours."
good,No equal opportunity provided for growth unless related or close friends to someone in management. Good opportunity to learn many new skills but with few raises for moving up.
good,The job was not exactly what I was looking for. I was more interested in a stable working environment. The staff was not properly trained to handle the tasks that I was overseeing them for.
good,"During my time as a seasonal sales assistant, I have found it very demanding because of the Christmas period."
good,The management never gave me a schedule they just told me when  to come in after my shift was over. They were always talking a laughing with one another during store hours.
good,"The management was fine just the coworkers were sometimes rude and unprofessional. Was planning on leaving but wasn't given a chance to hand in a written resignation, they just took me off the schedule without notice. Best part of the job was helping the customers."
good,"This was a fun store to work for. I learned how to work with all different types of people and personalities. I did enjoy working around toys and seeing the faces of the children as they shopped around the store. I learned how to work under pressure, especially during the Christmas and Holiday season. The hardest part of the job was standing on my feet for 8 hours, otherwise it was enjoyable job."
good,A typical day at work involves a lot of interaction with kids of all ages and their parents. I learned how to deal with customers in stressful situations.
good,"I wish they can have better management and treat they employees with respect. I love my job because of the kids, they make it fun. I get alone with all my co-workers don't have a problem with none of them."
good,"se puede mejorar mucho la relacion entre trabajadores, mejorar  a la hora de comunicarse entre la gerencia y los trabajadores"
good,over worked and underpaid thats what they will telll you at the interview. its a fun job because what kid dosent love the idea of growing up and playing with toys. you get over time by the day which   is really great but they will calll you in almost all the time. just think about overtime
good,"Most days were busy mainly around the weekend and the holiday season. During Season the store was chaotic, but the we always managed as a team to put our best foot forward. The management was rough do to the lack of Supervisors and Managers. At some point the team feel apart and we weren't a team anymore. Those days were the hardest because it felt like every man for themselves. The best part of my day would be helping the guest find exactly what they were looking for and that they are pleased with their visit."
good,"Coming to work is the first hurdle. After you make it in the door you find that the morning ""huddle"" was given to the overnight crew and checked off the list. "
good,"Toys R Us is a dynamic company whose vision is to provide children with the ultimate gaming, toy, and customer experience."
good,Unfortunately this isn't a good job to stick with. My typical day was okay but not the best. I do not agree with the management because they get a manager about every year to every other year. It was very hard during dinner time because you always got a dinner rush but you just have to keep thinking it will end at some point and it will all be okay. It was also hard when others didn't take work seriously and you did. I would only go back if I was in dire need to but otherwise I would only advise to use this as your first job or your last job as an elder.
good,"I appreciated working with Toys R Us, handled any certain serious situation in the sincerest way possible. We would get rewarded bonus points if we were able to get people to sign up for rewards. They also worked around your schedule so my school hours weren't an issue."
good,"Great place to start out as a first job, but no room for advancement. Learned how to keep thinks organized daily do to lack of organization from others. Hardest part of job was the physical lifting of large items but it can be rewarding. No room for advancement, start at the bottom and stay there until someone dies or retires."
good,Off season is most difficult because the company does not allow enough hours to complete the work to full execution.  I do enjoy the children that visit the store.
good,"toys r us is a fun pace. If you love kids and have patience this is a place for you. only gives a couple hours per week, but holiday is busy and great. mangers are great."
good,"It is a good place for first job experience. The hours are great, the managing is terrible. Orders are pretty much all over the place."
good,"Typical day at work consisted of mostly restocking shelves and helping customers"
good,"Was a fun place to work at, there was always something to do.There was no time to be board and they would cross train you for different departments. The only bad thing was the hours were being cut. Other than that Company is good."
good,"I was a seasonal off hour stock crew member, we would unload the delivery truck, then stock the shelves. Sometimes we would have to reorganize shelves or pegs or isle displays. Hardest part of the job was unloading as you often had objects fall on you. The most enjoyable part of this job was being able to listen to music while i worked."
good,"A typical day would start out with a walk through of the store and the back room, making notes as I go."
good,"A day to day basis consist of working to satisfy a customer every need within our store, and that's what comes first to the company! But managers can have aggressive attitudes at times when things are not going their way, especially during the holidays."
good,"If you want to work at Toys, make sure you don't have another job. They don't tend to pay attention to your availability. Only time exceptions are made are when you have kids and/or pregnant. The only reason people really stay are the fellow coworkers, not so much on management. Customers tend to suck too, if i'm going to be honest. Not everything is possible, especially on returns. Overnights are pretty neat though."
good,"I am a overnight warehouse worker so when I'm at work the store is closed. Our overnight managers and team members make the job a fun and enjoyable place to be, versus the daytime shift where there's more micro managing and subject to customer service at any point in time. the hardest part of the job is trying to scan in about 100 or more boxes of overstock or back stock into warehouse bays that are already 85-90% full. The easiest part of the job is Playing with the new toys."
good,"Work the sales floor, stock toys and break down boxes in the back."
good,Fun job helped lots of new moms and dads figure out what to buy what products are good. Lots of greeting and stocking short lunches not many advancement opp same position the year didn't learn many new things
good,"Typically just walk around in circles until you see a customer then ask if they'd like help with anything."
good,"I was hired for a seasonal position right after thanksgiving and it was extremely busy. I was never exactly trained per se but I was shown around the store and my co-workers were helpful when I reached out."
good,"so I was told i'd start as maintenance and then move to cashier. well, they lied about that. I never got to be a cashier, and i actually hardly got to do what i was SUPPOSED to do. i had to spend ninety percent of my time at work collecting carts from the parking lot"
good,It was an enjoyable place most of the time.  The benefits were very expensive.  I have had some really good managers that would help you to get to the next level.  Most of the time you would have flexibility with your schedule unless it fell on a holiday.
good,I enjoyed working here but we are very short staffed which can be very overwhelming at times. I still manage to strive with the company but don't see much growth coming out of my position. I have nominated employee of the month but sometimes feel overwhelmed with lack of communication and staff help.
good,"•a typical day at work"
good,This job is good for younger workers because they treat you as such. Boring but fun. Not bad discounts and able to move up to lead cashier but that's about it.
good,"A day at Toys R Us was  making sure the clothing was in it's place and the price tags was on each item, also did some cashiering. The coworkers were ok"
good,I provided the hr manager with availability but work counter acted with my college.  I expected more hours but was only given 7 hours a week out of twenty hours i was supposed to be working.
good,"This was easy work the management were very supportive of my studies and could give me the time I needed to attend college."
good,"Responsible for an $8 million dollar store. Responsible for day to day functions on running the store. Offered suggestions to employees to help attain daily store goals in offering store metrics. Responsible for leading a staff of 25-60+ employees in executing proper merchandising and compliance with company visual guidelines. Leader of phase moves for 2 rotations, and responsible for complying with all deadlines. Accountable for achieving sales, credit, and customer service results."
good,El ambiente con mis compañeros era bueno pero con mis superiores no.
good,"Typical day at work included working the register, restocking and organizing shelves and assisting guests. Learned how to operate register, work with checks and cash, and finding products. Management and coworkers were alittle too unfriendly. Hardest part was working black Friday sales. Most enjoyable was working the register. I just loved greeting people, working with the technology and just the overall aspect of it."
good,"Toys R us Is ok, pay could be way better at 12 an hour. Toys R Us needs a fresh start from the top to bottom. Stay away If you want to move up In a company because this ain't the place for you."
good,"The place had a standard retail routine and guidelines.  Management was professional and flexible.  Co-workers were helpful, nice and pleasant to work with. The unsteady scheduling could sometime be challenging."
good,The day I had to work until 19:00 and I could not get a transport back home. I learned so much about being dependant and make critical and productive decesions. Management is easy going and deciplined I love working around them. My co-workers are very friendly they actually welcomed me with warm hands the first day I started working. The hardest part of the job is to move all around the shop the whole day not being allowed to seat down. I just enjoy being around my co-workers.
good,"A typical day involved unloading 2000+ boxes from a 52 food trailer with co-workers who regularly were a no show or slacked off during work. Management wasn't the best, they allowed allot of slacking off from the other co-workers which made my job more difficult. What i learned was not everyone is as hard working as i am and can't be motivated to do their job. The hardest part of the day was usually the whole day. Since my co-workers were regular no-shows, that meant everyone having to make up for their slack and since we were understaffed, we never got out on time."
good,I had a lot of fun interacting with customers and team members as well as getting ready for a work day. All my co-workers were amicable people and the customers were really fun to interact with to help them find product. The only problem was that managers would promise promotions or movement and never follow through nor would they work with me on scheduling issues which combined with my studies was why I had to leave the job.
good,"My day involved keeping the floor organized, then getting trucks unloaded as well filling the salesfloor with new product. I was also in charge of Layaway orders and for all outgoing internet orders. I maintained the cash office and made sure daily deposits were done and that all paperwork was filed. I had to check our daily impact planner for any new projects assigned from the corporate office. I also was in charge of floor resets and making sure any recall or stop sale items were taken care as well as maintain inventory counts.  The hardest part of the job was making sure everything was accomplished on time when we were shorthanded during the Christmas season."
good,A typical day at work is generally good as far as production goes. I learned how to manage my time and patience. The management is helpful at times but I wouldn't recommend working here if you have a short temper or low tolerance for constant change. My coworkers are very helpful and understanding. The hardest part of the job is satisfying every demand that the job comes with. The most enjoyable part of the job is the customers appreciation when you effectively satisfied their needs.
good,A typical day consisted of 10 pm start hour. Organizing and unloading new merchandise. Worked as a team to stock shelves with new products. Fast paced with an average of 2 to 3 large size shipments. End shift would be around 5 am. The hardest part about the job were getting used to the work hours.
good,It was okay the team was great the hardest part bout the job was working in the basement and freezing
good,Working with toys and making kids happy.Unstable management at the time we had six stores in our district a only had two store managers turnover was high.
good,"As much as I enjoyed my working at toys R us the opportunities for advancement were limited, multiple times I was overlooked for promotion into jobs I was more then qualified for, instead they employed new employees or graduates."
good,"Toys r us was ok, it was good helping the children,at times the workload was very extensive, not enough employees,"
good,Prácticas de tanatoestética en las cuales aprendí mucho aunque la organización al principio fuera un poco caos
good,"Working here has certainly been...an experience, both good and bad.  Sure, every retail place has its ups and downs.  But this place certainly is one of a kind.  This is a job that can be both exciting and stressful, heartwarming and heartbreaking, tedious and novelty, energizing and tiring.  I don't regret the time I spent here, but I wouldn't do it again either."
good,"The most enjoyable part of my job was helping customers."
good,"I was a cashier so I stood at the front all day."
good,"A typical day is you coming in and getting your equipment(walkies and a scanner) and grabbing you clip board.  You need to get metrics  i.e. rewards cards, buyer protection plans, and instant credits.  You are suppose to get them in some amount that is determined by how well others are doing.  I work on the Babies R Us side of the store which is more involved in selling because we have the Baby Gear and Furniture departments with displays.  We have to Juggle: helping to answer guests questions and sell items to them,  filling the floor, place GFS orders for furniture and many times ringing up the people at a register, starting up a new baby registry or signing out scanners for people to update one,  find stores that have a product we don't for a guest and if we don't have it order it for them online, printing baby registry lists out for people.  getting items from the back for people multiple times a day, and getting and doing re-shop, and being a back up cashier when it's busy.  "
good,"The store I worked at also was joined with a BabiesRus and that is the side I mainly worked on. I assisted customers, resolved customer complaints, set up furniture deliveries, handled baby registries, stock, and maintained a clean work environment."
good,"You have your bad days and good days, Days can be slow at points"
good,Job was ok but was only hireing for part-time and seasonal. They also cut hours to sometimes only working 4hrs a week
good,My working day would be from 9-6 four days a week. It was a enjoyable few months work all my co- workers were good to me in helping me adjust to the work.
good,Iv worked there for about 4 years now and still have not had a chance to advance due to no oportunities do not become available and i still get stuck with very few hours during the off season.
good,"Sometimes could be very busy, other days it would not be as busy. It all really depends on how you make it. Co-workers are ok. The hardest part is closing. Most enjoyable part is to see the new toys come out and meeting wonderful people."
good,"Typical Day: Come in, check at front desk where you're posted for the day. Lots of customers, most are rude, put on your best face."
good,"The people you meet there are awesome, but they company pays you way to less to all that we do and have to deal. All the way from bad kids crazy customers and the holiday season. Nice part time job for high school kids."
good,"Management was awful, but the environment was stimulating and customers were great"
good,The best part of the job was the new toys and customer service.
good,A typical day at work was very busy whether I am on the cash register or assisting guests on the floor.The lines get very crowded and I learned at this job do not be afraid to ask for help when you do not have an answer for a customer.As far as management I learned how to communicate more effectively and all my hard work was actually appreciated at this job.With Co-workers you learn how to work together more and to satisfy guests to the best of you ability.The hardest part of the job is when somebody calls off especially on the weekend when its always busy. The most enjoyable part of the job is seeing the customers happy.
good,It's an unorganized atmosphere and I don't really feel as if I'm truly apart of the team.
good,I feel that it is very hard to advance within this company. I have learned a lot of different areas within the company and I feel the more that I grew the more of an asset I would be.
good,"Great place to work if you love children. Very fun envirnment. But, they do over work you ! Not, the best pay with little room to move up"
good,Just worked there for some extra cash. It's not a good job on normal day so it's best to have another job.
good,"It was an experience. It wasn't too bad, getting used to staying up all night. I enjoyed off loading the truck and then putting product up on the shelves."
good,"The hardest part of the job was picking up slack where others were lacking. Not everyone takes their job seriously, especially a toy store. It taught me how much team work and a good attitude is important in any job. Each work day I either worked the register or Customer Service desk, as well as straightened the store, helped customers, learned cash office and front end supervisor responsibilities and stocked third shift for short time."
good,"My current retail location is the largest Babies R Us in the district. With sales days ranging from $40,000 to $100,000 and a staff nearing 50 employees, my day is full of training, project direction, and giving answers for the many employee questions as well as providing the best guest service possible."
good,"This was my first job after staying home and raising my kids for close to five years.  I like the people I work with, and it was a very happy place to work.  Being able to interact with new person and seeing and hearing there happiness."
good,"A typical day of work at this particular job would be assisting Guests creating Baby Registries, finding items off of registries and other items in the store, doing reshop, aiding in covering Customer Service Desk and Electronics. I have also trained many team members to have them become registry consultants. I have learned more about customer service and what it takes to keep a guest happy. It takes a lot of patience and understanding when it comes to new parents, they rely on you to know your information about all of the products. As the Personal Registry Advisor I have been cross trained in every section of the Babies R Us, I have been on conference calls with different vendors and have done monthly product knowledge to gain more experience. Also learning the Service Desk you learn how to speak to people properly. Management is always friendly but also know when to get to business. They help you out when you need it and also assist guests. Co-workers are reliable, hardworking, dedicated and eager to learn. I would say the hardest part of my job would be trying to keep everyone on the same goal page and motivated. I would like to do an incentive each month but unfortunately our company does not approve. The most enjoyable part of my job would be seeing the parents I have helped and their new babies. They would bring them in just to introduce me. I have even had a parent ask if I would babysit their newborn for them. I have many clients recognise me outside of the work place and catch me up on how their baby is doing. It is a very enjoyable part of my job which proves to me"
good,"I loved the people I worked with, which is the only reason I stayed so long. The company has a lot of pointless procedures that take up time that you do not have. Do not expect to get a whole lot of hours outside of Christmas season (16 hours outside of season is an awesome week). Full time does not max out at 40, but rather 32 hours a week. The pay is also pretty bad. Took me four years to make a dollar more than when I started, this included a promotion and a raise every year. "
good,"A typical day at Applebees is you come in and put up your belongings. Go straight to host/hostess stand and make sure your menus are clean and make sure you have hot, soapy water with clean hand towels for tables and chairs. You greet and seat guests as they come in, keep work area clean. Bust tables as guests leave and clean restrooms."
good,"Toys R Us is a great company to work for but they can do so much better.  What is done for one store should be followed throughout all.  As a sales associate in one store I was allowed to do stock, inventory on the handheld, and work the floor.  However, at the other store, I was told I couldn't do the others even though I had experience.  I couldn't even really help customers because I had to depend on others who were busy doing things for the whole store.  Toys R Us should try to keep in contact with old employees to improve their stores."
good,"Average retail store environment, good for first time, or seasonal position jobs."
good,Manage electronics department and personnel operating in there. Ensure that customers received proper care and customer service. Ensure products were stocked and ordered additional as needed.
good,The Toys R Us experience is a mix of enjoyable co-workers and  mostly ineffective management. At my particular store there is no room for advancement and very inefficient management. 
good,"I was on the checkouts despite being told that my role was to be a mobile toy adviser. I learnt how to deal with the general publics requirements, and helped them out with problems  and queries. I felt that the management were not among the staff enough and would be left waiting to my calls for help for some time before anyone eventually came to me. It was a very busy store, and there did not seem to be enough managers on at one time. My co-workers were very nice people who were very helpful. My job was not hard, and the most enjoyable part was serving the customers as i met some lovley people."
good,It was a fun place to work. I mean its a toy store for crying out loud lol. Although its fun to work it is not a place where one could retire and raise a family....
good,"typical work day starts off with yelling, screaming children and soccer moms. management is tenure based, the more years the manager has the better the store is ran, most co workers are friendly and helpful, the most difficult part is holiday season( you are guaranteed to loose 50lbs) the most enjoyable part is when you are not in season."
good,It was a great place to work at during the seasons because it kept you busy. After season was slow and wasn't right for me anymore.
good,Unloaded trailers for the next day of work. Stock shelves and organized the store.
good,Stock the shelves and put sale signs up as well as do price changes around the store
good,"Start at eight a.m. drivers waiting for trucks and job orders, repairs where all day DOT inspections, oil chages, brakes, brakes ajustments, trailers inspections and repairs, good group of mechanics."
good,You will be working Thanksgiving day and you can forget any quality with your family during the holiday season.
good,The job constantly kept me on my feet with busy customers. The managers were friendly and helped you learn the ropes.
good,"Responsible for unloading truck, stocking merchandise on store shelves, pricing items as to their current or sale price, pulling replenishment, and assist in maintaining a clean store."
good,"I did enjoy working at Toys R Us because the satisfaction I got out of pleasing a customer was irreplaceable. However, the department manager never seemed enthused about her job, nor did she ever know when her associates were supposed to work."
good,"Managers were rude, didnt work me at all. my availability was open anytime, i just could work part time 15-20hrs a week. and thats it."
good,No more difference in any place that you work for Retail There some good and bad things.
good,"I enjoyed working here for just the holiday season. Anything beyond that, I don't believe I would have enjoyed as much."
good,"Every day at work is different. Depending on what you were hired for you may be doing a variety of things....... if you work overnight. Before this job I had no idea about retail. I was coming from a production job into retail. Working overnight was a good transition point for me. I was able to learn about retail from behind the scenes first hand. My overnight manager was very helpful in helping me learn. It was very tough at first but as time went on it gradually became second nature. My co-workers are fun to work with and we usually have a great time while accomplishing our tasks. The hardest part of this job is the uncertainty. I usually never know when I am working. it varies often. Unless you are used to a typical 9-5, this schedule is flex and next to impossible to get used to. Weekends are required, although you do get some off. I would have to say the most enjoyable part of my job is working with the people. both co-workers and guests."
good,"TRU is a decent company to work for. The expectations are challenging and there is constant pressure to improve and increase metrics. The benefits are okay, but expensive."
good,"I start by checking if there are any notes from whomever closed the previous night, to see if there any problems that need sorting, new projects to start on. Then check customer requests for items out of stock to see if product is avaible yet. I check to make sure signage is acurate. I fill endcaps with product when needed. From then on I just help customers or work on any projects that are needed to be completed. Managers are ok. They aren't very accomadating when it comes to schedules. My co-workers are very helpful. Everyone gets along and are fun to work with. I have made a few good friends since I began working here. The hardest part of the job is the sheer volume of customers I deal with. It is a very busy store on weekends, and there usually is not enough people working in each department. Most enjoyable part is seeing all the babies people bring in."
good,The job was seasonal it was a good experience i learn a lot from it.
good,"Too much turn over. Store Manager valued his family more than his job or co-workers, would cancel a meeting, as soon as his wife and kids showed up."
good,Well the job was fun meeting all kinds of people it was fun working with a younger group. I took care of any concerns or questions customers needed in finding any item or returns. It was a very enjoyable job.
good,This was a temporary position for me until I left for military service. My hours for this facility varied but most often I worked from 11am til 7pm. As this was a labor intensive hands on job there was very little I learned from this work experience. There was very little interaction with the members of the management staff or other co-workers. The hardest part of this job outside of the physical demands was the isolation. On the other hand in some ways this was also the best part of this job.
good,"Every friday we would unload a truck before the store opens, we would help customers with carry outs and price checks."
good,Had an opportunity to work in all facets of the Distribution Center and on projects.
good,"great up beat place to work in ,must have patience and be good with children!"
good,"Lots of turn over and movement - if you dont have corporate retail experience, do not go here... if you can deal with politics at its finest and are good at manipulating yourself, this is the place for you."
good,The management crew was really disrespectful to the employees. They often shouted insults over the pa system. They also shouted derogatory phrases at employees if they called out to you and you didn't hear them
good,When I was working there management was okay. It's an okay place to work. Too bad the companies out of business now. Flexible work hours for school students.
good,worked there for a good while although i was young at the time i felt as though i was held bad for any sort of advancement.Management wasent very professional but all in all it was a good place to start thinking about my forward career.
good,"There were so many pervs of toys r us "
good,"It was a fun place to work, when the right manager was there. Some of the managers liked to take things a little to serious. Sometimes it made the job not fun at all."
good,Honestly working at toys r is wasn’t so bad the management sucked she didn’t know wheat she was doing had employees not clocking out and other nonsense was taking place
good,The environment is fast paced. If you cannot keep up then you should not consider this job. You are going to be on your feet for nearly 8 hours. So if you cannot stand that long you should not take this job.
good,"It was fun working there for my first job, and it was really sad to only have been employed for the seasonal position. I made a lot of great friends that I still talk to, to this day. Sad that they closed down."
good,A typical day at Toys R Us was good. I learned a lot about the different machines. Our management team was fair and was always willing to help. The workplace culture was equal got to see a lot of different cultures come together to work. The hardest part of the job was working the night shift that was my shift. The most enjoyable part of the job was the many celebrations they had. They really made a person feel special.
good,"Comfortable working environment, productive and fun. Everyone was taught something new everyday, we were like a family. At some points it was hard. but everyone helped each other."
good,Great business poor management on a grand scale. Not able to compete with the ever changing business climate of online sales & social media presence. A great business that once flourished but declined due to poor compensation & employee benefits which in turn createdd p employees
good,"I loved working at TRU. I had a great team and it was almost always a good time. Loved the holiday seasons. Could be stressful at times, but the job was a lot of fun"
good,"Teamwork is encouraged to achieve goals and sales. Good working environment. At Christmas, a lot of work was done which made time pass by. Low season, there were not many hours available."
good,"No hours, gossip work environment, discriminatory, poor management, verbal harassment. no training or proper guidance. They have groups of people."
good,This chain of toy stores closed it's doors in 2018. Working for this company was like any other corporate retail environment. Standard operating procedures for clearly defined positions were provided through a company wide intraweb.
good,"Toys 'R' Us is a company that strives to help the customer meet their needs, sometimes even at increased cost to the company. The overall environment and local management were fantastic in their approach to everyday problems. Day to day was fairly simply retail with the occasional hurdle. By far the largest issues the company had were with upper management and poor allocation of labor. Often times the stores were required to operate with little to no staff and additional labor was not provided for larger operations such a plan-o-gram resets and holidays. The second largest issue was quality of life balances with work hours and personal time. Due to labor issues the company often forced employees to work swing shifts sometimes only allotting four to six between ten to twelve hour shifts. Overall the company was extremely satisfying."
good,I enjoyed my time at Toys R Us. I basically was responsible for store maintenance. I cleaned the store broke up boxes. I cleaned store shelves and relocated misplaced items and put them in their proper place. I brought in carts from the outside parking lot.
good,"My particular Toys 'R' Us location was shut down shortly after my being let go as a seasonal worker. The place was often dirty, and I believe I only saw one person ever involved in janitorial duties? The bathrooms were always a mess, and no one seemed to know what we could do on day side to help maintain cleanliness. There was always a layer of dust on everything that was completely preventable by educating staff about cleaning materials, and I'd often clock off to find my hands were dirty from straightening up the toys. In a place where it is very likely a child will come into contact with the products, I found that distasteful."
good,Gained a wealth of experience working for toyrus. You had to be a fast learner and remain calm and collected in the stressful work environment. skills acquired from working at Toysrus will be utilized in the future.
good,The store was disorganized and laid out inefficiently. Our employee discounts were small. Sales and busy times were almost solely during the holiday season. It was an OK part time job but it's still sad to see the company go.
good,It was a good job with pros and cons they all have them just was said I had to leave so soon.i would of loved to grow with the company and see where it could have took me
good,"Okay place to work , management was decent but the Atmosphere created by corporate was one of drudgery and desperation . "
good,I would load and unload the trucks.  I would stock the shelves and keep it organized.  I would handle all of the paperwork from the trucks and the stockroom.
good,"Great place to work during the Holidays,  come in and start stocking toys on the shelves. Sometimes we would unload the truck and put away the inventory."
good,"It was clear why toys r us is no more. Miscommunication, bad leadership were one of many things that led to its demise. The company never changed with the times. The disconnect between corporate and store level was ridiculous . The company was doomed to fail for the passed 5 years but did not acknowledge such. The fact that they didn't offer severance spoke volumes."
good,"A typical day before the liquidation sales started was filled with helping parents and grandparents find a toy their child wanted that they had looked everywhere else for. The kids would be happy, and I made the parents happy when I told them that we price matched. Toys R Us hardly advertised this feature so nobody knew about it and I was happy to let every parent know how they could save a few dollars. I would also answer phones to help with questions, usually followed by happy customers coming in to pick up a toy I held for them behind the service desk, or bringing something broken back for a new one, or picking up a new crib they ordered."
good,"Same work pace everyday too many unskilled workers around under trained unsafe croweded, life threathing job under paid for the skilled I was providing for the company"
good,Loved my job the people and kids. Helping people makes me feel like I did my part in making the customer happy especially when it's their first child.
good,The work was never hard to do but the pay was really low. There were some excellent employees and managers there. Kind of sad they went out of business.
good,Toys R Us stores are closed now but the employees fought to keep them open.  While working there there were good people that were hard working people.
good,"TRU no longer exists in the U.S So I cannot say much about a business that is gone. There were pproblems like at most jobs, but overall it was a decent place to work."
good,"Horrible management. Decent place to work for part time students. Seasonal is bad, they don't really pay overtime as they say. Customers are crazy. Everything is overpriced and employee discount is hardly anything."
good,"I enjoyed the work but I needed a job that was regular hours. This job covered the busy period over Christmas. "
good,a typical day at work was pretty easy going. stocking was the hardest part because customers would make it hard overall i enjoyed my experience working for toys r us
good,It was an OK job ffor extra Christmas gifts. I understood it was seasonal. I just tried to make the best of it and it turned out as a decent experience.
good,I used to work at TRU before they closed. It wasn't too bad. But the hours kind of sucked at times. It was fun to see all the new toys and such come in.
good,"As a part-timer, the job was like almost any retail job. At first, I started during their seasonal time and worked at the back of the store. After the season was over, I learned how to operate the cash registers and etc. and that's when it really became just a regular retail job to me with the random hours and annoyance of people. When the company was shutting down, it was a bit sad. I will miss some of my co-workers and I will definitely miss the Toys' R Us culture. I eventually adapted to the way my managers scheduled the employees which was a bit tough to do."
good,Fun enviroment.Worked with really fun people. Great co workers and management. Came into a very clean store. Customers were great. Its sad to see it go!
good,"I worked for Toys R Us for over 23 years.  An average day was to unload a truck and  then merchandise it to the sales floor.    "
good,"Toys R Us is now closed because of corporate misspending - there is not much to review. I involuntarily left this job. This was a fast paced job with many hats to wear. The compensation wasn’t great, but the relationships were a bonus."
good,The most enjoyable part of the day was motivating your team to ensure the store had the shelves stocked with the product our guests along with their kids would be looking for. Building relationships with customers and being able to utilize all company resources to help them achieve their product needs. I enjoyed working and developing a strong store team to achieve company goals.
good,"Enjoyed working for this company for so many years, but sadly they have dis continued service.This why it is important for me to seek employment right away."
good,"Supervised employees, engaged in sales, inventory-taking and performing services for customers. Illustrate the importance of integrity and work ethics."
good,Its an ok day working at toys r us its nothing to make a career outta of so i wouldn't recommend it to anyway especially since they all closed now anyway
good,"There were many times where it was fun to work for the company, but there wasn't any room to advance (they were very hesitant to promote, even after other keyholders would leave). Sales goals were unrealistic, which when combined with poor customer behavior (admittedly something that I'm fairly used to thanks to many years spent in retail) made for a much more stressful environment. Benefits for employees included a 10% discount on product (save for select electronic devices such as video game consoles) and health insurance for full-time employees. For those trained in the ""back of house"" area, you essentially acted as a worker bee: restocking shelves whenever possible, running register, assisting customers on the floor, etc. The payrate was quite poor, and you were also told not to take tips when assisting with taking heavy items to customers' vehicles. I do have some fond memories myself, and have met many people there that I still call friends, but I'm not terribly surprised that they are no more."
good,"The manager was not that nice. At the time while I was working there for holidays, they were very understaffed at on point and I ended up working 2 weeks straight. We got a new assistant manger that told us we weren’t allowed to work to get and no talking."
good,空間夠大，同事關係相處和洽，公司會給予員工自行選擇上班的時間，所以上班時間彈性較為寬鬆，但有加班的情況出現。
good,"restocked merchandise,assembled new stock,learned all about retail work,dealt with public, learned people skills, decent managers,learned about taking inventory,learned how to fill customer orders done on line"
good,"I started after the liquidation began so there isn't really much to tell but the atmosphere was always very chill.  There was a lot to be done towards the end, I'm sad to see it go."
good,"The manager at my store was an awful man. He had his favorites and let them have their pick of hours first. Female employees felt uncomfortable around him and were occasionally harassed. Some male employees were threatened with physical violence. He was blatantly homophobic, xenophobic, sexist, and vulgar. And all of these things made it to the store. They were apparent in most situations and the only reason it passed for so long was that he was personal friends with the district manager and the human resources department."
good,"Working at toys r us was the not the best experience for me, most of the main staff were straight rude to everyone, the bosses thought they owned you so they can treat you however they please, the hours were not too bad but could have been shorter, the pay was absolute minimum, just a bad place in general in my opinion."
good,"not being able to take tips from generous customers after helping them with heavy merchandise or furniture to their vehicle i would be lifting whole bed sets dressers, frames etc.. and if they offered me a tip i had to say no or else i would get fired"
good,"I didn't have much time as a colleague, but as a professional, I always was there. "
good,Toys R Us only pays minimum wage.  Paying minimum wage make it hard for the working adult with children to survive in this economy with the cost of living being high.
good,I had opportunity to grow and make more money in toys r us. The people are great and you feel like a team member but it’s going out of business. So I have to leave.
good,"Great people to work with, became a second home to me over the years and developed great relationships, I gained great experience overall; management needs improvement."
good,I enjoyed my time there but the company had to close due to bankruptcy. The people and managers were always nice and I never had any complaints towards the company elsewhere.
good,"i liked here, although it was only seasonal, still great managemt. nice co workers, they always by launch,  you can also get a discount, hands on training"
good,"Out source everything.... because it ""  lowers costs"" when Toy's R Us should have eliminated engineers not capable of common sense....and company would have been fine."
good,"My time working at Toys'R 'Us was brilliant, good chat with staff and loved helping customers and making small talk with them. Management where fine but sometimes wouldn't set the best example and when joking with staff seemed like they where having a sly dig at you at the same time. Which ended up with me and my colleagues feeling awkward around them."
good,"It’s a fun and productive environment- management is great, coworkers are helpful and all work together well as a singular team. Can be busy but is fun"
good,Productive and fun place to work as long as current store manager has proper training. Without it can be chaotic. Lack of focus on customers is poor and can at times be frustrating.
good,"ToysRus was fun and  ever changing ."
good,Days could range from absolutely peaceful to extremely stressful.  Many minors are employed leading to inconsistencies in attendance.  The usual ups and downs of retail I suppose.
good,"TRU is a supportive culture that allows you to pursue your educational needs. However, work/life balance is difficult. Strong boundaries between work and life are needed."
good,I started as a part time associate and work my way up to HR/Front end manager. I learned how to do daily store operations. Customer service in a fast paced work environment.
good,"Can be a fun place to work. However you are bombarded with unrealistic expectations and goals. Credit card and warranty quotas."
good,"Wouldn't recommend because it is closing all of its stores"
good,"The company wasn't horrible to work for. Compensation could have been better, management should have been screened better. But the people who have been there a long time are like family to me now, and I'm going to miss them terribly."
good,Business was only busy on weekends and Christmas holidays.If there wasn't any sales then work hours/shifts were cut and  consequence would be understaffed on busy hours.
good,Decent and fun job for part time but not for a long term employment. High paced especially during Christmas. Should have the an high bar for working with a variety of people and dealing with complaints. Should be able to multitask efficiently.
good,Fine working environment. 
good,"The children made the job fun, seeing their facing once they received their gifts was priceless. The job became stressful during the holiday season. Once you made it through the holiday season then you would be ok"
good,During the holidays it is very fast paced. Outside of that it is very slow and a lot of times hours are cut. Even at full time they still have to cut your hours some weeks
good,this was early on I my professional career. I met some really good people here and several of us moved on to other companies and recruited each other several times. Some great friendships were started here.
good,"Horario comercial, me resultó bueno para desenvolverme de cara al público, el trato con proveedores, arqueo de caja, inventario entre otras cosas"
good,"i was only there for the holiday season it is pretty much bottom of the barrel job, but ok for your first job. Worked back of house mostly and pick up."
good,The best part of working at TRU/BRU is working with the customers and with the team. Making the kids happy getting the toy they have been waiting for or getting a team member to their get goal. I hate doing the schedule!
good,Muy buena experiencia para mis conocimientos de servicio al cliente.
good,"Without a good leader in your store, the store will suffer and customers will notice. You can't rely on your employees to do an excellent job if they are provided the necessary tools to get the job done."
good,"The people who worked at TRU were great! Typical days were filled with fun and helping customers. Management was good and bad while I was there, but overall wasn't bad."
good,"Within the current climate of the company, it is difficult to thrive. With that being said, there are opportunities offered there that I have received no where else."
good,Good place if you have open availability however the most amount of hours you'll see is only during the holiday/christmas season. Certain store policies need to be stricter.
good,La vie en équipe était agréable. Le travail en lui-même amusant.
good,Everyday there is always a complaint with a customer and there was always workers on the job who aren't doing their job so everyone else have to do his/her part because the boss would get mad at everyone if one thing isn't done right.
good,The job was fun but the managers were cruel. The raises they give for hard work is about .05. Sadly that does nothing for your paycheck.The hardest part is keeping up with your line and making people happy when they finally get to you. The most enjoyable is seeing a kids face when they get that new shiny toy or amazing gaming system
good,"Over the Christmas rush the workplace can be a fun place to work with loads of jobs that need doing to keep you busy, although can be stressful and no communication within the management team. "
good,Company has so much potential but has had made poor decisions for years resulting in the bankruptcy and closure of many stores.  I would have enjoyed continuing to work with the company as it transitioned into the future.
good,"The workplace improved, cleanliness-wise, while working there, but management deteriorated. I went through 2 store managers and multiple assistant store managers and only a handful were respectful or valued their employees and their worth. Coworkers made working tolerable."
good,Make sure your hours are put in before the end of the pay period and also keep account of your hours for your own records. Great learning experience about the supply and demand on toys
good,"When i started working at toys r us it was a wonderful place to be working as a teenager but as you get older you start to realize that you need something more in life. Management began to become poor and i started to lose a lot of interest in the job however, my fellow team members were awesome people to be working with."
good,"I was a part time worker that was kept from a seasonal hire to continue year round. The only advancement I got was based on the need of someone to fill in someone who left the company. It is stressful and the raises are pennies to the dollar, like most retail stores. Its very demanding but the employees usually get along well together since we have to deal with a lot of situations that arent normal."
good,It's a fun place to work especially if you want a side part time job while your attending school. The employees are very nice but not enough hours or pay
good,the work at toysRus was pretty simple. I over saw the unloading of trucks and stock merchandise on the shelfs on the sales floor or on the stock room shelfs.We also assisted customers that ordered big ticket items(heavy or oversized items) the help needed to get the items  in or on their car.
good,They are a great company to work for. It's a very fast paced environment during the holiday season but dyes down during the year. It's a lot of cleaning during the closing time but it's a fun environment.
good,If you need some extra change or need something for a student toys r us is a place to check out flexible with schedules the HR will bend over backwards for you the people are nice and willing to cover for you if needed
good,Very little training is provided to new management candidates.   The culture of thebstores are very different between November and February. To be successful a manager needs to be very flexible and be willing to work unlimited hours for a quarter of the year.
good,Toys R Us is an immensely fun place to work there's always challenges that need to be met and new issues that you need to change your way of thinking to accomplish. The management however is always poor you feel like you're working in a highschool mindset where who is the most popular matters and rumors spread like wildfire.
good,"I cannot complain about my time working for Toys 'R' us. I enjoyed many of my co-workers as well as working with the public. Management was understanding and helpful during high stress times such as ""black friday"" and the holiday season. The sudden cutting of my hours are what led me to seeking other employment."
good,"I enjoy working at this place due to the fast pace. I enjoy getting to work in multiple areas within the store, switching from cashiering up front, to helping create registries in the baby section, and then jumping over to electronics to give advice on tablets. "
good,"I really didn't learn any thing that I learned from my previous jobs and"
good,It was an okay place to work for the holidays and to make some extra money. The customers are friendly and familiar. So there are alot of The same customers.
good,fun environment i would be on the baby side most of the time they relied on me a lot to get things done in a correct and fast paced way. Would unload most shipping trucks that came by
good,its ok they didn't give me many hours so that is one of reasons I am leaving also they are going bankrupt so my job security is not there so I need to get another job
good,"•	Taking the role of a sales assistant during the Christmas period."
good,The job is okay I am just tired of weekends and all holidays. the company has become very selfish and there is never enough help. its poor customer service. I just want a change
good,need to train staff more and get more help ceo come in the store's and they don't know they are doing some them need more training teams members work very hard I as a manager let the team know thanks for all the hard work the team members ask me when the big bosses come in most of them don't talk to us
good,"I only applied at toys r us for holiday season, it was very busy"
good,"For a generally entry level, retail environment it is a very down to earth and reasonable place. There is on the spot training for when you advance through the company and most store locations are fun and welcoming. However, the corporate leadership is terrible. Payroll is cut dry so the staff is overworked and struggling to cope with sales volume, compensation and benefits are close to bare minimum, and every change or development in the company is poorly communicated and counter intuitive. Discontent and a lack of faith in the corporate leadership is rife within store and regional management."
good,"I worked overnight at Toys R Us stocking shelves with toys and games. The job was fairly easy and simple, you just had to put the toys where they belonged. Management was very nice."
good,Personally I only worked part time during the seasonal hiring. Job is very simple. The location I worked was smaller and by the strip so you have to deal with a lot of different people from different parts of the world that spoke very little English. Besides dealing with customers on the floor you'll have to work the cash register and stock the floor. I worked grave so every night during closing you'd have to face and organize all the items on the shelf and clean the store before clocking out.
good,"Great staff , fun job and loved working there but low pay and low chance of advancement. Good team with good team ethics. low value of each individual and their own ability's."
good,Good starting job but didn't see much opportunities for advancement. Had a good time working there but just so so when it came to communication. Hours were few and far betweeen
good,"the job is very is different for different staff member, a lot of people work harder than other and are expected to do more than they should. Most managers dont understand the people cant work everyday no matter what there age, but all the staff who work their are amazing and make all the work worth while."
good,depends on management you can be at a nice store or a thrashed store . co managers were great but the gm was unprofessional and needed to be terminated . corporate kept moving her from store to store
good,"I would love my job, but the hours are too hectic and wrong for me as I am a single mom with a disabled son. I also do not like having to work holidays as it cuts away the time I have with my kids."
good,"typical day at work is busy. Co workers helping customers getting down bikes, strollers  making it easier for them and their customer experience. flexible works hours  and diverse work environment which is always good to promote oneself."
good,"fast paced especially during the holiday season. required to try to sign customers up for rewards cards, sell insurance on items and sell batteries to customers who would become annoyed."
good,the pressures that exist for a retail company who earn the majority of their money in a single month of the year means stresses are transferred to the staff. Not a nice working environment.
good,"Whenever I worked, I hoped to be on cashier because I wasn't really taught much about the items in the store. I would run around like a chicken without it's head trying to find items on the floor."
good,It is a great place to work but they expect too much. You'll have management or any one above your position harass you to get metrics. They put way too much pressure on team members but overall it's not a bad place it is just doing the same exact thing every single day. Customers come in always cry about coupons and you just have to put up with or get pulled into the managers office.
good,"It wasn't that bad. We had a lot of fun and everyone was always bright and happy except management. Management was straight up rude. They were very discriminatory towards me due to a medical condition and at one point even told me my ""issue"" was becoming a nuisance and I should get it under control before there's a problem. They threatened me and my coworkers with losing our jobs constantly and we always got our schedules 2 days before the work week. If you're not selling credit cards you're treated like you're nothing."
good,"they assign tasks in a time limit, that the tasks can not be done in. as a furniture supervisor i mostly worked closing shift and need to build furniture displays. you were not allowed to work the displays to the floor during business hour and all my shifts were during those hours."
good,The positive mindset if the managers and employees made my time at Toys R Us enjoyable. The store was run well and management was clever and respectable with the customers and employees.
good,"Typical day at work is getting to my register and being consistently busy for a period of at  least 3 hours. I learned alot about how to work the newly advanced cash register, and that was very helpful. Managers help as much as they can with how busy the store was. Hardest part of the job was never knowing when you were gonna be able to take your lunch break. Most enjoyable part of the job was when kids would come to my register and have a big smile on their face about the toy they are getting,"
good,It was fun to do events with co workers and seeing them happy to be around so many toys. I felt like a little kid myself being with them and seeing toys I use to play with.
good,"It may just be the store I was at, but it seemed like the managers did not like e very much. Not bragging, but I am a likable guy. I did everything right and showed up every time they called me in, but I still felt like I was still under appreciated."
good,"This was a great place to work during Christmas season when it was super busy. Open or close the store, train new employee's reface the shelves, handle returns."
good,Working at Toys R Us I grew close to my co-workers and we made working together an enjoyable experience. The opportunities to take part of weekly events helped me become more creative.
good,"Managing till and processing customers enquiries and returns, cashing up at the end of the day."
good,"I love the employees I work with. There are daily challenges from employee issues and customer issues, everyday there's something new!"
good,"I worked there for 6 years as a cashier, cutomer service, floor person."
good,A typical work day was unloading the truck and rolling the items out to the floor and unpacking items and placing them on the shelves. What i learned there how to read labels and how to use a scanner how the face the products.Management was fair.The work culture  was friendly i liked the people i worked with plus we was all young. The hardest part about the job since it was the night was getting everything done by 6am. 3 hours before store opened up.The enjoyable part was getting paid for sure but getting to know new people.
good,"There wasnt anything really to talk about. You came in, did your job and went home."
good,I really like my job and working with kids. Helping them and assisting them. When I first started they never knew who was suppposed to train me or didn't know the days I was supposed to come in. Out of 2 weeks I'll only work 1 day. Then after a month or so later I was finally able to talk to my manager just for him to say he needs me to get trained on the register & its why I haven't been getting any hours. It's so unorganized.
good,"Managment was not organized to prevent,maintain maximum porductivity."
good,"Weekly schedule changes are difficult."
good,"Ok place to work. Definitely room for improvement. Co-workers were fun to work with. One of the hardest parts of the job was that fact that we always felt understaffed, even after hiring for seasonal it felt like i constantly had to be at 3 places at once. "
good,At the start of the shift to the end of the shift the work is constantly coming in order after order this keeps the employees busy through the whole day
good,"  Interact heavily with customers on sales floor to create cash register"
good,I really enjoyed working here. This was the first job where I really got along with all my co-workers. The only problems here were customers and management.
good,"Its very busy around Christmas time and very slow after Christmas time. On a typical work day you will be on the till all day. My colleague team was great and being part of that team was enjoyable. The managing team was conflicting, some were very nice but some made you wary. The hardest part of the job was the boredom on a slow day and the most enjoyable part of the job was being in the family environment that store has. I learned many things while working here, one being that i prefer to work in a more hands on way."
good,Great place to work if you're looking for part time work. It was a good environment and the schedule was flexible. Management was always upbeat and ready to help in anyway that they could.
good,"-Fun place to work"
good,"Management firm, yet fair"
good,"loading it's not for everybody, if it is for you then its pretty easy. they when its busy they are very lenient but after peak season its firing time."
good,"I had to work with alot of changes in my schedule, a lot of ""can you come in at 2 instead of 4"" they needed to get some business about them selves and make it professional, They lost the fact that they represent the entire company... not just their location"
good,Overall my time at TRU was great.  Growing to be the best toy retailer is their mission.  Most enjoyable part of the job seeing the faces of the kids!
good,This is fun place to work.  It is a toy store and helping parents and kids connect more by giving them a enjoyable shopping experience brings joy to your heart.  The tasks are not hard and require little skill.  The pay is average.  Management needs a change and processes need improvement.  ToysRus is focusing on this and these problems will have a solution soon.
good,"My employment with Toys R Us was brief and temporary. We were a seasonal pop-up ""Express"" store. Management was nice, scheduling was well managed and flexible."
good,Mangers didnt work with you. They didnt help with questions and after 1st day of traning left you on ur own. Didnt give you an notice when they where letting you go. Didnt tell anyone tell christmas eve.
good,"Toys R Us was my first job. It was a good experience. The people who worked there were so kind, helpful and the schedule fit perfectly with mine. I wasn't getting enough hours"
good,"A typical day at work revolved around me helping customers and organizing the store. I learned how to help people in tough situations. The management was okay, my coworkers were amazing and super nice people. I enjoyed my job because I love being social. The hardest part was the angry customers who thought everything about the store was wrong."
good,Very helpful team but very disorganized. I personally just didn't like the disorganization. The cashiers and shift leaders were the big help. My time being there was very easy because of them.
good,"Worked here as a full time employee. very fun job to work, but as soon as the holiday season is over, no more hours. Difficult to make it though the early part of the year"
good,"La valoración de mi paso por esta empresa es neutra, ha tenido sus pros y sus contras, sin más."
good,I was told I would be rehired once positions opened and they have never called me but posted applications anyway. It is easy work as long as you actually do the work
good,"cashier handle cash, checks, and credit bag toys clean and  stock  area greeted customers great customer service fun work place happy kids"
good,"The salaries and hourly pay are low and they hire a lot of lower skilled people in the distribution center. Even lower level managers tend to be rougher individuals inviting in a range of lower minded issues.  At a high level, the company has a good mission and values, but that seems to get lost somewhere around middle management.  Hours can be up to 12 hours per day starting in October to meet the high product demand during the holidays, but that ends at Christmas.  Then hours get cut back and it can be hard to get 30 hours per week during the rest of the year because the orders drop off dramatically."
good,"Typically a work day would involve a number of tasks ranging from assisting customers to checking back stock and cleaning isles at end of day."
good,"Toys R Us is a great place to have your first job.  There are many skills you can get from working there by working with customers.  On a given day you will answer questions on the floor, phone, work as a cashier, get carts from the parking lot and stock and straighten the shelves."
good,"Little opportunity for advancement. Frequent changes at executive level. Lack of professional development. "
good,"typical day here was always busy stacking shelves rearranging your section, having that knowledge at its best so customers are happy to listen to your suggestions."
good,The workplace was always busy it also had a diverse culture. The co-workers were all very friendly along with the management.
good,Worked there for years during college. Partime they were very flexible with my schedule. Typical retail job. Managers were helpful and always backed you up.
good,"I loved working for the company, but HR supervisor was not friendly and after I worked seasonal, they gave me a bad reference when I moved to AZ and  applied for a  stocker job. I was very disappointed in human resources, but I called Corporate and they removed negative review.  I enjoyed my team and the customers.  I loved helping people."
good,"To say it was a seasonal job, it was hard work each and every shift I've completed. The hardest part of the job was keeping up with the long lines. Some of the co-workers were very nice and helpful to me.The most enjoyable part of the job was re-shopping because I knew where thing went and it helped make the time go by quicker."
good,Minimal pay was the only down side to this job. Employee discount was bad. Management expects metrics 24/7 with really no financial bonuses for your contribution .
good,"I enjoy working with the people at Toys R Us. "
good,"Toys Rus is a good place to work good benefits 401k."
good,"Basically the same as your average retail job. If you are not fond of playing politics to break into the management clique (gm and most managers came from same outside company) than this is not for you. Customers are great, your around toys all day. Decent benefits if you get full time work. Staff is friendly."
good,"It's a great place to work, they have a supportive group of workers. I learned how to increase my customer service skills by asking customers if they would like to sign up for the Credit Card. The hardest part of the job was reaching the goal of how many people we have to get to sign up for the Babies R us Credit Card."
good,The store was overall very neat and cleanly. The workers didn't have the best attitudes though nor did most of the management. Only one management member was very helpful and helped new members feel comfortable. When hired for the season we were told some would be offered permanent placement. I didn't hear of seasonal workers gaining a permanent position.
good,"This place had its ups and downs. The good part was I was getting paid to work out at a steady pace which was easily maintained with minimal effort. The bad parts were that the job was seasonal so a lot of people including myself were let go. Also, after the manager I learned everything from left, the place turned into a ""Hire anyone"" environment. There were all sorts of drug addicts and people convicted of crimes that still got the job."
good,"Not a hard job at all, standing everyday for hours does get tiring. Working during holiday season is fun and very busy. The busier the better, and the faster the time goes."
good,"Toys R us is a fun place to work at for about 3 months. After, that it really losses it charm. The Store could use a better management team. I don't see the point of have so many 5 supervisors and 3 managers if none of them have any leadership and/or people skills. the store is always a mess and it really gets annoying when management is constantly asking for more credit card sign ups. Besides the terrible management team, Toys R Us is an okay place to work."
good,preparing the store for the customers while monitoring the inventory and making sure there are enough products on the shelves for the customers to purchase co workers are very friendly and positive management  is the same hardest part is during holidays where the environment is very fast paced most enjoyable part is helping the customers find the products that they need to buy
good,"this company was good to work for besides the compensation was not enough for the lifting and work that was being done. the company was also only offering seasonal work, as well as the management had no involvement with the employees."
good,"My time goes so quickly when I go to work because I am always keeping myself busy. "
good,"A work day at TOYS R US was very productive. Something always needed to get done. I learned great customer service skills. I learned how to deal with difficult situations and analyze them best way possible to find better solutions. Management was great as well as co-workers. The hardest part of my job, I would have to say it was teamwork. Most team members only cared for themselves. The most enjoyable part of my job was when the holidays approached. Working at a Toys Store being hands on with the kids teaching them how to play with certain toys and just the spirit brought happiness to the workplace."
good,Toys R Us was a fun place to work. The management was not all that great tho. The most enjoyable part of the job was seeing how happy the kids were when they bought a toy they really wanted.
good,"fun place to work."
good,"Fun place to work with a great team of long time associates. Family orientated company. Employee discount is ok, but not much"
good,Normal Job with normal hours. Not much to do on a 8 hour shift except on holidays. The management was ok. The way we operated i didn't like at all also how we ran out of toys to quickly
good,"Needed better managers, not a place for someone who is looking to move up in a company. More work given to temp labor then to part time employees."
good,fun work place supportive management. Able to grow and at a fast pace learning environment.. The most enjoyable part of the job was working alongside my colleagues and learning from them.
good,"It's a nice place to work, great environment and people to work with. It's a sense of family when you work there and the customers are the same way. It's a shame it has to close down the end of this year"
good,"Always completed tasks"
good,Normally with the overnight process you have had to be there before you scheduled shift if not you missed the night of work because after hours the doors were locked. On scheduled breaks you could not exit the store meaning if you were hungry you best bet was to grab a some chips or candy if you didnt bring in a lunch. The store was very small not much roaming room when on break. As far as the team the team was wonderful management need much work. An unless you and you co workers had established a routine you would be lost because the training was pretty much go at it.
good,"running register and helping guests was the main thing I did. resetting sections was also a responsibility, cleaning, getting carts."
good,It's not always easy working there but helping the customers makes it worth it. I do like it some times. I like doing the returns.
good,Helping parents find gifts for there kids over the phone and in the store. I learned that the customer is always right. My mangers made sure the crew learned the proper knowledge to maintain the store. My co-worker were very understanding of their position. Their was never anything while I was working that appeared hard. I enjoy everything about this job. I love to learn new things.
good,Everyone is very friendly and helpful.It could be more organizes in work shifts and on the job training.U also get to see whats newest toys out.
good,I definitely learned a lot about costumer services and how to handle people in any type of situation with a positive attitude. my co workers helped in along the way as I worked there in how to do my job as to my highest abilities possible.
good,Some days no one would make as much an effort as they should. When interacting with guests it was spot on servitude. The training sucks but managers did well to encourage employees.
good,Worked at night so it could be fun but also be frustrating ive learned that no matter what goes on in that store you are a team at all times until someone mess up then everyone is about covering there own butts. The management is terrible the workers know more about what's going on and know more about the store products then the managers do. Co-workers are coll people depending on your team you work with and some can be a pain in the butt. The hardest part is sometimes communication when unloading the truck and bringing the merchandise to the floor when we unload a few of us would bring the merchandise to the floor of who's section is being worked in but the day crew is always in competition with he night crew it gets crazy at times also dealing with customers at the same time. The most enjoyable part of this job is during break time we all sit down and order some pizza or go to the buffet to eat together and we always have an all out war Nerf toy battle going on it gets awesome even the managers take part in it fun times can be made there.
good,You are responsible for unloading freights with an estimate of 1400 boxes in 2 hours time frame. A lot of torso rotation that can lead to injuries at work and effect your daily activities. It wasn't a job that I could see myself being promoted from my position.
good,"I think that this is a great place to work for your first job. I learn how to recognized the different types of customers. I had a relaxed management that showed responsibility and how to use a register. My co-workers where around the same age as me, some even went to school with me. At the time the hardest part of my job was working late."
good,"I worked in the electronics department as a Christmas temp and my main roles were customer relations, shelf stocking and replenishment and public demonstrations of equipment. The latter I would usually do on busy days/nights."
good,"Typical day is you clock in and run straight to a register to start helping guests immediately. Then you might get pulled to assist a guest in starting a baby registry, then go cover someone's break. It is never a dull moment at Toys R Us."
good,"- Typical day at work was very busy since it was during seasonal time."
good,"This was a fun place to work. Who doesn't love a toy store. the only drawbacks were a lot of heavy lifting, climbing ladders and couldn't support my family on the pay rate at that time."
good,"I liked working there for a while but then I started to HATE going to work. My daughter was very sick once and I tried to call in and they told me that it looked bad on me and that I needed to find someone to watch her so I could go in, but two weeks before I had covered alot of people shifts because they didn't go to work or just called in and I even stayed later and covered superviosers lunch breaks because the others were too worried about going home on time."
good,"In management, a typical day at Toys 'R' Us changes throughout the year. While the spring and summer time are relatively a slow season Fourth quarter can be a whole another realm. We do nearly half of our sales during this time alone. "
good,worked here for a month to cover the busy christmas period and there was no chance of staying. I did enjoy it as I interacted with customers a lot and I tried to help them as much as I could.
good,A lot of work is placed upon you due to lack of employees available and in our store at least management does not do much to help you out. The other associates you work with are nice people though and sometimes the customers can be nice but are mostly frustrating.
good,A good company to work for in regards if you want entry level advancement. A intern should look for this company to grow and advance.
good,"A typical day at work was either walking around straightening toys and asking and helping customers with things they needed, or waiting at the register for customers to come and check out."
good,A typical work day is very productive with good management leading the teams and pushing us to perform at our highest performance.
good,"Customer Service, Cashier, Lot Attendant, Facing Store, Constant Upkeep of aisles due to seasonal work, Toy Assembler"
good,"it was my first job, it was an average expereince but I wouldnt go back to retail. There was a lot of things that could of been avoided, which meant a lot of pointles busy work becasue the company wanted things a certain way, unfold folded clothes just to fold them again ."
good,"My position was an overnight stocker. We would unload trucks with pallets full of merchandise and pack them on shelves. We were supposed to follow a planogram (shelving layout) but my supervisor was very much against it because we had so many items out of stock so he basically had us putting merchandise up anywhere and everywhere and label the shelves as we went. I witnessed a lot of internal theft and I learned that even though Id want to believe that people want to do the right thing in the workplace there are bad people out there including my store manager because he allowed it. Most management was very good; polite, professional, and hard working. But the top store manager like i said was involved in internal theft, i was so young i didn't know the right channels to go through to report him and if I did I would of."
good,"Typical day at work was serving the general public"
good,Work was steady always busy with stocking shelves and assisting customers with their shopping needs. The hardest part of the job was  trying to put items away and making sure no customers were impacted with the number of boxes on the floor.
good,I enjoyed working as a cashier but not having to clean the store after standing for hours at a register. Staff was very helpful and I learned a lot.
good,Very quiet now as it seems coming up to Chrsitmas is the only time this place is really busy. only working flexible hours after the Christmas period. alot of workers under pressure  when its busy.
good,My normal day was spent between the cash register and stocking the shelves. I spent a lot of time working with management as they explained my duties and gave me specific jobs to help keep the store running.
good,"Everyday i welcome customers to the store wish them merry christmas, answer customer questions e.g if they were trying to locate where certain toys are i lead them to where they can find these products. Gather trollies and take them to where it should be kept, tidy toys off the shop floor and label goods."
good,"Toys""R""Us was a fun workplace the majority of the time, personnel would be able to engage in fun activities throughout the year."
good,"I really enjoyed working with the employees here both as a co-worker and as a supervisor. The employees are the reason I stayed with this company as long as I did. The management was horrible. In my years they went thru 6 different ASM's. The GM was more concerned with taking her vacations then she was about the business being run. The only time I saw the GM care was just before a District manager walk thru, and then she mostly just ran around and yelled at everyone about how bad they were making her look. With better management I would go back to work for this company anytime. The job itself was very easy, I started as a stocker seasonal, and I worked my way up thru the ranks. The pay is the worst I have ever seen in any company. 30 cent top raises each year is an insult."
good,"Working at Toys R Us has helped me with the transformation of completing high school to grooming myself to be part of the working environment, Toys R us truly helped me grow as an individual which also shaped my thinking and taught me about handwork and perseverance. "
good,"It was a good job, it wasn't where I felt I needed or wanted to be"
good,A typical day at Toys R Us is very busy dealing with products and customers non-stop. There is not much down time and you will be helping out in all areas of the store regardless of your job title. The company is very team focused and customer satisfaction being the number one goal. The atmosphere is always friendly and fast paced. The hardest part of this job is multitasking between your own duties and helping each and every customer you come in contact with. The most enjoyable part of the job is having a good management team that work just as hard as everyone else in the company.
good,"I worked at an express store for a while. I didn't know this upon getting hired, I assumed it was for the bigger store in town. Since the express store was just opening, the new employees were required to set up the store. One of the members of upper management was with us to assist in the set up, but all he would do was stand around and tell us when we did something wrong. The people I worked with at my store were all awesome and we had a lot of fun, but a lot of the upper management for this company don't really care about employees. Part-time employees didn't get a lot of hours. When our store was told we were closing, we were told we'd still have jobs at the big store. This didn't happen...apparently the manager of the bigger store hired too many seasonal workers at his store and kept them all on, leaving no spots for the express store employees (even though our store got multiple complaints about the other store's seasonal help). Overall, my experience was rather enjoyable, but the way things were handled by management was disappointing."
good,"This job requires alot of going out of the way to satisfy costumers, but when you see the smiles that you place on a costumer face by helping them it makes it all worth it."
good,"I don't like working here because income is very low and the management doesn't respect their employees and doesn't train you properly. They get me to pick up the slack of other employees but when I try to show improvement and when I try to progress, the management team then tells me I'm not qualified to do the job even though I've done the work before.  The employees are all nice, but all say the same things, ""there's no way to provide for my family or myself without getting a second job"".  I like the type of work I do which is helping customers and stocking the floor when I'm not being criticized."
good,"Toys R Us is a fun place to work, especially during the holidays. Lots of opportunities to interact with customers and see what they are interested in and who they are shopping for. As a regular part time employee the work is varied and the expectations of a days work is achievable. Supervisors and management however, is a different story. Company-wide cutbacks and new company policies just add to the ever growing burden of responsibilities of the supervisor staff and managers. The ""More with Less"" style of operations is alive and getting worse, with cutting hours to all stores to work with. Delegating tasks to part timers is critical, if you have anyone to delegate to!"
good,"At the end of the day as a team we pull it together and we make it work, we overcome obstacles and we demonstrate that we are a family."
good,"It gave me some of the skills I use today. A typical day BRU, is giving the guest a pleasant shopping experience .With knowledgeable co-workers ,friendly management ! The hardest part of the job is nothing at all . The enjoyable part is when it is really busy ."
good,"•a typical day at work: Work on different departments and meet sales goals."
good,"It was a part time seasonal job. It was a cool job parents and their kids would come in and the kids face would light up when they seen all them toys. Management was cool, I always did my job so I mean wasnt no problem between us because they never had to say much to me. I got along with everyone there, thats the type of person I am, the hardest part about the job was the pay and leaving when the season was over."
good,It was an interesting and sort of fun job at times. I wouldn't go back to it unless I was to be paid more. All of the above it was a nice experience and I enjoyed my coworkers and the environment.
good,"need to do a better job with new hire training from Management to associates. I have learned a lot for this Company, but feel the product mix is not a fit for me."
good,A typical day at work would consist of maintaining the appearance of the store. I checked customers out and bagged items. I assisted customers on the whereabouts of items in the store. I made gift bags and greeted customers at the entrance of the store.
good,"Its was fine to work, people that i worked with were not always team players what sometimes made the job more hard work."
good,"Originally a great place to work with many opportunities in both domestic and international areas. Working in the international division, it was a broad learning experience involving travel to many countries and working with people from all over the world. International was a lean organization and we accomplished great things supporting operations in 13 countries on one fifth the budget allocated to TRU US. Due to cost cutting (restructuring) International was absorbed into the domestic operations falling under a new Global IT. While logically making sense it was done poorly with little attention to cultural/operational differences which in combination with the economic downturn has been responsible for market underachievement. Now being owned by the venture capital group Bain Capital and Vornado Realty Trust, TRU is facing difficult times to meet its financial obligations. As a result cost cutting, over-working, layoffs and cut rate development are now the norm. The people who once made TRU a great place to work are mostly gone with those who remain now disillusioned. I believe TRU is out of time and has run its course as their business model is no longer profitable nor sustainable."
good,"Not good money or benefits, but the people were great to work with. Loved my customers! Learned a lot about accounting, stocking, customer service."
good,I think it was a very friendly enviornment at times. It was a seasonal job.
good,Enjoyed helping out new parents who needed help with picking things out. Counted money in the morning. Unloaded the truck and stocked the store.
good,"The company is heavily burdened by debt and years of organizational inefficiencies.  As a result, the systems and infrastructure are antiquated and a hindrance to business effectiveness.  There is talk about culture, but it is only talk.  With payroll percent to sales at an industry low 6%, there is little support for store operations.  Not a great working environment."
good,"Here, like every other warehouse, I learned how important is was to pay attention to detail, because not being alert could have you packing the wrong order."
good,This job was the worse I've had. Not very easy to work with your life schedule.
good,"Its an overall great company to work for.I stock shelve, unload trucks and place merchandise in storage containers until time to store stock."
good,This job was enjoyable because of my staff and the guest. Management always made schedule changes that they would benefit from at the cost of others. I learned the proper and improper way to lead a team.
good,"A typical day at work would consist of waking up early, getting a signage report, doing markdowns, clearance, and other promotional signs. Then printing signs for the next day. Baby registry would be next, answering phone calls, helping new moms register with us, greeting guest at all times. Then would be service, answering phone calls, returns, check out. Then would be baby gear, helping guest find the right gear for their baby. The hardest part of the job, would be when you have your mind set on one task and you have to mult-task within your hours scheduled to get everything done and finished. The most enjoyable part of the job would be helping people, and getting to see all the wonderful babies!"
good,"Working at Toys ""R""Us Inc. has taught me a lot about managing people teams to create a culture."
good,"Once I learned my job I liked it, I didn't like the hours they gave employees some weeks I worked everyday and others two days the whole week. Management did not work well together and some of the managers wanted you to be there whether you were sick or not. In my opinion coming into a place that has newborn babies and pregnant mothers to be Management should think of what there putting them around having contagious workers around. The hardest part of my job was not being trained well enough they would put you in places such as customer service without training you along with being by yourself all day. The thing I enjoyed the most was seeing all the babies that came in and some of my coworkers"
good,"Toys R Us has a fun environment, as the selling is mainly aimed at children. Keeping the store organized was always easy, assisting customers in finding toys and finding the right one with their child was always rewarding. The management varied but overall was pleasant. Tasks weren't difficult and the management attempted to stay away from micromanaging."
good,"Stocking, straitening, helping customers.  Hired too many people.  Had to let 50% go, 3 months after grand opening."
good,"A typical day at Toys R Us started with putting my coat and purse in the back room and getting something to drink, then going up to my register. At my register I checked customers out, while also greeting the ones that come in the door, and telling the ones leaving to have a nice day, while checking people out I also had to make sure that the customers behind me to do returns and exchanges weren't getting ignored. Atleast once a day I got yelled at over a toy not working right, or not being the right price, or anything else that customers could come up with, the whole time having a smile on my face and still helping them. Also atleast once a day I helped mulitple people at one time, there were sometimes when I would be checking a customer out, doing 2 returns, and ordering an item for someone on the computer, and answering the phones."
good,"Assemble bicycles, Power Wheels, and sometimes furniture. "
good,"Worked for 4 years under 5 different managers. Didn't have a set work schedule, was hard to balance school hours with work hours, when i was available to work i didn't get much hours but when i wasn't available because of school they would schedule me when i had class Overall it was a good experience, learned many positions and learned how to be a leader in a working environment. Co-workers were great to work with. My job wasn't that hard but i was told do certain jobs that i never learned and had to learn on the spot while doing the job. My typical day at work was to walk around the store, clean the aisle of loose toys and to ask customers if they had any questions about a typical toy they are interested in."
good,"It was very simple and a job that I like doing. I enjoyed working at the baby registry and finding that special item that a customer couldn't find. The smiles were worth it. I also, liked making an upset customer happy."
good,"Get assigned to be service, cashier, electronics, back of house, or assisting people on the floor.  Learned merchandising, cash register operations, stocking, upselling, satisfying guests, and more. Great coworkers to work with, management did their part. Most enjoyable part was closing and getting a little break from all the rush."
good,"At this job I was classed as a floor staff member in which I had to stock shelves, assist customers and staff. I was also back up cashier for when it got busy. I worked with a large group of staff within this company in which we all helped each other out. the part I loved the most was the excitement of the children who entered the store"
good,I enjoyed working here serving the customers and interacting with them. I learned to listen to what the customer wants. management is not up to par here. my co workers were a delight to work with hardest part of the job was gauging what the customers want.
good,Looking for change and grow. Interested in IT / Finance role. Specifically either Peoplesoft or Financial Analyst role.
good,was a loader unloader there that start off from temp work then turned into a permanent position.
good,"A great place to work while finishing school, flexible hours. Minimal chances to advance however. Full time hours are hard to get, can only expect anywhere from 10-25 hours outside of the holiday season. I learned a vast amount of information while being there such as interacting with customers, working a cash register, answering phones, working on computers and consistently multi-tasking. I highly enjoyed my connections with co workers and frequent customers."
good,"Started the day with opening store, making sure all the tellers  were up and ready, and then the day would commence.  We had 2 tea breaks and an hour lunch, but it was good experience.  We did pricing, packing, sorting, stock-taking and clerk work so it was busy and exhausting."
good,"Impossible work loads, and not enough hours in the day! Management seemed overwhelmed by company expectations and was usually behind, relative to daily task."
good,"•	Provided customer service and product knowledge for 100+ customers a day, along"
good,"Team effort environment, customer service based, clean and well stocked"
good,"This is a job suited better for young people who can be on their feet all day and do a lot of manual work. For the particular location, some managers were not very friendly towards me, but for the most part it was a decent job."
good,Great job to have part time while in college. Holiday hours are crazy. Atmosphere very loud with children playing in the isles.
good,Unpack and shelve merchandise overnight shift. Lots of fun interaction with staff. Keeps you busy all night.
good,"- Mi labor era atender a los clientes ante cualquier demanda que tuvieran, reponer material, cobrar en caja, prestar ayuda en las áreas en las que se necesitase."
good,"The company was ok, only worked during the christmas time just to make some money."
good,"My day at work depends on where they put me.  If I am on the Baby's R Us side, they may have me stock shelves,straighten the store shelves or work on resets of the store.  I also have days where they have me working the Customer Service Desk dealing with returns and any customer calls and issues they may have."
good,can get real busy and deal with all sorts of people but if your a peoples person you will love it
good,"Working at the Toy R Us I encountered many different types of customers ranging in ages from about 3 to 65. Being able to handle and satisfy the needs of the customer was primary goal along with tasking in the back. This work experience allowed for me to grow my multi-tasking skills and also exposed me to a very up tempo work environment. The hardest part of the job would probably be locating orders that were not put in the proper place. This was time consuming and often left customers frustrated. "
good,"My day at work varies but i have learn't to do all aspects of front of store such as dealing with customers complaints and enquires using computer to find stock and working on till. My co-workers are all pleasant and friendly, i enjoy working with them. the hardest parts of the job is working late and being bored, the most enjoyable part of the job is interacting with a wide variety of people."
good,"Fun place to work for just starting out in the workforce or a second part time job.  As always in retail there is a lot of work, and minimal pay.  The work environment is fun and you can learn a lot about operational procedures and the funtions of a retail store.  "
good,during the 4 years that I work there it was fun till my 4th year. I got pregnant and my managers treated me with no respect and made me work really hard even with my doctor notes. Even calling the HR line they still didn't do much about it. It was horrible. Cant even treat a pregnant person with respect made rude comments and remarks. 
good,"I learned customer service. I learned my phone skills like taking messages and using the intercom or walkie talkie to relay information or a phone call. I learned to do returns which, at times, was very difficult and a lot of company and store policies and abiding by them. I also learned to deal with disgruntled customers and stocking shelves. my co-workers were very friendly and took me in right away. It was a great job but the customers returns or problems with products was the hardest part of the job. Even around christmas time we did layaways which also became very difficult. but the most enjoyable part was the kids and the constant communication with people. It was friendly and cheerful. but just because it was a toy store did not mean we did not have our fair share of discrepencies. "
good,"A great place to work, managers are very easy to get along with and can work around your schedule. Always a great time working with the co workers, very fun atmosphere. Usually a typical day would include unloading the truck, loading and stocking the product, cleaning up."
good,"I was given my own store after only 3 weeks with the company. My store was amazing. The pay was horrible and corp was a nightmare to work for, but all in all I loved my job and miss it."
good,fun place to work at because of the toys management could of been a bit better
good,"I really didn't get to work here for a long time, but overall I had a pretty good experience. It was my first and only seasonal job, and they made it very easy for me to get right in and learn everything on the first day of the job. If you are looking for a winter job, and love working with people, then this is definitely the job for you."
good,I enjoyed the flexible work schedules. I did not like walking around all day.
good,"I remember this Toys R Us in it's heyday, so seeing it as it is now was actually kind of depressing, but still a good lil nostalgia trip."
good,"This has been a great experiance from my last few office jobs. I had forgotten what it was like to be out of a cubicle. My typical day begins with locating which department I am scheduled for, reviewing for any coverage or overlays within my shift. Then head to said department and speak with current on shift employee to find out what is the plan for that day and how the traffic has been. From then I would complete all and any assignments while assisting any customers weither they be on the phone or anywhere on the sales floor. The best part of the day is that I have a lot of time to spend completing tasks but the only time restraint is to have it done by end of shift. It is up to me on what I feel/know is the most important to complete first and so on. That can also be the biggest challenge. I was originally brought on as a Seasonal Employee so having less traffic gives us more time to see what may need serious improvement within the store and we can get ""lost"" in a project that may not have been for that daty or shift. It is a slow but steady project as a whole to get the store back from the insanity that was the holiday season in a toy store. Quite a fun experiance as a whole. My co-workers are one of my favorite parts of the job. I feel that who you work with can make or break any job. My team is awesome. We can go days (or weeks) without working together and then when we come back together it feels like a family reunion. I have many of the same feelings for the management staff. I feel farely comfortable approaching most of them and usually feel as if I get 100% of their"
good,Toys R Us was okay . overnight hours . we took breaks together for 30 mins .co-workers were cool . hardest part of the job was on black friday . other than that i found everything to be pretty easy and enjoyable
good,it was a good place to work at and fun to see new people everyday when you go to work with a smile and you managers work with you and there to help you when you need it
good,learned logistics process and everyone was helpful. Great co-workers worked as a team. Management did little to nothing for team and very lax on safety and culture.
good,Seasonal worker fun work. Night job hardest part of job loading shelfs around crowns of customer.
good,No hours whatso ever. No chance to advance. A good place to work for if you are a student so you can work and go to school at the same time.
good,"I worked the overnight shift, met interesting people and it was a fun experience."
good,Come to work do what you are suppose to and the days go by really quickly
good,"I worked at Babies R Us for 3 years. A typical work day would depend on the department I was scheduled to work in. If someone called in sick then I ended up having to work multiple locations, including cashiering. The rating of the management team depended on who the manager was. The store I worked for changed managers so often that it was a challenge to adjust to the new managements expectations. The most enjoyable part of the job was seeing all of the cute babies."
good,A typical day at the job would consist of attending costumers at the register. At the end of the day the team would all split up and clean our own sections of the store. The management at this specific Toys 'R' Us was pretty poor but however enjoyed my time with this company.
good,worked night and i was a stocker so i had to stock the shevels with toys and had to unload the trucks.my co workers were pretty good and friendly. I enjoyed the people i worked with and 3rd shift
good,I found it to be a fun and keep you on your toes fun. learned alot about the retail environment in my job.
good,its fum and busy all day lomg. whem workinh there team work is a must
good,"A typical day at work would consist of reviewing applications, taking follow up calls from applicants and reviewing the daily schedule for any gaps or call-ins."
good,"I absolutely loved this job because it gave me the opportunity to build relationships with the local OBGYNs and hospitals in Laredo. I visited with the doctors and handed out educational packets to their patients (new and expectant parents). I also partnered with the local hospitals and their birthing programs to increase local sales. I taught seminars in the store on caring for new borns, child car seat safety, as well as product knowledge on new products on the market. I worked minimally in the store and enjoyed making my own schedule. When the recession hit my position was on of the first to be eliminated due to the fact that Laredo is a small area ( population less than 200,000)"
good,"The management was great and if conflicts arose they helped me as much as they can. A typical day at work there was working in customer service by helping customers, answering phones, doing exchanges and returns and placing orders for items not in stock in the store. The most enjoyable part was seeing happy children and during the holiday season."
good,"Typical work was assisting pregnant women find the perfect furniture, bedding, clothes, etc for baby. I've learned the difference between baby products. Co-workers were very helpful and knowledgeable. The hardest part about my job was trying not to spend my entire paycheck on merchandise. The most enjoyable part of my job was being able to help parents and family members make memories for the child's future."
good,"While working for TRU it was an enjoyable experience while it lasted. I learned more ""people skills"" and also some casheir experience."
good,- fun place to work
good,"A typical day for me started out with checking my daily email, checking my daily reports and doing daily cycle counts. ( this is a count that is done everyday on high end products in the store to make sure the counts on them are correct.) After that I would walk around one department in the store everyday and scan all the items that we were either light on or out of stock. My job was to make sure all the counts in the store were correct and if items were coming in, it was my job to find out why. Part of my job was to also send out broken or returned items, and check in vendor items as well. I spent alot of time training people on how to use our scanners, unload trucks, backstock, and cashier."
good,"(Non season) In at 6 am to unload truck with several co-workers, unload merchandise to sales floor and re-merchandise product into isles."
good,"Fast pace, worked lots of hours during holiday season. Flexible schedule for college students, handling money properly and balancing the cash register in the end."
good,A typical day at work consists of assisting guests with their complaints and concerns. I have learned to help people to the best of my abilities and remain levelheaded and calm during difficult situations. The most enjoyable part of this job is the satisfaction the customers recieve because of my help.
good,"A typical day for me was to pick orders and load trucks, and in doing this the job got really repetitive."
good,Many improvements can be made if company is motivated to do so.
good,I think ToysRUs is an okay company to work for. If you're part-time then don't look for any benefits in the medical field. Unless you're working in a big city you probably won't make many hours only during seasonal periods will you make close to 40hrs. It's very hard to move up in the company because management does not communicate with the entry level employees
good,Enjoyed the short time working. But wasn't able to get full time hours
good,"Wasn't a very consitent job, Hardley no hours at the begining then they would give me a twelve hour shift, then my hours would be cut back again. It wasnt paying the bills , and mangement seemed just to really not care. But the people whom I worked with were all very helpful and caring they did all of my training while I was there."
good,I enjoyed working and being give the opportunity to advance toward my growth process with Toy R US. The work is steady and can be hard on the body around seasonal time. Overall I enjoyed the fast paste organization.
good,"I've worked there for about 3 years, very rare did a manager acknowledge my hard work and great customer service when customers would report to them. They never give you enough hours, and they don't pay enough."
good,Don't underestimate yourself always be self driven be a goal getter always be eager to learn and be challenged by what you doing  never give up until you get what you want
good,"The management wasn't very good, they treated their workers unfairly. The customers was always polite to the workers and always understood when the lines was long."
good,I had to quit because I was was only making enough toy get to work and back Nd buy lunch. We did win toys r us accessories if we got people to sign up for store cards
good,A Great job to start fresh out of high school. Fun and informative. Perfect second job. Was really busy during peak hours which is great but after Christmas season its really slow
good,"Forklift experience, hard worker, dependable, reliable, fast learner, computer skills, great attention to detail, multitasking a +, father of two kids,"
good,It was a fun job yet very stressful. I was hired for the Christmas season originally and I found that I and others were not trained properly. Once I was trained I found myself having to train others while dealing with customers. During the Christmas season the store hours get extended which was hard as I was often working until at least midnight. There was also no guarantee for when you would be leaving as you would have to stay until the store was clean and organized. Many times I was there for at least a hour after the store closed.
good,"Everybody would say it's because kids don't play with toys anymore or because amazon is ahead of the game, but the real issues were at store level. Toys R Us should've been an experience and not just a store. Walking in, everything was dusty and old. I was a manager and any time I had a question, other managers would not help me and tell me to look it up on our internet site, which none of them followed anyway. It was fun to work at but mostly cause management left me alone and I had the ability to make my own choices. Most of the employees were part time, so I know their experiences sucked more than mine. At one point I spoke to the store manager about going back to school and asked if my days off could be Tuesday and Thursday for classes and she told me no. I asked if I could possibly only work closings then so I could go to classes and she told me no, it wouldn't be fair to the other managers, so if that's what I wanted I would have to take a pay cut and become a cashier."
good,"Lazy employees, management does not seem to be involved with anything important, employees are seen as expendable and regardless of your work ethic or attitude, you are easily kept or fired based on personal preference on behalf of a select few, despite your numbers."
good,Stocking inventory putting toys on shelves where they belongs making sure customers find what they are looking for helping other workers stocking until my shift was over making sure trash wasnt on the floor
good,The most enjoyable parts of this job was meeting new people and putting smiles on the faces of children. The management staff was good. The hardest part of the job was working long hours after a 3 hour bus ride one way for low pay.
good,"Management was iffy once we hit liquidation, but I enjoyed working there. Everyone was welcoming; it really felt more like a family than a team. Just wish I got to work there longer."
good,Good job had to do alot of walking had to maintain areas clean. Schedule was never consistent always changed. Not many hours throughout the week. Pay was a little low.
good,Pretty typical compared with other retail jobs I've worked.  Good entry level skills learned that I've taken with me to other jobs.  Hours were assigned based on season (more around the holidays/less during the summer).
good,Having a 3rd shift job there made it more relaxed than the usual jobs i had. Friendly team and collaborative made it easy to learn and adjust to the job. Since I'm nocturnal made it way easier.
good,"Employment was temporary.  Management allowed younger set of employees to ""goof"" off more so older group had to cover needs.  Enjoyed learning about all the products."
good,Good entry level job to get into the workforce. Would recommend for individuals fitting the description or college student. Don't get stuck there though!
good,"I respected the staff, crew, and most importanly the customers. They spoke well and i Satisfied there needs by giving the correct information and advice around the toys store."
good,"I put 99% in every task i do."
good,"Overall, the company was a decent place to work. In my various roles, I had exposure to virtually every part of the business. The learning I took away from my interactions with the various facets of the organization allowed me to grow and continually improve both mine and my team's functionality within the organization. "
good,"conveyor pm, floor care, changing ,light bulbs,patching belts.operating machinery .helping other coworkers, changing ballasts stripping and waxing floors."
good,"It was a typical retail job, flexible hours and average pay. Managing retail stocks on the floor and in the back. Getting what customers wanted was very satisfying."
good,My time with Toys r Us was enjoyable. The employees and managers were all respectful and pleasant people who all helped each other and worked together. The environment was positive.
good,"Management at Toys ""R"" Us was very bad , there was issues with communication. There was some difficulty with my breaks. Sometimes my manager would not even give me breaks. Aside from that the company was great, I enjoyed working with children and toys."
good,"If you love making kids happy this the place the work for you . If a very fast pace job constantly changing , especially at Christmas when must of the guess make the big purchases."
good,I did not really enjoy working here because of how uncomfortable I felt. I felt as if though I was not welcomed and when I asked for help or a question I was looked down upon and treated as if though I was dumb. Not my favorite place
good,I didnt enjoy working for this company because of the stress and dysfunctional warehouse team who spammed the store with tonnes of stock which wasnt going to fit on the shop floor.
good,"It was an amazing first job, it wasn't stressful or difficult, and the people I worked with were amazing. If a team member needed any assistants doing anything we would all try and help the team member."
good,"it was great while it lasted. the hours were everywhere, we were working full time shifts and getting paid for part time, "
good,I joined at the busy part of the season and found it very enjoyable. Worked hard and was a top seller of merchandise. Gave me alot of enjoyment. Pushed development of the team and furthered the department to be the best in the company.
good,Company went bankrupt . Long hours. Poor benefits. Top management did not know how to change with times. Worked with some good people. Schedule could have been better
good,"Very sad that Toys R Us closed its doors for good. It was just like any retail job, even as the HR manager, I was often on the floor or at the customer service desk doing busy work."
good,This company is bankrupt. Indeed should not require a 150 character review. You will not get a job here because there are no jobs to be had. This company is closed.
good,"It was a fun first time job, but pay was not good, no chance to move up since they mainly hired outside rather than with in, hours were not the best. They didn't have the best training but they did train on a few items, but it was up to you to do outside training on others if you wanted to know about them."
good,working there as a cashier was great but there wasn't many customers due to the fact everyone had started ordering everything online rather than coming into the store because it was cheaper online
good,I worked with Toys R Us for over two years an almost all of the employees were nice and welcoming when I stared and I quickly became apart of the team. The company however did not put their employees first. The executives that worked for the region and were in contact with my managers had no concern for our safety or well being. The only cared about money and numbers
good,"It was great working with my team as a family for the 2 years I worked for Toys R Us, it was horrible going through liquidation and not receiving any support along the way from upper management. I've never been more disappointed in a corporation run business."
good,"there isn't much to be said aside from the typical retail experience, low pay, high hours, short breaks, and nasty customers. Not the worst place to work and solely because of staff."
good,It was a fun place to work while I was there but they have recently gone out of business.  It was very stressful from November to January due to holiday business.
good,"They're no longer in business so I don't think a review is pertinent to anyone.  They were a good place to work if you needed flexibility, and did not count on the job to pay your bills"
good,"Busy and hard working IT Department"
good,"Every day I've worked for Toy's R Us has been an adventure.  Unfortunately with the business closing it is sad to see what was once an adventure be torn apart.  This childhood memory will be turned to dust and swept under the rug because of online shopping."
good,They were a good company that got me started in my career. They offered chances to advance within the company. it was easy to transfer from one location to another if you needed.
good,"Lo mejor de Toysrus, es su calidad formando equipos y sabiendo transmitir unos objetivos comunes a nivel empresarial. "
good,It had a very fun and relaxed work environment. I enjoyed going to work each day. Even though I was only there for a seasonal position I enjoyed the people I worked with.
good,"i learned that this place is not the place you would want to work for a seasonal time. believe me, you will go nuts when Christmas comes around because most of the time you don't exactly get out at the time your suppose to."
good,It was tough to learn everything about the store in such a little amount of time but mangers and co-workers helped out a lot. It was fun but hours were cut short every week.
good,every day there is something new to keep you busy. Constant changes in merchandise keeps you on your toes.The merchandising can be a fun challenge that I enjoy.
good,Toys R Us was a good job. I Really had like working with my co-workers and seeing the kids and toys. We had cute uniforms and the hours wasn't that long.
good,"Working at Toys R Us was an interesting experience. It was my first job and I started during the Christmas holidays. We were very busy in the beginning, that was the most enjoyable part of my job, the hardest part was dealing with irate customers. The store manager was awesome, however the assistant store managers were hard to deal with.  Workplace culture was basic retail, a typical day at work involved restocking shelves, assisting customers on the floor and cashiering.  Being that this was my first job , I learned how to do retail and how to have and maintain responsibility."
good,It’s a good place to work as a seasonal employee or part time employee  but not for the long run.  Really hard to get promoted and become a full time employee
good,Was a great toy store. Fun place to work.  Great selection. Store is closing in the next few months. In the process of liquidation.  It will be a sad day when the close for the last day.
good,"dealing with staff on a daily basis setting out a work floor plan to show where people are working."
good,"Toys R US was a great place to work. It offered nice pay and solid benefits. Unfortunately there were a lot of poor decisions made over the years that caused the company to go out of business, I did enjoy my Career with them."
good,Working in a retail enviroment can be hard for many people. It can be slow-paced in the off season and shift into high gear for only a few months. It requires an employee to be flexible in both their work hours and how they do their job. I felt Toys R Us did a good job in training me to be a great employee but the lack of advancement opportunities and low pay made it hard to recommend.
good,"At the store level the teams are great."
good,"Co workers make the experience and they worked around my schedule but other wise the push for credit cards, some very angry managers and no incentives was not great. Bitter sweet to see toysrus shut down."
good,company closing - the company went bankrupt because the corporate people didn't  listen to the in store workers. They didn't sell the correct items or were late selling hot items.
good,Was the lack of help from management when it came to actually getting work done. It was the delegate game. Positions were given to you without warning and without proper paperwork so proper pay was never given.
good,"While I had a wonderful time working at the company, it was evident in the long run that it would not last. Working for the company was a life changing experience, but it was only measured by the manger at the current time."
good,"Toys R Us/Babies R Us are closing their doors."
good,It is easy to be persuaded by the large campus and cafeteria when you first come to interview. Management is poor but the people are why you stay. Make sure to ask questions about opportunitys and functionality of your team.
good,"After 10 + years at this organization, I have learned a lot to help me with my career.  I have had exposure to many cross-functional roles and have met a large group of amazing peers and mentors."
good,Clean place and nice mangers cool co workers they work with u with your schedule if it does not work sometime. But if looking for good pay it's not the place.
good,Corporate made too many changes not in the best interest of keeping the stores making a profit. Had a great team at the store location I was happy to be a part of. The store manager was the best ever.
good,"Overall, I had a fun working experience working at TRU. I was cross trained in every position. I learned a lot of how retail works; pricing, advertisement, sales, customer service,etc. The coworkers were marvelous to work with as we finished tasks quickly and thoroughly. A good experience was learning all available positions."
good,The holiday season is a difficult time of year for retail.  Its barely controlled chaos at times.  I worked with some really terrific people at the store who were willing to jump in to help each other get through the chaos.
good,"I honestly love the Toy brand but due to some changes and being understaffed it has been a challenged.  "
good,"Its a failing industry, with a lot of retail business being done on line the company didn't invest enough into that portion of the business. This would have allowed them to be more competitive with Amazon and other big box retailers like Wal-Mart and Target."
good,"Management was great. Great experience. Training was quick and easy. The interview was professional and fun. Did not have any bad experiences, everything went smoothly."
good,"While Toys R Us is a fun company to work for it is definitely like any other retail job out there. You clock in, work your tail off, clock out, and go home. I will remember the people I met while working there more than the job itself."
good,The company just announced the closing of 180 stores.  This makes the environment difficult at this time.  Customer service is very important and can be rewarding to assist parents in making the right purchasing decisions for their family.
good,"A typical night would include: unloading a truck, sorting each box to the appropriate aisle, unboxing all boxes corresponding to that aisle and section of the store. "
good,I was excited to start with Toys R Us and it was pretty much what I expected.  As a salaried manager you work a lot of ever changing hours and you don't get paid overtime.
good,"Typical of company as big as Toys R Us. Possibility for job advancement but company is always worried about the bottom line in terms of cost for themselves. "
good,Very fast paced and dealing a lot with customers always getting your attention. Need to deal with customers quickly and effectively while doing whatever your manager told you to do.
good,The team didn't like outsiders (new employees) and I was a new employee.  Survived long enough to get another job.  Had one exceptional manager and he and I keep in contact still.
good,"For working only seasonal it was a very good experience and still is. I enjoy my co-workers, and how good the vibes are around there. And the how positive the environment is. It has been very great!"
good,it was ok management was bad. they still have a couple things to work on. the store looks good but theres no leadership at all. everybody does there own thing.
good,"As a manager be prepared to work fast past and long hours. Employees need to know their job well and  have plenty of patience when dealing with the customers. The customers can be rude ,mean and disrespectful at time. Employees need to think fast and move fast."
good,"I'm a permanent employee at Toys R Us and for my job, stock crew, during the thanksgiving/Christmas season the hours are great. But after Christmas, you get about 10 hours a week maybe. So this is a great seasonal job but if you want to stay with the company, you'll have to deal with poor hours. I've been working here for a little more than a year now and I continue to stay because I actually enjoy working there. Its a friendly environment if you're doing your job right but the people there are pretty great. The hardest part of the job is after season with the decrease of hours and sometimes when you are working during the season, they schedule you a lot to unload the trucks and that can really burn some people out. Management is also good, my manager is pretty laid back and understanding."
good,"Decent Job for over the Holidays. But Management can be very difficult to get along with. And if you need to miss for any reason at all, you better be able to prove it right then or they will not allow you to come back even if it is for a funeral."
good,"Stressful, not supportive. Not much training. Management not always knowledgeable. Company in trouble. Employees pulled in too many directions, do not get to complete needed jobs"
good,"It is a good company to work for if you plan to also attend school such as i did. However, there is not much room for advancement and hours can be very difficult to get if you are a part time employee."
good,"Management could have been more involved in the overseeing of the stores success, but the co-workers were amazing. Everyone stayed motivated and kept sales up!"
good,"I usually only worked about 3-4 days a week , literally less than 20 hours a week. Hours definitely suck UNLESS  you're a supervisor of the floor or manager. I've learned a lot though. I actually started learning the whole HR process and how to conduct an interview and the onboarding process that they do. and learning registry was also fun"
good,Overall it is a great place to work but there is an unfair workload on individuals due to a reduction in headcount but generally a good moral around the office.
good,"Inventory control, cashier and customer service. Learned to handle multiple jobs at once. Management was hands on but not always available to answer questions when needed. Work was fast paced as team size was small."
good,"A typical work day starts by offloading merchandise truck , separating it and placing on sales floor, and then saving extra in back of house. Completing good housekeeping."
good,Fun place for teens to work their first job. Salary is very low. Laid back environment and flexible schedules that work well for students. Gets crazy during holidays be ready.
good,"This company are ok to work for however they do push for a number of targets ie: gold cards, bags, batteries, certain items. Sometimes there are so many items to push that you forget the customer."
good,Toys R Us overnight stocking get good pay. It can be difficult around Black Friday and Christmas because it's a lot of things you will have to stock for the holidays.
good,Highpace work environment. Learned many skills from customer service to inventory management and management skills as well. Hours are very flexible but lost of work for the pay.
good,I got to meet a lot of new people while working here they were pretty friendly. They were helpful in their training and it didn't take long to learn everything.
good,Very fun place to work with the right set of coworkers and customers. Managers were not very helpful when there was atleast 3 at all times. Fun to make a customers day when having a particular item.
good,". A typical day in TRU can be entertaining, there's always work to be completed so you're never bored!"
good,"during the christmas season is the worst, during the year you still have to deal with crazy customers and worrying about making metrics. theres always pressure on you to make metrics i.e. credit card applications and warranty sales."
good,"register"
good,Store manager was always helpful. He was laid back but always made sure work got done. He was fair. The hours were not many unless it was December which only around the holidays was I able to work 7-8 hour days multiple times a week.
good,"Its a cool job , as a kid i always went to toys r us. So getting the chance to work there was pretty awesome. I would rather be goin in there to buy something then work there though."
good,"overall it was a great experience work as a assistant manager for Baby's R Us. I started as a dept. supervisor and worked my way up to the top, by being the best employee I could be always giving 150%"
good,"It was a very organized environment.  The boss was strict, but things normally ran smoothly because of it.  People were usually very eager to help, but there were a lot of employees, so it wasn't super personable.  Just your typical retail job."
good,"You get plenty of hours if you are available, however the pay isn't fantastic and its fairly hard work. If you aren't a good salesperson or don't want to, you wont last no matter what position you have. You are going to work every single holiday. If you close, you won't leave on time, it often takes an additional hour or two to close the store, during the holidays you can work up to 6 hours overtime. Management is strict but fair, they have no issue working with you as long as you communicate with them. If you work hard they will consider promoting you fast as long as your available. However if you want weekends or holidays off, forget it. Customers also tend to be exceedingly rude. I only ever got 2 actual complaints from customers but main cashiers will get them daily for things beyond their control."
good,the most enjoyable part of the job was the other coworkers worst was dealing with extremely poor management constantly changing being replaced and the new guys not knowing what to do.
good,"The warehouse job I was assigned to was quick-paced and physically demanding but fair and enjoyable. It was easy, simple and repetitive. Those that are used to hard work will find this place to be familiar. Occasionally, there will be heavy boxes to lift but there is always someone that is willing to help. The workers are friendly and hard working. The job becomes tiresome after a long and busy day but I leave content, knowing that I have done a good honest day's work."
good,"Manager was extremely rude and he did not care for him employees needs or requests. They do not show you, your clock in times so you kind of have to keep track. Overall an ""ok"" place to work."
good,"Let's just say this:  if you are out of work, by all means apply and go there.  If you have a job, be leery:  things are going poorly, morale is horrible after a big layoff, rumors of future layoffs are rampant"
good,It was a very fast pace job. The work I had to do was very inconsistent and I had to fill in for other employees on several accounts but it was still manageable.
good,Most days consisted of unloading a truck. And i did not learn to much besides sorting boxes. The other employees were very friendly though so that was a huge plus.
good,"With the amount of people laid off, and the amount of people who are leaving, it's a big workload on the folks who are left.  But with the right amount of staff, it's a good place to work."
good,"I would not work for Toys R Us again unless I absolutely needed to for financial reasons.  The position was great for learning how to multitask and interact directly with consumers and customers.  However, the compensation was only minimum wage and there is very limited opportunity to move up within the company.  For example, when our store needed a new manager, the company hired an individual who had experience as an assistant manager for another retailer, rather than promoting an assistant manager to be a store manager from within the company."
good,"Fun place, smart people, almost no job security. A great deal of coordination with several departments. A lot of knowledge on retail business. Good in-house amenities."
good,The management was friendly as well as some of the works. The environment was chaotic sometimes especially with the events all the time. There are many positions available. Try to get into one that fits you.
good,its a great place to work. most of the people are great. though management makes questionable decision. the training is horrible. jobs easy. meet a lot of interesting people.
good,"Unfortunately Toysrus did not make a profit this year and the employees are paying the price. Team members have taken demotions and their raises have been retracted.  The coverage is very low in the store, and the employees and working harder than ever.  The wages are not competitive with the other retail stores in the area and they believe they can make up for this by engagement activities for the employees .  Cashiers are under high pressure secondary sales; such as, credit cards, rewards programs, and protection plans. "
good,"I worked as a front end cashier for the first 6 months of my employment with TRU. It wasn't bad, and it was decent pay for someone still going to school and such. During the holiday season, I was put in the electronics section and that's when the job became a little more strenuous. As I began to learn more skills in the store (replenishing items, marking items to be put on the floor, et cetera) they began to use me to fill holes. For example, if they didn't have a cashier that day, they would still put me in electronics but keep me on standby as a front end cashier. I did not mind helping out a little bit, but when it got to the point that they wouldn't schedule a cashier on a busy weekend day just because other staff members knew how to ring up guests, it got a little ridiculous. It also prevented things from getting done quickly, as I would have to drop what I was doing to go help the front of the store. "
good,"Was working with the team I had there.  We were a small team but we accomplished a lot in the short time I was there.  We were a tight group of 20 associates that really cared about one another.   We had our disagreements, but we found ways to work through them and continue to grow as a team."
good,"Campus is amazing "
good,Working for Toys Rus was fun and and working with the people was great. Some of the work load is fair but to the point they add to much for the stockers
good,"I only worked there for just under two months as a seasonal employee, so I probably don't really know much about the place in the long-run, but I will say it was a mixed bag as far as how I felt about it. My coworkers were friendly and we all got along well, and the majority of the customers were pleasant to interact with, and the job itself was one that made me feel like I had a bit of responsibility. My only real complaint is about some of the management. I don't know if this is a common thing at Toys 'R' Us, but where I was, the way the place was managed felt unimpressive. I liked most of the management as people, but there was quite a lack of communication between them and the lower down workers, which often resulted in confusion. We also had a number of incidents of shoplifting, being a toy store in the middle of Holiday season and all. I'd recommend it as a job if you're struggling to find one elsewhere."
good,"Every store is different, and every day is different depending on MoD. I love my coworkers, but some managers can be overbearing and there are some rules I don't agree with, but different store managers definitely make all the difference. I started as a seasonal cashier, and 6 months later I'm a permanent employee now, so work ethic is recognized and rewarded. As a cashier, they go almost solely on ""metrics"" AKA credit cards, warranties, and rewards sign ups. All in all, I love my job, the people I work with... But with any workplace, there are bad days. If you can upsell, you'll excel."
good,Sometimes there's nothing to do but refix shelves that aren't messed up. There's not much to do sometimes so it can be pretty boring. Coworkers were nice and friendly. But overall pretty boring job.
good,no issues. got hired and moving on up. everyone is friendly and ready and willing to help when needed. staff pleasant to all staff
good,"It was fun working at Toys 'R' Us, however, not a lot of customers, mostly customers would come in asking for electronics vs actual toys. Security was bad though. A lot of people often stole lots of things from the store."
good,"Not much to say since it was for a short period of time. The job was simple. Lots of walking and on your feet all day long, but got to interact with guests and that was nice. No micromanagement, yet that does not mean to lack off either. The job is a great job to make money if you are in need of a job. I would like advancement is an option just do not know of that process or time frame."
good,"I have been trained in every department at Toys R Us. I started as a cashier, then i trained for COSA and shipments and even the price changer but there really wasnt much of a chance to grow."
good,Toys R Us is a great organization with some of the most intelligent individuals that are in the business industry. I enjoyed the constant drive for additional strategies to increase sales and profits.
good,A typical day at Toys R Us felt energetic fun and a good environment to learn what it is like working a seasonal job during Christmas.
good,A typical day for me would be taking money and checking out people after they find items suitable for them . I better my customer service skills during this job . I also learned how to hold my calm with management
good,"My Job at Toys R Us was the best job I ever had however, management don't roster you on enough for shifts and don't offer full-time or part-time very often even to those whom would jump at the offer. apart from the above the environment is very friendly and most of the employees are easy going but extremely hard working individuals and the mixed cultures within the establishment is amazing. I learned a lot from mostly the floor staff that have worked in the business many years such as the first ins and outs of retail like names of the shelving units, how to use a pallet jack and even how to replenish stock at a fast pace."
good,"Co-workers are easy to get along with, some more than others. Management is great as well just as long you do your job. Customers are just as friendly if you are."
good,"Loss Prevention needs to be more of a focus for the company, and better training before getting mad that it was done wrong."
good,"Overall fun place to work, co-workers mostly have a fun and energetic personality. Management may have problems scheduling sometimes but when done correctly, work is a place that the workers want to be."
good,I don't mind the place.. But the communication is very very horrible. They already had four people quit in a week. Not a place I recommend anyone
good,"This was my first job where I was able to use my hands and building skills. Though the job was seasonal, I don't think I was given a fair chance to keep the job."
good,hardest part of the job is working different shifts on a daily basis and keeping up with work during the christmas holidays
good,This was my first experience in the workforce. My coworkers were pleasant. Very easy job with a good environment as well.
good,"Toys R Us ist eine sehr gute Firma, leider können nicht Familienmitglieder zusammen beim Toys R Us zusammenarbeiten, was auch verständlich ist. Das Arbeitsklima ist der Urzeit und der Saison entsprechend."
good,Toys R Us offers a fast paced environment for all levels of positions. They offer a lot of opportunities to grow and expand roles withing the company.
good,i had a good time working for toys r us meet a lot of good peoples learn a lot of things like how to pack and unpack the store good management and job culture i would there again if imget the change
good,"The Digital business has undergone a significant changing of the guard.  New CTO, CIO, and all Director level positions in both IT and the Business.  Many consultants were brought in by the new leaders to ""Assess"" the business."
good,"always busy"
good,"Store becomes a violent workplace very frequently because of the guests that comes in and steals. They get violent with the employees and sometimes get physical with them when trying to prevent theft, leaving the employees in danger because of lack of security or asset protection."
good,"I spent a year working here and the best parts were that my co-workers were very friendly, helpful, and welcoming. As a student, they were very flexible with my schedule and made sure that most of my hours were met. This is a good place to work for someone who needs more flexible hours."
good,Enjoyed working with Babies R us. Favorite part was working with soon to be mom's. Loved my co workers. Gained a lot of experience with this company. Hardest part was closing at the end of the day and holidays.
good,"Some workers work part-time, while others work full-time. Yes, you work full-time, that doesn't mean you trash talk the establishment over headsets and bully other coworkers because you're angry. "
good,Management turnover is too high and some employees are just there to get a check and do as little as possible not cool i want to be the best even if its cleaning toilets and don't like the fact the the early shift can just leave without finishing tasks or leaving legible notes on what they were doing for the closer to finish while the closers have to stay late and if your off at 4pm you can leave and not tell anyone not cool
good,It was great start off with and after the holidays but during the holidays they just hire anyone and with that there was a lot of Call ins and we where always short handed.
good,"Busy, non stop work but not difficult tasks. good vibes from other employees also respect giving throughout the team members."
good,At first Can be stressful as they want you to sell sell sell credit cards even when your uncomfortable doing so. When you didn't sell them they would throw you under the bus. Once you got past that not a bad place to work.
good,The job was wonderful it was the manager that pushed me away. I got sick and was unable to work and my manager was not very friendly
good,"worked each day stocking shelves, greeting guests, and running registers.i learned to use the technology they had required to scan products and shipments"
good,"I liked working for Toys R Us. I have been working there for 10 1/2 yrs. There have been many times a job has come up that I have done many times, I was told recently that I was not getting to move up at all due to the fact that I was not replaceable on the register because I get the metrics for the store even though I am qualified for the positions that became available to me. I wanted a change to advance in my work."
good,I enjoyed working there but was only hired on for a seasonal position. I only worked for two months during the Christmas season. It was my very first job. they had sent me an invite to come back for the seasonal position again but I never went back to work there again because I wanted a permanent  job.
good,Overall a productive work environment with great managers and great training methods however longer breaks should be required for the amount of hours given.
good,It is pretty difficult to keep your productivity numbers up. Some things don't seem to score you correctly. Management and co workers are great. Most days you drive MHE and put pallets away.
good,Management is okay depending on who you work with. Co-workers are nice. No chance to better yourself. I learned how to drive MHE and use a RF scanner. A typical day you report to your manager and get your assignment for the day. Check out your MHE equipment and scanner then begin working
good,I enjoyed the customer interaction at this job. A fun and friendly place to work. the only downside was the short notice of working hours.
good,"My typical day at work was mostly filled with doing reshop(restocking,basically).Followed by organizing shelves or a ""zone"".This being my first job I learned how to cooperate with my fellow employees and not goof off . My co workers were mostly lazy as far as i could tell,none truly wanted to be there and when they were there they didn't do anything,but talk to one another. Management was ""okay?"" Really two of the managers were very picky and one didn't seem to care at all. One manager seemed to make my co workers fear her ,but she was really the nicest to me.The most enjoyable part of my experience was the satisfaction of seeing people find what they're looking for."
good,"Its a great starting job. The company is fairly easy to move up in. The general management can be sketchy with how useful they are, some of them are really good though."
good,I just think that you need patience to deal with the costumers and you have to have good time management when its time to check out the costumers.
good,"Great job experience, company was going through a transition and trying to survive the buy out and changes, to many unresolved issue with the new but out process, lots of payroll issue and in stock problems too."
good,"Comfortable and fun work place/environment. Need to get the numbers, we compete against other cities. Rules are meant to be enforced at all times. Hours are okay, they may ask for overtime workers last minute. Overall, great people, very helpful and informative crew. We play a game every so often to reward us of our efforts and that brings us closer. With all the great people, it lets the time go by faster and smoother. Customers can only be a pain when they don't understand our policies, but that's okay."
good,It was cool. very laxed and you were given a reasonable task to do with enough time to complete it. Only worked fthere for the summer. im sure holiday season is hectic
good,"Constantly being spread thin with not enough workers each shift. Had to cover two departments on busy nights, being pulled left and right. Basically too much responsibility and work with little pay and not enough hours. Co-workers were nice and fun."
good,Work was pretty tough had to get a certain amount of pallets out by a certain time in the morning. It was great experience though and I appreciate it to this day.
good,"During my time at toys r us, I witnessed a lot of unfair behavior from the managers to the employees. The managers showed favoritism and made work hard for others. The customers were extremely rude being new parents and not enough sleep but the managers made it no better and did not support the employers. The only good thing about working here was my interaction with expectant mothers and the hours."
good,"Toys R Us is a great place to work when its during the busy season. During October to the end of December, its really busy. During the rest of the year its pretty dead."
good,Toys R Us was a great. When the company went private the culture changed and the company struggled. Loved the holiday season. There's nothing like it retail.
good,"Made some of my best friends here."
good,"I enjoyed being amongst customers, helping them find the suitable toys required and to make there shopping experice enjoyable and easy. I enjoyed being on the tills. Co workers were extremely boring and all looked bored and depressed. I like a happy work force and fun people to be around. Working with the public personality is a must!"
good,Long days and high expectations. It's a good place to work if you love working hard. Self motivation is a must. Teams can be great to work with. Company has good intentions but falls short with the execution.
good,"It is a great place to work if you're in school because they're willing to work with your schedule. If you're not in school then I suggest looking elsewhere because they do not give many hours, usually 12-20 hours off season. "
good,Team is well put together. Team knows products well to suggest it to guests. The best part is that the workers get to see kids smile with their new toys.
good,"Great place to work, very nice and friendly. I've learned a lot about toys and video games. Co-workers were very nice and respectful. The best part about this job was making the customers happy and want to come back."
good,"Unreal expectations for cashier involvement of sales add ons, credit card sign ups. Demanding work times no work/life balance, lack of payroll to staff store correctly."
good,"managers either make or break the experience. Work is easy enough and the pay reflects that. Advancement while possible, is very hard and not rewarding. Co workers were some of my best friends while I worked there."
good,"A typical day at work could be anything. Everything is so fluid, you really don't know what you're doing from one day to the next. I can honestly say that I've learned every area in the store. Management can be difficult to work with at times, and the managers who try to look out for the best interests of the team are often snuffed out by those who don't. Most of my co-workers are a joy to work with, but there are one or two who spoil it for everyone else. The hardest part of the job is feeling like I have very little support from those in charge, but the most enjoyable part is making customers happy."
good,"For the work you have to do and the hours that are offered to part-time employees, you really have to want to work here. I was a backroom worker, constantly being pulled up to the register because actual cashiers couldn't be bothered."
good,"Honestly, I enjoy working around the toys and items, and I enjoy learning about the new products that are to be stocked whenever I'm given the opportunity to view Product Knowledge Programs. The job can be a little scary as I have to deal with some rough personalities; people who are seriously bent on stealing items or causing trouble in the store. Being ""unarmed security"" with no combat training, and the restriction of not even being able to apprehend such people, makes the job somewhat unnerving at times. If I had more support from Corporate and management, more stability in terms of our hours and pay, I would recommend the position as a good place to begin your life in the workforce or a decent part-time job."
good,"Work environment was highly interactive with daily communication with guests and co-workers.  Highly energetic with a great team of co-workers.  Lack of communication and leadership make it a difficult environment to learn new things, but provides a bonding of co-workers."
good,This was a good place to work very fun. The managers were very helpful and understanding. I wished I was full time instead of seasonal because when my time was up I missed the place.
good,My first job out of High School and I work for them until I had to move to Colorado and then I just transferred to here. The management was good but sometime they wouldn't listen to you especially if you had a family problem they didn't care.
good,This job wasn't all that bad but it does teach you to have patience because there are a lot of people or customers that will not know what they want an it can become very frustrating. Its best to have patience with everyone which is really the key behind it all.
good,"I absolutely love every part of working for this company. However, the pay is not great at all (minimum wage to start out) and raises are hard to come by. Great for a 2nd job or seasonal job. Management is fantastic as well."
good,"I had targets to make each day and enjoyed the challenge on meeting my goals. I done very well in this."
good,I learned how to work a cashier and about what it's like to work in retail. It wasn't the worst experience but unless you enjoy being in a very fast-paced environment you may not get many hours if you're new.
good,A good job with a lot of flexability. IAt the time I was looking for more of a career and going back to school. A very fun and energetic environment that kept me looking forward to going to work
good,under staffed and poor customer service unprofessional sales rep. I tried to treat each customer with respect. Very unorganized and not enough employees to handle the work load.
good,"Easy job, rude managers. Managers will never be on your side as always. But what do you expect from a customer service base company. Don't let it get to you. Was accused of things I didn't do. Hardest part was just accepting everything even if it was true."
good,"I was an cashier but also worked guest services, I stocked items, I greet customers, handled money, the hardest part of my job was the way the managers attitudes were towards workers."
good,"Generally, every day of work is the same: come in, clock on, do a walk-through of the store to recover and see if customers need help, ring up customers, repeat. It's very nice for people who don't mind repetition. If the managers had any special instructions or projects, they let you know and you get it done. They are quite easy to get along with as well, and are very friendly and understanding. The team members, unfortunately, tend to be rather lazy, and frequently stand behind the counter doing nothing, even when there is work to be done. It can be quite irritating when there's just been a truck and product needs to be worked out from then back. The hardest part of the job is probably emptying the truck, just because there is so much to do. However, It also is one of the most enjoyable parts of the job because I get to talk openly with my coworkers without worrying about customers."
good,"A typical day at work begins with checking which department I reside in during the day. Then it continues by helping guests find and choose which toy or gift that they are best looking for. Stocking and re-filling the shelves with product during the day are the rest of my duties."
good,loved this company only time you can get hours is during season or if your management.
good,"Retail "
good,"the management was very wasteful of my time "
good,"I loved helping customers and seeing children, seeing a child's smile is a real benefit in any job I come across. Co workers were friendly and willing to help when I didn't understand. I would say nothing was hard about the job, just wish the scheduling was more consistent."
good,"Very busy from start to finish, not a lot of help. worked at cash register, handled money, restocked selling floor, loaded/unloaded trucks, & censored product"
good,stock merchandise and products at Babies R' Us also did inventory for the back store warehouse and counted and organized them too.  Helped customers with certain products to their cars i.e cribs and things of that sort.  Also help keep the store in order and help customers with whatever item they be looking for
good,"i come in and get my work n unload trucks"
good,"My employment with Toys R Us would involved working as a cashier, or the sales floor. When business was slow I would be requested to face inventory and stock returns. When business would increase, I would work as a cashier. Many days required facing inventory and check out customers. I always assisted customers to locate products and answer their questions while on duty."
good,"You come in an hour before closing time and assist other employees in the clean-up, and once a week, help with unloading trucks and properly storing them within the warehouse. After closing time, warehouse stock is brought out to restock necessary shelves, racks or tables. After the sales floor has been properly stocked, the warehouse is cleaned up and reorganized for the next evening, and dispose of all garbage and recyclables."
good,"Fun logistics day walking through the distribution warehouse seeing """
good,"My job as a cashier allows me to encounter many different individuals. Its never a dull moment as a cashier in a toy store. Although the management shows favoritism in who they give hours too, I enjoy the majority of my co-workers."
good,"I feel that the situation I was placed in was a bit unfair, the General Manager hired me then seemed to go on bi-weekly vacations which would leave me with responsibilities I hadn't been groomed to handle at the time.  While I did have support from my associates it did become overbearing."
good,I enjoyed the holidays because there were so many customers coming in all times of the day and night just to find the perfect toy for their kids and I adore that. There wasn't anything I didn't like about the job. My co-workers and I are were very comfortable with each other and My manager was also my friend.
good,"Great co-workers, good work culture and environment."
good,"its a good place to work at, however I noticed that management would show obvious favouritism to certain workers and would treat the others unfairly. a typical day at work would be busy and exciting, the most enjoyable part of working there would be bringing joy to children by showing them all the latest toys."
good,"Helping ringing up customers and stocking shelves. Working for this company is great for customer service experience,"
good,"Fun place to work, but pay is low and minimal opportunity for advancement. Company is failing."
good,"Not enough hours some weeks, but a good first job. Its pretty straight forward work. You're on your feet most of the time. Seasonal you make the most money and its the most busy around the end of November."
good,This is a Great place to work for young adults or anyone who loves kids and toys.
good,"Pile a ton on your plate without giving you proper training or time to complete everything. Ontop of that they don't give the store enough hours to keep it staffed appropriately. Most of the co-workers are great and 75% of the guests are too, but the stress of the job sometimes makes it hard to enjoy."
good,Enjoyed working with the company for the holiday season of 2012. Were not many opportunities to stay after the holiday season but was still a decent place to work.
good,"start with re-shop then help another team member with something then back to re-shop, and at the end of the day clean and take out trash. I learned how to work with others and customers but it helped realize that was not a job for me. the co-workers and managers were nice and very helpful. the hardest part was bouncing around from task to task. the most enjoyable part was re-shop because I like being organized."
good,"Most days are spent working on multiple tasks with minimal tools and no definite guidelines to follow. I have learned the basic means of what a retail job implies and the sacrifices that are called upon oneself.  High turnover rate for management, but we usually receive descent to polite attitudes and some professional and knowledgeable leadership skills. I appreciate the highly flexible schedule. Most of my co-workers do not stay with the company for more than a year before moving on to other things."
good,"I started as a Department Supervisor and was responsible for the largest department in the store. My tasks included making sure that my department was always cleaned and fully stocked. I rotated in new products while marking down in price older products so that as new inventory came into the store I always had adequate space to display everything. During resets I had to rearrange entire sections of my department by reorganizing entire shelves and taking all the out dated and expired products off the floor while making sure that the new products were properly displayed and labeled for the guest. "
good,"Even though it gets busy, the people make you feel comfortable shopping and make the shopping experience easy."
good,"It was fun while it lasted at first everything was great we went through so many changes in just a month or two. Managers and associates quiting like crazy, everything was very disorganized overall I just want better."
good,"A very productive and active,quick as well as enjoyable.Music is played through out warehouse with voting of choices is encouraged .  Gameroom,AC/Lunchroom as well as Dish TV"
good,being xmas period it was busy and had to be fast to keep everyone satisfied but friendly fun place
good,"Come in to Work And Unload the truck that came in."
good,I was happy working in the store by organizing toys and baby care items and helping expecting parents. It felt great to put smiles on those kids' faces.
good,Great company overall. Your perception can change quickly with the wrong fit of leadership though!
good,While I was there management changed hands and people were leaving left and right. They want you to learn everything but they do not want to pay you a good wage for it. They will pull you from your department to go cashier and then have to go catch up your area.
good,not a kid person....too many loud screaming babies and kids that misbehave....it was so out of control i switched my position to the overnight stock.... thats probably the best position there
good,A typical day at work was working with people and making sure their experience was pleasant. Hardest part of the job was climbing to the top of the ladder to stock boxes. The enjoyable part was meeting new people including co-workers
good,Loved the traveling that was involved when I participated in store openings
good,"It was a nice experience to have working there but, the only down side was the management. Most of the time nothing seemed under control"
good,"Toys R Us is a great company to work for if you are looking for a first job. It will introduce you to unrealistic job expectations, provide many challenges that may overwhelm you, and teach you how to deal with the public."
good,"Toys R us is a great place to work ,  Iove doing anything that involves children.   Helping new moms get ready for the arrival of there baby."
good,"Sincerely, the experience was very normal, it was the typical warehouse job, but the better experience I got there was the atmosphere with my co-workers."
good,Toys R Us is an awesome place to  work if you have children. THe only downside is the crazy holiday hours that they expect you to work. The fact that you are schedule for five hours so you have no breaks but end up there over 8 hours with no break at all just sucks.
good,"typical day includes cashiering,sales floor and cleaning and straightening the store"
good,"I loved the people I worked with, most of them. I can NOT say that I preferred my manager. I have certain times I can work, that I had stated upon being hired and they did anything but work with me. Overall my coworkers were like family and my job is amazing, except for the management."
good,"A positive work place, cool environment, good co-workers to work with and lots of toys, YES!"
good,When working at Toys R Us I would clock in first thing and get my cash register drawer to make sure it was ready to go and that it was even with the receipt for the day. I learned that no matter what to make sure you look at what the customer is giving you and that way if you enter the wrong numbers into the register you can count back the cash to the customer because at the end of the day your drawer needs to equal what your receipts say. When working at Toys R Us I talked to my co-workers but working there I just felt uncomfortable. The hardest part about that job was getting the big items into the bags or through their isles and the most enjoyable part of the job was getting to see the kids with a smile on their face when they got what they wanted.
good,It was my second job of the day. Major work was to charge customers and watching my embers area always clean and in order. Help in closing the shop to do the balancing of cash register and accommodate the toys were misplaced.
good,bonuses friendly customers great supervisors seeing all new items advertised before customers
good,Great for seasonal work horrible in the off seasons. They don't care about your hours.
good,a typical day at toys r us is always over joyed because I get to play with the kids and interact with parents on which toys to pick
good,"The RUS Corporation has great growth potential but once you become salary you have a very poor work/life blend.  I enjoy most working with my guest.  I have shared a lot of time and stories with my guests, they are the best part of my job.  Overall I have a great manager who is great a train and is very knowledgeable.  I have learned a lot over the years from my store manager.  I am able to run the store alone with Toys R Us is in their busy season."
good,"* tills * shop floor * customers * trolleys * meeting and greeting on main door"
good,"they only hire part time, and most dont even get 8 hours a week."
good,"During my time working here i learned many things very useful for future jobs including many great things that helped me complete my task and duties for this job."
good,I enjoyed the variety of jobs I was able to do in the store. I worked in many different departments and worked well with other employees. The managers were usually good about working with their employees' schedules.
good,A fun job with fun staff if you are like a big kid this is the job for you.
good,"Well the actual store in itself was very busy so there was always something to do and time did pass fast. On the whole the atmosphere was not great but that may have been due to the people working there at the time and lack of management support and communication. I processed delivery, dealt with refunds and exchanges, served on the till, worked on various departments to increase sales etc."
good,"Every work day, the employees have smiles and willing to help one another.  Which then makes it easier for employees to help the customers genuinely."
good,People take thier time to make sure I understand things.Unloading trucks is fast paced.
good,Can be a place to have fun and do some work at the same time flexible hours  
good,"a lot of babies, but overall nice job. bosses were nice kind of "
good,I enjoyed the people I worked with and the job was pretty interesting.
good,"assisting customers"
good,"typical day would include filing shelves, helping customers while they were in store. and bringing stock from the storerooms."
good,"Being that I was apart of the loss prevention team, I got a feel of who EXACTLY my management wanted me to keep an eye on. They particularly wanted me to watch people of specific races in the store. They always turned out to be incorrect when it came to who was committing theft."
good,The flexibility of this job is good. The pay isn't great. Management and corporate pretty much don't care about anything. 
good,"Great First job."
good,"The most enjoyable part of the job are the customers, especially if you have children of your own and you realize how hard and easy it was to find the right toy for your child.  Co workers are always the second best part of the job, sharing ideas, laughs and everyday conversations make the day go smoothly.  hardest part of the job is enjoying the aspects of the job but not receiving the hours you deserve based on work merit. Management needs alittle work, they need to learn how to value the people who are reliable and dependant instead of rely on people who take the asects of the job as a joke. I learned how customers feel when they come into the store for a safe shopping experience, no hassles, no shoulder shrugs, they want to receive good customer service just like I do when I come into their place of employment."
good,"its a fun environment helping expecting parents, good variety of products to choose from"
good,"Working here was pretty routine for the most part, but it was a stable job that assured hours, especially during the holidays. However, the store I worked for closed down due to lack of sales and part of that had to do with management and the lack of passion they had for their jobs. Everyone was enjoyable to work with. The most difficult part of the job was probably working through exhausting holidays hours and the most enjoyable part was the fact that they took into consideration employees interests and let you work in the department you felt most comfortable with."
good,"I would stock shelves, dust and clean. Would orgnaize back stock room. Organize merichandize on floor and shelves. Track inventory for current and needed merchandize. Management was ok not the best. My co-workers were great to work with. There was never a hard part of my job. The most enjoyable part of my job was helping customers and making them happy."
good,Typical day at work would be cashiering and assisting customers.
good,Good place love the customer and staff if you are looking for a good work place this is one of the best company to work for they really care about you and every one treats you like your family
good,nice job; but not enough hours unless you are a student.
good,"Good merchandising skills were always applied, especially for the seasonal resets. It was fun to learn the photo lab and the ever growing technology, and it was a great experience on learning things about pharmicuticals."
good,"I loved working for Toys/Kids R Us, but the pay was not so good and the bureaucracy was ridiculous."
good,"I like Toys-R-Us because its a friendly place, I don't like that their is no job security, right now their are not any hours and since I've been employed with the company there has been 4 different district store managers, recently another just got let go. I need something full-time that I can continue to grow within the company with hours to schedule."
good,It was avery busy day everyday for work. My hardest time was Black Friday sales. My most enjoyable part of the job was making a sale and finding exactly what the customer wanted.
good,"You will only get as far as you want to. If you have no need to advance or a lot of hours then this is the place for you. This company is GREAT if you are a student and need some extra cash, or if you already have a primary full time position or if you are retired and need extra cash.. NOT for those who need it to be a full time single job."
good,"Thankful for the opportunities there, however, the minimum wage, minimum hours & horrible health benefits - makes you think twice about the company. They are quick to cut hours yet you have customers complaining about why this or that register is not open, why is there no help on the sales floor etc. I wonder what District managers would feel if their hours are cut. I feel like the people who actually do work get paid least, while the District managers etc get paid to give directions and oversee."
good,it was quite interseting and hectic but the people are amazing and its never a boring moment
good,it was just a job for me. That store went through a lot of managers. the invorment was ok.
good,Was a nice job but it wasn't the best for me due to bad management and organization.
good,"Standing for long periods of time, working with children and parents so patience is needed. Management is cool, they usually help out especially when assistance is needed. Hardest part of the job is being able to help a line of customers & still take the time out individually to make sure you can offer them credit cards, reward cards & buyer protection plans(part of daily metric requirements). Best part is being able to be a part of a fun team that are dedicated to seeing their customers smile."
good,I learned alot about babies individual needs and little things that we available to them.
good,The hardest part of the job is trying to do the amount of work expected in the number of hours given to run the store.
good,"Its very fun to work at this certain store , but when it comes to pay and hours they aren't that great."
good,"Any shift at Toys R Us is ""typical"". Stand in departments where your skills/position is not ""busy"" or being used to its potential. Many times you cover breaks for people in other departments when you are in the middle of a major project. Very boring shifts if it is not during Christmas season. I enjoy jobs that keep you busy with projects. I enjoy the different customer experiences daily."
good,Typical Day:
good,"A typical day at work would be by me starting off in the cash office, then either being the service desk team member for the day, or either working in apparel/ performing my HR duties out of season. In season a typical day for me would be scheduling and conducting interviews,orientations, training New hires, helping guests,etc."
good,Worked seasonal with the holidays being the most busiest time.
good,"It was a great first job. I had a lot to learn. It was fun to work on my own and with others. The management team was okay. Many workers slacked off, but then there were some that picked up the slack. The environment was usually fun. Working in the winter was hard work with the heavy customer interaction and pushing carts outside."
good,unloading the truck at an fast pace.I learned how to sale yourself.hardest part of the job is chirstmas time when everything is rush hour.the most enjoyable part but the job is unloading the truck and packing evertything out.
good,"Toys R Us is an ok place to work at. Stocking and merchandising is fun because it kills time and you get to know a lot about the product. Co-workers aren't as great. They talk to who they are close with, rarely interact with new people or those they don't know. The older co-workers are friendly though. Management is horrible. Too many have favorites, not all work gets recognized, and they don't abide by one's availability yet expect them to come to work. Hardest part about the job is lifting heavy boxes with no help, getting recognized for good work, and waking up at 4-5am to work 4-5 hour shifts. Most enjoyable part is meeting customers, helping people, and knowing that a section you cleaned/stocked looks nice enough for customers to find what they are looking for."
good,I spent most of my time talking to customes. Personal experiences at each individuals discretion.
good,"At first this seemed like a great place to work, everyone was pleasant. I was hired after two interviews which were relatively short, not that I am complaining, but after being hired I noticed a lack of communication and unity among the managers. I have been working here for three months and already want to leave. This were going smoothly until i required a change at which point the store manager started to give me the run around. I live in Ridgewood and the location that hired me is in College Point, that's an hour and a half commute, after realizing they are using me only for weekends and late night closing shifts I realized this location is too desolate for me to wait half an hour for a bus that's going to take and hour and a half to get me home, its simply not safe for me. After explaining that to the store manager, and expressing that I would like to go to the Toys R Us in my neighborhood she told me she was busy with other things and will speak with me later about it. That evening as she was leaving she told me to speak with her on my next work day, on that day she told me ""they are not doing transfers."" I am not one to believe everything I am told so I did my own research and found that the Toys R Us near me is hiring, why would they not be ""doing transfers?"""
good,Overall not a bad place to work. Depending on the management. Holiday season is the best but goes by way to fast.
good,You work mostly nights driving a truck because of store delivery times.
good,I enjoy working at Toys R Us I have met some very interesting people that I know I will keep in contact with for a very long time
good,Got to help others and made great friends. Had two job duties customer service and cashier.
good,Very good management staff. Long hours and very stressful. Great people to work with
good,"The hardest part about the job was keeping up with all the costumers request. Especially around christmas season, it gets really crazy."
good,"Productive, busy always a challenge to drive metrics.Not much communication with management."
good,"Aide customers with purchases, merchandising and sales. New managers who shifted focus time and again. Attempted to become too efficient too quickly."
good,overall working at toys r us was a good experience. It was a fun productive place to work. Everyone got along pretty good only problem was there was no chance in advancing.
good,If you love to work hard in a medium paced enviroment this is the place to work part time. You also have to love kids the adult ones and the small ones
good,It’s a nice and okay job if it’s your first job. I worked there seasonal. It’s a fun and easy job. You can get a lot done if you work at the right pace.
good,"Working for Toys R Us made me feel like a kid again, would I work there again yes. They had great deals for employees and families, they also had opportunities for raises."
good,Hated the hours. It was seasonal and was very fast paced. Employees are alright but don't expect to much from them. Don't really know what else to say.
good,Just work hard and go to your shifts plight and the customer is always right even if they aren't but don't tell the they aren't because then they shall get mad
good,"I worked at toysrus and babiesrus for 9 years. I was a supervisor in many different areas, I also ran a toysrus pop up store. Most of my managers were great managers except my last one. It was her way or no way."
good,"Toys r Urs , was an excellent place to work at. I enjoyed the holidays when the kids come out  and shows their parents what they wanted for Christmas."
good,Collègues très gentils manager et directeur également. horaires tres avantageux pas très loin de la gare sncf
good,"Direction très active qui aide les salariés du mieux possible, bonne ambiance de travail."
good,worked with a good environment with great management. the hours were a good fit for me . i like to work daytime hours in a fast paced warehouse. management was great
good,"Loved working there, our store had an awesome team.  From management to seasonal worker everyone worked together. Management was always willing to work with scheduling needs"
good,All I remember was that I was given good enough hours. People were friendly. The work wasn’t too loaded at all. Was never a dull moment. Was just overall a good place to work.
good,"This was just a volunteer job and I did not get hired on afterward because they were not hiring at the time I did this through school, youth transitoin"
good,Management needs to be supportive to the staff. Interaction with the Management on regional products needs to be consulted with the local team. Staff need training twice a year.
good,I enjoyed coming to work every day and help customers buying things for the children and family. It was a great feeling helping others  make the perfect  decision.
good,Worked at the one in Manchester and I feel like some of the supervisors were very rude and your hard work sometimes goes unnoticed. I feel like they only keep the majority race for advancement
good,"Toys R Us has typical days for your average cashier has them on the floor greeting/helping customers and being called to cash when needed by a more senior ""anchor"" cashier. The management does not receive enough hours for the staff and so the workplace tends to be high stress due to there being not enough staff to help the volume of customers. The people there were fun, and on relaxed days it's entertaining. When it gets busy however closer to Christmas it begins to get much more stressful and the pressure on cashiers to perform is high."
good,"I truly enjoyed working at Toys R` Us, I received the hours I wanted and they worked around my after school activities. The people and customers were the best and would not trade them in for the world. I have inquired many life skills that I will carry on in life."
good,it's hard to give a review on a company that i worked for only one month then it dissolved a few months later. there was a lot of moving merchandise around.
good,Could’ve been better but it was a good experience. I learned a lot and got to work with great people. If I didn’t move from new york i would most likely still be working there i just needed higher pay
good,"Great to work at while studying full time. Not really a heavy burden as helps u build people skills as well as customer services skills. Sad to see they closed down,"
good,"There is nothing to review here. However, if Toys R Us was to open again it would be ideal for anyone who loves/ collect toys. You have to have to be able to connect to the guest through fun adventures."
good,working here was  not bad at all it was normal work for over nights. we stocked toys over nights and made sure no toys were out of place. all toys went in their respective compartments.
good,The pay was horrifically but the job was decent. Yet they are no longer in business. Because they thought the internet was going to be a fad. I guess they were wrong.
good,Préfere ne pas spécifier. Pas que negatif mais je ne préfere pas en parler.
good,"Buen ambiente de trabajo, buenos compañeros, horarios flexibles"
good,This was such a wonderful company until they left. I wouldve loved to stay full time if it werent for the company going out of buisness. Great pay too!
good,"This is really like a after school job. If you are in like 11th or 12th grade and you want to start saving for college or anything, then this is the perfect job for you."
good,I had worked there for 2 years and I actually enjoyed it. You have to be used to children and cleaning up messes of toys and such. Holidays were always super hectic. Overall a great place to work at. Management could of been a bit better honestly but as long as you did your job then they left you alone.
good,"Toys R Us was very much a  place where you were valued as part of a team. Appreciated for the work put in also by Management, the workplace culture was friendly, sometimes Office politics were highlighted but I didn't get involved in that. A typical day was 9 - 5.30. I did enjoy my job there."
good,ok place to work gets a bit tedious after a while though other than that its all good some good people work there and its pretty much stress free thats it
good,One of my first job where I either worked on the till or was going around the store checking if everything was good and if i customers needed assistance with anything.
good,"Alot of their employment is seasonal, so you aren't always guaranteed a job after Christmas season is over. They do hire you on after season is over, if you're good at what you do. Management wasn't always the best, the director was kind of  judgmental and was always on his phone."
good,I worked there for seasonal position. What I had to do was stock shelves and organize aisles. Sometimes there was nothing to do and I would walk around in circles. I also was on the register. It was stressful for me because everything was unorganized and since it was my first job I had no experience at a work place.
good,Chashier helping people find what they need getting people jobs if they need stocking toys and re pricing toys helps you get to no your customers and co workers
good,Not much of a challenging job. It was great to cater to kids and their families. Learnt to make maximum impact using minimum resources. Rumors of the company closing down used to be around when I was working. But the company is still working well.
good,"I enjoyed working there and i learned a lot. I am fond of warehousing because of the fast non stop pace and it is also a good workout. In addition, I also appreciate learning new things."
good,"This job teaches you basic skills to help with your customer service, but does not offer any good benefits or good pay, no raises unless you ae promoted to a higher position"
good,Every day working here was different and generally quite busy. I had a lot of different tasks which I liked so nothing was ever repetitive. Co-workers made the days go by faster!
good,"It was really a good experience working for this company. Don`t really have much to say as I`ve only worked there for the holiday season."
good,This job had ita ups and downs .. Somenight I couldn't wait to go to work and other I just disnt really want to be around the coworkers who would just play around all night and put us behide all the time
good,When I worked at toys r us it was very busy . I worked during seasonal time and had a lot of customers shopping periodically . I was fast- paced . The enviorment was nice and so were the co-workers
good,This was a temporary job that helped me pay for college. The job was fun and couldn't complain being able to play with toys and gain experience that would eventually set me up for success later on in my career.
good,A typical day at ToysRus for me was to stock shelves and ship out toys in boxes. Sometimes I would help customers with what ever there concerns they had.
good,the workplace culture at Toys R'Us was a decent work experience it was a fast and hardworking pace you had to get things done at a certain schedule and have them organized which was a bit hard being a student at the time and balance work and school over all it was a decent experience.
good,"long nights working in warehouse and on cherry picker and forklift, lots of people moving around, abverage staff the business has been closed for the last two yrs"
good,Nice company fast pace especially on holidays and weekend those days was the worst. I had to assemble bikes and toys or scooters at a fast pace  had t
good,Having been a seasonal sales worker for Toys R' Us I found that a lot of the times my fellow co-workers were no where to be found when customers needed help looking for toys or any information.
good,Toys R Us had great intentions on taking care of the employees but didn’t have the annual sales to provide their workers with decent wages to support a family on
good,Company was a leading toy retailer before it went out of business.  It was at times a very stressful retail environment in which to work especially during holidays.
good,"Pretty standard retail environment.  Enjoyed being part of the Babies""R""Us side more, helping new parents figure out what the do/don't need and being able to answer any questions any parent needed answers too."
good,The best place I've ever worked. To bad it had to come to an end because of slow hours.  Honestly I could still see myself working there but they're closed now. None the less I really enjoyed this place of work especially coming right out of highschool.
good,Potential for maximizing efficiency through a better relationship with everyone on the team. Unfortunately the company went bankrupt and sadly many people lost their jobs and all the benefits that came with it.
good,"Typical retail position. Company is no longer in business (at least in the United States). however, rumors of rebranding have been circulating, and unknown if it will have the same culture/management style/etc as the original company."
good,Was a fun place to work but depended on managers who moved frequently.  Many assistant managers were not as flexible and made work difficult at times  Sale of the company changed the course of things and led to closing of the stores
good,"definitely worked hard bring out toys from the back inventory for customers or to restock shelves, best part was interacting with the customers, the employees were cool too"
good,"Toy's R US was a seasonal job for me.It didn't seem like there were many advancement opportunists for me at that location. The company is now closed anyway,"
good,Ein interessantes Unternehmen mit großer Vielfalt.
good,"I only worked here for a short time, I was a seasonal employee. People were friendly but it was obviously very loud and chaotic as you’d imagine a toy store at Christmas would be"
good,"I was only seasonal help during my employment with Toys R Us, so I was only there around three months. My times employed with Toys R Us was not bad and helped my gain life experiences that I did not have at the time."
good,Things was good throughout never was a dull moment. Everyone was nice and product knowledgeable. On average days was pretty simple and easy. You made your work at your own pace self motivated.
good,I only worked there for the Christmas holiday season. It was very hectic and the managers didn't have enough time to train new employees on products and procedures.
good,Wasn't horrible. Decent pay. Decent hours. Was only working seasonally so it was a paycheck. Probably wouldn't go back since they closed down permanently.
good,"very stressful place to work for. by time goes by fast when you are busy, co-workers are good and very helpful, but management is horrible . my job was very intense but i loved it."
good,"Good high school job "
good,"Even though the place is shut down now, it was always fun to work there. There was always a steady flow of foot traffic coming through that the work days went by quickly."
good,It was a fun work place. Getting to see and play with new toys and games. Seeing the smiles on people face with we help them and give them what they want.
good,The job is great if you're a high school student but it is extremely difficult to make a living with this job unless you are in a management position.
good,My management was so disconnected from the actual work being done that they often didn't know what the employees were talking about when bringing up issues.
good,During the time that i was their the employees and supervisor would guff of talk about personal stuff. But the store would be clean and organized their where some employees that would just walk around
good,"The job was kind of fun. It was nice to see some cute kids. It was very quick paced and physically demanding. Pay wasn't that great, overall it could have been better. Now I know why they shut down. Toys were too expensive."
good,I worked here as a seasonal worker but overall it was very stressful. I was often scolded for assisting customers who were not in my work area or had work dropped on me in fields i did not understand or know about.
good,"It was a great place to work. I worked their on and off for 10 years."
good,"I only worked as a security in toys r us, but i was involved in a lot interactions with the sales and management teams. The workers were happy and the mangers and supervisors treated them well. Everyone got along like a family. I believe toys r us is a good environment for those who wants to have a career in the retail industry."
good,"Help open store, learned to coordinate front end sales and how to run the electronics department. Management was adequate, culture was toxic at times due to stressful work days."
good,"It was a great first job for me. I landed a seasonal position, it was chaotic during the holidays but that's to be expected for a toy store. Management was alright, everyone was friendly and it was a big enough store that ""workplace drama"" wasn't really a thing. It was a very lax environment."
good,"Great Place to work & a place you can make your own decisions when it comes to changing results."
good,toys r us was a cool place to work the atmoshere was fun an playful. great place for adultss and kidds alike. mever met a person that didnt like toys r us...
good,"It was one of the biggest toy stores around, therefore the environment was always busy. Management had favorites and you could tell. This company gave me first opportunity to learn how to work and deal with customers in a retail enviroment"
good,environment in good but the overall way it was run made some things rather difficult. doing the graveyard shift for stocking was great and worked great for overall work.
good,"A typical day at Toys R Us required one to have a lot of energy. Working as a bookkeeper, I had to do a lot of training which allowed me to be able to be the best and remain there for 5 years."
good,Working here taught me to not make excuses and get the job done to the best of my abilities. Which included getting the best from my team and making sure customers were happy and buying toys. It was a very structured environment and management was stuck to a set of corporate rules and regulations.
good,"it was a good place to work, fun while you're in high school but thats pretty much it. would never work here as an adult for a career trying to pay bills."
good,its a fun work place seeing all the kids happy to find what they looking for. But its gets a little stressful because then you get the up set customers who mad about an item/game that doesn't work.
good,They told me what i wanted to hear in my interview and didn't keep their word on any of it. It was a job. Friendly enough co-workers. Not much to it..
good,"Workplace culture was good, enjoyable. Customers were occasionally rude but for the most part was a good experience. Management was ok as shifts would often be randomized and would not be set to a specific day/time each week."
good,"This was the first job I ever had and it was sort of exciting. There were times where I enjoyed working there. The only things that seemed to rub me the wrong way were customers. They would asked the price for a product and just place it wherever they wanted. When the place was closing down and if they didn't get what they want they wouldn't listen to reason. If there were no returns, regardless of the signs that mentioned this, they would come back after looking at their receipts and be upset with the cashier. I understand, people have their own problems in life, but not reading the price of something on a pin pad shouldn't be one."
good,"Greeting and helping customers.  Read Plan o grams, set schedules, manage sells and goals.   Friendly and fun.  Could have had better communication between high up management.   Nothing to hard as ling as you tried.  Working with all the toys and kids."
good,Llegar y realizar mis actividades laborales como estar en al almacén o hacer demostraciones en la campaña navideña. A continuación realizar mi descanso volver y proseguir con dichas actividades.
good,"Working at Toys R Us was fun and welcoming. Though it was very laid back, you were still able to be productive. Management acted more like your friend than your superior."
good,I've  learned to pay close attention to detail while working alone or under the direct supervision of my supervisor. I have also learned to adjust to change at any given moment.
good,It was an adequate entry level position with reasonable but not competitive compensation. The most enjoyable part of the job was interacting with the public.
good,"This was a means to an end for me and very basic manual work, freindly staff and management, I liked working here and it was paid quite well for the hours worked"
good,Its a great work experince for young worker. The workplace was more like a second family. The vibe was fun and upbeat. The pay was reasonable but pay raise was very little.
good,Fun place to shop for toys and things for babies. I don’t work here anymore they shut the place down. Anyways the job was excellent I was always on time & made sure my job was always finished before I had to leave.
good,Working at Toys R Us has helped me excel in customer service. This job taught me the proper way to interact with customers professionally. Overall my experience at Toys R Us was a good one
good,As a casual I cannot really say much about the company except they seem to faire and clean and are always willing to help wherever they could. The staff was great
good,The company was struggling to stay alive when I worked there.  Lots of changes were happening on a daily basis.  Made work difficult at times with all the desperate measures.
good,Nice Customers Decent Pay. The Employees Are Easy To Work With. No Drama & No Arguments. The Day Goes Very Smoothly. We Are A Good Company With Decent Pay
good,This company is no longer is business but when it was it good to work for and they treated you fairly. The most stressful time was during the holidays where they wanted you to do more with less.
good,overall company was awful but it was a very fun work environment and job overall this company is out of business now and probably because of how bad it treated its employees
good,"Toys R Us was a where you could go to work and forget about any outside problems. When they closed down it put a lot of good employees out of work. If they were still open today, that would more than likely still be my job."
good,"always on your feet, fast paced working, no benefits, great for working as a first job, no paid vacations, workers were great, always helping, manangers were good"
good,typical day at working was being a cashier it was pretty boring your typical cashier position. Occasionally stocked shelves and helped customers. The management was fine
good,"VERY DEMANDING WORKPLACE, too many worker not enough pay , part timers only getting one day, not enough employeesn to fill floor, barely registers open, barely stock rooms stocked."
good,"great place to work good work environment, great management, I would do cashier/sales. so typically I would sell credit card sales and warranty. clean and organize the floor"
good,I learned so much their for retail but managers didn’t communicate well. Stress would be taken out on others and no one sloved it. The HR was manager and I charge of front of store. Too much would be crammed on others.
good,"It's okay as a second job or a starter job. The paid is not enough to make a living off of It. As minimum wage go up. So does everything else, food ect"
good,"working retail, for a kids store, expect to be yelled at a lot, especially christmas time and summer for outdoor product. management above general store director usually a bit out of touch with retail environment which leads to suggestions that appear great, but usually end in profit loss due to theft and product damage."
good,I think that management could of been a lot ncer to employees I mean the work was great I did the janitorial at toys r us it was fun in the early morning but when the cashiers came in and you had to get trash from behind their work area they would get pretty upset about it like you were bothering them  don't get me wrong the job was great but I think that maybe they should of gave the cashiers training in how to treat people
good,Fun work environment the people were a joy to work with and I enjoyed helping and making the family's day easier .management was sturn but we're great to work with.
good,It was my first job so it wasn't terrible. There is no way you can live off of 9.25 a hour as a adult on there own. it was a easy fast paced work environment
good,wish they had better hours. management was okay. hard to relocate sometimes when had no car no ride public bus was always problem. buses where late.n/a
good,"Stocking , customer service , cashier.  The franchise closed down so therefore I was laid off. Due to lack of production. Fright team , stocking shelves"
good,The most busies time of the year. you have to work fast and efficiently while providing the best customer service.  it was a good environment to work in.
good,"It was ok,it paid bills.It was in a nice location not too far from the house but sometimes it can be busy and the employees can get a lil agitated but other than that it was smooth for me ."
good,"Great place to work, if you can still find one that exists! The pay is not competitive in any way unless you advance into a store leadership or corporate role."
good,"This was a kids toy store. That says so much in and of itself. There was always something to do here, whether it be stocking or facing items, to cleaning up messes left and right, as kids are like a tornado in a toy store."
good,Toys R Us was a fair but competitive workplace were store team member were obligated to make sale quotas monthly by encouraging customers to sign on discount programs.
good,it was alright. not great. i was nott very happy there. it was a job. i need more characters. you cant work there. they are out of business. oh wellll
good,"Was a great place to work the team made time go by quick ,management always listened to concerns if you had any.they celebrated the holidays with us setting up Christmas trees gave out certificates for thanks giving to food4less had raffles ,was a great place to work."
good,i come in load my truck i leave go make my deliveries i meet new people everyday myself and my co worker got along the pay was ok hardest part of the job was loading the truck and traffic
good,I really liked  this job the only thing I didn't like it was a seasonal job and the pay was nice just give more seasonal people more opportunity to work.
good,"It was fun working there. The customers were so great and the employees were fum to work with "
good,There were a few good employees but overall it felt like I was doing the work of a manager as a part time associate. The holiday hours were pretty brutal as well
good,It was a nice and fun place to work. Especially if you’ve shopped there as a child. Was easy work and time went by fast if you always stayed busy. Good discounts also
good,"I enjoyed working at Toys ""R"" Us but they didn't give me enough hours because there was not enough hours to give. So, I had to leave. A typical day at work for me included working in the back of house for the most part, but also walking around and helping customers"
good,Working at Toys R Us was a great work experience to start with since I was only a student. The work hours were never overwhelming and I got to meet new people around the workplace
good,"too many clicks not teamwork favortism and at times could be a little "
good,Take care of the floor and people. Answer questions as best as i can. Take online orders. Take and give out orders of idem to customer. work hard and smile.
good,"I was on part time hours. Schedule was flexible and relaxed"
good,I enjoyed working at toys r us because the atmosphere was generally positive. I would not work at this store again because I did not enjoy working in retail.
good,Toy r us was a great place to work nice people nice energy coworkers was nice Customers  was nice it was a good environment but I was wanted to move on an try new things and work different places.
good,A very cool environment just a super busy place. Had to relocate or I’ve stayed as a employee. Great deals and hours around the Holiday. Just get extremely busy around that time.
good,I enjoyed working at Toys R Us. It was a fun job with room for advancement. Management was friendly and helpful. And I enjoyed interaction with the public.
good,"I would be stationed at the scheduled sections (games, sports or action figures. We learned how to sell by implementing company techniques. The culture was enjoyable and friendly."
good,"I loved working at Toys R Us. My team was amazing and allowed me to learn every aspect of the job, from working cashier to customer service, stocking and shipping. Unfortunately my store closed, then all Toys R Us stores closed."
good,Helped me with computer and customer service skills. Work place created a good environment between employees and customers. The most enjoyable part was all the competition with creating sales.
good,"It was a fun place to work. I learned a lot that i can take with me on my new journey. Customer service, stocking, online orders, layaway program. Learning how to interact with all aspects of retail."
good,They were really good to me when i was there they actually cared about me as a employee and it showed i wish i could have stayed with them and that they didnt close
good,The managers were very mean. They never gave me more hours when I asked. They were very rude when I called in sick. Barely any breaks. They chose when your break was.
good,Nice and friendly environment. Fast-paced does not offer enough hours. Can be a bit unorganized but friendly culture. Cannot recommend this company considering it is no longer in business.
good,It was a learning experience for me to learn how to assemble bikes and how to stock shelves. I meant different people from different cities and countries I saw excitement in children's eyes when they first walked into Toys R Us it was a great experience.
good,I would b scheduled and then they tell me there over staff can I come i later its something I did not like. other the that it was okay most the times it be a clean place
good,"No longer applicable. This company is out of business, and it's a shame. They were unable to adapt to the changes in the retail marketplace, and sadly Sears will be joining them soon."
good,"It was pretty busy during Christmas time. However, the people that I worked with were very helpful and worked hard. There was always someone on the floor to help customers."
good,"Fun place to work. Sometimes really slow, other times really busy. But there was never a time there was nothing to do. My managers were great. The rules were fair. The customers were friendly. Too bad they went out of business."
good,the company is shut down. there is no use in even applying to the franchise. the chain failed as a company and has closed its doors as a result. I do however recommend Newport as a premium cigarette brand.
good,I worked hard I was usually on the floor. Fixing things that were on the wrong place. I retag the prices in the isle's. I was never late always on time.
good,Very slow very dead job never any guest im not sure if it was location but no one came in ever just a very unmotivated environment to work at and wouldn't wanna go again
good,"- Scheduling to ensure proper coverage at the front end/service desk"
good,"Just like any other retail store. Everyone was pretty much like a family, we all worked together to get tasks done. We did resets, received trucks, replenished the store, etc."
good,The experience was great. You always have to have a open mind with this job. You great to meet wonderful kids. This was a great experience I loved this job
good,"Was okay not too bad of a job but they are gone now, the management wasn't the best. But it was okay for a first job they made  me a lead their while I was working with them."
good,"went out of business. A lot of things contributed to it going out of business. Major factor was the top executive didn't really care enough. Also, private equity firms."
good,It's always busy because there is not enough of help. Getting less team member each year. The hardest part of the job is dealing with everyday task with limited resources. Having a great management team that support each other what I really like about my job.
good,"It was fun. I was only there for Christmas season. I was liked very well there and made friends with all my fellow employees. I was sad to bed let go, but it was worth it."
good,"Company was ok for the most part, coworkers were great to work with. Atmosphere was fine, commute to and from work was great. Supervisors and managers were great to work with"
good,"I was a  store assistant and a cashier, so helping customers especially kids was my day to day activities,"
good,Toys r us was a very productive environment to work in because of good management and good workers. Quotas were discussed daily to ensure warehouse worker were staying productive
good,"The people were nice, everybody was on the same schedules. Everybody knew what needed to be done and how to do it. Friendly coworkers. Always willing to lend a hand"
good,it was nice to work here it was busy on somedays but most of it was fine there were days it got kinda of hard but we all work together to finish strong
good,Good place to work. Sorry that it closed. The employees were very helpful during training. Manager did not mind working around school and other scheduling issues.
good,"A typical day at Babies R Us was a morning meeting communicating on what the daily expectations were.  Sales for the day are pointed out along with the goals we are trying to achieve.  The schedule is explained along with what employees are working in what specific department.  I learned that retail has various opportunities for growth within it's own stores.  Management unfortunately, changed often from store managers to assistant managers.  The culture in the store was family-like when you spend up to 40 hours a week with people they do become a part of your life.  The hardest part of the job was when changes came from corporate that did not benefit the efficiency and service of the way the store was run.  The most enjoyable part of the job was the lasting friendships."
good,"As aToys R Us sales associates perform a multitude of important duties for the retail store company. Sales team members typically handle customer service encounters and stock replenishing duties for a Toys R Us retail location. Toys R Us sales associates often field customer questions and complaints about products, services, and store personnel."
good,I worked a seasonal job during Christmas holiday! It was a very busy time during the year so time off wasn't exactly a thing. A typical day at work during this time wasn't sticking to one task I did 5 different jobs under one job assignment because every job needed tending to at this time
good,"A typical day at is making sure the cashiers are greeting and making sure the customer had a great experience, working at this company I was able to learn all aspects of retail, management was good, the culture was good, the hardest part of my job was having to tell a customer that a particular item they wanted was no long available, the most enjoyable part was my coworkers and making customers shopping experience great."
good,"Worked with you when you needed time off, let you make up time when you had Dr. apointment, had employ ot the month, celebrated birthdays once a month and would have parties when we won contest."
good,"I'd show up to unload trucks and stock shelves when stocking was finished I would help assemble bikes, the people were fun to work with through the night never a dull moment"
good,"Some people clearly work harder than others. The manager i worked under was okay, but the assistant managers would take advantage when the manager was out."
good,"The work was pretty simple and straightforward, but the pay was too low. It was okay as a part time or second job, but it was not something that you could rely on as a way to make a living."
good,"Everything about this place was fun. "
good,closed for business - All toys r us stores have closed down. These stores are no longer in operation anywhere in the United States of America. Nothing to review
good,was a nice experience working with kids the company was a good atmosphere to work in very organized was a fun experience also management was ok was fair and understanding
good,"My job title was a sales associate, while working there though it was awful. When i was working there i was 4 months pregnant and they did not meet my needs, i then had complications in my pregnancy that required me to leave."
good,"On arrival we would be allocated to the tills or stocking shelves, either i didnt mind as it was quite busy and that is what i liked. I learned a lot about customer service and also enjoyed helping the customers with whatever they needed. I enjoyed all of the job as i like to help customers and let them leave happy."
good,Hectic hours and stressful holiday season but good experience. IF they had not gone out of business i would recommend to anyone looking for part time work.
good,The company is now out of business.  it is obvious that they were not doing things correctly since they are out of business.  It was a male dominated environment in our location as far as management was considered.  I was never so happy to leave a place I worked at.
good,"Guter Arbeitgeber, jedoch viel zu wenig Gehalt für die Aushilgen"
good,"Great location and nice place to work.  Nice place to learn about all the different types of toys, puzzles, games, etc...  Management there was easy to work with ."
good,"Fun and easy job, cool managers and staff,  decent pay for an overnight stocker, working at night you didn't have to worry about any customers and we were allowed to listen to headphones while getting our work done. Only con is you were not allowed to leave the building for lunch."
good,While it was a good learning experience a lot of customer service experience and working with toys was fun to bad they are no longer in business it was a good job
good,"When I worked for Toys R Us I went through 5 managers.  One of the problems about working there was managers could be transferred within days and without warning.  I had some awesome managers and I had some very poor managers, especially my last one."
good,i worked here for the christmas season. so yes that makes things as crazy as it sounds however even though it is crazy they refused to work with me with my health issues.
good,"It went out of business so there's no real jobs for potential employees. Management worked hard, associates were friendly and the pay was reasonable but as I said there is no more work available at this time."
good,Good team work on time ppl some good days we had our hard days to but we still made it happen the manager was every nice and good with help out if needed
good,Working at Toys R Us offered the opportunity to to gain valuable experience in all areas of the retail environment. The general environment was positive and encouraging.
good,Good environment to work in and good managers decent pay all right hours and flexible schedule good learning experience willing to compromise being close to home
good,The job was more stressful than a normal retail job. Some days were slow and work was easy but it was crazy Thursday-Saturdays. Stocking was easily organized by sections in the store. The managers were slow to come to the registers to solve disputes with the customers.
good,I  open this new store when it came into town.  It was a fun fast paced environment.  Customers were mostly happy and there was a baby registry. Customers registered for their baby gifts.
good,"Toys R Us was a fine place to work. Retail sucks, but the store that I worked at made it enjoyable with fun coworkers and management. Christmas time was hectic but for a first job, it wasn't that bad."
good,Working at toys r us was ok. During the holidays you are overworked and after the holidays there are hardly any hours to work. You work late cleaning the store every night because of all the children who destroy the store.
good,"Friendly environment, good management, but the working hours too long, fromm 11 am to 10 pm..the most enjoyable when your working partner is friendly and we make a great team"
good,"The management did accommodate my school schedule and availabilities.  There was a lack of supervisory control with regard to additional assistance for customers during times of high demand. Sometimes it appeared there was not enough people scheduled to work, which often led to me not getting any breaks. Although the company is going out of business, It would not have been my choice  for a lifetime carrer."
good,"The dress code was strict and very formal for a place that thrives on appealing to children. We weren't allowed to wear shorts, even though the AC had broken and had been broken for over a week. Whenever it was colder, we weren't allowed to wear jackets. This on top of more old-school uniform policies such as ""no tattoos, piercings, or unnatural hair"" were big turn-offs as they reduced us from individuals to just another employee with no room for individuality."
good,"Day to day job requirements weren't bad at all , it was my first place of employment and I was able to get the swing of things fairly often. I learned how to maintain a store not only on the salesfloor but managing the inventory as well. Along with handling customers and leaving them with a good impression of the company. Relations between managers/supervisors and store associates were casual and stress free while still professional and I think that helped with teamwork and overall moral around the store. Hardest part of the job wasn't work related but more so going unnoticed to the company other than my own managers and supervisors despite standing out from other coworkers and meeting all expectations and then some on top of being the youngest employee, other than that I enjoyed all aspects of the job and loved going to work anytime."
good,i honestly don't remember much of the job that was my first job since it was seasonal i met a lot of good people there aswell as took my first step into retail through that job
good,"Great Co-workers but awful management, depends on the store but i've seen some real disasters as far as running the store is concerned. The holidays are really hectic aswell"
good,"A lot of work, but fairly laid back. Always helped me with any sort of schedule changes and days i needed off. Not the best pay but maybe for a part-Job."
good,"Always had a morning meeting, then got to work on resets if needed, always helping customers and being a cashier if needed. Most of the management was decent."
good,Was hired as a manager and performed every duty but that. Did more walking around on the floor and straightening up shelves than anything else. Was not the job for me
good,"Working at a warehouse it’s calm most of the time, but when the trailers show up with the goods things can get hectic but that’s why being work oriented come in handy as well as being able to multitask."
good,"the days at work were mainly busy for the most part, I learned that you can do anything even at a fast pace, the management was okay but some managers were more understanding than others, the work place was overwhelming some days. the hardest part of the job is trying to keep every customer happy when we were busy. the best part of the job were the Christmas parties & little crew parties we had occasionally."
good,"I liked working here just needed better pay to cover costs of living, I was barely able to cover my rent and bills each month, plus food and other household needs."
good,"The Company as a whole was pretty bad, especially to try and move up. But individual stores by store we were all a big family. Management goes we had the best boss possible there."
good,"They went out of business. It was generally okay, The pay was low obviously, it wasn't a hard job. You'd meet some of the ""toughest"" people working there."
good,its very fast pace work place. very friendly place with very kind wokers but the mangers were very rude to the guest and we as cashier have to fix the problem
good,It was your standard customer service position but the company was obviously going under and the staff I worked with were intolerable and had the management under their thumb judging by multiple conversations with various members of management.
good,The job is interesting cause if you have kids then you always get to see the new toys that come in. Theres always something cool there. Especially when you're a kid at heart.
good,Fun workplace and decent management but with a high degree of turnover for both management and employees. Also review is rather irrelevant because company is going out of business and closing basically all stores.
good,It’s a good place to work if you just have a lot of free time and a teen looking for quick money. Everyone is really nice and I would recommend it to someone else
good,"it was ok tiring and busy work"
good,Not a lot of stress or responsibilities. Fun work environment you’ll always see something new. Good people to work around and management is pretty cool.
good,Do to poor management from upper executives toys r us is going out of business.It was great working there in the beginning years but it slowly started to decline.
good,"A typical work day was always busy, especially during Christmas Season. I learned a lot about customer service at this job. The hardest part about this job was the stocking of shelves."
good,itv was okay job i had really fun cause you get to shows kids about new toys and also overtime somebody come in it be about gift or just trying get they kids something
good,A typical day at Babies R Us was going in early to help unload trucks and stock shelves before the store opened to the public and then when the store opened occasionally help customers but generally would scan and stock the back room.
good,It was a cool place to work. Majority of the workers treated each other like family and had each others backs. There were sometimes some miscommunication over scheduling and some of the managers were very strict.
good,Great place to learn customer service. Gained customer service skills and learned the importance of great customer service and patience. I think it s great starter job to learn the basics and grounds for any position involving interaction with clients.
good,"Pros"
good,"The typical day was fun and fast paced, I truly felt like I was apart of a functional team, the most enjoyable part of the day was working in the back."
good,"The work environment was always very hectic, we were always in rush and always being told to get people to get a credit card. It did not offer many hours to their employees."
good,"Now I knew before I was hired that Toys R' Us was having financial problems. Me though, I needed work and I got it. Every day I'd go into the breakroom, drop off my lunch, then pick up my employee card and clock myself in. Most of the time I was a cashier in the electronics section, which I was somewhat bored by because my fellow cashiers in the section were often allowed to go about the aisles to help with customers and reorganize the shelves. I was hoping for some of that so I wasn't doing the same thing over and over again, but being at the front was what mostly happened."
good,I enjoyed working for a place intended for families and their children. Watching them grow up was an honor and a privilege. The knowledge I was able to give parents and parents to be was extremely rewarding and gave me a sense of pride and accomplishment when they took my suggestions and enjoyed their purchases.
good,"Toy's R Us is a nice, fun and exciting place to work. Great enviornment, especially if you like kids. very family oriented and has good discounts for customers."
good,Campaña de navidades ambiente distendido y en equipo
good,This review doesn't really matter as the company is going out of business. Used to be a great place to work in the 90's but as everything all good things come to an end.
good,"We worked hard and played hard and created some great work along the way."
good,"A typical day at Toys RUs was always busy. I learned a lot in the past 17 years. Cash Office, Payroll, Opening/Closing building. The hardest part of the job was maintaining the building without the proper staff. The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to help the moms and establishing a relationship."
good,"This place was a fun place to work for you could enjoy your day here it was a fast pace work but whilst you worked you could talk to fellow workers as long as you carried on working"
good,the facility is very unorganized and a big mess. There are actually works that show up in sweatshirts and hid their work shirt so customer don't ask them questions
good,"I learned skills like time management, dependability, and accountability. The management was solid with a nice workplace culture. The hardest part of the job was handling some of the larger dressers and cribs. The most enjoyable part of the job to me is when you can make a kids day and just see them smile."
good,"They're going out of business but my manager deserved it, dude was rude as heck. I do hope my former coworkers can find something to do though, they gotta work too."
good,Toys 'R' Us was a good company for me to start working retail for. They had a good work environment and I often felt of the people there more as friends than as coworkers.
good,"Company is non existent writing a review is pointless and invasive. I wokred at this company for 5 years, promotions tended to be internal as opposed to outsourced."
good,"I am going be honest here. I liked babies r us so much better than toys r us. I actually got my full time hours and overtime if wanted. The hours were better. The manager was way more flexible with your schedule. I went to Toys R Us because I was promised same position, hours and pay. Pay was the only thing I kept. They barely give me enough hours to live of off. They give me less than 30 hours a week and there is never enough stuff to do. Babies r Us also had more than enough work to do."
good,"i worked there seasonal around christmas time "
good,Not enough time to do my job to my satisfaction. It was too much rushing. I also had problems with transportation in the mornings. I would miss my connection because the bus would arrive too late.
good,leider nur Weihnachts aushilfe gebraucht schade aber trotzdem toll
good,"unloaded trucks, stocked shelves and kept the store clean and orderly. also helped customers with questions and loaded the car with their items they bought"
good,I didnt enjoy working there. They worked us to hard during the christmas season and then never called back. They basically just used us to work for the season.
good,I learned a lot in Babies R Us. I learn to do returns and do guest service. It was a nice experience to work with them. I can learn how to solve a problem because going to the manager.
good,"Retail environments can be harsh, especially during the holiday season.  Working at Toys R Us was like going to work with family.  Even at the crazy times....it's a Toy Store, you had to have fun."
good,Its a great place if you are trying to earn a living if you are out of high school. The company does promote inside. So you can grow with the company.
good,good place to start of with to learn how to work in a fast pace employment. they help build good customer service skills good summer job and extra cash.
good,"Toys is liquidating it's operations due to heavy debt burden.  However, it was a fair place to work in it's hey day.  For the most part the people were knowledgeable, competent, and the company was run efficiently."
good,Store management wanted associates to work multiple areas because there is always a shortage of workers. Employees are NOT paid what they are valued. $8.25 is not enough for people to live off of and we shouldn't be working that hard for it!
good,"Before the store opened everything was okay but the moment the store opened everything was crazy. Management became rude when the doors opened and they wanted everything done right there and then. But everyone else was great to work with, the made it fun."
good,"To greet customers as they walk into the store, ask and assist for what they are looking for in particular."
good,Everyone hid everything my manager would lie to our faces when we knew he was he would lie about raises or start new people out more then what others got for being there for years
good,I enjoyed working there and am only leaving because its closing down.  I would have worked there much much longer if it was going to still exist. I think the world will miss us.
good,"In a typical day working at toys r us as a cashier, you'll be answering phones, helping customers from start to finish, asking good (open-ended) questions to best assist them and eventually ringing them through the register. Its mandatory that you explain and offer the rewards and credit card, which count towards your numbers and should your numbers not be so good, your hours may not be that great either.(there are ""benchmark goals"" that may or may not be attainable) In addition to sales, returns, special orders and anything else like donations to ask for or batteries to upsell, you're also responsible for keeping your surrounding area stocked and clean and putting back merchandise. "
good,The setting was nice and all of the employees got along with each other very well and were willing to help each other out. The bad part of my job was having to get people to get the company credit cards.
good,I really did enjoy working for this company. The pay was horrible. The people were great. There was always a toys that could be played with. Overall it was not so bad.
good,"To bad it is closing the stores in the United States. The store,I worked at was a great atmosphere for team work and caring for the team members. But, we had high standards to maintain to keep us at number one in our district."
good,This job was stressful with low pay and there seemed to never be enough people to help. Especially when it cam to unloading the trucks. People would miss work or hire less then capable people to do the work.
good,Bad management. Needs more incentive from senior management to perform well. A typical day of work would be customer service and restocking shelves top ensure they look great.
good,"Working Cash Register "
good,"great environment, awesome management staff, there's always something fun going on. when you get to management there is not much time for home life and there's not enough hours for the team as a whole"
good,"The position that I help with Toys R Us was a seasonal position from coming home for winter break of college. If you do not have any retail experience, like I did, I do not recommend the position. Having my first day on black friday was a very stressful time."
good,"Toysrus was a great place to work for most of my career."
good,"I worked on the babies r us side, loved working and helping the moms to be and their families!!! Have a great team I work with there! We work together as a family and help each other make our guest have wonderful experiences at our store!"
good,"During the Christmas season is when it is stressful and when you have your most hours. Management is okay depending on what store you're going too. If you're not good with stressful situations, Toys R Us isn't the best place. (Especially during the Christmas Season)."
good,"great place to work, very busy daily schedule of deliveries and meeting customer needs, nice to make customers happy by finding them the toys they desire"
good,"It is a nice place to work, the staff is friendly, they give you the necessary preparation, it is a friendly and competitive environment.The hardest part of the job is when you are a seasonal employ."
good,If You Don’t Like Kids Don’t Apply Because You’ll Have To Hear Screaming/Crying Kids All Day Long. Other Thab That It Isn’t A Bad Job It’s Just Not The Right On For Me
good,Good place to work at for the holidays and flexible hours  excellent pay friendly staff and safe place Good customer service unload the trucks restock the toys clean up the store
good,My experience at Toys R Us was unexpectedly especially it being temporary I would have thought they would have needed me to work more days but instead I worked 2 days out of the week for only 8 hours total.
good,very chaotic during black Friday and throughout December but overall i would say it is a very enjoyable place to work at if you want a minimum wage job.
good,"The staff here are friendly and easy to get on with. The hours are flexible but the downside is that there aren't many out of the christmas season."
good,it's a good place to work and get experience from. complete your tasks in a timely manner and have a great attitude and that will take you far in this job.
good,I would of loved to stay at this establishment but they cut my hours from 30+ to like 12 hours a week and I had to pay bills. Toys r us was great just need to appreciate well working employees.
good,"Fun place to work!  Hectic pace during the Holiday season, but the teamwork made it fun.  Seeing the joy and excitement on the faces of children when they walk in the door was the best part of the job."
good,It wasn't as good as I'd thought it be. It wasn't worth the bi-weekly pay. the air conditioning in the girls department was broken so it was a really hot.
good,I worked there before for many years..always loved working there.the hours were long but they would fly by. Some of the same management still worked there when i came back for seasonal this year. It was like i never left.
good,"Hours are great in the christmas season. Not so much the majority of the year. Picks up again slightly in the summer."
good,Good enough for the season. Wouldn’t want to stay afterwards and glad I didn’t. Cashier don’t have to handle returns and if you learn the register quick then you don’t have to call over management too much for help. They hate that.
good,"Working here was like working in any other store, with the expectation to go above and beyond for the customers. There was a large emphasis on credit card applications and warranties as well."
good,Typical day is going in and putting merchandise on shelves in a timely manner and unloading trucks if necessary. Management wasn't good at times. Most enjoyable part was the laid back work environment and being able to be by myself and do my job.
good,"A typical day was boxing layaway orders and online orders. I learned how to use a scanner for looking up items in the store. Hardest part for me was finding the layaways that someone else boxed and getting them for the customer, management was also good."
good,Upper management is not professional. If you enjoy being harassed by management about your availability this is a great place to work. Always short handed and taken advantage of.
good,It was quick the job was seasonal and it was pretty easy to stock toys after the shelves were empty. shift when by fact when work at a nice pace. How ever learning stores was difficulty
good,It was an overall decent seasonal job . I made decent pay . Worked 8 hour shifts . They had decent management .Typical night at work consisted of stocking shelves for opening next day .
good,very fast paced environment to work in. some managers are fair with the employees and some are not. you get your work hour depending on how many credit cards you sell
good,"Toy R Us was  engaged in retail work covering various types of merchandise. It was located along Old Kent road. The training delivered was adequate for my role as retail assistant. As retail assistant it required long hours of continuous standing with very short break period.. This results in cramps and very tired legs after working hours. The management failed to engage adequate number of staff to work in shifts for shorter duration. However, I was able to provide excellent retail services that resulted in sale of products most times. The staff were friendly  and supportive of each other. We normally participate in celebrating the birthdays of colleagues as and when due. this brought about more friendly relationships.."
good,I had fun working at toys r us i felt welcome i learn so much getting People was the best thing smiling and seeing babies/kids help others talking things out helping kids find the nice cool toys was good as well
good,"The stores are falling apart and equipment is never working, or just plain non-existent. Pay is way to low for a department Supervisor, as I could get paid more at many places as a part time sales member."
good,Toys'R'Us was a quiet quick pacing job. the team I was working with was professional and fun. Everyone had their task and performed it swiftly. I enjoyed working there .
good,Toys R Us have some great people working for them but the prospects for advancement is very low because of poor company performance.  The company has been constantly cutting on workforce the last decade.
good,a typical day at work at babies r us was pretty high paced at the customer service area . i also handled the cash register. i learned that babies are expensive
good,"It was only a seasonal job, so not much work experience there.  I was originally scheduled to work the front end, but opted out of that.  I then worked on the floor by organizing shelves and stock.  I would help customers out in anyway which that I could.  It was an overall wonderful learning experience, however during the holiday season made it extremely stressful for me and I felt overwhelmed at times with all the shifts that I was scheduled to work at times there."
good,Did sales / service services / worked on floor/ helped  customers / helped coworkers / ran customer service end of store / would open and close store /
good,Learned about the new products and the expectations of the store compared to other companies. Get to demo the new product in the store. Also interact with customers about getting them certain toys and assist the woman that are pregnant with their registries.
good,"Days are usually filled with meeting and deadlines. Currently the company is very top heavy, but with a lack of direct leadership. You need to be a self motivator who works well on their own and can meet deadlines.  l like what I do and who I do it with, but there is not a lot of opportunity to move up."
good,ToysRUs is a fun company to work at. The location in Owings Mills is not fast paced enough for my liking. The hours are cut short due to the amount of customers received.
good,"This has all of the typical characteristics of a retail job. Lots of customers with varying personalities; some crazy busy days and many involving working short-handed and long hours; sometimes unrealistic expectations. But I also had a lot of fun working for this company, mostly because of the people that I worked with. It is what you make of it. It may not be your ideal career path but you could certainly do a lot worse as far as retail goes (and maybe, like me, you can meet some lifelong friends)."
good,"Good team ethic "
good,"I enjoyed working here. I had both my children working here, so it came in very handy to work here. Stock options were great."
good,"organized work area when it comes to helping customers, merchandise orders and sales. from helping customers to putting new items out to sell for customers."
good,I enjoyed working at Toys R Us. I had fun with all the new products. Putting the items in displays and keeping on top of all the new toys! Often had staffing issues
good,Baby's 'R' Us is a wonderful place to work for if you enjoy being around little kids. Very competitive but can be a good experience to learn. Have to be very quick on your feet. The most enjoyable would be seeing little kids. Very cultural environment. Would recommend young teens to work here.
good,"I worked at toys r us over christmas, it was a pleasurable experience but constantly where trying to contact me whilst I was at college and asked me to work on days I had said I could not work. Apart from that lovely coworkers and friendly supervisors."
good,Long hours because there’s not enough people working because the company keeps cutting hours . It’s a dominoe effect that can’t seem to be fixed my coorporate
good,I enjoyed working Security and would refer it to anyone especially at Securitas. It was a diverse site where I got to meet a lot of different people. I learned and was able to pick up plenty of life skills also.
good,"I was a seasonal employee at an outlet mall location. Part time hours, and the pay was pretty low, but it was something to do. As Christmas got closer and closer, the hours got a little longer, but the pay wasn't worth it."
good,I enjoyed this job however the management left a lot to be desired! Unbearable at times as the sheer rudeness of them was shocking at times. Astounding behaviour for such a lovely place.
good,Toys r us was a seasonal job. I was stocking merchandise and cleaning up isles. This job was temporary and was on night shift. The area I did was action figures for boys.
good,Work here a long time ago I have nothing really to say about this company it was toy r us.  The time I was there was fun but it wasn't my career job.   Just did to make some money.
good,"It is a decent place to work day shifts, but anything having to do with night and overnights, wasn't worth it. the pay was good for overnights, but no paid overtime, even though overtime was mandatory. scheduling was always confusing due to multiple changes. No training was ever provided, you were basically left on your own."
good,"Working at Toys R Us was fun. It was only a seasonal position but the time that I was there, I enjoyed interacting with all the kids and seeing the smiles on their faces."
good,It was seasonal.It lasted 2 months. I would clock in and litrally stand at the register the whole time unless we had to restock merchandise.  I learned how to do returns and restock.
good,Hope the company  grows and helps alot of people in the world. Some great people work there and there great leaders in the company. Love it when they work together.
good,"long hours and even longer hours during holiday season.  Working 12-15 hours daily (during Christmas) however seeing the joy in children's faces when finding that special toy, made my day."
good,fun place to work but sad to stay my place was closed i loved working at the toys r us location i was at seeing all the kids running around the store before christmas and the holiday season picking out toys they were hoping to get on christmas or duing the holidays
good,"Very low paying job. Though, very relaxed atmosphere with cool employees. I was able to work around a needed schedule. Minimum wage for seasonal temporary employees. Black Friday and end of the year sales are your worst nightmare in retail!"
good,Awesome starter job for anyone you can definitely get yourself promoted or get raises if you work hard. great pay sometimes not enough hours but all you have to do is ask. management was both what they should be but yet still a person you would want to be around
good,This was a fun job because of helping parents find toys for their kids and it was always entertaining to see how different kids acted when they came in the store.
good,I don't remember too much from my time working with Toys R' Us but during the time I was a seasonal maintenance and all I could do during that time was to keep the store maintained and bring shopping carts in by hand
good,"It was fun to work there, people made learning fun. It was always fun to see kids happy and picking out toys. Or helping expecting mothers with what to buy."
good,"Not necessary, only seasonal work, one makes the most of each day that you are given to work.  You don't work many days beyond the date that is posted as the end of the season."
good,"working in a retail was not my cup of tea, with customers, working in the back of the store stocking and unloading the trucks was great. was only seasonal employee which became permanent  after Christmas hours. supervisors back then very un organized schedule changes daily."
good,"OK work,OK management. I just think the structure the policies and the building could be revamped. our customers don't take us serious cause or employees don't take us serious.We don't even have a proper asset protection. I've worked there for along time and yet and still i see a lot of criminal act that i cant either prove or instigate"
good,"It was very busy during the holiday season, so I expected everyone to be focused. But the whole store seemed unorganized. The co-workers were great to work with but the managers' were so-so."
good,"In my area of chicagoland if you are working overnight stocking for the Christmas season be prepared to work with a bunch of kids that don't care about their job.  Of course some coworkers were good, but we had to pick up the slack from a bunch of others.  Not too bad of a place to work for the season but not enough hours after the season to get paid enough."
good,It wasn’t very fun to work there. Management was rude everyone was trying to be better than everyone else. It was super stressful and tiring. Management usually just stayed at the front and really didn’t help
good,Pretty standard workplace through out the day. No additional work skills were taught to me. poor management. there wasn't a whole bunch of culture. The hardest part of the work day was helping the customers. The most enjoyable part of the job was interacting with the other employees.
good,"The job was just - meh. Show up to work, fix other peoples problems, fix the customer's issues, deal with whiny employees, talk down overbearing racist managers. All in a days work. Compensation was not too bad though."
good,Toys r us is a fair fun fast and slow paced relaxed place to weork not too busy but not too slow just the right amount and the workers are very helpful and fun and it is a great place to work
good,"a first job for me, I learned a lot. I learned how to work from this job I was moved up pretty quickly but I was focused on school and because of this i ended up quitting and moving on."
good,"Very fast, never a dull moment. You have to be on your toes at all times to be ahead of the changes that go on here, but that is typical of any retail environment."
good,"This company, particularly in the holiday season is fast paced and never boring. If you like putting smiles on the faces of kids of all ages then this is the place for you."
good,"The job is great if you are a teenager looking for something part time but overall it doesnt pay well enough for you to be there full time. And if you did your job well enough, they would have you working longer shifts than you initially were hired for."
good,"ToysRUs is a fun and competitive place to work.  There are constant changes in processes and corporate positions so, flexibility is a must.  Interacting with guests and team members is the enjoyable part of the job especially during the holidays.  Friendly competition among stores/districts is in your daily regimen.  The workplace culture is fast paced and always changing.  The hardest part of the job is keeping everyone on task while still maintaining a high energy guest centric environment.  The key is to make every day and every task fun.  Most of the team members are part time because of school or second jobs."
good,I worked here in high school. It was a great first job. Fun environment. Not something I would do long term unless in management and even then maybe a stepping stone type of situation.
good,Typical day in my area meeting with people and addressing issues.  I enjoy working there and the people I work with are a good group. However the culture there is changing were experience not as important and the younger generation of work force seems to be more valued.
good,fun place to work especially when you have children and during christmas time so you can get discount and they also have layaway manager was nice and always good sales
good,this is an okay job for any type of students. The hours aren't bad and the customers mostly consist of parents looking for nice things for their children. not a bad place to work if you have to patience of reorganizing the store every day
good,"I only worked there for a couple of months due to me relocating to Rexburg, Idaho. The people I worked with were really nice and friendly and willing to help when you had questions. The job itself was stressful because it was really high paced. During the holidays, customers are less friendly and more aggressive."
good,"Good Work place , Learned lots of things from past few years working at Toysrus . Management is okay . One of the hardest part working at Toysrus is working at tight timeline."
good,"I maintained a busy work schedule.  It was a seasonal job during the holidays so there was always something to do between cashier, customer service or stocking inventory.  I learned about what the job entailed and a little about the company which contributed to easy interactions with customers.  Management was knowledgable.  Workplace culture was positive.  I didn't have a hard time because the job responsibilities I had were easy.  The most enjoyable was interacting with customers and other employees at work.  Cashier was fun job."
good,I only worked there seasonal. I had a lot of fun and met a lot of nice people. I would recommend this type of job for someone in school or someone who wants part time work.
good,It's a fast paced setting that will prepare you and test your abilities in the retail experience. The hours are good but the overtime is even better.I recommend anyone to apply
good,"Used to love coming into work. But now all I do is work and never see my family and have nothing to show for it. Upper management just sit in their offices and do nothing while department supervisors run the store. Then upper management complain that supervisors do not know what they are doing, And proceed to talk about all employees to other employees.,,like a high school thing"
good,It has been a long time since I worked for Toys R Us. So long that I can't even remember half the things I did when I worked there. I do know I enjoyed the work environment. It's a good first time job or part-time job.
good,First job. Provided ample opportunities to learn a wide variety of job functions which helped teach me about the many things a blue collar worker will see.
good,"Its all minimal tasks you're doing, not much thought required. The job is pretty much point and pick up for everything. A person who enjoys variety in the work place this would not be the place."
good,It ok to work at toys r us but it's sometimes a big mess.What i have learn from toys r us is that we all help each other as a team and it has a good place to meet new people.
good,With a full time work day you are able to earn enough money to support yourself. Not a heavy job with nice people and good management which helps the days roll by and leaves you satisfied with the work that has been done.
good,"Hours were long and working with kids was exaustive, i thought when i first was hired at the job that i would strictly be in the back but i had to work directly with kids."
good,Overall it is great to work with the children and watch them find what they love. Enjoyable helping a parent find what their kid wants for a special day or holiday.
good,Do your job it is a good place to work. The employees work hard and expect the same from any new hires. Very accommodating to scheduling issues. Friendly environment can be very busy or extremely slow must know how to manage time appropriately.
good,Fun environment to work in. I loved seeing the look on children faces all through out the store on any given day. Did not enjoy having to get massive amounts of people to sign up for a credit card.
good,Worked there prior to children.  A nice atmosphere and was being trained for the new opening of the KRU division.  Left due to having my children and did not go back.
good,Ambiente de trabajo bueno pero mal remunerado y sin posibilidad de promoción
good,"Loaded and unloaded trucks, used pallet jacks to move all stacked items. Refilled sales floor with all products and rearranged the sales floor to the desire of the management"
good,"Very fast paced, lots of restocking and putting merchandise back where they belong. Weekends are very busy and hectic. If you like a fast paced job this is it."
good,Overall an okay place to work. Must like kids. Management was alright. Pay was not good. If you  like toys its a good place to work. Lots of toys and people.
good,There are many areas that make up this facility.  It is over a million square foot warehouse that is largely driven by the conveyor system that weaves throughout the warehouse.
good,Relaxed place to work the environment was great the employees were great management was great. Had fun working while still getting my job done. Was able to work in a team but also worked alone. Both ways was great.
good,From when i was hired between the time i left they had four different managers. Some of them had never worked in retail before and did not know what they were doing.
good,Overnight work was fairly simple and easy to do. Coworkers were nice and managers were always available to help. most physical work consisted of lifting boxes of toys or assembling displays.
good,I enjoyed working here. Fun place to work. Everyone worked as a team. Not really any room for advancement.  The hours are pretty bad if you're not a manager.
good,This is a great place to work you have a lot of fun. good sales people will prosper in this company. they provide plenty of overtime and opportunity for growth
good,"When i worked here under the age of 18 was a good place for that bit of pocket money. the job itself was good, i learnt how to work a till and helped out customers with what item they was looking for"
good,I worked at a pretty busy babies r us and it proved to be a very stressful environment. the staff morale was low and our management expected too much of us.
good,During the holiday season you will work like you have never worked before. This company does most of its business from Black Friday till New Year's Eve.
good,Have to work at a fast pace to be able to have good working svores must always be on look out sometimes it gets very hot. Sometimes its hard to make things fair
good,"I only worked seasonally at Toys R Us. It got very busy during Black Friday time and Christmas time as you would expect. I worked a mixture of sales and stock because both areas needed the extra help. The per hour pay was poor but the amount of overtime given made up for that a little bit. There were constant trucks coming in and out, unloading product so I spent a lot of time after work helping with that."
good,It was fun place to work. Many hours to work fun it was fun ok I filled out what I had to say why does this have to be 150 charaters minimum in the first place.
good,libertad a la hora de ejecutar decisiones e iniciativas.
good,"I had a good experience working at this job. Fun interaction with kids, friendly co-workers. This job really shown me to be patience with others. The management team was great very helpful with new team members. The hardest part of this job was working on Christmas Eve till midnight. Over all my experience was a good one."
good,The management was a little rude. The employees were great. I was able to learn and advance in this company. The hours were great. The store closed down.
good,"Toys R Us is a great company to work for. This was my first ever job and I was taught a lot in the 6 months in which I worked there. "
good,"I was responsible for Furniture Dept. placing special orders for pick-up and or delivery. Assist customers with registering and Stocking Area."
good,Job consisted of stocking and unloading trucks. Hours varied but still got a full week in. On truck days may need being in as early as 3am but other then that usually around 6am to stock shelves before store opened
good,"Wasn't there long enough for a proper review."
good,Work was different each day depending on the job you had that day. As a stocker on the floor the job was fun because you got to move around and help customers that needed assistance.
good,"A lot of managers were under experienced and would forgot to take time to do scheduling and training. "
good,"Toys R Us is one of those places that requires a lot of patience. Customers are always looking for that one toy to make their child's day but half of the time due to shipping errors and computer malfunctions, it made it hard to comply. Management is rarely ever there, they are always busy with some other issue. The hardest part was wintertime, customers are always coming in last minute to get their child's gift. We understand most of the time that you had to wait to get paid but customers usually take it personally.  But the best part was seeing those kids jump up and down while squeezing their toy to their chest."
good,"Toys R Us was a seasonal position.  Was in charge of 8 staff members.  Was in charge of unloading and packing out of trucks, counting out tills and taking deposits to the bank,"
good,Worked as a world lead from working at the registers to organizing a stockroom. great appreciation for the employees. Fun place to work. held accountable for all work positive and negative.
good,"If you have never worked retail, the environment could be  stressful. With budget cuts and payroll constraints you have a lot on your plate as a salary manager."
good,This was my first job and I enjoyed it. I loved the energy the clerks had. This is where I learned how to be a good courtesy clerk. I loved dealing with people and helping them out.
good,Pretty much what the summary says.  It's a fun place to work for the holiday season if you need some extra cash.  If you're looking for a career?  Don't even bother.
good,The most enjoyable part of the day is being able to help all the families that come into the store daily. The staff here at Toys R Us is excellent and I've learned a lot from each one of them.
good,"I was a seasonal worker, and it was not bad at all. I dont give it a super high score, simply because there were no benefits and very little option for a seasonal worker to become non seasonal."
good,Very truthful and I answered based on my experience and this is what I think about toys r us! But another than That I have nothing else to say they just need to improve on a couple of things
good,Worked mainly by myself assembling bikes and various other toys. It was a relaxed atmosphere as long as your did your job. Everyone was friendly and easy going.
good,"Nothing glamorous working in this company.  The schedule is simple, you work and then go home.  Doesn't have any real benefits or cons.  Health Insurance is standard and vacation days are based on hours worked.  Management is ok, but focuses heavily on metrics(this is normal)."
good,the pay was not that great because if they where cutting hours that means that the temporary and part time employees was getting the hours cut while full time employees was not. an at eight dollars a hour was not a lot of money.
good,"	Redesign the salesman commission system and convert the ISAM files to Oracle. "
good,really not to much to say seasonal job only worked there a couple months during Christmas season gave me more customer service experience good work place
good,hey how you doing my name is jonathan I use to work at toys r us in the summer I just didn't like the pay they want I to pay me for all the hard work iuse to do
good,Proud to be part of the team. Work with many cross functional teams and learned print and digital advertising. Made a lot of great friends. Great location and cafeteria on site.
good,"Wake up early, Restock using pallet jacks and pallets that are brought out on floor. Make everything look appropriate, stock as children and parents move everything and ask you questions."
good,"My job role required me to serve customers at one department of the store, called Babies are us and that involved the sale of items for newborn babies, toddlers and children of early age."
good,I worked the over night shift. I learned how to stock the shelves. management was ok. The hardest part was staying up at night. The best was the check
good,"I just wanna compliment the other members of staff I worked with, they really made working in TRU an amazing place. The work itself was typical of a large retail store, lots of heavy lifting and warehouse work but there were plenty of opportunities to help out members of staff or do various roles to prevent boredom."
good,Employees are nice and the hours given are workable if you are looking for a part time job that has no set schedule. Will work with availability of your choice
good,"working as a cashier it can get very hectic, especially during the holiday season.  The manager was not very friendly but did her job very well.  The store can get very disorganized and can be a chore to reorganize."
good,"I worked for Toys R Us as a seasonal worker. I was given the desired amount of hours I wanted to work most of the time. Some of the cons are that certain workers were singled out for either working too hard or not enough. If you work hard here, you get acknowledgement, but the workers who hardly worked never got in trouble."
good,"Easy job tasks. Starting wages above minimum wage"
good,"I got a job at Toys R Us during my first semester of my first year in college. I was only a seasonal employee coming in the last two months of working. Overall,  the job was nice and I was able to work around a lot of toys. It was fun."
good,"This is  decent place to work for is not all that great but some of the mangers are great and positive and some of them I got nothing good to say about them, you do get a great hand on opportunity,but there are so many scheduling conflicts either not enough people or not enough hours the hr person there is great very helpful if I forget a password, all and all its ok place to work for"
good,This was always my seasonal job. I was always welcomed back with open arms! Coworkers were always pleasant to work with as well! Always enjoyed my time here
good,"Wasn't good at first but a few changes have made all the difference."
good,"It was a decent job I guess, I mean if you disregard the crying kids, careless parents and people who get mad when certain things are out of stock- yet there's a slip out there stating that there is some. Apparently it's my personal fault that the store doesn't have anymore in stock."
good,It was ok for the time being I was there I worked hard and did extra time. Its a force to have your credit card score up thats all they ask for and to tidy up the place
good,its a nice place to work in but the store can get really hot and when its hot and busy at the same time it gets stressful so it isnt a nice atmosphere to work in
good,Working within this company was a treat. Being a kid at heart allowed me to surround myself with toys and kids. Theres no better feeling than helping a child find the perfect toy.
good,Fun work place truly colorful and joyful. A place for all ages to shop. Over all the work was fun competition to see who could sell the most protection plans.
good,"Enjoyed assisting customers while at the registered and at the floor.  The managers took their time to train their new staff members correctly and professionally. A very nice work environment, everyone was very friendly."
good,you had to be on time and have a flexible schedule during holiday seasons it was stressful yet a somewhat relaxed environment. the management was friendly. i learned how to stock and straighten up the shelves. the hardest part of working there is the customers can have very high tensions in the work space. the most enjoyable part was being able to have a great opportunity to work for such an amazing company. a typical day at work was standing at the cash register and being able to be on the floor helping the customers.
good,"Management and work staff is enjoyable to work with, very knowledgable and open to teaching anyone who asks, very friendly staff and a place i loved working for"
good,Sitting at a cash register is not fun. It's all they really had me do but I was not trained for anything else. The people were pretty nice there. It was an okay work environment
good,It was a typical retail job. Nothing special about it. Management was attentive but not overly happy to be at work. I did enjoy working there during the busy season.
good,work was always like any other day and also sometimes their would be fun involved. I learned a lot of new skills with RF scanner and in the shipping department but really didn't enjoy working in shipping since that was never my position and also would take on other peoples work that wasn't part of what you were assigned from the beginning. Would also get taken advantage of at times while trying to leave on schedule times and would have to explain what happened to overnight team supervisor and tell the next time on what had happened so that i wouldn't get into trouble which they would give me overtime pay and take  over. Horrible place to work to be honest and would get used moving us around when we had non experience in a certain part but would have to learn without learning how to do stuff.
good,"I only got to work for Toys r Us for a short period of time, but over all the Christmas season was a fun time to experience the Toys r us company and what it has to offer."
good,It was great first job. Learned many things that are needed in the job field. Although dealing with angry parents looking for specific toy only toys r us carries during Christmas season can be rough.
good,"Obviously I enjoy working for this company or I would not have stayed for more than 30 years. I have enjoyed the various job duties within this company, they have given me a lot of job experience."
good,"Great management, room for growth, shifts were ok, clean and organized, motivating employees, good discount, on the job training, easy uniform, good people"
good,"Working at Toys R Us was a great introduction to store management and cash management.  I enjoyed the front end manager position best, which was responsible for refunds, cashiers, daily cash count and merchandising in the front of the store."
good,"Handle Customer Accounts issues. Responsibilities Communicate with customer to resolve product issues"
good,"a typical day consisted of just helpimg customers make decisions about products and services they needed and checked them out at the register.I learned great customer service here.i really liked management the they were easy to get along with.The work place culture was great ,there was no better feeling that to be surrounded by expecting mothers and their excitement. The hardest part of the job was dealing with unpleasant customers when we didnt have what they needed in the store.The most enjoyable part of the job was seeing the smile on a mothers face when you were able to help them with everything they needed."
good,"I started here seasonal but after I proved how hard I work I was hired on permanently. The drive was a bit far and I got in an accident and could not find a way to work out hours with my lack of transportation with management, but overall it was a fun place to work."
good,This was a seasonal position for me a few years ago and it was an okay experience for me.          There weren't any problems during my seasonal time working here.
good,"toys r us is very unorganized especially around the holidays. You do not get many hours and can be sent home if business is slow. The manager at the time was hard to work with. The work that you do is not worth the pay. I applied as a chaser and before you knew it i was unloading trucks, and stocking the store."
good,I enjoyed my position with Toys R Us.  Company shared the goals and key performance metrics consistently and measured often.  I worked with a great group of people.
good,seasonal work only long hours during the holiday and they pushed sales of store credit card way to much by cashiers when we were busy enough helping on register
good,It was an ok job. Helping customers. Organizing and stocking shelves. Cleaning up store. Folding clothes. Climbing on ladders to get certain items and using the computer to find certain things.
good,"While the workplace is fun and the customers are, for the most part, nice, this is not a career for most people. Management are somewhat disorganized and sometimes apathetic to how the store is run."
good,As a cashier I mostly dealt with customer transactions. This meant eight hours a day stand and waiting for someone to come by to purchase a toy. When I was allow to help on the floor I would be bombarded by rude customers and messy aisles. But management was kind and would take care of you.
good,"Managers were not very helpful.  I was on register and needed help and there was no managers around.  I wasn't sure if I had rung up some stuff correctly and it might have not rung up at all.  I didn't know how to look back at the items."
good,the hours can run later than scheduled and if you cant accommodate the later times not scheduled they threaten your job. The basic hours in the day are good hours. Working with customers is a good experience.
good,I learned a lot about the retail world. I learned to run the cash register. Stock goods. Unload trucks. Assemble merchandise. Process damages. Process goods to return to warehouse.
good,All the coworkers were really funny and very helpful. The managers and supervisors made sure that the store was safe. I learned a lot from working there.
good,I enjoyed working with the new pregnant mothers to help them prepare for their new little ones.  I would help with questions while assisting with registries or buying for new little ones.
good,It is a good job but the company doesn't really take care of its employees. It is difficult to try and stay busy 100% of the time and it isn't what I would recommend as a way to provide for a family unless you were the manager of the store.
good,"A decent experience overall. Co-workers are nice and friendly. Environment is is good but could use some improvements. However, its works well for job experience in retail."
good,A typical day at work consist of coming in getting equipment and head to my work station(which ere I'm assigned to that day) rather it be the dock to unload the truck or the back of house to scan in overstock inventory. Once inventory is done i would then proceed to the floor to begin stocking shelves or helping customers find their desired items.
good,"Working in the stockroom was a great experience, only downfall was they didn't teach you how to organize the merchandise correctly the way they wanted it and then got mad at you when 3 other managers would tell you how to organize them a different way."
good,I worked this job straight out of high school as a seasonal worker. There is not much too be said about it otherwise. My supervisors were good people.
good,"Direct oversight and responsibility of fleet, shop, yard staff, dispatch operations, DOT compliance and financials servicing 89 stores in a six state region while working closely with store, corporate office and DC operations."
good,"This was a good experience over all; the majority of the staff was patient with me. This was my first ""cashiering"" job. Working with the very young employees was very challenging, since they got to goof off alot, while many of the adults like myself had to pick the slack. The night supervisor was not very friendly, but she knew everything about the store. She never complimented any of the hard workers!"
good,"it was when I was young and just left school , it was only a temp placement over Christmas my role was to fill shelves and top up stock from the previous days opening"
good,Policies and procedures change often. It is hard to keep track of who has the right answer for the question you may have. Working with management can be ambiguous.
good,"There are many job roles to do at Toys R Us, audit is important to work as part of a team in order to do all the jobs effectively. It does get very busy and can be quite challenging to deal with customers at times, however with a calm and patient manner it can be a good place to work."
good,"Job has opportunities to advance. Depending on your store manager, store can have a great family-like environment. Christmas and Thanksgiving is crazy, but that's to be expected"
good,"the pay and the hours are bad. they never let you work more than 30 hours to avoid paying benefits. the hours are never steady, i worked all times of day even overnight."
good,"easy going job, had tasks everyday to complete so time was used well, friendly work enviroment, job satisfaction and good motivational workers, always on top"
good,Empresa estable y reconocida con turnos por horas .
good,"Like any other job, toys r us  is ok. Besides the fact they work you to death. Had a few times my check wasn't right, which they fixed.  Not the best but ok."
good,Several rounds of layoffs and reorgs.  It is a tough place to work as you are doing multiple jobs due to cuts.  Limited opportunity for advancement....
good,"The first thing I would need to finish would be the COSA, which is their banking system. Followed by the signoff of yesterdays earnings to the Loomis Company. The store was place on the other popular end of the Kittery Outlets so we didnt get too many customers but it did give us time to clean and prep for any upcoming events."
good,Toys R us Oldbury is a good job for students around the Christmas period as there are many hours available due to the store being a favorite for children's gifts.
good,"Overall decent place to work, great customers, wish the pay was higher. Fun and fast paced. Associates are not committed to the store or customers, they do a lot of walking around, talking,  and taking breaks."
good,"i enjoyed working at this company but it just wasn't for me  "
good,"Days were easy, filled with childrens laughter. I enjoyed working here because being able to see the joy that toys bring to kids is amazing. The parents were a blessing as well."
good,"The experience at my store has been positive however the pay rate is not competitive with other companies, including local competition, and little room for advancement within the company."
good,Poor work ethic from most employees and all management. Training was acceptable. corporate input was good but lacked the ability to follow through in the store.
good,Great opportunity to work in the corporate office of the largest toy company on earth. I have had quite a few positions during my time working here. Though the work life balance was not what I prefer it to be it was still a great opportunity to learn and grow new skills.
good,I really enjoyed working here. The job was fairly easy and I pick it up quickly. The hardest part of the job was finding quitting. I learned how to truly stock the proper way and to be efficient.
good,It was good while it lasted. It is like any other toy store in retail. it was only seasonal and for only three months. The actual store is no longer around.
good,I love my job especially when it's busy. I've learned about care seats and stuff I never knew I will need to know information about. It's mostly females that work there so the hardest part about my job is lifting big items.
good,"the job wasn't bad but when it comes to times you've cleaned the whole store and there is no customers to assist and you cannot find anything to do you get moaned at for doing nothing when in reality you've been working really hard on the store and keeping it tidy"
good,"It was nice helping customers but it was dissatisfying when i got my paycheck. (it was a seasonal job,with not many hours) I carried on although like i always will no matter the job."
good,"Learn a lot how to manage time, how to handle customer, checking product and placement or stock. Good teamwork and partner. Difficulties is when you cant find the missing item and how you cash money is less than what you sold. Most like happy environment."
good,"Working in a toy store seems to be every kids dream. But the reality is that it is also extremely tiring. Although you may be the cashier but you made to do everything in the store such as logistics, sales and customer service all at the same time."
good,It was a productive place to work. keeps you busy. Typical day would be unloading  truck and stock shelves. I really did not learn since I had prior experience. culture is really close. hardest part of the job was the overnight shift. Most enjoyable part of the job was the people working there with me.
good,"Depending which staff you work with doing your shift. Started out a nice place to work, been there a year and a half busting my butt working and the furthest I have moved is furniture desk. I'm a hard worker and I have owned my own business for a short time and I can't stay in one position for a long time. Not much room or opportunity to advance."
good,"Typical day at work for Toys R Us depends on your position. Sales Associates usually cashier, and do re-shop. Back of House Associates stock the floor with items needed, along with bringing guest orders to the front."
good,"Fun, busy place to work over the festive period. lots of young staff, and a fun environment. the only downfall was having to have a mobile phone on each staff member which was a direct line from customers. It was distracting when dealing with customers face to face."
good,"Benefits can be good but they only apply if you are full time employee. Very tough in the back, they expect you to work at a steady pace even when you are tired. Pay is quite good and hours vary depending on season."
good,was a fun place to work management was easy to get along with hardest part of job was unloading trucks and putting product away
good,"ok job, barely remember it too, winter job in college and remember that I had some fun met people here that I am friends with to this day, this was along time ago"
good,Working at for babies r us has been good learning and life experience very fast past store and management was also an ok thing but I wouldn't work back at the location I was at
good,"Atypical day at work was mild not too slow and not too busy."
good,"Hired as seasonal and temp for the holidays, so all you do is cashier. It is actually a lot of fun, although crazy all the time. But you can always talk to management about any concern, and not be scared of losing your job. If you do a good job, they may call you back again."
good,Not much to say other then this is where I first started my retail career. Toys r us back then was the go to location for toys during the holidays. It was very busy and I learned a tremendous amount about responsibility and giving your best effort. Effort will be rewarded.
good,toys R us was is a great job for High school students its just to put a couple of bucks in your pocket. the job isn't hard at all. its common sense
good,Its a good job with growing opportunies it is normal paced not a hostile hectic environment a typical workday the best part of the job is the co workers
good,Friendly staff and great co-workers but pay is horrible an no career advancement opportunities. Recommended for seasonal only or high school grads and not a permanent job.
good,a typical day at work involved organizing the merchandise and putting it in the correct aisle. I learned a lot from this job and really enjoyed the environment. everyone was really helpful anytime I had a question about the workplace.
good,"Good job to have starting out. Season time teaches employees great customer service skills, and merchandising skills.  Season was the best and hardest part of the job. This job taught me a lot and started me on my retail path and merchandising career."
good,"Every day I would work from 9 pm to 7am. most days we would have truck that we would usually take until about midnight to unload, and then spent the rest of the work night unpacking and stocking the shelves. I arrived a little under two weeks before christmas and everything was pretty hectic, so I didnt really have any formal training. I had to ask one of my co-workers how things operated and what to do. I only interacted with my manager a hand full of times as he was always busy doing other things. The employees we all fairly friendly and we got along well. The hardest part of the job was probably getting used to where everything was and having to stand on my feet all night long. The most enjoyable part was that I could work at my own pace and I could choose to work on an aisle by myself or work alongside a co-worker."
good,not a terrible place to work but management was always hounding the associates on getting more credit applications. thats part of how they determine who stays on after the seasonal holidays. they look to see how many each associate got
good,"Typical day at work consists of typical management duties. Tasks change daily. I learned a great deal about customer service. Management is constantly changing. Workplace culture is fun at times, but is far outweighed by the constant absences and attitudes of the associates. Most enjoyable part is dealing with customers, and setting aisles."
good,"I worked part time at night while my children were home with their father.  I enjoyed the busy work and the people I worked with."
good,"A typical day at work would be to go in unload the truck, take items to the floor stock them on the shelves, make labels, rack items that are overstock. I have learned to read and create planograms and to train others. Management is stern but fair. The hardest part of the job is when we are short handed. The most enjoyable part of the job is my fellow employees, I get along great with everyone and helping put smiles on customers faces"
good,"A great employee discount, not enough hours are given, the christmas season is awesome, You have to remain positive with rude customers"
good,Seemed as though the company has a high turnover rate. Prior to starting I heard employees would frequently leave. Many employees seemed stressed out more often than not.
good,"buen ambiente laboral entre compañeros pero no entre superiores, mala educación al hablar, siempre malas formas y tratos como si fuésemos inferiores, no tenían en cuenta nuestras opiniones ni vida personal."
good,"It is an okay job to have the people are nice  and it is a nice steady pace job to work at the pay and the hours are a little bit not to my liking but all around it's a fair job. A normal day at toys r us is just working on the cash register, helping guest, and fixing the toys and making them look nice. The best part about the job is the discounts we get 10% off on anything and 20% off on snacks and candy."
good,"Awesome place to work at. Really great management and colleagues. Will work here again!"
good,"This position was quite enjoyable. We had to work as a team through busy periods to make sure our customers were satisfied. Daily tasks included replenishing stock, demonstrating products, taking payment."
good,Toys R Us is a good place to work; there will always be friendly and smiling faces. Toys R Us is also a very busy to work but it is worth it. I enjoyed the kids running in the store with so much excitement in them.
good,"Working here was fun, an enjoyable overnight experience with some great people. An easy going work environment. Included unloading trucks and then proceeding to stock shelves."
good,would be a great job for someone entering the job force. There are a few different avenues that you can go in and learn for future employment opportunites elsewhere/
good,"working there was fun. Getting to meet different people on a daily basis. The people I worked with were fun, cool and we always had a good time at work with each other."
good,"it was a fun place to work but management was never on the same page. they were never around when cashiers needed help and always rolled their eyes every time they could. they also never tell people when they let them go, they just stop scheduling you. and when you ask them about your schedule they played dumb."
good,"It's typically a slow paced environment but when the holiday season prepared to be working for 10-12 hours sometimes without a break, the hardest part probably was being pressured to get credit card sign ups from customers. The managers are very helpful and patient. Co-workers are usually friendly and helpful if needed.I learned how to deal with different types of customers and how to react to them."
good,"I learned that a lot of people don't want to open a charge account. My co workers were nice, I liked them. Talking to customers were a good part about the job. Management I could care less about, yea they were good but I would be working 6-8 hour shifts with no break. It's like they didn't care about breaks. Hardest part was dealin with difficult customers."
good,"always busy, nice environment to work in, affordable prices, witness protection follows protocol, employees are always working hard, management is on top of everything"
good,"my day included merchandising, inventory, cashier, stocking, and truck unloading, answering phones."
good,Good benefits. Holidays are hectic. Ran pretty efficiently for a big box retail. Terrible work life balance for managers. You would work 6 or 7 days a week and at least 12 hours a day during holidays.
good,"No real room for growth, mostly a fun, positive environment but there is a sometimes unreasonable expectation to sell credit cards to customers."
good,"I enjoyed working with moms-to-be, informing them of how their life is going to change once their baby come. Learning new products and selling it to customers. Only con would be that there was no consistency in hours or management."
good,good place to start at entry level job and work your way up. good for just getting out of school and for learning experience
good,Every day we interact with children and get to show them the latest and greatest toys. Making sure I stay on top of all managerial duties! Always a good day and every day is all new.
good,the environment there was so good every one is helpful . i had a great time working for them on the toy parts . the salary wasn't that good   but anyway it was a nice experience .
good,"very good environment and culture , very family oriented company and truly care for their customers and employee. you just have to work a lot of hour and closing is the worst especially to clean up ."
good,This is a great starter job. I love the management at this job as well as the welcoming environment. The only downside to this job is there is not a lot of room for advancement.
good,I believe it was an overall good experience. I enjoyable working alongside my co-workers everyone worked well together. The management team always was there for everyone and always willing to help.
good,"It was a good place to work. Kept me very busy because it was a seasonal job. So I worked during Christmas. Was an overall nice place to work good management, etc.."
good,"A typical workday consists of providing customer service to guests as they enter the building and especially in high shrink departments. I gained valuable loss prevention experience with this company. The co-workers there would have your back in hostile situations. The most enjoyable part of the job was assisting in the apprehension of shoplifters, however, this was the hardest part of the job because there were many policies that can easily be broken in a matter of seconds."
good,It was a very fast paced work environment with somewhat strict schedules. My co-workers were usually people trying to find another job while temporarily working at Toys R Us.
good,"I started working here when I first started college, and decided to stay as a casual employee when I started at Staples in order to keep extra money flow."
good,It was a good company with strict policies and procedures. Its not a hard job but it is very tedious and alot is demanded out of you.
good,It's a good job if your just starting out I only worked seasonal but generally a fun place to work every one was really nice there. Management was good except for one who was really rude.
good,"This job was somethin good to add for future work experience far as truck unloading, stocking, replenishing , and customer service . As for me personally I've done so well they have made me stock room team lead  immediately ."
good,"Of course its fun to work in a toy store! However the location and management made things not so fun. Being as though I took metro I expected to get off at my scheduled time, they would try to keep longer because it is ""retail"". That was my biggest problem with this job. The best part of the job was the discount. I  would work at Toys R' US again just at a different location,"
good,"It was a great experience. Everyone pushed everyone to work harder. The supervisor pushed us and stayed on top of us to make sure business was handled, but at the same time we had fun."
good,"This was my first job, and I was employed as a Christmas temp. Although I did not particularly enjoy my time here it did improve my time management skills."
good,"The company pushes us to sell everything possible, no matter what the customer wants, and that makes the customers cranky with us. Everyone feels like the company, and some management, doesn't care about the employees whatsoever. Kids are the most enjoyable part of my day, and that shouldn't be the reason I work here anymore."
good,Assisting customers on the sale floor as well as at the register. Answering any questions that guests might have about certain products in the store or online
good,"Everyday there will be work you no matter what. This a work place where you can't slack off, if you work hard and prove you're capable of management you'll get there eventually. The manager was one of the hardest working people I've ever met. With that being said you'll be expected to do the same, it can be stressful but you'll be rewarded for that hard work. The hardest part of the job was managing my schedule between two full time jobs. The people I worked with were all amazing individuals that worked hard. Being hired here shows that you are one of those people, not everybody is hired even though it's a retail position."
good,never a moment to waste. projects and customers make the day go by too fast. not enough hours in the day to complete everything
good,"The job its self was easy. There was little training. On my first day I was already handling the service desk, alone. They worked with my schedule and was very friendly. I was only hired on through seasonal, I was OK with that. We weren't assigned a specific area. We did all jobs and rotated throughout the day. After closing, everyone left would restock and walk the store assuring it was cleaned for the next day. Lunches were OK, a few vending machines in the break room."
good,"very good work environment friendly employees very helpful easy work everything is explained fully in detail for you once you get the hang of it, it becomes so much easy"
good,"It was ok, the management was not very helpful. Customers were not happy. Lots of theft that none of the employees cared about. Overall it was an ok first job."
good,"this job was part time for aweil. was fun working with the toys, giving people knowledge on products. i really enjoyed helping everyone. the hardest part of  this job was, doing truck, basicly was loading or unloading and stock by my self ,didn't really get the help i needed."
good,"A typical day at work is just full of laughter with customers that needs help with everything and jokingly say they're new to this having a child thing to even managers joking with you about family stories or job stories. I learned so much at this job and i love all my managers and coworkers. Really aren't any hard parts in the job after being there for so long, i enjoy every part of my job now."
good,Toys R Us was a fun and productive work place that put family before work but also has great benefits and time off the work place
good,"lets start with my co-workers 90% rude and thought they were managers lol they also give you the impression they can intimidate you, um they didn't, i did have fun working with a good group which made working there much easier and worth coming to...most of the workers didn't want to be there i get it who does right? especially on the weekends but we are all here for the same reason,,management was great before i got hired after it was all downhill all i can say is be aware of who you work with... the managers and supervisors look out for #1 always they will get your fired some how, some way...make sure you look at your schedules really good if they're two versions of the schedule in your store confirm both otherwise bad things happen..a typical day consisted of me being at the register rarely doing go-backs during working hours but after hours yes if you thought you were going home when you clocked out WRONG!! expect to be there an additional 2 hours after your shift has ended you get yelled at like all day even when your doing your job it's like they abuse their title remember they started out just like us at one point so i never took them seriously! the hardest part was learning credit cards and selling them and dealing with managers ...the best part was being surrounded by good people and helping customers in a store you actually love and know...overall this was the store i had worked at doesn't mean you'll deal with the same stuff but please be aware and learn well."
good,Worked in stockrooms which was hard work but enjoyed working with the people. Working during Christmas was also very demanding
good,"short employment nice coworkers, nice friendly environment to work in, structured time, locked in during never night shifts."
good,"It was a good working environment, I loved it because it was labor type of work. I got to use my hands and deal with customers. It was my first job so it taught me the concept of making money and working for it."
good,a typical day at babies r us was always interesting because all the customers were different.. i have learned to respect people opnions and learn the customer to the best of my ability through conversation to keep them satisfied and wanting to always buy more.. some of the manager well nice and some took advantage of the position.. all my co. workers loved me and always looked forward to me coming to work because its never a dull moment.. the hardest part of my job is have a customer leave without satisfaction.. the most enjoyable part of my job was having customers request me while im there or days of because i always find them what they want or need and more!
good,"At Toys R Us, I was a part of the electronic and media department. I was accountable for assuring the needs of every customer in my department, as well as operating the registers, stocking and cleaning the store at the end of the shifts. While working at Toys R Us, I have gain customer service skills and also experience in working in retail."
good,Working for this company was very eye opening it allowed me to sharpen my customer service skills. They were very easy going and allowed for flexibility with my schedule.
good,Work hard to make sure team members are taken care of.  The management is good but can sometimes be unorganized or have too high of expectations.
good,"Help restock shelves, cashier and cash out customers. I learned  where most of the toys were at and was learning how each department was ran. My Co-Workers were very helpful and Management as well."
good,"The most enjoyable part of the job is the interaction with the customers. In regards to the most difficult part of the job, the time and effort was not put in to properly train management."
good,"Toy's R Us, is a great work environment for the young generation they work around your busy school schedules, they have great team work and their really good on reaching their goals for the day, management is pretty cool they push you to do as good as you can, the hardest part of the job is when it gets super busy, but I like that because it keeps you going and you always have something to keep you busy and going, what I enjoyed about working here is meeting new customers everyday even though you had some bad ones and really good nice ones but you do learn a lot on a day to day basics."
good,I enjoyed working there the money was great and I had Sunday off. They provided a good work place and I was a machine operator there.
good,"Clocked in and worked at Customer Service desk, answering phone calls, looking up products, putting products on hold, ringing up products for customers. Hardest part was the late hours at night cleaning. The most enjoyable is working with co-workers."
good,Ive worked for them during two different holiday periods its fun. The hardest part of the job is putting back all the toys.
good,It was a pretty great day at work helping and dealing with customers during the holiday season. The experience I gained while working at Toys R Us is that it takes team work and effort in order to work in a fast paced environment.
good,"Flexible hours. Overall, good co-workers. Always something to do. Decent benefits. Can be stressful, as is all retail."
good,"Teaches you the importance of multi tasking in a ""Big Box"" retailer.  Typical retail environment with fast pace work load and good/bad managers.  Not a bad company to work for but lack advancement opportunities."
good,It was a nice job but hope to work long. Nice working with people and cashiering. It was  usually a busy day there. Had lots of fun.
good,Cool place to work! Pretty flexible with the hours you wish to work (except some major holidays). I have built some great friendships with some of my coworkers.
good,learned how to properly stock all items on the sales floor as well as how to find items stored in the back when not found in the front of the store
good,"Outbound for the online companies: ToysRus, BabiesRus, Babies Universe, and Etoys. Fast paced fulfillment requirements daily. Pick/pack items via Item Fetch. Managed Gift wrap station and train other employees. Cycle counting via IC count: Receive and count stock items. Pack and unpack items. Verify inventory computations. Clean and maintain supplies. Examine and inspect stock items. Provide assistance or direction whenever needed."
good,Seasonal can be stressful. If you enjoy working with toys and setting new planograms and layouts this can be a fun job. The hardest part is under staff and recover especially after major holidays.
good,very fast paced and could be a little more organized in departments. learned how sign up customers for credit card and rewards card.
good,"Was suppose to be a temp job to tied me over and stayed there for "
good,the pay isnt the greatest for how much pressure they put on their employees and there is little recognition for good work
good,customers are friendly...the co-workers are the best....the management is ok to me...i like that it's close to a shopping area
good,"Day At Work : handling inbound outbound operation."
good,"Load/unload truck, replenish shelves, print tags, and assist customers. I've learned great customer service skills. The most enjoyable part of the job was to see a customer leave satisfied."
good,"Great company to work with supervisors are very flexible"
good,"Toys R Us was my first real job and there I learned how to work as team and with the large amount of seasonal workers meant that we were never understaffed and could always get stuff done, as a seasonal worker I had a specific job with the occasional helping out in other places at the store, but my schedule was pretty routine."
good,Toys 'R Us was a stepping stone for me as I got ready to enter the work force. I was employed here as a seasonal worker during the holiday season. I quickly learned that I was good with customer service and I got work on a team.
good,"If you're into Babies, toys, etc it's a great place to work.I learned all of my customer service skills here and a lot of life skills, because I started when I was 16. Typically I handled cash and returns and baby registries. The most enjoyable part was watching the babies and families grow. Watching the mom grow during pregnancy and then watching the child grow afterwards is amazing."
good,"hectic"
good,"The typical days work at Toysrus was always fun filled & busy, I learnt how to communicate as a team and on my own."
good,"- my typical day at work was in the morning. re-stock new purchase and tag the prices"
good,"It's was fun for the most part, dealing with customers, learning about the toys and people needs. It could have an higher pay for the work employees put in. You do more than just your job. We unload trucks. stock the shelves and do customer service. the plus side of it is that it was fun and worth staying."
good,a typical day was to help customers to find this in the store.ie toys.to make the customers fell welcomed in the store.we had 20 staff members and they were all great to work with.
good,"A typical day at work consisted of unloading trailers, labeling product, and breaking down pallets of product to proper locations while verifying quality and using proper safety equipment."
good,"Facilitated interview activities by identifying candidates to be considered for positions, coordinating candidate interviews and collaborating with facility/program leadership on extending offers to qualified candidates. Utilized a Taleo based ATS database to match incoming applicants to open positions based on weekly staffing projections and information provided by production managers. Designed and implemented a successful full-cycle recruitment strategy, which boosted the quantity and quality of available labor pool for the 2015/2016 season. In addition to recruiting and coordinating interviews, the position was also responsible for monitoring the status of new-hire On-Boarding."
good,"Toys R Us was a fun and exciting place to work. The environment was great and co-workers and management were great to work with. A typical day included keeping the store neat, running a register, stocking shelves, answering customer questions, etc. The job wasn't very difficult, in fact in was very enjoyable interacting with positive people that are shopping for smiles via toys. Being a Toys R Us employee is really all giggles until you don't have the luxury to live life playing around all the time. Employment at Toys R Us is less satisfying when trying to handle recurring financial responsibilities, a demanding personal life and the desire to advance a career. The crazy hours, low wages and limited upward mobility potential eventually wipes the smile off your face."
good,Working seasonal stocking and also cashier. Good job if you are into toys. Some of the staff was very rude but other than that good job.
good,co workers were nice never had any problems working there they also worked well with me as far as my availability not very motivated organized in their work ethics but over all the seasonal workers were all helpful towards one another unlike the full time employers.
good,"best time to work there is seasonal, lots of hours and customers. at the same time, worst time to work there is seasonal. high traffic means your going to meet some of the best people and some of the worst people, but management does a good job of assisting and keeping positive."
good,"Toys R Us has a fun and dynamic culture and the Finance team is filled with highly intelligent and passionate team members."
good,didn't enjoy the job at all the staff and the managers and manage was shocking there attitude towards jobs and staff was disgusting they wasn't very nice people to work for at all
good,typical day at toy r us was mainly just stocking things in the back warehouse and stocking things on shelf's. On busier days you would help customers find things.
good,"Day to Day work is entertaining, "
good,"You can get a lot of experience working here. Also a good work out. i felt like i did a lot of walking, heavy lifting. i love working here but the hours were not that great sometimes. either you get two-fours a day or 10-12 hours a day depends on work flow."
good,"learned a lot of teamwork skills "
good,Good job to make a little extra cash during the holidayh season. they provide plenty of hours and if you are dedicated tp the comapny you may adnavce within the company
good,"atencion al cliente, dentro de un buen clima de trabajo, un clima agradable y buenos compañeros"
good,"Overnight workers have it better, position is only seasonal but there's less cranky customers to deal with. There's a lot of work to do as far as unloading back to back truck deliveries."
good,"wonderful experience! I worked during Christmas and my long days never seemed too long, it was always busy making time fly."
good,Was seasonal and felt as if I was treated unfairly. Had to many people telling me how I was messing up and no one could tell me how to do it properly. Improper training.
good,"It's a retail environment so expect lots of stress, workers with a general lack of motivation, long hours, lower pay, incompetent management."
good,"Good place to work, management needs to have better structure. Not enough accountability of performance. Good mix of individuals; could use stronger talent search."
good,"Management at this store is very unsupportive and does not foster collective team work ethic, however they do allow for longer work hours and opportunity to come in to work on scheduled days off in order to work longer. Employees band together to work collectively without support or encouragement of management. Also the breaks are very short, regardless of the length of time you are working you only get one 30 minute break, whether it is a 5 hour or 9 hour shift, there is only a 30 minute lunch break allotted for employees."
good,"The managers and fellow employees while I worked made the job better but the changing schedules, even with preferences and seasonal needs, could be difficult to manage sometimes. I learned a lot about the different areas of the store, the necessary programs and technologies needed to preform my job, as well as basic tech specs for the electronics department where I mainly worked."
good,"The management team at the Toys r Us I was working at gave me an alter ma tum. It was either go to school and dont have a job, or either quit school to keep my job."
good,"Job stability is not very good, but managers are supportive. Stressful work environment, but helpful and courteous coworkers."
good,On the daily basis you will be placed into a section and you would have to keep toys out of the way in aisles. You would then do re-shop for items that has been returned or left in a different area.
good,Working at Toys R Us was a great experience. I loved being able to work so close with the employees and managers. I learned a lot about people and customer service.
good,"I enjoyed my job, i work with people fulfill customer orders and handler merchandise for customers as well as using a computer for packing customer orders and scanning orders."
good,When I started working there I never received any special training of any kind. They took me in and started me working and the employees weren't very friendly either.  No one to talk to and the store was mostly empty because it was a hard time for that particular store itself and eventually it closed down permanently.
good,I worked for this company but it was originally for the the chrostmas period but hourts had stopped there as I was only key time and couldn't give me the hours I currently needed at the time
good,"Stock Member 							"
good,"This job is like most retail jobs. It is busy at holidays and dead for most of the year. If you enjoy helping children and making them smile through finding the right toy for them, then this job is for you."
good,"A typical day at work I had to be on the doc at 2pm-11pm Monday-Friday unloading and loading all shapes and size boxes in a orderly manner, and fast passé. I've learned how to work under pressure due to stacking the different size boxes in a neat manner while being timed, and also working in different weather climates because it could be very hot at times and also very cold."
good,"I only worked with Toys R Us for a short seasonal two months and learned a great deal of patience and the gratitude of helping a customer. Typically I cashiered and held my place at point of sale, occasionally I'd help stock or put away recovery (items customers no longer wanted)."
good,"Lavoro divertente peccato e' durato troppo poco"
good,"cashier, stock and clean up the store after work. They have some deals sometimes for kids toys. Learning about the different electronics."
good,meeting and helping customers daily. restock constantly. night shift gets overtime because you have to close the store and takes about an extra 1-2 hours
good,"did not too much care for this job. was very nasty worked in a hot diesel all day.9.50 an hour and  did not get many days off and it was all for a little pay. yes a job is a job but sometimes a friendly, team working environment can help a company go a long way"
good,"My time working here was... okay. I had no problems with my co-workers, and management was okay. It kept changing every year though, and I recall a time where I was tasked to sweep up leaves out in the cold. While it did get me away from the less then civil customers, it wasn't that enjoyable."
good,"Enjoyed meeting and helping people. Learned many new things. Some schedules were inconvenient, but still doable. Pleasant atmospheres."
good,i learned to stock shelves and make sure inventory was complete . provide great customer service and exceed sales and work well with other.
good,"loved working here, i wish the people in the office would see how hard the teachers work here, they do not pay much for all that you are required to do, and you don't earn much time off either, they also frown on calling in but if your sick you are sick."
good,Sometimes i helped customers but mostly it was sales for Christmas holiday. It was fun to work with kids and help parents find toys for their little ones but the management was not great.
good,"I enjoyed my time here as it was a fast paced very busy environment which I prefer. Everyday I had new deadlines to reach and I was never doing nothing. Everyday I was assigned to the same 3 stations to work which I also prefer as that way I know every task I need to complete. My co-workers helped majorly towards making my day happy, we all got along and helped each other if and when it was needed. Unfortunately a short time into my time here me and 4 other workers were told by the agency that we were no longer needed."
good,"not a great place  to work but    staff and management really good, however  the area managers did not know what was going on most of the time"
good,"I liked learning the newest toy coming out for kids, it would make you pay attention and to see people get exited about games and spending time with their family was amazing."
good,"This job can require a lot of patience. You are dealing with many children running around and playing with the toys. It can be a lot of fun though if you are a child at heart. After all, who doesn't love Power Wheels?"
good,I really enjoyed working overnight and having that experience this job was actually fun and is a very active job placing stuff around and the store and stocking at each aisle.
good,Great when meeting people that are excited to make a purchase.  Many foreigner's come in and in awe of the amount of toys.  Not the business I would see myself in the future.  Unfortunately kids are too entitled nowadays and demand they are due something.  Sad state of our kids.
good,"It's been quite some time since I've been there - it was a great atmosphere, good workers and good management. "
good,"Management was great, Decent hours. Friendly co-workers. I worked during Christmas season so customers weren't to friendly, but it is a good place to work."
good,"I have been with this company for 4 years and I am so grateful for all the knowledge that it has given me. Due to this company I have become trained in so many areas that I work in every department of my store. I can help every customer with whatever they are looking for, from the baby side to the toy side I know where everything is. This company is the reason why I have most of the knowledge that I have in the work force."
good,My over all experience was pretty decent. It was hard to move up and sometimes I felt that we weren't appreciated enough for all the work we did. But overall it was a positive experience.
good,"Great fun place to work. An individual has the ability to grow sale through demos of toys throughout the entire store. At store level, staffing plans fall short causing a task driven environment."
good,"Safe place to work. Good co- worker employee relations. Easy going."
good,"You help customers around the store, some are hard to deal with, some are nice. Black Friday is the hardest part but the day goes by quick and the company provides breakfast/dinner."
good,"You may think working for a toy company would be great, and it could be."
good,"The team members and select managers were comfortable to work with and fun. A typical day at work involved reviewing applicants, updating the break room, supervising at front desk, fixing apparel and misc. tasks. There was a clear pick of favorites, and anyone who tried to challenge the management was putting their job in jeopardy. There was variety in my everyday tasks although the job is slow until in-season begins."
good,"Very numbers driven and very task driven. Inventory replenishment system constantly in process of being improved, which is both and good for our customers.  Working with the employees and colleagues was very enjoyable and learning from them."
good,I worked in receiving and was one of the top rated employees in the building. I had a trailer where I had to unload it by hand and in the next bay was the exact same load being unloading by a friend of mine done by forklift. I was 5 minutes faster and was told I was 20% too slow. That was when I signed up for college and left warehousing for good.
good,"While I was only hired seasonally, I enjoyed my time employed there and was trained very well. I caught on quickly and was allowed to ask questions to further my knowledge. The company did a great job maintaining a safe and productive workplace while dealing with the holiday shoppers."
good,"Toys""R""Us is a great starting point for individuals looking to get work experience. With all the toys in the store, it is slightly encouraged to play with the toys in order to better to sell the product."
good,I really enjoyed the looking at all the neat merchandise and the different people who came in to purchase and the associates I worked with needed to be more uplifting and open minded.
good,Kept me on my toes with new price tagging and opening and stocking shelves. Kept my focus. Supervisor was very supportive and helpful.
good,I was not asked to continue after my seasonal period because I didn't do well in selling warrantee packages. Otherwise they were easy to work with and for and I don't know what its like to work full time or permanently with them.
good,"It's a rollercoaster ride to work here. It can go from slow and boring to extremely busy in two minutes (literally). I learned exactly how far my multitasking can take me at this job. You will be answering customer phone calls, while responding to customers in the store, and looking for items in the store and online for five different people at one time with a smile on your face. I loved it! "
good,I loved working here it was a good experience for a new cashier or sales floor attendant. The manager is very understanding and humble man. The coworkers were very team oriented. the only thing is they dont get much work after the holidays and they cut hours drastically.
good,The staff was great but the hours didn't work for me but I needed the extra money during the holiday season and would go back occasionally during the christmas season
good,Very organized business although very understaffed and goals seemed unrealistic when placed in line with providing great customer service while maintaining service goals for the day. Would have loved the company more if work load was more evenly split for night shifts
good,"I only worked for Toys R' Us for a month during the Christmas rush of 2007. In that month however, I did feel like I received at least two months experience."
good,As a part time job I had limited time there to make many comments.  I was able to work hard and get paid an amount.  Moved on once full time work was found.
good,If you are a college student who needs low hours and have no kids then this is the perfect job for you.  One thing I didn't like about the job is that you are sometimes stuck on the register and don't be relieved whenever you want.  Can't always take a break or leave without somebody covering for you.  If you had an emergency at home or with one of your kids at school this may be a problem.
good,"Seasonal position restocking shelves, unfortunately the season was basically short, too short to form any kind of review on the company."
good,Enjoyed working there. Very busy but all work together and helped each other out. Management helped out and everyone got along
good,The old saying toys r us kid was true. There was always fun times. The management staff made working there fun and exciting
good,"Toys R Us is good as a first time job. But they do not allow you to grow as worker, manger plays favorites. The best thing was to work with toys and seeing families happy when they got what they wanted."
good,"Always an eventful day working retail, this was a pretty simple job. Management however, was terrible, human resources visited almost on a monthly biases."
good,I only held a seasonal position here but I learned a lot from every staff member and customer during the time with the company.
good,TRY is an okay place to work for if you are a high school needing gas money. Not a place to make a career out of. No real incentive to do more than what is expected of you.
good,My experience with this company was an okay experience.  I worked BOH as the overnight stock crew and the job was very easy.
good,A typical day entails working with customers and handling money at the register as well as other misc. projects that need to be done.
good,"I processed returns, cashiered and helped customers with Problems. It was very fun to work with all the toys and children around."
good,The hours were cool . The coworkers were fun to be around. I enjoyed being of every weekend. management was great. I We typically unloaded trucks with a conveyour.
good,"stocking boxes and customer service"
good,Overall it was an ok job. There were times of very slow business with rushes intermittently. You usually had to find something to do for yourself so that you don't have to organize shelves. Lots of standing and lifting.
good,"It was a typical retail job the only difference was you were working around toys and kids, all other operations were generic."
good,"Guest Services at ToysRUs can be really fun.  Interacting with kids and  helping them learn how to ""manage their money"" is a highlight and it is very rewarding assisting guests with finding something special.  The hardest part of the job is upset customers, but that can be the most rewarding as well, when I am able to resolve problems and have guests leaving satisfied."
good,Loved interacting and socialising with the customers and my other work mates. the hardest part about the job was gaining back my confidence which i did when i was fully trained on the tills and i was able to my job to the best of my ability
good,Toys R Us was for me a very fun place to work. It was a job that I would have loved the opportunity to grow further in. This was a good retail environment.
good,"Filled with smart peopletrying very hard to turn the company around, Nice campus"
good,Not much room for improvement but it is a fun environment if you have good managers. Turnover rate for managers is high so you need to get used to new management.
good,Ok company good for minors and young adults. Will give you good retail experience. Very diverse work group. Seasonal employees get pay raise if they come back as full time.
good,Working hard and pleasing guests with the best service. Making sure they get everything they needed and more. What I've learn is that every guests may not always be completely satisfied unless I try hard enough to do something well enough to walk out our doors with no problem.
good,"Great breakroom for employees to enjoy throughout the day, almost all employees work with very little supervision and job still got done on a daily basis.  Hardest part of job is to stay productive without supervision, but is a great plus that you dont have supervision micromanaging everything."
good,"The job was ok. It just was a seasonal job. I really enjoyed being in the public eyes and interacting with customers. Dealing with customers sometime was hard. If I couldn't answer their question, I would tell them im going to get somebody that can help you."
good,This is not a job for someone who want a slow past job.  there is always something that needs to be done.  The hours are long during the holiday season and not the best paying job.
good,Management was not the best. The co-workers were pretty lazy. The customers were very interesting and had a lot to complain about when I was working here.
good,An interesting and fast passed place to work especially during the holidays. Something always new going on and new product.
good,I loved Working There. It was a Seasonal Position. I loved working with the Public. I liked seeing the new Products that came in
good,The job is okay. My coworkers and management team are all great people. But the pay is definitely not worth what they ask you for. If you aren't part of management team then you are part time and thats that. Its not enough to live off of.
good,"A typical day working at Toys R' Us consisted of cashiering and communicating with several shoppers. My co-workers were all easy to get along with, and they made the time move rapidly."
good,The location that I worked at was very far from my home.  I also did not like the cycle of cleaning the store and having everything in order to find it destroyed the next day.
good,"manager were very unprofessional. they have over night closing to Christmas season and hours are long and very demanding,"
good,A typical day at work will be standing for long periods of hours servicing  people and there needs .helping the best way I know how .
good,Cashier/Customer Service Representative was fun working at toy r us did get really busy during the holidays especially around Christmas timing with parents shopping for their little ones.
good,"productive i learned how to stock, drop boxes,good customer service the people were nice and willing to help if you didn't understand"
good,"Toys R Us is a great place to work if you like customer service and might not have much experience elsewhere. There are some opportunities to move up in the ranks but from what I understand it takes years. "
good,Specialty retailer in highly competitive categories facing both brick & mortar as well as on-line competition.  Executive team is relatively new and working to turn around the businesses.
good,"Learned to multitask with handling customers, stocking, and keeping the establishment clean. Learned to work well with others and that having a good relationship with co workers makes work a better place to be at"
good,"Each day was pretty much the same no issues just work. At the time i learned to load U-boats by box identification, load and unload bays, scan items, load and unload shelves, use most equipment, and a little time with customers. Management could have been better, break times were usually short, and lots of sarcastic things were said. Co-workers were no problem they were all easy to understand and get along with, and especially focused on working hard. The hardest part of the job was probably being sent to do something i had no training on. The most enjoyable thing was knowing that i had worked hard each and every single workday."
good,Working 3rd shift for Toys R Us is kind of hard. You don't really have much of a life. You mostly go to work around 10pm and do not get off until 6am. Everyone needs rest so I felt like I was wasting my entire day away and never really saw my family unless I was off. You work long hours and is on your feet for long periods of time. Lifting heavy boxes is not unusual.
good,This was a very enjoyable work place for the one month I was there. Management was very kind and nice not bad to say about them. The hardest part was trying to get the hours they gave me t work with the bus schedule.
good,"Even though it was only a seasonal job, it kept me busy, it was a fun environment to work in. Pleasant experience. I would recommend it as a good place to gain experience."
good,I was a cashier and it was only seasonal for the holidays from October to January. I had to sell reward cards and clean the candy section. It was a nice first job.
good,"Learnt how the buying world works and how to build good relationships with suppliers and internal staff."
good,Toys R Us is a Very friendly place to work.  People are very helpful and I very much enjoyed working there and performing excellent customer service...
good,Gained a lot of experience (even if in short period). Learned to be more patient and learned a great deal of teamwork as well as working individually \.
good,"All roads lead to the buyer here, which is great as you are then merchandiser, catalouge planner, marketing, store planning."
good,"Typical day included greeting guests, searching the system for products, ringing up customers, doing returns and exchanges, keeping certain areas of the store clean all while having a smile on my face which wasn't hard."
good,"Ensure a positive in-store experience and customer satisfaction.  Monitored cameras, checked store employees, surveyed store floor.  Completed loss reports and followed company protocol."
good,"I think overall that it was a wonderful experience. The employees made it very fun and professional. I learned how to be a good cashier, sales floor representative and  have great customer service while working guest services. A typical day is good, you go and clock in. Get 30 minutes lunches, 15 minutes breaks, and if you have personal issues to address too like restroom needs, it is permitable. The hardest part of the job was honestly trying to understand what the youngest customers were saying when they tried to give me a description of what they were looking for. I enjoyed working with kids. They made my job fun. I enjoyed a child walking out of Toy's R Us knowing that my co workers, managers, and myself made somebodys day."
good,worked with a good crew enjoyed the job unfortunately no room for advancement or career opportunities pay was not enough to survive on
good,I love the people I work with but the compensation is minimum wage. I wish we got paid more but we don't. The discount is tax only. I only continue working here because of my co workers I dont really belive the company cares for its employees.
good,"This is a great place to work at if it is your first job. The atmosphere seem to specialize  in that manner. I would have rather worked for their sister company, babiesrus."
good,"Fun place to work. It makes you feel like a kid again seeing other children faces when their buying an item from here. Great staff, easy going worl duties and reasonable pay."
good,"A typical day at Toys R Us consisted of me clocking in, walking to the back of house area and getting started on unloading the shipment of boxes waiting to be removed from the truck provided. Afterward that task is completed, we all start on one side of the store and being emptying each box and stocking the item(s) in its designated location. Once that step has been completed, we return anything that was not able to fit on the floor to back stock."
good,A multi-lingual workforce provides challenges to overcome.  Many employee recognition events keep the workforce engaged.  Must take the initiative to get the job done on a daily basis.
good,"Always had great respect for the company early on.  Cared greatly for their employees.  As the years went by the company changed and the opposite became reality.  I thoroughly enjoyed my 33+ years though.  Loved my store teams, the job I was doing and my tenure with the company."
good,"Good job, too many employees not enough managers. Bad pay, but good hours. The managers are very understanding. Always busy so be ready to work hard. Job positions are a little sexist"
good,"A typical day as a stock team member is Back of House- (BOH)"
good,"Loved helping customers."
good,"I think I am a person with goals of overcoming and meet my goals very professionally , I try to help and support my coworkers and follow the rules and regulations established by"
good,My management and co-workers was not as strive as me to get ours tasks done correctly. We manage to work together to get each job done. I like to work with them again but under better circumstances.
good,"It was a fun job, we came in for and we would either pack boxes or pick the gifts for the orders which go inside the boxes."
good,Pretty nice job enjoyed working there. fairly ok work environment. timely breaks.
good,"There are a lot of locations where the management had no clue what they are doing and it was evident. I worked for this company way to long to not have moved into any lead/supervisor positions. If I could make the choice on leaving earlier for a different employer I would have. The job isn't extremely hard but it does get overbearingly boring. This is due to the lack in job rotation that the stores have. However, if you ever just want to work overnight for a season I recommend it."
good,"change prices through out store, make signs with current ads and greet to assist each guest walking inside store. ring on register as a back up.file paper work in my office and always be prepared for an audit"
good,It was a fun place to work. Not much room for opportunity. The pay was little and the days were long
good,Pulled merchandise from warehouse at night for morning shift. Stock merchandise in am. Checked out customers daily. Helped customers find certain products or ordered them for them.
good,"A typical day at work includes cleaning up sales floor, assisting guests, and answering phones"
good,Just like all other retail jobs.  No family time unless you are part time. During season the store is open 24hrs and you feel like you never grt to go home
good,"Learned to deal with customers complaints and how to satisfy them, to sell promotions and make the display look better. Deal with large amounts of money and if no one was around to help me find prices, I would run to the front quickly and find out. Enjoyed learning new skills and helping people, if they needed me."
good,"I recently started working there and got thrown to the dogs and had to work black Friday with minimal training. I got a scheduled that didn't have any work on it for a whole week. the HR manager is great and I like here but the back of the house people some are to be desired for. the one woman who trained me was just fantastic and was very knowledgeable and the rest had their knowledge but wasn't exactly friendly. the owner Mike is a Fantastic guy, but some of the managers back of house need a refresher that I'm not the know it all and only been there for 3 days and doesn't know everything."
good,"Working overnight isn't what most people want, my manager was cool but my supervisor was always on my back over minor and miscellaneous things, co-workers were nice"
good,Los compañeros siempre se prestan a ayudarte en todo lo necesario y hay muy buen ambiente de trabajo
good,It was a great experience learning to enjoy your work. Also allowed me to be myself and build great customer service skills. The company was also flexible with your schedule. A great entry level job for students.
good,"cobrar caja."
good,"a typical day at work is busy always something to do"
good,"Hands-on experience in accepting payments from customers and giving back change and receipts "
good,If you enjoy children and don't mind messes go to Toy R Us. The children will play with toys and not buy them but hey....that's the job.
good,"Oversee the management and implementation of competitive pricing and promotional initiatives.  Partner with the merchant, finance, and marketing teams to incorporate competitive pricing intelligence into pricing and promotion strategies and decisions that maximize sales and EBITDA."
good,"I enjoyed this job because it is a different experience for me especially during the holiday season. It was crazy in the store. It was just a rush that you couldn't get over and just made you work, work, work and the day and night would just go by so fast."
good,I enjoyed dealing with children on a daily basis. I loved the hectic environment.
good,I really enjoyed working here the people and the environment was great but unfortunately the hours/compensation wasn't enough for me to make my bills.
good,"It was an ok environment, for me at least."
good,"Average retail company, great to work at for seasonal,the most enjoyable part of the job was communication"
good,Clock in and check out customer's items continuously. I learned how to use their register and information on new toys. Co-workers are friendly. The hardest part of the job is when there's a rush of customers at your register. The most enjoyable part of the job is...
good,"job was seasonal"
good,"On busy days, you stand on the cash register all day doing cashier duties. On calm days you're on the sales floor helping out the new mothers who frequent the store. The managers and co-workers are cool people. The most enjoyable part is seeing a really cute baby. The hardest is having to deal with the crying babies."
good,Worked in the distribution center so I could interact with employees and respond quickly to an issues of concern.  Toys R Us was a union company.  Make it difficult for the Managers to discipline workers without union representation.
good,"Price- quoting, bar-scanning,freight concerns,customer concerns,and some maintenance concerns throughout the day."
good,Typical retail store. Pay isn't great but benefits are. Discount would be better if it was more.
good,"Busy periods during public holidays. Cash Handling, Stock take and customer queries"
good,It's an OK place to work. I have so much fun every single day. Toys has taught me the meaning of life and such.
good,"Job was not to hard, got to see the new toys before they hit the floor, great co-works."
good,this was a good job for me because of hours.did not work here long because I relocated to Delaware.i like the warehouse type environment which is a big plus.
good,We all split up into groups to unload pull or stock the items i learned
good,I was only seasonal so i can't say how it truly is on a regular bases.
good,Place to work if you are looking for a part time job. The place to be if you are good with kids
good,It is alright until management conspires against their employees.
good,Learned how to deal with customers and their many personalities.  Wonderful training.
good,Most enjoyable thing about the job was the team I worked with. As far as the pay it wasnt really that good.
good,Good place to be in for new start ups. Good working environment
good,The job was a good seasonal job and they were generous with overtime.
good,"While working for their company, I never experienced anything negative. Its a great place to work part time for additional income and for first timers"
good,Easy work. Most training is on the job. I learned how to be patient when problems occur. Hardest part of the job is not having as much time as needed to get assignments. Most enjoyable part is making customers happy and getting to see newborn babies.
good,Its was a decent place to work at you just helped sell toys. Management wanted you to promote reward cards and credit cards
good,"the job was ok "
good,"The people I worked with here nice and a hoot to work with, but hours get slashed dramatically during the slow months. Customers can and generally are a terror to work with."
good,"Working for Babies R Us/Toys R Us, LLC is a decent job to have for a first job in retail."
good,"Work Monday - Friday"
good,This company caters to the family and its growing needs in a growing big business.
good,"My daily job insisted of knowing the items we had."
good,Easy work stocking the warehouse usually not a lot of heavy lifting.
good,"I only worked weekends and the occasional mid week shift in order to focus more on my studies. For what it is, the job is a good for a part time job to supply money to assist in full time studies, working 12 hours a week. The most enjoyable part of the of the job would be customer satisfaction. Assisting parents in making the best choice of present for their child, or helping them spend their money wisely is very rewarding, especially when they are appreciative of the service provided. Management are great when on the same page but sometimes wires get crossed and communication is lacking. I have learned key experience in working as part of a team, and dividing my time wisely between studies and work."
good,"I would clock in and find who I would be working with or for the day. I would stock shelves, pick up toys that were in the wrong area, help customers and ring customers up. Most of the time it was very busy. Most employees were great to work with and very helpful. Some of the managers seemed to have a power trip. The hardest part of the job would have to have been not knowing where everything was in the store. The most enjoyable part of this job was getting to be around new people daily. I learned how to ring customers out at the cash register."
good,It was a seasonal job and they worked us pretty hard and blamed us for everything. But it was fun while it lasted.
good,"Very well run busy and fast passed work environment, very fun and based on customer experience"
good,Ok job to have for the summer. Not meant for permanent employment
good,"This is not a job for the phant at heart. You must be quick to respond and answer question as well as phones. You have to be product knowledgeable and very willing to compromise with management, coworkers and customers. The most exciting part of the day was the ""Jump start"" meeting and going home."
good,Seeing all the new products was enjoyable in addition to seeing happy customers.
good,World Leader (supervisor) in charge of 5 employees. Learned to deal with general public.  Problem solved coordination of certain departments. Enjoyed the child like atmosphere.
good,Store manager was not great and the work load they give you is not worth the pay
good,"Retail work is never easy. Management cares about making numbers (credit cards, rewards programs, insurance program for toys). They work with your availability. Co-workers were great."
good,At first I worked overnight in the stock crew. Then I worked during the day as a sales associate.
good,"Decent atmosphere, could do better about employees break time, it was an okay place to work during the Holiday season."
good,This was a good job during the Christmas period as it was busy. I was also one of the few asked back to take part in the stock take.
good,Meeting people from all works of life in a retail enviroment
good,"Hardest part was staying on my feet for hours, after nonstop inventory work. The managers were okay, they were understanding, but i think it was very unorganized, they didn't even know my name, there were so many people hired in a short amount of time. Most enjoyable part was communicating with costumers ."
good,"My typical day would consist of cashing people out with the register, creating online orders, filling online orders, creating registries. I would work hand in hand with other teammates to make sure the customers are taken care of. The hardest part of the job is to have disgruntled customers and try to fix the issue they have. The most enjoyable part of the job is dealing with new moms and the excitement that having a baby brings."
good,depending on the day I would be greeting and helping patrons or unloading a truck that just came with new product for the store. A fun and laid back working environment.
good,"I enjoyed working downtown in the city."
good,"Provided excellent customer service. Learned and followed company procedures. Performed duties such as maintaining a clean shopping as well as work environment, Baby Registration, cashier."
good,I loved working at the cashier and having customers that enjoyed to interact with my and were very friendly. The management was great and really enjoyed the people I worked with. The store is a very big place so it would be difficult to try and find another coworker that needed to assistant a customer. Retail was an experience for me but was not my favorite. I did not enjoy having customers that were rude to me and did not want to be friendly to me.
good,"Management needs improve, strictly on the job training from co-workers,"
good,"Loading and unloading trucks, stocking the floor, filling and retrieving guest orders."
good,"OKay, retail job. Basic goals and basic tasks. Enjoyed working for the company, although a better discount or incentives would be a nice bonus for people who want to work harder than others."
good,"Team memeber on a cool 3rd shift crew, the job was seasonal but i enjoyed it for the most part."
good,Management was friendly and worked well with scheduling around availability
good,Typical retail part time job. low pay pay low hours. There really isn't no benefits for the employees. Management was decent.
good,"Great co workers "
good,stage voor school en had het op zich wel naar me zin maar het was de verkeerde opleiding
good,"Typical day included pulling reports of the computer, going over numbers with staff, unloading and sorting merchandise, and assisting customers.  The best part of the day was helping people find exactly what they needed and bringing a smile to their face.  The coworkers were extremely helpful and responded to the daily challenges of loading/unloading merchandise and getting it to the salesfloor in a timely manner."
good,"Once you get used to the shift and the hours, the job wasn't all that bad. The managers stayed off your back as long as you knew what you were doing and did your job. If you didn't, watch out. The pay wasn't great and it was only part time work but the potential benefits were great."
good,"rung up merchandise, cash handling, good customer service. stock and clean merchandise on shelves."
good,A retail company that's easy to work for and quick to hire. Management is good like most retail jobs. One of the better companies to work for.
good,I loved working here everyone got along and the place was kept neat.
good,"overnight stockers had to unload truck of products and place on shelving in deferent departments"
good,"fun environment, great place to work at for young people, enjoyed working with my co worker"
good,no team work overworked underpaid and no flexibility at all
good,stock unload trucks help customers build strollers and car seats baby gear items
good,very upbeat and the families enjoy most of the workers. typical retail job.
good,"I would come in when ever scheduled, which would only be 2 day out of the week. Most weeks I wouldn't get put on the schedule. "
good,"do not make wave,management does not like the truth.being a yes person,the most enjoyable part is being told you did a good job."
good,Great company. Great managers. I loved my co-workers. Great opportunity for advancement.
good,"taking care of customers and their kids, managers and co-workers were very fun and energetic to work around. working here taught me of working in a loud, fast paced environment."
good,"Multimedia and shop floor sales: customer service, stock samples and stock replenishment. "
good,"I enjoyed working at BRU/TRU. It was always a fun place to work for. I was able to meet new people and help them with their questions. I enjoyed doing what I was doing and getting to interact with all the young children. It always brought a smile to my face. Working at this company has taught me so much. It has taught me work ethic and responsibility, how to peruse what it is I want, how to be patient and how to enjoy everyday. I enjoyed that the company also helped families when there was a terrible occurrence in their lives.it has always been something that I admired about the company and that they would also donate to Toys for tots."
good,"a typical day at work is fun and I learn something new most day, the management is great and friendly, the co-workers are fun and also friendly, still haven't found no part that hard yet. I really enjoy encountering with the customers. I love this job but wish I could just get enough hours per week."
good,"I would come to work clock in and start working on my assignment until I completed it or the manager would ask me to stop and do something else."
good,"This was only ever a short term contract and ceased at Xmas. The reason why i only gave 3 stars for Management was solely because, there were so many and there were Managers leaving (3), and new Managers taking over. As i was only there for 3 months, I feel i cannot give a true account.  As a whole the job was enjoyable, but very tiring. There could have been more to make the staff less stressed. The working hours were very long without breaks given."
good,"Un dia normal se entraba  a las 07:00. Se ordenaba, despues se cambiaban las cabezeras, promociones etc..."
good,Enjoyed helping parents and children find what the needed.Worked with a good group of people
good,Standing for 8 to 12 hours a day to help people buy toys for their children and grandchildren.
good,"•	Multimedia Customer Advisor specialising in games and          consoles"
good,I Only Worked 2 months for Christmas Season for Toys-R-Us So I Really Cant Answer These Questions.
good,My experience working for ToysRus has been overall pretty good. The one thing that could be improved on is possibly better communication opportunities for workers and managers - work e-mails would be a good experience to stay up-to-date on work expectations and specific position oriented goals. Possibly creating a chain communication system that organizes daily needs and goals.
good,"Laid back atmosphere, but keen on completing task in orderly fashion. Supervisors are understanding and friendly. Learned how to use Rt scanner. Overall experience was good."
good,Working at toys r us was a very great place to work. I had wonderful co-worker. It is a team job. I like to help customers with anything they needed such as help finding a product.
good,"Handling customers and solving small question and problems."
good,"A typical work day would usually be smooth and fun. All of my co-works were nice and very easy to get along with, they always made the work days go by faster. The hardest part of the job would cleaning up after all the kids had destroyed the store. The most enjoyable part of the job would playing with all the toys whenever I got bored."
good,A typical day at work is bringing down and putting up pallets into the rack storage locations. I learned how to drive a turret truck through their company. The management there is pretty affective how they operate. The co-workers at Toys R Us are pretty good people. The hardest part of the job was trying to maintain your productivity rate. It's not a task. The most enjoyable part of the job was receiving my checks.
good,"A quiet retail environment, lots of filling shelves. A great team to work with."
good,"opened and closed store, customer service, training, interviewing and hiring. Every day was different. Management was great and taught me a lot. Co-workers were also great and fun to work with. Hardest part was hiring up to 100 temporory employees for seasonal employment. Most enjoyable was the knowledge obtained while working there."
good,I wasn't trained well enough but I found my way through each trial. management was okay. my co workers were good. Hardest part was working the sales floor and having to go into work at 6am some days. The most enjoyable part was re stocking shelves at night when the store was closed.
good,"It is only based on commission. You can make money during the Holidays, but that is about it."
good,The work flow at Toys R Us is constant non stop work until its break and lunch which is good keeps you motivated. I have learned how to work in a fast past work force. Management was always open for discussion and answered all questions pertaining to the job at hand. My co-workers was great to work with everyone was friendly and was willing to lend ah helping hand. The hardest part of the job was the unloading of the truck but on the other hand work is work no complaints on my part the enjoyable part was seeing the different toys that came out during my time of stay.
good,"Workday is usually laid back assisting customers, maintaining store and replenishment. Truck days are usually more physical labor and fast pace."
good,Do not wish to review good job i encourage anyone to apply fast and easy to get accustomed too
good,"fun place to work, great environment.  co-workers were fun and knowledgeable in the products that were sold"
good,"A typical day at work for me includes working hard and at a fast pace, all while paying close attention to details and finishing all work assignments within a timely manner. The hardest part of the job is maybe not having enough employees with the same kind of work ethic as yourself. The most enjoyable part of the job is staying focused and meeting or/and exceeding goals and expectations."
good,I worked there as my first job and it was a seasonal position. We had to learn a lot in a short time
good,"Good job but can be hectic at times, but fun environment! I enjoyed the kids!"
good,i was fun working at toysrus. my hours were short and did not tire me out. i enjoyed it there and loved meeting all the new people.
good,"First off, the store hired way too many people for the work that was needed/required on an everyday basis. The managers seemed a bit unorganized, as some of the events that were held seemed very last minute and had little to no advertising/preparations. Fun people, and the Babies R Us part of the store was great to work in, as you felt like you were legitimately making a difference by helping people."
good,Made sure that all the customers had everything that they needed. Rang them up and an orderly fashion to make sure that the lines where not backed up too far. Cleaned store and made sure that everything was neat and able to find.
good,you  sell toys and games and you help people find stuff birthdays and christmas
good,"A typical day at work is clocking in, setting up station, and providing information about merchandise to customers and making transactions."
good,"Employees are not treated fairly at Babies R Us. Pregnant women are asked to stock high shelves with any type of boxes: small, medium, or big."
good,Great and fun place to work. Great co-workers. Advancement opportunities.
good,The only thing I dislike is the lack of hours and days they schedule me
good,"Helping customers, in charge of returns, go backs, as well as general customer service."
good,A decent company not much upward mobility. Can be a good job with the right management.
good,Stocking toys and changing the store around. i worked overnight so was pretty easy. when no customers are in the store it is easier to restock etc....
good,"Good management, clean store, co-workers helpful.  Good training program.  Not much else to say since I was only a part-time employee that transitioned from seasonal to permenant."
good,"Centrarse en su lugar de trabajo, deja tiempo libre para la vida personal, buena compañía en el trabajo."
good,"was only ther for a few months, as a seasonal worker, an it was so long ago, but management an co worker was good to me"
good,"My job was to run the customer service desk. I would  answer phones, handle returns, and customer questions and comments. My co-workers where probably the best group of individuals anyone could ever ask for. The hardest part was working a 14 hour shift on black Friday."
good,minimal pay..but overall fun experience .. good people and bad managers
good,"typical workday is 9.5 hours, team members work hard and take pride in what they do"
good,The hardest part of the job is all the lifting but it has to be done. The people I work with are very helpful and make the shift go by more quickly. The managers are very respectful and do their best to accommodate my schedule.
good,"was a great job and had great management and team, just really bad pay and benefits.  was a seasonal position so no job security"
good,This was my 1st Job out of highschool. I loved everyone. We were like a Family. The Store itself was kind off. It was easy for people to steal and get money for stolen items. pay rate was not good at all. Managment changed frequently.
good,"Toys ""R"" Us sounds like a super fun winter job, and it is. The shifts go by quickly and you bring home great paychecks for a part-timer in high school (My senior year of high school was my first season, and my paychecks were averaging $500-$600 per two weeks)"
good,I liked working at toys r us. my only problem with them is they schedule seasonal 10 hrs a week. it just wasn't worth me paying a babysitter and riding all the way from ashford to the other side of Dothan for.
good,Company was really great to work for until the merger.  Everything changed then.  That's when it was time to move on.
good,It was an interesting job. I learned a great deal about customer service. I also learned a lot about video games.
good,Very busy. I loved meeting new people everyday. Love being around the co-workers and had an excellent time working with them. management was very acceptable and understanding
good,"I enjoyed my job there, there was always something to do and new people to meet. There was always something new to learn and fun ways to learn it. The most recent management is not the best. They were very non flexible with the employee's availability. The morale of the employees went down dramatically and they seem unable to keep loyal workers. The hardest part of the job was getting along with management but i did enjoy what i did and all of the new friends that came with meeting new people everyday."
good,generally amazing people to work with but lack of hours and poor rate of pay is not a great job for someone who wants to earn serious money more ideal for someone who is at college or uni
good,Heavy lifting fun environment beautiful personality not all but some
good,"Working at Toys R Us was a learning experience.  Everyday my work would chance so I would get the chance to learn something new everyday. I would either greet the customers everyday, provide them with all the information they would need about the store and where everything is located. I would assist with elevators and I would also demonstrate toys. My co-workers, most of them were helpful but most had attitude problems and only thought about themselves. The hardest part of this job was dealing with the angry Christmas shopping customers but once again the job has also taught me patience. The most enjoyable part was the mornings, Our boss would always uplift us with either a joke or something inspiring to get us through the day."
good,"I'd rather focus on the positive side. Although the job can be demanding, you get to meet great interesting people. I learned to balance my work more efficiently.  I have a high work ethic and I had to learn that I had to make the customers my priority, not any of the tasks that were given to me.  Management tries  to be understanding. Some co-workers are lazy, but what company doesn't have a few lazy people.  The hardest part of the job is dealing with some irate customers, especially during the holidays.  The most enjoyable part of the job are the children that I get to meet, and some of the product knowledge. It is a toy store after all."
good,"working in customer service, dealing with video games. "
good,it was an ok place to work early morning stoker and sales.the workers there were nice and there was always something to be done.
good,"my overall experience was a pleasant one working at toys r us, the staff was great, the were good, the pay wasn't bad, the work was easy"
good,"Good place for summer employment."
good,"marked stock items using identification tags,stamps,electric marking tools"
good,"I started out as an sales associates and moved my way up to be in charge of my own department. My job was to keep the shelves stocked with diapers, food, and formula. I also assits customers with their needs and questions."
good,It was a fun and exciting job. I worked during the holiday season so we were always busy. My co-workers and management were great.
good,"At this job, I answered phones and set up baby registries. I was a seasonal worker, so it was fast-paced and there was always something to do!"
good,"Toys r us, I liked this job cause I was interacting with the kids and the pregnant women  that would come in. I had just had my baby so it was just exciting to learn about the new products and to give feedback to the other moms. the hardest part about this job was keeping up with every new product."
good,Great company. Constantly busy helping new families was an amazing experience. not very good for advancement though.
good,Co-workers were great and the job was easy and simple.  Help customers find what they need!
good,this is more of a summer job no place to advance not matter how hard you work
good,a typical day was fast pace moving guest in and out the management was very friendly and help when needed. my co- workers were a bit under experienced at times but for the most part everyone got their job done in a timely manor. The most enjoyable part on my job was sending people on their way with a smile on their faces.
good,"Fast-paced environment, multitude of tasks to be completed never bored."
good,Fast pace retail. Customer service and assistance very important. Good management and co-workers.
good,it was a winter temp job. only worked there for 2 months. there's not much to say here but the site is making me fluff this review.
good,"This being my first job I didnt know what to expect but I learned alot about answering phones and working hard and fast. Managment was iffy at first but I got use to it and my co workers was a big help. The hardest part about this job was washing dishes in scoldng hot water and the most enjoyable part was makin the wings, breadsticks and salads to go"
good,Working in a toy store was always a dream. Keeping the shelves stocked. The co workers and management was always great. Very understanding when you have a conflict.
good,"When I worked at Toys R Us it was very unorganized.  When you needed a manager, you where never able to find one. There was favoring there was an employee that was friends with a manager and she got away with a lot. I would not like to work there again."
good,Definitely a positive place to work. The atmosphere is good!
good,Depending on the season Toy's R Us isn't usually too busy so a day on the job is usually straightening isles and odd jobs.
good,"Overall Toys ""R"" Us is a nice and fun place to work.  A typical day at work consists of working the cash register, cleaning the store, and assisting guests with whatever their needs may be.  All co-workers are nice and knowledgeable and the managers make sure that all employees and guests are well taken care to the best of their abilities.  The hardest part of the job is making sure the whole store is clean and ready to go for the next morning with limited hours to do so.  The most enjoyable part of the job is helping a guest find the exact product they were looking for and seeing the kids playing and enjoying the toys around the store."
good,Very demanding and hard. if you did have the right crew it wasn't going to be a good day. 
good,I went to work and worked as a cashier and customer service representative. I ensured each guest had a wonderful experienced and always found products. I also educated customers on the products ranging from car seats to toys. I enjoyed my day to day even when it was a bad day. 
good,"I worked at Toys R' Us as a seasonal employee. Ultimately, they offered me a full-time position, but I turned it down because I wanted to continue my education. This wasn't a bad place to work, but it was not what I went to school for."
good,great people and good management and good opportunity and good hours and a fun environment to work in
good,"Customer service, inventory"
good,Performed various corporate treasury functions. Managed daily cash positions. Managed working capital. Domestic and foreign wire transfers.
good,"I usually get to work at seven am. I walk the store to make sure everything is up to date and looking great before the store opens. I do my daily price changes and any signage that needs changed or put up. I have literally learned just about everything there is to know about baby products. All the way from strollers and car seats to bottles and pacifiers. Hardest part of my job is when I have 20 end caps that need changed and new signage put up all in one day, I always managed to get it done, just can be challenging, not that anything is wrong with a challenge though. The most enjoyable part of my job is ending my day looking at all the things I got done, all the compliments I receive from my DM and Corporate Office. It is such a rewarding feeling."
good,It was a great place to work when I first moved to memphis. I would recommend it for anyone trying to get a start in life
good,"It is a wonderful company, I would work there again if they opened a store near me."
good,I enjoyed hearing all of the children get excited about seeing their favorite toy in person that they seen on television.
good,I love co-workers and the management team. I don't want to go into to much detail but structure from the brass down to the front lines is non-existent. The company doesn't know how to utilize labor and labor is never there for the employees. That's all I have to say about that.
good,"Open and close of store on a daily basis                             "
good,"Job was fun and customer service oriented.  I enjoyed helping the customers.  The most difficult part of the job was learning where the products were, so I could assist customers to find what they wanted."
good,"open register, stock out new receipts"
good,"It was a seasonal job, did not stay there for too long, i had a good time working there. "
good,Really enjoyed this job learned how to interact with people and working the cash register. It was a new learning experience 
good,"Nice people, but the work hours are inconsistent and you never know what you're schedule is going to be like from week to week"
good,A good job for part-time students; busy work constantly and working with families and children
good,A decent place to work while studying in college.  Decent sense of teamwork and leadership.
good,A typical day consisted of handling customer relations and encouraging the sales of various products. This job taught me how to be calm under pressure and to be able to handle any situation due to the seasonal variations in the work environment. On the management side of the business the communication between individual managers and sales associates was poor. Quite often an order would be passed onto the workers which none of the other members of management were aware of. This would cause much confusion throughout the store. This was by far the hardest obstacle to overcome. The most enjoyable aspect of working for the company was the fulfillment I received when a customer left the building completely satisfied.     
good,"i was a sales associte as well as a cashier. My job duties was to provide outstanding customer service, Go above and beyond to ensure the best quality of service for every customer."
good,"My typical work day consist of replenishing the store to make sure it's stocked for the customers.  Correct any inventory issues, fulfill online guest orders, and in-store pick-up orders. Also, damaged out items and send back to the venders.  The management team  are very good to work for.  Some co-workers are not very pleasant but others I've grown very close too.  The hardest part of my job would be down stocking travel systems.  The most enjoyable would be places guest orders to meet their needs."
good,"People were nice, if you did not know how to do somethings they would take the time and show you how to do it."
good,"Look at the truck order. See what furniture need to be taken down or put up. Stock the shelves. do computer work, call customers to tell them their orders are in or they are going to be on a certain truck."
good,This is definitely the place to work to stay connected to your inner child. Good place to work if it is your first job.
good,Good place to work but a little chaotic during the holidays as expected.
good,"A typical day in toys r us is very fast pasted and geared towards great guest service. 	Responsible for 20 associates schedule and making sure there in the appropriate area. Able to make rational decisions when handling guest and employee conflicts Assist customers in locating and selecting merchandise.Balanced cash draw at close of shift. Supervising the inventory process in the departments.Overseen retail team recruitment and training process. Communicated well with my fellow co workers. The most challenging  part of the job was the ability to be promoted to the next level. I enjoyed interacting with the guest and answering their questions and also i enjoyed working with my co workers."
good,"*A typical day at work involves assisting customers with products and following the STAR system."
good,fun work environment. flexible hours. pay was poor. working with kids was fun.
good,"I worked the overnight crew which was at the end of the day for the store.  No customers were there after an hour of being there.  It was hard work and you basically didn't have down time if there was work to do.  The managers didn't let you walk around the store and do nothing.  You had a half n hour for lunch and had to punch in and out.  You were allowed to leave the store for lunch but had to come back in.  Your hours were pretty much what you wanted actually. I was lucky. If I wanted hours I got them and if I didn't then I didn't.  I think they were living with me.  Anyway, the hours extend for the Christmas season as I was working a seasonal position.  You work for three days during open hours as the store was open 24 hours a day.  But the problem is that you work evening only. So you have to get used to that schedule.  The money wasn't bad at all.  I got for one month approximately three weeks around $800.00.  So if you wanted to work full time then its not a bad deal.  You should definitely think about it as an alternative to work if you are looking and having problems.  For the holiday season. "
good,Atypical day at work would be cashiering and doing returns/exchanges. I learned time management. Management was GREAT and exciting to work with. My co-workers were easy going and easy to get along with. Hardest part of the job is trying to sign people up for rewards cards. Most enjoyable part would have to be getting rewarded for doing a great job during shift. 
good,"i workted full time so did earlies and lates and worked a sunday,i worked most offmy time on shop floor and tills customer services and loading bay,making sure new stock top sellers get out on shelfs."
good,"I have worked at two different Toys R Us. The second one is much better then the first one I worked at. The Work experience really depends on the members of the team and the management. They put a lot of emphasis on being a team but at the first store i worked at i did not feel this at all. The second Toys  R Us that I worked at because I was transferred since I moved, was much more of a team feeling. Also the management was a lot better and everyone played their role.  A Typical day depending on where you are starts with making sure the front end or whatever needs to be done is done.  The hardest part of the job is the rude guests that you would encounter during christmas time or even outside the holiday season.  The most enjoyable part of this job is the coworkers that you work with. "
good,"A typical day at Toys R Us for may be recieving 1-2 Instant Credits, 5-10 reward sign-ups, and about 5 warranty sign ups. Every mornig the head manager give each employee a goal in each of these category. These tools help me to communicate while encouraging customers to continue shopping at Toys R Us. These Tools also applied great comfortbility to communicate with the department supervisors. Luckly for me the staff was very helpful and welcome me in as if i been with them for quite a while, but learnig each of the co-workers individualy may have been the toughest time working at Toys R Us. "
good,"It was stressful at times being the only cashier and then if we had someone not show up one of the co-workers would have to replace the position. Also the current manager can use some more leadership and also listen to his employees so Toy's R Us can be a better work environment and that way the employees feel valued and  they are able to serve customers better. My learning experience evolved around being around different types of people from different backgrounds and ages, also how to communicate better with different people with different point of views. The employees all got along and we all used to work together to get things done. Also the children did sometimes make your day. They are also pretty flexiable and since I was studying it really helped me out.  "
good,"Guest orders, returns, exchanges. Ability to go the extra and get the guest what they needed or wanted."
good,manager hassles you all day making you overextend for minimal pay. If i hadn't met the cool co-workers there i would of probably gave the rating a 1.
good,"I wouldn't mind doing it again. I worked as a seasonal cashier. Saw a lot of smiling faces as well as frowns too. But I never shopped in this store, so to see another kids wish being fulfilled made me happy. "
good,Ok job love dealing with the kids had a very fun team a good company to use for experience 
good,Toys R Us is a decent retailer to work for. The hours are unreliable and the pay is minimum wage. During the Christmas season it is crazy busy but interacting with the children is the best part.
good,"this was by far the worst job I have had, no one knew their job and it made it hard to establish a routine workflow, "
good,just a cool job would have stayed if store did not close to renavate
good,It is what you think it is. Dealing with the public around Christmas time can be a very hard thing to do if you do not have the right mentality. I enjoyed the people I worked with but in the end a little over 8 years was plenty. You can only be told so many times how you have ruined a child’s Christmas.
good,high voulme store duiring christmas season. Pleasant manger staff.
good,Best experience during seasonal period. Fast-paced and great work environment.
good,greatttttttttttttttttttttttttttttt job to work at love it there greatttttttttttttttttt job love it there nice placeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
good,In a typical day usually I assist customers by being in the cashier or customer service desk. I've learned that you have to be productive at all time and have to know how to multitask . Management is good and they help you in anyway they can. My co-workers are very helpful. The hardest part of the job would probably be the stacking of products in the back or inventory. The most enjoyable part of the job is seeing satisfaction on the customers face and knowing it was you who gave that to them.
good,"fun seasonal job, okay starting pay but the hours are there to help. Management can be a little non constant at times, i went through 2 different store managers before my seasonal time came to an end."
good,approaching customers asking if they need any assistants to help them towards what they need throught the store.
good,"Fun and great to be around kids, easy and good discounts. Schedule is'nt to bad but must work every weekend."
good,Early hours and a lot of paper work and dispays to keep up with. Management is very selfish and dont really care to much about the employees. Coworkers try to stick together to make the job seem a little easier by helping each other with daily assignments. The hardest part of this job would be trying to figure out will they change your assignment from one minute to the next. I loved working for the company because I enjoy helping people.
good,a typical day consist of where they put me on the floor. i worked as a cashier and customer service rep.
good,just make sure you don't steal cuz all the people that stole got bumped to manager then got fired.
good,"Working at Toys R Us definitely gave me great insight into the world of corporate retail. But, unfortunately, there was poor communication on the managerial level and obvious favoritism based solely on disingenuous brown-nosing as oppose to work ethic and merit."
good,My typical day was on a checkout.
good,it was seasonal with a temp was not hard liked getting off the co-workers was ok
good,"The biggest toy store in new york city it was fun to work there because I was a toy buff for my son, and a big video gamer very beautiful place to work, you get to help people make there child wishes come true by helping the with what they want an are looking for"
good,A typical day at work would be to run the cash register. I started the job as a cashier and worked my way up to customer service.
good,"Everyday would be the same routines. Assisting customers with their wants and needs. Organizing breaks and lunches. Guiding new associates into different levels of their jobs. The hardest part of my job was doing the work of many, and getting no apprecitation from co-workers. The most enjoyable part of my job was the feeling of being accomplised with each of the customer's needs."
good,overall productive.
good,"I enjoyed working there, my co-workers were great, everyone was friendly but when it came down to getting paid it was the worst experience for my first job."
good,I was not the biggest fan of working here but it was just for me in college.
good,Receiving Back Of House Associate
good,"- Pulled product from store room to support morning, mid-day or overnight replenishment."
good,It is very rare that an investigation can include the Smurfs and Dora. Only at Toys.
good,I great place to work. The managers are wonderful to work with and I get along well with my co-workers. The only downfall is that the pay and the hours aren't great.
good,Great people. It was fun working there. They also recognizes your hard work. Seen a problem regionally with nepotism.
good,"I cannot think of what I might of done had I had to work their past the season. But during the season, it was awesome. Even the WORST of the managers was awesome. Seriously. Thumbs up for toys r us. I only gave it three stars because it was seasonal, so I can't really say how it would affect my life in a big way."
good,I worked at TRU during the 2011-2012 Christmas season and then again during the 2012-2013 Christmas season where I was kept on as an out-of-season employee.
good,"Working at ToysRus was a fantastic starting point and could diffidently turn into a career, but that's where I decided to leave it. The job worked fantastically to show me the ins and outs about a real job but it wasn't something I wanted to do with the rest of my life. The people who work there are some of the nicest people you'll meet once you get to know them, and the customers, even though they can be needy at times, are not the worst thing in the world."
good,"My typical day starts with checking the stock levels on the shop floor and keeping them up to the required levels. Approaching and dealing with customers, explaining how various products operate and advising on how they are best used. As I work mainly in Babies R Us there is a lot of product knowledge required. I also keep the product displays upto date according to company direction and amend signage when needed. Ordering spare parts and transfering item from other stores can also be part of my days work."
good,Worked with consumers who had difficulty finding their products.
good,"theres a lot of yelling and the managers dont care about anyone but themselves. they give hours to the peolpe that brown nose or if you're in the ""click"""
good,Was my first job. They taught me everything I know about sales and how to conduct myself in front of people.

good,"A typical day of work at toys ""r"" us included to check cumputer for audits, shipping an receving. i learned a lot on how to interact with customers an sell items to them in a five min. time. The management were very strict an fun. My co-wrokers very kind an helpful in the work place. The hardest part of the job were dealing with the customers demands. I enjoyed helping guest an making them happy."
good,Great location. Amazing co-workers. Good management team and promotion with in.
good,"Overnight shift, staff and customers where friendly. Good company to work for."
good,as an employee at Toys R Us i had to report to work daily and unload trucks and almost keep back storage area clean.
good,"It was a good place to get my feet in the toy industry.,I was given the opportunity to run the games and video department where I trained my own staff, performed my own inventory and complied with company operations, marketing, merchandising and department standards. The most enjoyable part of my job was working with my fellow co-workers and employees. I gained valuable experience as an employee trainer."
good,Stockman; loaded and unloaded merchandise; floor sales representative
good,Ok place to work except some of the managers forgot to post timesheet in a timely manner which causes problems with attendence.
good,"team leader, pack out trucks, open and close store, customer service and secure funds."
good,A typical work day was confusing at times due to co-workers calling off or not completing duties. I learned how to complete various task in minimal times. Management was friendly for the most part and Co-workers were funny. The hardest part of the job was not being recognized for work completion and the most enjoyable part was competition for loyalty.
good,I was hired on for the holiday season and I worked a lot of hours. It was hard to handle during school.
good,Basically what I do is stock I unpack boxes and put them neatly on the shelves or in the aisle or counter tops.I also put the newer sales price on the products and shelves so it will be known to the customers. My coworkers are hysterical to work with and we all actually work as a team.There is no hard part about this job but the most enjoyable part is is working midnight's and unpacking the trucks.
good,Toysrus isn't bad but they hire almost no full time employess
good,"Working there, I loved when I first started because it was my first official job. I started there when I was 17. The work was fine but I feel as though there wasn't enough time for me to advance because I was hired on a seasonal position"
good,"I have recieved outstanding customer service skills, and a great smile. I have learned hard work does pay off and to never give up. I have been taught sometime it is better with team effort."
good,depends where they have you working i work infantcare baby registry service desk cashier and stocking things out as well as helping guest answering incoming calls for the store i also help out in other parts of the store also when it comes to co workers you get a mix of everything most enjoyable seeing all the cute babys
good,"Typical day of work was zoning, cleaning, customer service, stocking, and unloading trucks. Co-workers were good to work with. Was learning alot every day."
good,"The hours were terrible, the people were very professional and the work was not that difficult. The only real problem I had was with the hours alotted to work."
good,I worked here for quite some time and have had many good and bad moments with the company.

good,Sometimes physically demanding but a fun place to work. Always excited for the holiday seasons.
good,"*I would pull orders from the storage department, scan with an RF gun and stage it in the shipping department or consolidation department"
good,"It is a fun place to work, the team i'm on is very good. growth opportunities cross functionally do not exist"
good,I learnt how to use a till and to sell add ons.
good,"TRU is a good place to work as well as a great starting point for my career. However, career advancement and professional growth have been stagnant. I desire to grow more as a professional, while utilizing my education. I enjoy the people at Toys R Us along with the established relationships and it is always a great feeling being part of the toy giant of America. I believe I have taken the necessary steps to better myself as well showing integrity and I would love to have a great career to show for my commitment and dedication."
good,"What I liked about this job is that I learned and got over my fear of working a cash register. I was so terrified. Hardest part about the job was keeping up with re-shopping, it was so hectic especially because it was the holidays, but luckily me and my co-workers kept up."
good,If i could i would love to work there again.
good,Personally I never liked working 10 to 6. It felt like all I ever did was work and sleep.
good,"I actually loved Toys R Us, I had so much fun and that's where i use to shop as a kid. The people was cool and the pay was OK"
good,"Toys R Us is a great launching pad for a first job, they have good values. however the holidays can be crazy"
good,"Go in make sure the store was picked up toys in the right place, helped out customers and ran the cash register."
good,Good place to work just always busy unloading trucks. The co-workers and managers are nice people.
good,"okay, the pay isnt much for the labor you do and hours you offer."
good,horario normal de una fabrica entrada 06 salida 15 hs y aprendi lo que era la costura del calzado que no es nada facil
good,I would always be put behind a cash register. As long as you showed up and clocked in and out on time it was fine. This place was always busy.
good,It is an enjoyable place to work. The other associates made it fun. I liked coming to work daily. Management was good. The most enjoyable part of my day was helping the customers find things for their family.
good,"Typical retail but with toys. If your at a cash register you had to stay there, if your on the floor you had to clean and constantly talk customers even if they didn't want help"
good,"Always assisting all customers with any questions they may have and insuring product knowledge and accurate pricing,answering of any phone calls in your assigned areas. Working alongside co-workers,always keeping up with the maintaining of the store."
good,"Stock shelves,help customers,reliabe co-workers,and good management.Doing trucks is the hardest part of the job. The most enjoyable is helping customers."
good,Accurately accounted for money registered to a money drawer.
good,"Extremely customer service oriented. Fun, exciting place to work"
good,working for toys r us was a pretty good job my best part was being a deptartment supervisor in the toys r us express stores i would love to work for those stores anytime
good,Overall it provided great warehouse experience which i'm hoping can get me a better job.
good,"Its a typical job to have while staying in school. It had early hours for me before class. It was a quiet environment. You just did your own thing. I learned to organzie differently and make toys fit on the shelves. Christmas time was stressful because they'd hire a lot of people who didn't speak English really. The regular coworkers were good though. Management was good, fair, kinda scary depending who was working that day. Hardest part of the job was deadlines and always reorganzing entire rows of toys. The most enjoyable part of the job was that I was left to do what I needed to do and be a little creative to get the job done."
good,When I get to work they break us up into groups to stock certain parts of the store. I learned where pretty much every item was located. My co workers were fun and easy to get along with. I didnt really have a hard part with this job it was fairly easy.
good,"Typical day involved ringing customers up for their purchases and putting unwanted items back on the shelves. Also had to answer phones. I learned how to sign someone up for a credit card. My co-workers were friendly. The hardest part was Black Friday and dealing with angry parents when we were out of a product. Also customers trying to explain a toy not knowing what it was called, and their description matched about 55 items. The most enjoyable was seeing how happy a kid was with their new toy, and being able to have fun in the workplace."
good,"Just like at fashion bug, I was only in charge of stocking shelves and clearing messes that any customers left. As well as give assistance when needed. My manager at the time was great to work with."
good,"Never a dull moment, Always happy customers, and willing associates to help. Learned alot about infant safety and parenting."
good,"As a merchandise coordinator i was required to stock a certain amount of merchandise a given number of trucks on a daily basis, as well as make sure the trucks are loaded in an organize manner."
good,"Fun Envirionment, with graet employee recgonition, offers wide range of employee growth."
good,I loved to learn about the new video games and video game systems. Management was fair to all employs. My co-workers all were great to be with. the bad thing about working at toys r us was at times i was the only employ on the floor and it was hard to keep all my costumers happy.
good,"Nice place to work. A lot of fun, management is okay. The kids thatcome in the store make the job fun."
good,"Honestly, the only thing I looked forward to going into work was the paycheck and the beautiful babies that came into the store everyday. You clock in and get straight to work. If you don't sell the Buyer Protection Plan, the manager looks at you like you've done something wrong. They expect you to pressure the customers to buy the plans. That's the part I disliked most about the job. On the bright side, if you never knew anything about babies, working at this store will tell you almost anything you need to know. They really do offer a variety of product so anything you need you can find here regarding you babies."
good,Help customers find what they are looking for. Put returns away.
good,"very busy during holiday seasons, however business was challenging when there were no customers shopping"
good,Day to day Operations. I learned how to service customers excellently and manage a team of associates. Management was helpful in my growth. Co-workers were always ready to help guests. The most enjoyable part of the job was selling toys to children and lighting up a smile on their face when they got the right toy they wanted.
good,• Responsible for every phase day-to-day store operations.
good,"Fun place to work at, great to work around kids.Retail was great and customer service was cool"
good,"Working at Toys ""R"" Us/ Babies ""R"" Us was an interesting experience for me. It was a good work place, the co-workers were friendly and helpful, but the managers and supervisors weren't so friendly. Some were very rude and I felt they shouldn't of even been able to work around children. All in all I enjoyed helping our guests and making sure they found and were satisfied with everything they were purchasing or returning. I just did not enjoy the people I was working for."
good,"Each day is different, so unpredictable. You have to be ready to change and adapt in the matter of minutes. Customer Service must always remain priority number one no matter what the circumstances. Good management came few and far in between and when there was a dependable manager, the company stretched them thin to compensate for the lack of others and they would end of leaving the company or being transfered. The hardest part of the job was trying to maintain structure throughout the store, coach and train team members according to company standards and not having the support of the rest of the management team for the lack of their knowledge and or caring to make a difference within the company. The best part of he job was interacting with the customers and my team members. I made a positive impact in everyones day during every shift"
good,was fun got to put away toys and see new stuff before it hit the shelves
good,"A typical day at work was standing on my feet at a old cash register. I learned a lot about transactions, returns and just working as a team. My managers were always on your about selling products and getting rewards. The hardest part of the job was being pregnant and working long shifts. The most enjoyable would have been getting badges for good work."
good,co-workers are great to work with. Can be a fun active enviornment.
good,"Went to work, help all customers, management was great, coworkers are friendly every body was able to work as a team. Theres no hard part to the job, most enjoyable dealing with people."
good,I worked only during the holiday season and it was very hectic. I loved the high paced work because I never got bored. I had to deal with customers who were very stressed during this time but it was completely understandable.
good,Toys R Us is good place to work part time or as a supplimental income but it doesnt pay alot and it's tough to make a living there full time. The job itself is mostly stocking and assisting customers. If you like kids and toys it's even better.
good,very great place to work i injoyed my time there learned alot from this company
good,I worked as a cashier.
good,"A typical day at work is constantly moving, helping customers, and keeping the store clean. I learn how to work as a retailer and how to keep a customer happy. My co-workers were very kind individuals and hard working. the hardest part of work was working on Black Friday because of the number of customers and you had to work even faster so you can meet the satisfaction of the customers. The most enjoyable part of work is a slow day because you have time to bond with the customers and see them leave the store with a smile on their faces."
good,"A typical day was consistantly busy whether helpling clients, answering department calls or maintaining stock."
good,"Working for Toys R Us was a great excuse to be a kid again. Helping children and parents alike make a selection within the vast variety the store had to offer was very rewarding. I have learned that even a toddler can be your customer therefore requiring excellent customer service. As a Human Resources manager my job was to make sure that each employee was extensively trained and felt confident in correctly promoting Toys R Us' company image as well as strictly adhering to company guidelines. The employees created a trivia game to see how much product knowledge one could absorb and play against each other. This was a fun way to really get to know your products as well as ensuring accurate knowledge to pass on to the customer. The hardest part of the job was how limited job advancement was offered. However, by far there is no real way to describe the joy that is registered upon the faces of children (and adults too) when that new toy or game came out. Christmas came all year round!"
good,I worked the cash register. I helped and greeted customers. I learned how to multi-task.
good,Work place is close to other shopping centers. Co-workers are friendly and helpful.
good,They can show alittle compassion when you are doing a task on hand they should acknowledge what there employers are doing.
good,"TRU is a fun and great place to work because there's so many things you can do. You have the opportunity to play with the coolest toys and even learn about them so if someone comes and inquire about them, you can give them the full review. This also includes games. It's employees are normally fun and palyful. They have many events in which are children oriented but most adults get involed as well."
good,Working here gave me the experience needed in dealing with difficult customers and situation due to the holiday season toys would frequently be sold out or not yet received. As a sales associate this gave me an opportunity to handle with frustrated customers on a regular basis while keeping situations positive.
good,"Good management, fair pay for menial job. Coworkers are a bit on the lazy side as a consequence of menial job."
good,always keeping the customers smiling and assisting with help.
good,"Minimum to no training once employed, you learn as you go or forced to asked alot of questions. Onces trianing is over your on your own but there is a great management team that will guide you. The company offers plenty of compensation but no motivation to get it. No job security tell your 90 days is up and even then your hours might be really low."
good,"I have to be frank, I have never experienced toy season at a giant retail store with customers that are so motivated to find and purchase what they want during Christmas season! Black Friday was crazy stuff.Temps are treated pretty well but the pay needs to be more. I have no Idea how to rate my experience accurately."
good,The company will work with you and easy to switch positions.
good,"This a taskful but fun place to work; however, it could improve on leadership at the store level."
good,I enjoyed this job. This was actually my first job in high shool.
good,"great first job, would highly recommend for students or retirees"
good,not great on hours but definitely a good work place if you love children and a fun atmosphere.
good,"it was fun sometimes when everone came too work. I built bikes,power wheels,stock,unload"
good,"clean, stock, item inquries, online orders, pick ups, check out, recovery."
good,"cashier most of the time, it was always busy, i did cart runs customer service answering phones, putting back merchandise on the shelves"
good,"It helped me to prepare to be a parent , at the right time and all the things people aquire when bringing a new life into this world. How and what to look for in accessories to assist in taking care of a newborn baby."
good,I worked there for a year and watched the place go from at least a fun-just over minimum wage job to the same soul grinding environment of almost all retail establishments.
good,"While working at Toys R Us, I experienced a great knowledge on different toys and electronics. I had a chance to work with a team that was friendly, fun, nice, and helpful."
good,"I worked a part-time overnight/early morning stocking and merchandising position that I really enjoyed. It involved a fair amount of manual labor. Occasionally I'd be asked to work during the day on the sales floor. My co-workers were fun, motivating people to work with, but management was possibly less than fair. Though they were required to give me time, I was told several times they didn't approve of me taking time off for weekend drills and other training time for my National Guard duties."
good,Company is closed but required alot of work to succeed in an atmosphere of deminishing help and resources. Started off as a great company but poor choices by corporate lead to problems for the stores to accomplish what they desired
good,"-Checking out all layaway orders from back of house."
good,"The lower management was amazing and so were coworkers. The only issues were they pushed selling protection plans and donations way too hard, the upper management were not good at all and mistreated employees and the pay/hours weren't great."
good,Difficult during the holiday time period with the immediate influx of hourly seasonal associates.  The hiring process was conducted in a group hiring setup whereas up to 20 people could be in attendance at one time.
good,"A beautiful and friendly place to work very well organized and clean and safe environment for people to enjoy saying this where I work , very saddened of the news of closing the stores"
good,Customer service. Warehouse and floor replenishment. Truck loading and unloading. Skill and safety training. Sales and internal metrics goal achievement drives.
good,The job overall was a good experience and I appreciated the fact that the managers gave me a chance at joining their company and making it a safe environment for our customers
good,Good management and fast pace good place to work at if you want to do shelf stocking. People are so nice and funny there I suggest working nights because you don't get distracted as easy for them people who do get distracted easy
good,"Have no problems wit toys rus great work environment!"
good,"I carried heavy things to customer's cars. I learned something about being a store associate."
good,It was busy when I worked there. It was when toy's r us was busy during the holidays. I was there for the seasonal position. People who worked there was friendly.
good,It was a great job to work at while balancing school and work at the same time . Very good communication between management and coworkers. overall good experience
good,"Unless you are full time, and in my store there were only 7 or 8 full time employees, there were times in the spring and late summer/early fall where we would only get 15 hours a week."
good,I enjoyed my time working here with the staff as it was a good experience. Learned important organizational and communication skills. I had a good group to help me gain my bearings as a new associate and become acclimated to the work environment.
good,"Ahora yo no me puedo quejar pero no me gusta coger pesos y subirme las escaleras. "
good,"Clocked in, find out what i am doing for the shift. Get assignments done than move on to the next. depending on if its a busy time of the year i might have ot but get work done than clocked out."
good,It was a fun work place to work in. I enjoyed moving up in the company fast and being able to have flexible work hours. We also has benifits and we were able to get discounts in the store.
good,"It was an okay place to work.  The district management was very strict on stores meeting sales figures and selling appropriate items, such as batteries and protection plans."
good,It wasn’t the worst job but it definitely wasn’t the best pay the holidays were the busiest time and it was impossible to take off due to the high demand
good,The pay isn't much and it can be very stressful during holidays like Black Friday. You will need to be fast-paced at times and the management can be disorganized sometimes.
good,"1. Typical day at work you go in get ready clock in then get to work. "
good,"The best part about the job was the family environment. The pay was not very competitive especially for internal promotes. However, there was potential for advancement. Unfortunately the company filed bankruptcy and no longer exists in the U.S."
good,"slow pace work day, book keeping,working with  slacker co-worker manager, meeting all kinds of customer & being in management & working in Clarksburg.."
good,Very high paced great team good customer and fair loading pallet was my favorite job though kept you focused on job entire time team members were awesome and everyone help to make sure jobs were completed
good,I probably would have worked for TRU for several years had we not closed. A lot of really great people lost their jobs when the company went bankrupt.
good,Lost track of time making kids smile 😁 as the kids purchase gifts. Enjoyed seeing new mom's gathering things for they're newborn. Watched father's bring in their kids and spend money a happy family shopping experience for kids and adults.
good,"This job was demanding in an ever changing retail environment, our team regularly did well at executing the demands of the tasks at hand . management was effective at the overseeing of associates making most daily business smooth"
good,store closed. simple as that.the only thing i can say is that i got to meet alot of interesting people. and had one of thebest managers who taught me how to handle customer service like a pro with out him i dont think i would have lasted as long.
good,"Emplyess would call out on a regular basis and never written up or held accountable. Meanwhile, when I had a death in a family I got written up for missing to many days. "
good,"Le toys'rus a beaucoup d'avantage dont les pauses payées en plus du dinner (non-payé) . Le seule problème s'est les ventes supplémentaires, il y a beaucoup de pression."
good,"When I worked here , Management was really hard to find at times .. not much of  team work going on here in this business .. but overall great staffing ."
good,I enjoyed working here because of the employees. The hardest part of this job was the mandatory overtime and stocking of the shelves. Sad they closed down.
good,"I was a cashier so half of my time i was standing in one spot at the cash and the rest i was walking through the store returning items to their designated spot. "
good,"There are many different tasks and positions at ToysRus such as being a cashier, floor associate, baby associate, 500, merchandiser, and more. The hardest part is the Christmas rush."
good,Toy R Us was a great an fun place to work an the company was outstanding for my first 2 years but almost at the end things started to crumble they never told us they was closing down at all that wasn't good
good,"This company doesn't really exists ant more but if it ever comes back I suppose this review might be helpful? I had fun working for Toys R Us, lots of teenage employees though and they didn't take the job too seriously."
good,I work for Toysrus off an on for 2 year for there seasonal position. It was a fun temporary job until it wasn't. They are not busy through out the year only around the Christmas holiday which it the only time you will get work hours.
good,I really liked the people and the job sometimes it was hard because of the customers with problems but i just let the manager handle that the coworkers were nice most of them it was a fun job
good,its was a decent place to work to work sometimes very busy but also can be very slow I enjoyed my time there even if it was shot sad that stores closed.
good,"Great place sad that they closed. This company was popular for many many years. "
good,"From cleaning and basic maintenance to stocking product, unloading trunck and running the register. It was a fun environment with good people to work with but the store in closed now."
good,there were days that were tough but there were days that made up for it. Had a great manager who would work with my hours or making sure everyone was okay. Felt like family.
good,"It was always easy to work in tys, due to the fact that people were always willing to work together and accomplish goals as a unit, hitting sales goals never felt like a chore and management always made me feel welcome and respected"
good,my assisstant managers were the best i have had. if they were to call me now id be tempted to go back to work for them. good group of people to work with made the job fun.
good,I did enjoy working for them quite a bit but since they are now completely out of business I cant really say much or recommend them. But it was enjoyable and the store will be missed.
good,"Went in, completed reshop, helped customers, cashiered as needed, completed store recovery. Management could have been more visible. Enjoyed the people."
good,"Most enjoyable part is very hard to describe because it is priceless to see a child happy. Other than that introducing and comparing products for their pros and cones a little bit challenging."
good,"Typical day involved stocking and reshopping(putting items back where they go)"
good,"I enjoyed this job very much, fun coworkers, enjoyed the people, managers were hard working and nice. Only problem was not much opportunity to advance and starting at minimum wage."
good,I loved working at toys r us but the pay rate was not as good as I hoped and I needed to move forward with a new job. I loved that I also got to interact with children. Just not the best work place all the time.
good,"My fellow co-workers were socialable and professional and the customers that I got to meet were a diverse group that I enjoyed attending to, although the job environment did somewhat emphasize quotas."
good,Job I have grown to love. Great times good people. It only turned into a job when the investors took over the company and made use worry about stupid things.
good,"there were many activities that helped to keep the employees involved. one such activity was to have a ""fashion show"". The employees children modeled the new seasons clothing and the employee got the clothes at a discount."
good,work hard and have a great day.  it was all about the kids.  We all reminded each other daily what we worked for the children.  That's what would keep us going at Christmas.
good,While Toys R Us was still in business the warehouse was in need of workers and being a worker who managed to stand out from the crowd made it easy to get asked to do more and more things. However that did not guarantee job security as all positions available were temporary.
good,"I have worked in two branches. The first was horrible; never saw management, supervisors were rude and power tripping, co-workers were lazy and I had to pick up the slack. The second branch, I love my co-workers, assistant managers and manager. They work with my schedule (I am a student), and always resolve conflicts quickly and professionally. The atmosphere in the better-run branch has always been friendly. Unfortunately, this is a failing company, and so there is definitely no room for growth or new employment now. Pay has always been low compared to some other retail jobs. Hours are only good during season. You need to have thick skin because a lot of customers are extremely rude. They also treat the store like a giant ball pit, letting their children run amok (they think we are babysitters because it is a toy store). There are some good regular customers, though, who I willingly go above and beyond for."
good,"Toysrus is a family, fun atmosphere that encourage all employees to engage with guests on a daily based. They have weekend special events at all toys and baby stores."
good,Friendly work environment
good,Worked a seasonal position for the holidays. Restock shelves and ran cashier. Learned how to work in retail and how to help customers find exactly what they are looking for.
good,Job was challenging but also a fun place to work. Very low pay and really bad raises. Loved the associates I worked with. Store is closing all locations.
good,"I loved working at Toys R Us. I did part time for about 4 months and was scheduled to work full time but was never officially called in to work there again because of the management. I would've loved to work there again but the management is poor and because of the business bankruptcy, Toys R Us has turned into a disappointing place to work in."
good,"Working here was not only fun, but fast-paced as well. Working with the customers to find that special toy or book was very rewarding. Staff is very helpful and willing to work with you."
good,Fun for college Kids. I dont like the fact that they dont have a lot of workers on staff is extremely hard to please guests. overall it was a fun and happy environment.
good,"Sadly, TRU has gone bankrupt, forcing me to seek other employment.  Otherwise, I would stick with them and retire.  It has been a great company to work for through the years and I appreciate the chance."
good,"Babies R Us is my first job and I think t is a good starting job. It is fairly laid back, but some of the employees were too laidback and avoided to do work. I love my coworkers, but sometimes they would annoy me when they don't do any work. It is mainly slow and an easy day. I love interacting with the customers and seeing their children because they are very nice and sweet. My favorite part of working here is the fact I see everyone smile after I have helped them look for items or check them out at the registers. Overall, it is a fun job, I just wished I got paid more because minimum wage did not feel like it was enough for the amount of work I did at the store."
good,"Starting to liquidate. Do not apply anything to this company. You won't get anything. Try to seek another job out there. It was a great place to work, but this means company is going wrong way. Hard place means they are running correctly. Learned."
good,"Ability to manage 10 to 20 people daily while coaching and developing a guest focused selling environment."
good,quick pace work place but al well positive staff. Everyone is there to help each other to complete goal and task. management is very help with training and building a great pipeline.
good,It's fun but I didn't get a lot of hours which sucked. Not trained fully on the register or at the customer service desk but still had to work cashier shifts.
good,"My time at Toys was enjoyable, management team were superb and made you feel valuable. Due to advancements at another job I had at the time I did not take opportunities to advance at Toys R' Us. The management team soon fell apart after a few years with some being promoted and some moving to other companies the store started to fall apart. Soon after I had left the company. Now just recently the store has closed and multiple locations are closing due to the bankruptcy of the company. It was a rather pleasant job at the time but the future for Toys seems rather bleak."
good,I worked there very young as a seasonal employee. You may or may not stay after the holidays. Good work for when you are just starting off. I learned a lot about salesmanship. I enjoyed my time with my co-workers.
good,"I enjoyed working at ToysRus very much it just that the low income of $8.50 and the few hours you got didn't make working so hard worth while. Daily responsibilities included stocking inventory, maintaining store appearance, assisting customer in find products, working on layway requests and working at the cashier. "
good,Its was a good job very nice staff they help when youask i justleftforsomething better for me and my family but have lots of discounts for all workers
good,"It's a great and fun place to work at but the expectations from management are set too high.  A typical day includes clocking in, reporting to your station and then clocking out at the end of your shift."
good,This was a good seasonal job they work around your schedule. It was really hectic durin Christmas and Black Friday so you have to be fast paced and able to communicate with customers and give reviews on products.
good,Place was a pain to work for bc of corporate. Lots of rules put in place by people who didnt work in the stores. Main focus is pushing their credit card and warranty programs.
good,They are so concerned about getting people to apply for their credit card. If you struggle to get them they do not really seem to like you. But beside them yelling for not getting enough people to apply It is a nice simple job. Getting raises are really low. I have heard some people have only gotten about 10 cents for a raise in a year. sometimes it can be a quarter.
good,"It was my first job at age 19. I was a seasonal employee and all my coworkers were fantastic. Perhaps because it was the holiday season, it was so joyful being there but it was sure fun seeing the kids smiling faces and optimistic parents. It's busy during the holidays but I liked having something to do. It was not so exciting to work after the holidays though."
good,My experience was a seasonal position. It was fun and easy going work environment. We were provided and area for relaxing and eating. We received recognition not only from our managers but our co-workers as well. I would have liked to stay full time.
good,"I like working at Toys ""R"" Us because it is a fun and energetic workplace. There is never a dull moment working there. The customers are friendly people. I spend most of my time at the registers checking people out. If there isnt alot of customers checking out sometimes my managers puts one of us on the floor to reorganize, make the aisles look more presentable, and to help out any customers that need help."
good,"The company itself has great ideas and stores. Some are better than others. As a manager, I found out I was getting paid about half the salary of the male managers of other stores. It was very difficult to excel with the limited hours to schedule my employees. I worked long hours to perform exceptionally. That is the only way I think you could do well as a manager there. Basically, I had to do everything myself from hiring and training to cleaning bathrooms."
good,working for toys 'R' us i just did what i just came in went to the morning meeting then got to work i stripped pallets i and the the boxes on the balt i build pallets in repack helped in shipping i learn how to fix jams be for safey worker and faster worker the hardest part of the job was when we are back up and short handed so we have to work faster and longer. the most enjoyable part is teaching others about what they don't know and getting everything done on time or earlier
good,"Compensation and benefits are excellent, there is simply NO work life balance.  Increased work loads as expected for the holiday seasons and management team is spread from 112 hours a week to 168 hours a week."
good,"At the time, company was going through changes that I did not agree with.  Culture changed and was not in the best interest of customers or employees."
good,"I start immediately star unloading merchandise from the truck, I sort the boxes from their category, then bring the boxes to the sale floor to stock. I learn how to label and to put up back stock. Management is fair, and the culture of the work place is very divers. Overall it's a decent job, the pay or hour I receive is not that good, but what I enjoy most is working with kids."
good,"Walk in, get pallets with boxes and unpack them and put them on the floor in the designated area for the people who unpack them and put the items on the shelves, We wait for a trailer and empty it and put the boxes on pallets for specific area and repeat. At the end of the day we pick up the trash, put carts away. What I learned how to work under cold conditions. Management was helpful and greeting. Work place culture was diverse, older and younger people working together. The hardest part of the job was going high up with boxes on a ladder. What I enjoyed was the coworkers."
good,"Fun, friendly, can be super busy or super slow (as will most retail/customer service jobs)."
good,Easy job around the holidays to help the family out. The only thing I didnt like about working there was that we had to push the promotions to people that were already enrolled in the programs.
good,Enjoyed the job atmosphere! It was a daily treat to watch kids enjoy the toy store. Managers and team were great. Pay and benefits stink! Ok for 2nd job.
good,"A great place to work from a brand and people perspective but the revolving door on senior management results in repeated cycle of attempt and failure."
good,"Each day would start with the same tasks for opening the store, but as each new customer came in, the opportunity for a new experience began."
good,Think its nice place to work and visit but I feel they need more staff. I feel at christmas toys r us have so much in stock which is good because people like to have a variety of stock to look through.
good,Being part of over night crew during the Holiday rush was adventureous because sum days were lite others like where did all this come from & where does it go?
good,"I worked here for about a year before I left because they did not provide me the hours I needed due to too many seasonal hires. Went back to visit my some friends and after 2 years, since they were hired the same time as me, they had only gotten a $0.10 raise. Management seems to be paid well but cashiers get paid little."
good,"Toys R Us is as much the same as many big retailers as it is different. While you might find similar approaches and initiatives between Toys and its competitors, the atmosphere is at the same time very different. It is an environment where you get based on what you give. The more time and effort you are willing to put into your work, the more you will learn and advance; the opportunity for advancements are numerous and varied. If you want to be learn from some of the best in retail management, this is a great place to work."
good,"Fun to work at and great friendly management and staff. "
good,"Good place to work.  Uppermanagement strugles with their own perfromance overall.  Great stores concept, great customers, great people overall.  My supervisor was a true leader.  The company expects too much with little personnel............................................."
good,"As a Sales Associate, I worked on the sales floor and on the register. I enjoyed helping customers find those must have items, and I also enjoyed helping to keep the store looking clean and presentable. I would say that they need to make sure that they have the right people in place, when it comes to training new hires. As well as supervisors that are always willing to help those that they are supervising, and not act irritable, when asked to help. Overall, it was a decent experience."
good,The management is very unorganized and really focus on things that have nothing to do with the workers. The environment with workers are great but management is very rude and disorganized. They put work off on others and other workers aren't trained correctly and you end up picking up their pieces
good,Manager was very flexible and laid back. Stop was very unorganized and messy. business was slow and job was boring.  typical work day would be working cash register and fixing shelves. The co managers were jerks and not friendly at all. The job on a really show day would be sitting there reading a book fixing shelves on being on my phone.
good,"Not bad place to work had some good times met some good people."
good,"I worked during the Christmas holiday season. It was extremely busy, which makes your day go by faster. I was a cashier which entailed running the cash register, selling any necessary accessories for a customers' purchase (batteries, warranties), offering rewards cards/credit cards, and restocking merchandise, It was a fun place to work, especially if you enjoy being around kids."
good,Responsabilidade de caixa e gestão de trocas e devoluções exigia a máxima concentração.
good,"Job is quite boring. Same thing day in and day out. Average customer service, the job is easy enough to carry out. Expectations of staff are average. Minimum wage and good discount."
good,I enjoy helping people and making them happy. You can stay as busy as u want to be. Always something to be done in retail. Wish they had better benefits and would have more full time position. A great job for someone who is living at home and just want to make some spending money.
good,"This job can be intense, but it makes you strive for more. It pushes you to be better than you were the day before. There are so many resources available to you and for you in order to develop yourself and to help you along whatever journey you choose to take. Management is always available to help you along the way as well. The hardest part of the job is learning the processes - it is a different ballgame in regards to retail, but it is an incredible experience. The most enjoyable part of the job is making people's days, from children of all ages to moms and dads and grandparents. It really is a fun place to work, but it is only as fun as you make it!"
good,Good fast pace and friendly environment. The supervisors will explain what ever questions anyone will have. Incentives are also given to employees to get metrics during the holiday season.
good,taking orders from the supervisor and motivate the team members to complete each task that is issued by the end of the work day. reporting hours updates on the teams progression.
good,"A great place to work. If you like helping people  on the floor,  it is fun to be a kid again. Manager is a great person to work for. Great place to work."
good,"I worked in the back of house department most of the time or on the toy side of the store, with me working the back of house I was the only one usually in the store other than management that could grab things out of the back. They hire a lot of employees and don't train the employees on how to do things until needed. They go with less experienced associates instead of a core set of staff that know what they are doing. They mess the schedule up from time to time and don't keep you up to date on the changes through the emailing program. The staff as people are amazing and will be extremely friendly even management is friendly."
good,"There are a lot of things that needed to be improved on, specifically communication. The lack of communication and coordination made working there tiresome. Also, the lack of staff was astounding for such a big store. Regardless of there being new hires and a new store manager, there weren't many people compared to before."
good,Toys r us is a fun industry to work at.With each day being full of exciting challenges.I have learned a lot from management.Which is why I became receiving clerk.The hardest part of the job I would say is when the system is offline and you are not able to complete your daily tasks.The most enjoyable part is getting the job done with no left over work for the next day.
good,"Often overworked during season. Managers often throw responsibilities down to supervisors. You will feel pressured to sell metrics and credit cards. Sometimes there are long hard days. "
good,"This is a fun place to work. The people are enjoyable to work with and the customers are delightful. The management is reasonable and will work with you regarding scheduling and accommodations as needed. The job can be stressful when the work piles on, but that is where i learned to multitask and manage my time."
good,I worked as a seasonal part time and mostly was closing team. The managers really had no control or had no idea what they were doing. They would make us work up to 12 hours a day some times and only give us a 30 min lunch rather than also giving us the 15 min break.
good,"Toys R Us provides great products for children and those alike. Working there was indeed fun: only because of the workers around me. Work was otherwise rather tough and seemingly one sided because those who are available at night usually close, which is much harder than working in the day. Compensation does not vary on that, however that is the way the cookie crumbles. The management did a good job with filling me into my position and teaching me the things I had to know. However other than that, it wasn't the most enjoyable experience."
good,"Day was spent writing, splitting, updating Purchase Orders."
good,learned to restock shelves also learned how to work in a fast paste i enjoyed the hours i work overnight and the people i worked with it was a fun and positive work place
good,"You will constantly be moving and challenged. Responsibilities include specific tasks related to your position while ensuring that customers are greeted and assisted."
good,"Typical day at work can range anywhere between working on the registers and cleaning/straightening your register area. To working on the floor dealing with customers, cleaning the store, working on re-shop and back of house. Back of house consisted of loading/unloading trucks, stocking shelves, and online orders. All coworkers are friendly and outgoing people. Hardest part of the job is dealing with ""rude"" customers and fulfilling there every need. Most enjoyable part of the job are the coworkers I work with."
good,"Toys R Us has been a fun place to work and I love my co-workers. Every day is different but usually it is pretty slow and easy-going. During the holiday season, it is pretty busy and makes your shifts go fast. The most enjoyable part of working at Toys R Us for me is working with the customers and children. Although I love working at Toys R Us, management isn't the greatest and the hours are never the same. You could have 32 hours one week and 15 the next, so it definitely isn't stable by any means."
good,"You cone in clock in, get the necessary equipment and head to your work station. with boh we run stock to the floor and answer orders. The Co workers are nice and the management is alright"
good,"Friendly workplace, always helping helping customers. I know a ton about toys and what products are good for what age groups. The hardest part is working through the holidays and not being able to spend them with family."
good,"For sesonal it can be vary hectic and messy. Depending on the manager, they can have a bit of an attitude. It's a fast pace during seasonal and will be on your feet until you leave work or on break."
good,Flexible hours. A lot of work and pressure to meet sales goals. Management works together well. Sometimes difficult customers. Overall good for customer service experience.
good,"When I worked at Toys 'R' Us, it was during Thanksgiving and Christmas.  During this time the store gets a lot of customers because of the holiday rush.  Because of this, the store stays open longer and recruits more people to work at the registers.  A lot of people quit because it was a lot of work so the rest of us had to add more to our plates.  I had a lot of overtime because I would have to stay late and clean up the shelves."
good,I liked being able to talk and answer questions new mothers had about their babies. I explained to  them all of things they would need before there baby arrived. I helped them create registries for baby showers. I also stocked and walked the floor to help anyone who might need help or have questions.
good,Surrounded in friendly staff members who are always there to help customers as well as their team members.Hardest part of the job is dealing with rude customers however i soon learnt to how to handle them. The most enjoyable times are when the store is quiet and you get to bond with your fellow work mates.
good,"I love working at Toys R Us, but you must know how to do everyones job in case they are out for the day. It's fast paced and you need to be very efficient and self motivated. Common sense is necessary for daily needs and customers can be very disrespectful and ugly, so learn to cope."
good,"The policies change consistently so many customers are confused and angered by the changes in returns. This usually leads to them yelling at service area associates, who have absolutely nothing to do with the change. Higher up management pressures store managers to achieve unrealistic goals, which in turn puts pressure on team members. I personally have come to blame corporate. They claim that flawless execution is one of their mottos, yet they change their mind frequently when their plans do not work."
good,"Worked night crew on the holiday season, very demanding job, very physical, customer service oriented. Management was very involve.  great team work environment.  the hardest past of the job where the hours."
good,"A typical day at work consisted of talking to  customers and helping them find exactly what they need and processing a lot of returns from baby showers. It was usually pretty slow. The Management at Babies R Us was good for the most part, just could get a little rude at times. My co-workers were really friendly and just all around awesome. The hardest part of the job was making sure every single guest had what they needed and left happy. The most enjoyable part was knowing when i really helped customers and made them leave completely satisfied."
good,The work place was fun and a good starting point for someone needing work experience as long as you do the work you will get the experience you need
good,This job was not that great and was an in between job. I worked hard at what I did which was customer service and stocking. The company did not provide adequate lunch time and some of my coworkers under-performed. Management was great though.
good,nice place to work very professional setting but too much is expected with not enough compensation for the work required
good,To start my supervisor will tell me what I will be doing in my shift for the day and some days that differs from tills to floor work- i.e stock replenishment and tidying. And occasionally working on unloading the truck and tidying the stock room. At time it can be challenging by I know that there are always other staff members who are there to help and assist me on filling the customers needs. The most enjoyable part of the job is when I am serving a customer and I can help the accomplish their need and when they leave the store I know they are happy.
good,Toys R Us is a great entry level job when you are fresh out high school or even if you are currently still in high school. The start off pay is horrible and the raises are pretty much nothing.
good,The night would start off with music and unloading the truck. We go at a pretty good pace. Get done with that now on the floor putting up everything. Our music is still playing so its still a good time. After all is done we clean up and go home. Just that simple.
good,"Great place to work. "
good,"Loved the average day while working there. The workers were great to work with. they'd laugh and smile while having a hard day at work, making sure the customers were satisfied."
good,The people make this job worth it and the management is not bad. A job i loved while it lasted. Loved helping pregnant woman make the best decisions about baby products
good,This is a great place to earn experience. It lacks room for growth in certain departments. The most enjoyable part were the connections i made and the relationships built. People often move on to do better for themselves after employment at Toys R Us.
good,"even as a seasonal temp i had fun and learned alot as well. to me it really was a fun job, management cared for all employees and i got to do more stocking, helping customers ect."
good,Good job but not for me. They want you to work very fast unloading and stocking trucks that are mostly 1000 item truck which is not for me. I like to take my time doing stuff so everything can be right.
good,"Fue una buena y bonita experiencia laboral, ya que se trataba de una formación, la cual pude compartir con dos compañeros de clase, ya conocidos."
good,"assist customer "
good,Pretty Fun Working Overnight with Coworkers and Supervisors Keeping Each OTher Pushing. Started Out Pretty Slow With The Trucks but as we came Closer to Black Friday and Chrsitmas the Work Started to Become More Challenging But with the challenge we made it fun so it was less Challenging then what i orginally thought.
good,"Easy going, medium pace job with good opportunity for growth and a great staff that is always willing to help when you are in need,"
good,It was a good starting job even though it was only seasonal. The responsibility this job taught me was about how to plead a costumer need and helping them.
good,A lot of kids. Its good to know about toys. Because kids have many questions. It may seem hard at first but getting trained can take off the stress.
good,"I stayed with this company for four years because they worked well with my school schedule and after being there for a while I got decent hours for a part time job.  I learned a lot at this job and worked in almost every aspect of the store.  I worked register and guest services, helped guests on both the toys side and babies side of the store.  I helped set planograms, clean, stock, and reset aisles.  I also answered phones and did store orders for guests.  I liked helping people and the experience I got.  However, the amount of responsibility they put on associates is a little much for minimum wage."
good,"I have not worked for the company in over 20 years, so things could have change since I worked at TRU.  Management worked long hours from October through January and shorter weeks the rest of the year.  6 day work weeks required during Holiday season"
good,"A typical day includes coming in early in the morning and doing the cash counting then putting up pre printed sale signs, making sure all bike tags are correct, clearance tags are in the correct places or hanging up at all, making sure all merchandise has correct price label or a price label at all, going through what we call life cycles of merchandise (finding items the company wants to donate or get rid of)  then doing anything else any manager needs assistance with such as stocking or finding expired food on the shelves and discarding it according to regulations. I have learned a great deal in multi tasking and how to balance my time well enough to get all my jobs done in a timely manner even though that is what I consider the hardest part of the job because we also have to take care of the customers as well.  Management is ok, I don't want to talk bad but its not at the best it could be.  My co workers are wonderful, they make the days fun and we all help each other as much as we can. I leave work with a smile on my face because of them.  the most enjoyable part of the job are my co workers, but also when I can help a customer out and let them leave with a smile on their face too."
good,"Fun, interesting position.  Solid salary and OK benefits.  Lack of role clarity, high turnover and opportunities with senior leadership regarding overall company profitability."
good,"I enjoyed working there over the Christmas period, very busy store, staff helpful when you need help, gained lots of customer service experience whilst working there"
good,"cashier"
good,"Come in, Unload a truck with more than 2,000 pieces on it, learn how to properly unload truck and down stock a store, kept stockroom and sales floor clean"
good,The vendor performance analyst position is responsible as part of a team that acts as one of the main points of contact and communication between TRU and their suppliers to build upon the relationship between TRU and the vendor community.  This is done thought working cross functionally from end to end throughout all departments involving the supply chain.
good,A day at TOYS R Us is good because they teach you everything you need to learn and a little extra. Management is great because they help you meet your goals and they teach you how things work. Co-workers are good people that know how to work and they help you. The hardest part of the job was not getting enough hours. The most enjoyable part was just working their and being a part of the company.
good,"management actually said thank you after every shift worked and commended on a job well done. "
good,"I was a seasonal team member at Toys R Us for a few months. This included merchandising, stocking, cashier, and assisting customers. It was a nice place to work. I'd say the hardest part of the job, for me, was not having enough hours. Though I knew going into it that it was a part time position. I need to find full time work. I really enjoyed the environment and helping customers."
good,Good working environment friendly staff get the most hours during the holiday. Downside is there's  a lot of work with little pay
good,"Don't get me wrong, I loved working for ""R"" Us, both at Babies ""R"" Us and Toys ""R"" Us. You get to spend time with families and help them realize their dreams; that goes for the guests as well as the Team Members."
good,"unloading trucks, separating items by pallets on"
good,"Great coworkers, fun and fast pace environment. I enjoy working with and helping others so I really enjoyed being employed with them. But the only thing that is wrong with them is when they break promises to a few customers and employees the same."
good,"Usually my main duty is to clean the store, since I typically worked nights and there weren't too many customers in the store. When there were customers, I would assist them in any electronics related questions they had and steer them in the right direction of what they actually needed. The holidays get pretty hectic, due to the exponential increase in customers, and sometimes during the ""off season"" there aren't enough people on the schedule to effectively deal with everyone because of pay cuts or managerial problems. The hardest part of this job is the overwhelmingly repetitive tasks that happen on a day to day basis. The most enjoyable part is that I get to work with video games and talk to people about something I like that we sell in the store"
good,"Get some coffee or good sleep for the shift , be ready to have a little scratch on the hand from cutting boxes and replenishing shelf. You learn to appreciate the behind the scenes people who restock shelves when you come in to shop. Co-workers find their own business and work efficient and individually. The hardest part is keeping up the whole night if you have no rest and finding where every little item should go in the store if your just beginning. The most enjoyable part is being able to play with store toys and live out your childhood."
good,"I would start work at 10 PM and usually work from than on to 2 AM or 6 AM. So usually 4-8 hours during the night. I was a night stocker that lifted various sorts of objects onto moving collies to transport them to their ally's and than stock accordingly. We wouldn't just stock the objects either, we the team of Toys R Us would stock the objects to be at the best view and neatly as possible for customer's to see. Also because the store didn't sometimes close till 11 or 12PM we would often assist the costumers while doing our usual routine of night stocking. The job overall was very fast paced with many tasks to do when at work."
good,group work loading trucks forklift operation tagging pricing heavy lifting
good,If you love a fast-paced working environment then I highly suggest working at Toys R Us during the holidays because that was extremly stressful!
good,Ok place to work if you need a part time job or somewhere to get your start.
good,"Toys R Us is a company that wants to cut costs wherever possible. They do not pay well and they do not spend the money that they need to in order to keep their stores in good shape. I enjoyed my time there, but I left because I could go to another company and take a responsibility cut while at the same time getting a higher salary. They provide no incentives for their employees."
good,The companies policies for promotion greatly limit a qualified individual from advancing if they work in a stagnant department.
good,"- Lots of restocking and organizing shelves."
good,"Well, I do enjoy working for Toys-R-Us, however I don't get many hours(~9 1/2 per week). My co-workers are great, no complaints there. Management is pretty understanding. In many cases, make sure you have a second job as well."
good,"a typical work day at babies r us/toys r us can be either really fun or really busy and task filled. Everyday I leave learning a new task, or just a life lesson on how to raise a baby. Management allows me to make executive decisions because of how hard working I am, and how dedicated I am to my work. My coworkers make this team great and fun to be around. The hardest part of my job is having to clean up others mess, mistakes, and short handedness which causes me to overly work. Not a complaint, I would just like to get paid more for all I do for the company. The most enjoyable part of my job is being able to assist the customers and have them go home happy!!"
good,Company continues to become innovative and provides a culture that drive guest satisfaction.
good,"In a day I would typically straighten the merchandise on every aisle and organize equipment, boxes, merchandise, etc. In addition, I would check out merchandise for customers. I learned how to deal with people, create an organized and clean workspace, and contribute to the sale of merchandise. My co-workers were friendly, never had any problem with any of them. Hardest part of the job was dealing with upset customers. The most enjoyable aspect of the job was working in the electronics department."
good,The Management and Team Members are dedicated to our guests.
good,"As member of management days can be pretty busy, some days you will be helping a guest a the service desk and then find yourself on the other end of the store helping out a co-worker with a store order. The hardest part of my job is finding way to motivate team members to meet their daily goals. The most enjoyable part of my job is assisting guests at the registry desk. i fond it very fulfilling to know that i am helping making a soon to be parents day."
good,A fast pace and fun place you help guest tell them how good your product knowledge is
good,"I worked for the R Us Corporation for seven years and experienced a steady slate of promotions during my time there. The first year I went from part time to full time and then department supervisor. During the next few years I supervised multiple departments before finally becoming a store supervisor during my seventh and final year. I was scheduled for management training but our store was given the unfortunate news that it was closing. I will say that I worked with several people and never had an issue unlike other retail companies I worked for, but like other retail companies the opportunities for advancement can be slim depending on the situation. I do my best not to say negative things about my jobs but I did find that building a line of communication from store to corporate level was incredibly difficult more times than not, making resolving problems far more complicated then they needed to be. Often management was left to fend for themselves after waiting days - occasionally weeks - for a response. Aside from benefits that seemed to lack a certain quality, it was fun to hang out with coworkers during times when stress needed to be released."
good,"seasonal job, packing toys. enjoyed the discount. working 7 days was draining"
good,A typical day would be to clock in then get your equipment ready. Once you got your equipment ready you head to your supervisor and ask what's to be done today if there are any projects that need attention. Then the day goes smoothly and you have to do your best to maintain your position there if you start off as a seasonal worker.
good,"Armonia entre los compañeros, flexibilidad de horarios y buena remuneración."
good,"Good people to work with. Enjoyable atmosphere. Definitely a job just to supplement your income, unless your in upper management."
good,"A genuine experience that I have grown from, more than any other position I've ever held I will take lessons learned from this position with me for years to come."
good,multitasking is a major key working in this company.Acceding a customer expectation is the companies major priority . I have increased my management skill by the help of a great manager.There is Lack of maturity in some of the co-workers
good,"In the 15 years I spent at Toys R Us, I enjoyed my work experience and created lasting friendships. The business allowed me to grow and learn from my mistakes making me an over all better employee. The fast pace world of retail allowed me to adapt to stressful situations and achieve success. Working along side your fellow associates and together creating a positive work environment was the most gratifying part of my job. To be allowed to satisfy our guests with excellent customer service and realizing what effort was put into the process makes you feel that you had done your job."
good,"On a typical day, I dealt with several customers, selling our products and helping them locate items they were looking for, as well as keeping shelves stocked and organized. I also had a phone on the sales floor to help customers who called with any questions or concerns they had. I learned how to present and sell products and was trained as a backup cashier. The management team did well dealing with employees and customers and my co-workers were fun and easy to work with. The hardest part of my job was keeping the store organized and closing during holiday months. The most enjoyable part of my job was helping customers during holiday months find what they were looking for for their families."
good,"My day would start usually in the load-out dock unloading the trucks full of merchandise and sorting them in to specific piles to be distributed throughout the store. I would usually break away from the sorting and unloading of boxes to use a pallet jack to drop boxes of merchandise onto the sales floor for stocking. I would then begin stocking merchandise in my designated area. At the end of the shift, everyone was required to mop and clean up the store, break room, and bathrooms."
good,"During the early mornings, the EMT (Early morning Team) would unload freight from trucks and prepare pallets for other workers to stock in their respective departments. I would typically be in charge of managing the 'truck crew' placing workers in areas that would best suit their strengths and get the job done in the most efficient way possible. "
good,"A typical day at work includes alternating between ringing up guests on a register and assisting customers throughout the store. At Toys 'R' Us I learned how to effectively provide customer service. As a manager, it was my duty to train team members and hold them to the standard that Toys R Us sets for its employees.  The most difficult part as a Managers was maintaining great guest service while frequently being understaffed. The most enjoyable part is training your team, and receiving positive surveys from guests about them."
good,"I enjoyed working here, unfortunately management had a lot of communication problems and there was too much workplace politics. Its a good first job, especially if you're attending school. They will work around your schedule"
good,"i would run the cash register, straighten shelves, and do re-shop. I would also help customers locate items they where looking for."
good,"Working with that team was a energetic experience. There was never a dull moment. The customers energy always brought a joyful and contagious atmosphere to the job, which made it cheerful and a meaningful workplace"
good,"Working at a toy shop during the holiday season? HARD WORK. People can get crazy with their toys, but the managers were always nice and pushed us to our max. "
good,"You have something new to do everyday. Fast paced environment. Since the baby section has been added, I have enjoyed seeing the babies come in everyday. The parents are a force to be reckoned with though. You will have unruly people everyday. Some are much worse than others."
good,The management needs work.  I enjoyed working there for the short time period.  They expect you to learn and know everything right away.  A lot of inventory.  
good,"Fast paced, learned how to deposit checks, Some managers weren't helpful but a couple were great, the co-workers were awesome. Very nice and always making work so much more fun, hardest part of job is probably zoning back items that customers didn't want, people are always great to talk with."
good,"The hardest part of my job was when I could not find a solution for the customer and they were very upset or hearing that the same mistake or issue has not been resolved after a period of time has passed the most enjoyable making the customer satisfied, and getting kudos calls to my floor supervisor."
good,"Fun part time job or first job to start off with, learned to deal with all kinds of customers easy job to have"
good,"My experience with Toys R Us was during the holiday season, so things were a bit hectic as the holiday season tends to be. While I had previous experience as a cashier already, I felt that the training I was given on the products and the offers that Toys R Us had wasn't ideal enough for me to show it in my work. I had to do A LOT of reasearch on my own and ask other experienced co-workers for help. This lead to me being more informed, but at the same time, hindered my performance because it was an information overload and I ended up being laid off after the holiday season. IF you can, try hitting Toys R us while the holiday season isn't around. It was a fun environment and I enjoyed it a bit more when the store wasn't overcrowded and people were angry all the time."
good,worked Sunday thru Thursday 1:30pm to 10:30pm
good,It was nice seeing so many kids around. They have a flexible schedule meaning you can work 8hr a week then next work 4 or not work at all.
good,"A typical day would include maintaining all new freight is out being available for customers .In my working their i learned how to run a Point of sales system for new and outgoing parcels,my managers have always been quite helpful in my advancements at this job, hardest part of the job is when its a busy rush and kids are knocking all the merchandise down right after i have cleaned,but the most enjoyable part is seeing the happy faces on kids when you go in the stock room or even the floor and find something they couldn't."
good,"Great place to work, Fun during the Holidays. Most enjoyable part of the job is the people."
good,Toys R Us can be an important lesson for a person. You consistently are asked to accomplish tasks that are usually unattainable. However finding ways to get those tasks accomplished is where the fun part comes into play. Working with the public and fellow employees was often a high point of the experience.
good,"A lot to do here. Never a dull moment. Management is nice and very to the book. The co-workers is what makes everything mesh together well. The hardest thing about the company is that their expectations are over the roof and not enough time is given to you. Its like tug a war, pulling you in every single direction and then later your questioned why your things didn't get done. TIME MANAGE TIME MANAGE, DRIVE FOR RESULTS."
good,"Operations, schedules, shrink control, inventory and payroll cotrols, customer service."
good,"Everyday brought on new obstacles to overcome. I learned how to managed a full schedule of associates, how to manage payroll, and how to handle guest issues. Great team members."
good,good place to work. pay was good. co workers were good. one of the cons was that we were never staffed enough to get all the work done that was necessary. My hours were good and comfortable. job training was not all that adequate learned alot on my own. The people were good.
good,"I worked for Babies R Us, and each department is full of wonderful people who have their own experitise, people will work together to help expecting families get the best for their new baby. I learned about registry, basic baby needs, and how to give some of the best customer service"
good,"Managers are alright, kind of stuck up as you'd find anywhere else in retail. I thought it was unfair I had to work a 14 hour shift Black Friday when I was very pregnant and had swollen feet."
good,"tough warehouse environment, enjoyed employee relationships."
good,well my experience working with toys r us express was a fair one. they were very unorganized yet i enjoyed working with my team members.
good,"The workers there were fun to hang out with and drama free. The Managers were not easy, but not mean either."
good,This was a great job . I got as many hours I needed and got good pay. Come to this job is that security. This job didn’t treat the associates with respect.
good,"fast paced workplace but not enough pay . Pay was $8 an hour and daily I would stock, merchandise , cashier and reshop. Fun environment but not enough hours given due to business decreasing."
good,"Work during season (  From Oct. to Jan. ) has as many hours as you wish to work. Great training and support from management and co-workers. In the off season, however, ( Mid Jan. to May ) the hours drop off dramatically. It is possible to pick up shifts, but time is not guaranteed. Employee discount is a bonus and was greatly appreciated during the holiday time."
good,"Toys r us was a great experience for the tume i was there. I learned alot while working here. Has prepared me for the next step in management field."
good,"It was okay, It a good job for young people, high schoolers. The pay was okay, could have been better. Management was nice but it varies by location. The most enjoyable part of the job was the cheerful atmosphere."
good,"I was taught very well how to interact with customers, use proper merchandising and work to a very efficient schedule. However, the pressure they put on individual workers was stressful at times and led to a few of their hardest workers quitting. I didn't quit for this reason but I was tempted to."
good,I used the time at toys r us to learn new things like working back of house for example. I was taught alot regarding that. The environment was great though.
good,"I opened the store and got the store and the employees ready for the day, I would also do money in the morning with the money counter, and do the money drop when the store closed at night."
good,I loved working at Babies R Us. It was not the company that I appreciated. I loved that the work was different day to day. There was always something that needed done. I knew all the areas so I could be in different areas every day. My managers were amazing and worked hard. They were very understanding and applied the perfect amount of pressure to perform without making the employees over stressed. I loved my fellow employees that I worked with. It was like a second family and they are the reason that I looked forward to going into work each day.
good,"Working at Toys R Us has helped me grow as a person. Working there has taught me about how diverse the community is and the rewarding feeling of getting to know new people and bond with them in ways I thought was impossible at first. The pay may have not been the greatest, the people I had the pleasure of working with it what made it worthwhile. The managers were always fair to me when i needed advice on helping customers, and teaching new things when the occasion required something unique to execute said objective. Never once did I have any major issues while working there."
good,Working at Babies r us was a great experience for me due to the people I worked with alone. As far as a company they did not take care of their employees whatsoever. We were paid poorly and expected to work extra hard for very little pay and non existant benefits. On top of this we were kept in the dark about the stores financial state until it was released in the news for everyone to see. Then when we closed we received absolutely no severance pay that we were promised in the beginning. As a company I give it a zero but the people I worked with were absolutely amazing.
good,Company was a fun environment in the beginning of my career but towards the end Toysrus bankruptcy made my job very difficult and he company seemed to not care to much about employees however the management team seem to differ at times.
good,I did enjoy working with the company mainly to see the smile on the kids faces when they were able to find the one toy they were looking for. I loved the people I worked with directly in the store.
good,"its like any other huge warehouse. worked there on blackout, which is  from thanksgiving to new years and you are not allowed to take or miss any days. could be very dangerous at times. people speeding on forklifts trying to keep up with almost impossible requirements and pallets breaking and falling out of the racks because people are rushing. keep your eyes open."
good,"No review at this time as 33,000 employees were let go without severence package.  The company filed bankruptcy and liquidated all assets but backed out of the bankruptcy and is rebranding the company under a different name - and all the employees were let go in the process."
good,i loved the job people were very hard working lots of kids were in and out of the store there were lots of nice coworkers including the mangers but at times we had to work fast but not as much we only worked fast around holidays
good,Toys R us corporation was a great and exhilarating place to work. You get to meet so many new people and you can help the children find their dream toys which made me feel very happy.
good,While working for this place . I didn’t get much hours the Pay was bad some of the staff members and managers were rude but I will miss toys r us. Toys r us barely had any money to stay open.
good,"Working their had its ups and downs, like most retail oriented jobs.  Sometimes I liked my job, other times I hated it, but in all honesty, working their with my former team made it fun."
good,Overall the job was productive and relaxed but at times it's a little hectic because the kids were yelling or screaming. Also the parents insisted coupons
good,it was a toy store. I enjoyed Christmas time. and seeing the excitement on children's face. management was great but wasn't bad. hours we're all over then place
good,"I worked at the Columbia & Annapolis stores in MD. Typical day was either getting on the register if the lines were big, or stocking shelves. Management was usually hands off but weren't afraid to tell you when you needed to do something else or help out in another department. Culture was actually pretty decent as a whole, made a few friends. Hardest part of the job I'd say was coordinating with the BOH when we needed bike assembled and trying to remember what the product replacement plans cost for each price range of bike. Most enjoyable was helping people make buying decisions over in R-zone. I one time talked to this couple, who was buying a video game system for their 9 year-old, for almost 20 minutes going over the benefits and drawbacks between two video game systems. Eventually after thinking it over I was able to sell them a console and they were happy as could be. Knowing that I made them happy and their son for Christmas was probably the most enjoyable moment I had there."
good,"BRU was a fast paced, fun place to work.  The best part was seeing new parents with their babies come in to shop.  Overall a good group of customers made the job more pleasant."
good,"Really have to have patient when it comes to the younger children they want the first second and third thing they see, so adorable tip try not to get your big toe stepped on."
good,"The job was easy and I enjoyed it while I was there.  The payroll was fair and higher than other places. The company was near my home, which made this job easier to go."
good,"Typically, I supported all global team members.  The stress to help the team members get what they need, in a timely fashion, was fairly high many times.  I was an anonymous person and many thought I was a ""team"" of people supporting them, meanwhile, I was one person supporting thousands.  "
good,"assisting customers with product selection and ensuring a positive in-store experience. I learned how to work as a team player. Management was poor, we did not have a store manager during Christmas. The manager we did have just quit with no notice. The workplace culture was very friendly and outgoing. The most enjoyable part of the job was getting a child the perfect gift."
good,The pay is very minimal. ToysRUs was bankrupt and had liquidation skills because the company owed 5 billion dollars of debt. It is a nice place that children often love to visit.
good,It’s a great experience working here. Everyone is like family and very friendly. They work around your schedule and are very helpful. When there seems to be a problem the managers are quick to fix it.
good,"You would think that working at Toys R Us is a pain, and that's true, but to be honest it's not that bad. It gets really annoying when it's rush hour and you have a lot of kids coming in who have all this pent-up energy, but in the end, it's kind of worth it since the pay is 8.50 an hour."
good,"Toys R Us had a good environment during my time there and made the job easier. There wasn’t any pressure put upon one employee, we all helped each other out."
good,It was an interesting place to work. I have never in my life seen so many adults who were all about drama. I met my husband there so all in all it wasn’t a bad place to work
good,Toys R Us was a fun place to work with great people. So sad that the company closed. I made many connections while working at the GRC in Wayne NJ and really hope that we may one day cross paths again.
good,"Toys R’Us will always be the job to remember for future purposes. Part-Time is always the route to go though, it’s a fast paced environment and anyone can do the job really."
good,"Once customers found out we were closing, they shopped as if it was Christmas. Due to our location and several locations for that matter, not reaching quotas to surplus our debt, we were forced out of our jobs and shut down."
good,Great workplace just bad management. The manager's break the rules alot and they don't abide to the rules that are set for everyone. Most of all the locks were broken and the restroom were hardly clean
good,It was fun to help customers find and learn about toys. It was stressful the amount of pressure that was put on you as an employee to sell extended warranties and credit cards. The management was fair but also had high expectations. I worked there 23 years
good,"Unfortunately higher ups were more concerned about their pockets than reinventing the company and adapting it to the needs of the consumers. Not very proactive, chances of getting a promotion were slim to none."
good,"basic retail job. Management was fine, its the employees that get to you, a lot of them are cut throat and to me the stress that comes with the job is not worth the pay"
good,"The company is experiencing bankruptcy so I would not recommend trying to be employed here. The company is great at enhancing skills, and supportive of employees with families, but it is not a good time to join this company"
good,"typical day would be replenishing the shop floor and helping customers find the correct item they are looking for , i learned how to merchandise to a high standard , improve my customer service "
good,"Customers always come first, making sure everything is clean, putting things where they belong.  Answering phones, and questions that any customers have."
good,its great not a bad place to work but financial status is causing the concern in order to protect my own well being. Upper management does well in the service of its managers.
good,Too much to do and too little pay. I am not sure if I would recommend this job for anyone else because I myself do not like it. I would rather work at a plant nursery!
good,Everyday is a busy day clear out the loading docks so when the trucks arrived we have the space.storing away merchandise in its assigned sections laying out or dropping the pallets of merchandise in its area most of the co-workers I dealt with were pretty relaxed. I felt like a like a little kid when I received the discounts.
good,typical day is processing a truck and stock. overseeing store opening shift. I learned a lot about the culture at toys r us and they do promote from within.
good,It was a job and that's about it. I did learn a lot about baby gear and the like which helped when I had my own child. the workplace was like any other retail place so it just varied.
good,"Toys ""R"" US is pretty hectic around Christmas time, but they are very good with handling situations and helping customers.  I was okay with working there as a seasonal working even though it was stressful. But they're amazing with helping!"
good,"En el tiempo trabajado, he estado muy  agusto y también me llevo unos buenos compañeros y unas buenas personas."
good,Working at Toys R Us distribution center is a quick paced environment. you are timed on a lot of your work and always need to finish on the time given. You must be clean and help others as well.
good,Hard working environment with great ways to establish stocking skills. Adaptable working space with good pay during season.management could have showed more respect towards workers.
good,"Working at Toys R US wasn't a bad job. I started off working seasonal and stayed after seasonal until it was time for me to graduate college. Sometimes things were unorganized due to lack of communication from managers. The pay was not so good, not getting many hours and only getting paid bi-weekly."
good,This was only a part time job while I was going to school the work place was fine my typical day was about 6 to 7 hours unless it was around the holidays then I usually worked longer days.
good,"i didnt work there long but i did do well at my job, i ended up getting very sick and being hospitalized for a weeks time and they threatened me telling me to come back to work right away or i wasnt going to have a job."
good,"Thoroughly enjoyed working here at first however, management are not appreciated by seniors or allocated enough hours to share fairly between their staff."
good,"No meu dia a dia aprendi a trabalhar em caixa, atender clientes, fazer chamadas, fazer embrulhos."
good,"A typical work day was tightly scheduled, and high demanding as would be expected stocking a toy store around Christmas time and other seasonal times. Management was very involved with the job itself which was nice and admirable. However it there were some poor examples of people skills and unreasonable demands from management that I didn't like. The best part of the job I would say was the satisfaction of stocking and seeing a full and organized store. The worst I would say was the poor management."
good,"Busy stocking products, organizing the store, and interacting with customers. "
good,The Toys R Us Corporate Headquarters integrated several departments to coordinate a start to finish search of locations.  There were separate specifications for each division.
good,"Great job if you love to see kids smile. You will be in heaven if you like games too! The pay is good, and the environment is better. The management is okay."
good,I loved working here as it is a place where you are able to just do your job and be productive. The management are a little difficult but most are easy to work for.
good,Learned how to work the register. Most enjoyable part was working around the warehouse area of Wal-Mart. Hardest part was dealing with the pressure of customers paying in pocket change.
good,Fun work place to work. People are great there. Just doesn't give many opportunities to advance. I've been there three years and only get raises in pay but not in job title.
good,"I would again have to say getting to interact with the customers and more speicificaly the kids. Having kids come into a toy store you really get to make their day with all the amazing toys and electronics we had. Even though they are paying 100% of the time, the parents or their guardians are walking out with a smile and happiness on their faces."
good,from tee interview to the last day I worked they definitely made it fun! I wanna thank them for giving me the opportunity to work with them. We got to play with leggos at the interview
good,"I worked overnights and my overnight crew and manager were the best. I learned about stocking and shelving and other retail type things. As I said my night crew manager was the coolest (He no longer works there) but the store owner was horrible. The night team was family, we would banter and encourage each other making everything pass by swiftly like we weren't even working. The hardest part of the job was some of the lifting and whatnot. Most enjoyable part was the team."
good,Great starter job or when in school. The compensation isn't much to shake a stick at. Great team environment with competent management. Just seems like there is no way to advance in the company.
good,"Depending on certain days, especially times of days, it can either be incredibly fast paced or miserably slow. It was my first job and I learned cashiering and customer service. Only a few employees are hard working. There seemed to be a lot of tension between employees but most times it was playful. The management team were very caring but seemed a bit scattered. Of course it is a baby store so there were emotional pregnant women and rowdy children but I got used to it. The pay however was not worth it in the end."
good,Toys R Us is a fast pass place helping customers find what they need. I learned a lot about cashiering. There management team was great to work for they were always willing to answer question when needed
good,Toy R Us is a great place to start especially for those who are a kid at heart. It's a great place to learn and explore products which will allow you to perform great customer service.
good,A very easy job & they offer overtime all the time. Supervisors very organized & workplace is very clean. They have a lot of equipment. They communicate well & very understandable
good,I worked in a very small store (a pop up store) that didn't have the best management because many people that weren't managers before  moved up to become managers. The environment was okay and the people were okay. It was really boring most of the time because we didn't have much to do.
good,"A fast paced job with very high traffic during holidays. Not easy, but never boring. The people there do well to create a team environment, but the job demands a lot of commitments in terms of availability, crazy hours, drastic hourly cuts after holiday season and more in exchange for below average retail pay. Other retailers offer better pay without the craziness of Christmas at a toys store, but after working here other retail jobs are just a little bit easier."
good,"I have made some life long friends."
good,I wasn't the biggest fan of this place at first but I do miss it and will always love it because it was my first job ever!! working here was very fun while it lasted.
good,its challenging you need to stay on your feet as you are always bombarded with accompanying guest with there questions the breaks are very short 15-30 minutes only
good,"Management & customer service was not all that, cashier job pay is not enough especially when their job requires signing at least 2 people for Rewards cards & 1 person for the store credit card. I was fortunate they wanted me to work for them because this was my first retail job."
good,the job was boring you work so hard to become full time and stay with the company and then they tell you well hire you for 1 day a week I think not
good,"It's a toy store.  I worked full-time over the holidays, using my awesome customer service skills. It was most enjoyable.  The store has gone through managers who seem to have to live up to unrealistic quotas, but the managers I had were approachable, positive and professional."
good,"I worked at Toys R us twice. The first time was in 2014 for a christmas temp when I was 16 and in part time education. I was working here to gain a bit of money while I was in college and the second time was in 2016 while I was already in part time work I just needed abit more money  in the christmas period. The colleagues were friendly and helpful. I learned how to work the tills, deal with customers, handle money, re-stock toys in the appropriate place. The hardest part of the job would be when the ques are long and you're trying to serve everybody in appropriate timing without seeming like you're rushing people. The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting new people every day."
good,"very busy days, typically resulted in staying later than scheduled. Friendly staff, and a nice company to work for. free lunches, or snacks often provided to help boost morale."
good,"manager is extremely rude "
good,You tend to get a lot of young folks that apply to work there with the occasional Mom sprinkled in that wants to work there to get the discounts. So you have a fun group of people to work with as well as the challenges of young people and there cell phones.
good,"I worked seasonal at Toys R Us so it was pretty busy. It was my first job so I didn't know what to expect really, but the communication was off a lot. I didn't start for couple weeks after I was hired. Also I feel like I didn't get trained properly, but rather just thrown in with trial and error. The coworkers were alright everyone treated it like another job. The managers at the time, were ok too, it's just sometimes they disappear throughout the day and only would commit to taking their role seriously. But with the amount of business that came I can't really judge it was very hectic."
good,"Working for Babies R' Us was fun at times, while at other times it left something to be desired.  I am glad to have had the job as the income allowed me to pay my bills."
good,A typical day at Toys R Us consists of assisting customers and also making sales in Rewards cards and Credit Cards. Management is fun and easy to talk to but stingy with hours. Co-workers are pretty helpful and chill.
good,"A typical day consisted of me walking around the sales floor straighten up aisles, assisting guests, and occasionally checking on the warehouse. I learned how to worked in a warehouse, talk to guest with confidence, and assist guest with a timely and definite manner. Management was real easy to work with and provided you with the tools and guidance to complete your goals. Co workers were a joy to work with. The hardest part of the job was when were short handed and we were still required to meet our demands. The most enjoyable part of the job was working with the kids and giving them the toys they wanted."
good,"I would come in straighten the store, put back reshop, ring up customer, and help them find product."
good,Everyday at work there is something new to experience due to the different and diverse children and families who come in to shop. Working at here was a great experience when it came to the costumers' smiles and the laughs with co-workers. The only problem I had here was being held after scheduled hours and not getting breaks when it was legally needed. In this case management was just a bit unstable but overall it's a great place to work.
good,Everyone was incredibly communicative and helpful. Co workers and managers worked as a team. Everyone was very polite and very kind to one another.
good,"Closing sucks and it can get packed quickly and easily, but the people are friendly and very encouraging. A typical day at work its either excruciatingly slow or terrifyingly busy. All of my co-workers are wonderful people and management is a joy. But the low pay and the people you interact with can really take a toll."
good,"Toys R Us is a great place to work. The employees are fun and easy to get along with. Management does a decent job with tools they are given. Not enough hours given for important jobs, such as unloading trucks, and merchandising."
good,"Co Workers are great"
good,"Typical Day-  Overabundant"
good,"had a great time having to work an overnight shift and around toys it was somewhat peaceful, but truck day would have you working a lot more and faster because things need to get done before the store opens."
good,It was a great experience. It was my first job ever. had fun with my co workers. hardest part of the job was having to lift an average 25 to 40 pound boxes like almost 3 hours straight when we had to unload a trunk.
good,A very nice workplace. Management was ok. Co workers were nice. Great for working and going to school. Not too stressful.
good,"Seasonal stocking job with good work hours. Overnight shift with high paced work involved. Must be able to stand long periods of time and lift up to 70 lbs. "
good,"I was able to meet new people, and experience new things such as working in a warehouse.  I assisted in putting up displays, stocking, putting together toys or even bikes.   it was a positive experience."
good,"Toys R Us has a great working environment. It takes a long time to get promoted though. If you can become part of management life does get better, but the work becomes harder. Toys R Us is a family company and that is very important."
good,great place to work but management could be a little demanding when needn't be. met some great people and job was suitable forme at that time in my life.
good,"Overall, a great place to work with friendly employees who are willing to assist new hires. Managers are flexible with hours and you will not be scheduled to work on a day that you are unavailable. The job can be demanding, but if you produce, you will move up. However, the rate of pay is quite low compared to other retail stores."
good,"I enjoyed assisting customers with their needs, leading children to toys that they might like and persuading their parents to buy the toys for them."
good,"A typical day was to restock merchandise do planograms, help customers, fellow associates and act as manager on duty. I learned be a manager and solve customer complaints. Hardest part of the job was not being able to accomplish everything I wanted to do on a timely manner. The most enjoyable part of the job was interacting with people and helping customers  find what they were looking for. This gave me a sense of accomplishment."
good,"My only complaint about Toys R Us is the lack of available hours for me to work, otherwise I enjoy the work I do and I look forward to working each shift I am scheduled for."
good,"Total accountability of merchandising, inventory control. Attained sales manager of the year total company. productivity increase"
good,This job was okay. I loved the perks that come with it. I knew about all new toys and games that were released before the customers did which gave me the chance to buy certain items for my kid.
good,"I did not work at this job for very long, but for the time i was there i can admit that i enjoyed it to an extent. The people were great i just dont know if i fully enjoyed the work."
good,Toys R Us was a great place for me to join the workforce. I was trained very well by my supervisors and associate. They made tasks I had daily simple and straight forward. Every time I clocked in I was happy to do it.
good,"6am - 3pm shifts. "
good,"My experience with Toys'R'Us was short, but worthwhile. In my short time there, my hard work helped me to gain the trust of my supervisor and I was put in charge of teaching new associates the general rules of a typical work day."
good,The management and fellow employees are great. The bad thing is trying to get enough hours when you are trying to get minimum wage. The benefits are also minimal.
good,"Great place to work.  Great advancement opportunities.  Co-workers are like family.  Great sharing knowledge with guest.  Fast paced, always changing.  Hours are long."
good,"Clock in at 4pm walk upstairs to department, get everything I need before start work , work until 7:15 for my first break, clock back in at 7:45, work till 12:00 and go on break until 12:30, and then go home for the night. While working in this position I've learned to really pace my self while I work because there is a certain goal we have to meet everyday. Everyone is usually friendly that works there, I get along with every girl in my department. What really gets hard about my job is when we get more boxes of work to do but not enough time in our shift to finish it all, so the work we don't finish that day we have to wrap it and put it aside for the next day to catch up. The most enjoyable part about being there is having weekends off and a set schedule."
good,"It's the biggest toy store in the world. Kind of hard to dislike working here unless you hate kids, tourists and toys then this is not the place for you."
good,At first I didn't like working there but after a few months I started to like working there. Management was the only bad part about it.
good,"A great place to work if you like interacting with a lot of people and multitasking. Co workers are very nice and helpful especially towards the new people. The managers and supervisors have favorites, they'll give others more hours and demote people to strictly cart runs. The most enjoyable part about the job is definitely the customers helping them get their toys and putting a smile on their faces."
good,"A typical day at work consisted of sorting and stocking truck shipments, cleaning up you area, and occasionally fetching pick up orders for guests. Management was alright, co-workers were decent. The hardest part of the job was lifting really heavy stuff by yourself because most of the time there wasn't anyone else to help you. The most enjoyable part was probably helping out children and kids."
good,"My time at TRU has been a great learning experience in dealing with vendors who are looking to get their brands represented properly, while working for a company that gives them the guidelines to submit such assets.  My relationships with our vendors have been what has enabled me to efficiently do my job, and get things done in the best manner possible."
good,"Typical day involves reviewing reports processing daily operations."
good,"On typical day at work you can work in a variety a different departments "
good,i learned that you always come to a happy place where you learn everything
good,"It was a nice paced work place but very inconsistent with hours, only during the season"
good,"Great company to work for, but, they don't offer any benefits or very many hours. Wasn't efficient enough for my cost of living. My paychecks basically covered gas to get to and from. Not worth it, if you're like me and live a distance away from the company. Other than that, amazing company to work for with great management and great team members. They're all very helpful and willing to lend a hand. Something that I appreciated, very much."
good,"A typical day at work would consist of working the register, doing the go backs, zoning, and working the floor. I learned how to work a register, how to handle money, how to talk to people, and how to find information about anything a customer may need. the hardest part of the job was training. The most enjoyable part of the job was helping people get good deals during Christmas."
good,Fun place to work. I worked with some great people and was able to learn a lot from then.
good,"Removed completed and defective products and materials,placing them on moving equipment such as conveyors and in specified areas such as loading docks."
good,I feel my job experience in Toys R Us was a bit brutal my supervisor hyad an attitude and the women would speak on sex interactions they were having or had with their partners people attitudes were reall degradeable made you feel as if though they didn't want you around but I did enjo0y the reviewing of toys
good,"A typical day at Yankee One Dollar is processing of freight,oredring of merchandise,while keep a neat store."
good,"It was an ok job.  Pay is minimal, not much room for advancement, and hours slightly suck.  No good employee discounts, but the culture of the place is great if you like kids.  Management was very sketchy and not real professional.  I ended up leaving because of in-store and corporate management and wouldn't return to the place, but ok as a stop over.  Don't expect to pay any real bills with the pay, even when you're full time."
good,"My former co-workers are well trained in terms of store and product knowledge, so the day goes by quickly due to the efficient productivity of each and every one of the team members. The culture at the store that I worked at was very friendly; where everyone was able to just have an easy conversation with each other where nothing was forced."
good,"customer service was key. you either love helping customers or you don't. i loved it, you never know what kind of people you would meet and help day to day. and when your regular customers came in it was great because you know what they liked and who they were."
good,typical duties you would expect from any retail sales position
good,"The hardest part of the job was dealing with the constantly changing priorities of management. The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to put smiles on the faces of children and parents with the perfect toy purchase. Also, having great co-workers that work as a team."
good,"A normal day at work, for me at least would be working in the customer service area. I handle returns, purchases and other guest related problems such as looking for a particular item, processing special orders and many more issues. I learned in there, which i feel is essential is the processing of the bank when they come to collect the money, and counting over the safe and tills when needed. My co workers are very reliable, all ways when i need back up someone is around to help me out. But of course you do have the few that don't want to help out. The hardest part about my job is dealing with the difficult customers. Sometimes you go above and beyond for the customer, and they still are not happy. The most enjoyable part about the job is when the customer is happy, cause for me that makes me like i did a fantastic job in providing the best customer service i can for that guest."
good,"A typical day at work was working with customers and helping them with anything they needed. I learned how to talk to different customers and give them was they needed. The management was rocky at times because it was always changing. I did however enjoy my co-workers because they were all excited about being at work. The hardest part of my job was dealing with angry customers, but the most enjoyable part was dealing with the children and putting a smile on their faces. "
good,"Keep your department clean, very helpful co-workers, new faces every month, good atmosphere, not enough days to rest or days off. I've learned a lot from customers and co-workers."
good,"Very easy to understand the work and get used to it, not much room for advancement but steady enough job to pay my bills during the times of employment."
good,"my co workers kept the fun going, manager was nice."
good,I was pretty much new to being a supervisor of my department.
good,Typical day at work includes greeting and assisting customers. Learned how to sell metrics and maintain stock. Co-workers are mostly friendly and helpful. Management will teach how certain things can be done better and faster. Hardest part is always maintaining good metrics and keeping all customers satisfied. Most enjoyable part was my co-workers.
good,"i my role at toys r us i was mainly on the tills which consisted of serving customers and packing there products, i also went on to the shop floor alot to do shop floor sales e.g demonstrating products and explaining which product would be right for the particular customer."
good,i liked working for the store due to it had very reliable assistant managers and cooperative with their employees.
good,cashier. stocked toys. helped kids. close to home
good,"Fun easy job, little to no chance of advancement, low pay long hours"
good,"great seasonal job, great environment long hours at holiday times"
good,"The pay is bad, the culture is negative, and management was often very loose with the rules - but if you worked and didn't make anyone mad, you could keep the job forever. My day consisted mostly of stocking shelves, cleaning aisles, or cashing out customers. Nothing extraordinary, other than the occasional store reset."
good,"I enjoyed working with everyone. I learned how to set up displays, price change, and sell some of the items in stock."
good,Always encourages employees to enjoy the workplace while challenging them to improve.
good,"It was an overall enjoyable experience with great people who take their jobs seriously. Outside of the Christmas season the work is rather mundane and the supervisor does more labor than supervision. Often was no more than 4 employees in the store to close, which is fine unless you want the work completed correctly."
good,"If this job is in your sights, be prepared to get dirty. There is ALOT of dust and dirt around. Job made easier with motorized pallet jacks rolling around the warehouse. To fully fit into enviroment, Learn Spanish as a second language. If not, then communications with fellow employees becomes nonexistent. The company's rule on cell phones on the floor is a good rule for safety purposes but if caught once then immediately terminated from job without question."
good,"Standing on your feet for 8 hours a day watching every person that walks in and out of the door. Watching the cameras, and making sure nothing leaves the store. the management was very strick, they did not give any room for error"
good,"I enjoyed working with my co workers, but I didn't like the way it was ran we never had order"
good,"In charge of hiring and training new associates. I've learned several management techniques such as; knowing how to approach different people in order to get a task done, and motivating others to complete tasks. I really enjoy all of the people i work with in our fun environment. Getting everything that needs to be accomplished while still finding time to help toy dreams come true during the holiday season is the most difficult part of the job. The most enjoyable part of the job is getting to work and engage with a diverse group of people."
good,"Fun for the children , work place is relaxed and exciting, products stay stacked on shelves, store is clean, nice breaks"
good,"My work day would sometimes start as early a 5am but I always looked forward to being there. I loved to see how enthusiastic the costumers were to shop at our store. Each experience with a costumer was different. Sometimes I wasn't able to meet a costumers need but I learned that I should be patient and assist them in the best possible way I could. That is what the managers lived by they always wanted me to make sure that the costumer was able to access the product or information they needed. The managers of the store were not the only people I asked for assistance with a problem. I also had very helpful and dependable co-workers who were able to answer any question I had. We were taught to work as a team and at the end of the day the whole team of employees in the store would take misplaced merchandise and return them to the correct place. In fact this was the most difficult task while working at Toys R Us, because the store was quit large with thousands of items. My team members and I worked together to make sure every item was placed correctly. Sometimes we would even have to stay until 2am. Even though I was a hard worker nothing compared to the joy I felt when I saw the satisfaction on the costumers face."
good,"I enjoyed working for toy r us corporation, i was satisfied with my work from start to finish."
good,Great place to work as a student with hours that are easy to be managed with. Great team members that make the work week great.
good,"Management is not good at all, very poor at delegating in order to get proper training resolved. Pay is very low. Offer benefits but not that good."
good,Was a great job until they close down the business I enjoyed working with the public. Everyday was a different day at toys r us but I always left work with a smile on my face.
good,While working here I had the two best and two worst managers I have ever worked for. I miss my teams I had but am glad to be out of the company going forward
good,As a first job toys r us was pretty fun. I love kids so working in an environment with them made me enjoy going into work more. I especially enjoyed Saturday’s when we would have events for the kids.
good,How to stock shelf's and count the items to prepare for the next displayable item. I also learned how to manage money putting it in the vault and help preparing the deposit.
good,"I started when I was 16. I worked 3 days out the week due to me being a minor , It was a fun first job. I enjoyed myself because I use to come here as a child."
good,Good job on a very part time basis. Upper management a bit clicky. Younger floor managers were lovely to work with. Pretty good training! Just not the position that suited my needs.
good,"I enjoyed working at toys r us because I loved seeing the children . Always with bright smiles on their faces .. my favorite part of working at toys r us is when I got to do birthday shout outs to kids . They were always cheerful. My second favorite part about working at toys r us was working in customer service . I catch on really quickly so returning, exchanging, and ordering products was really easy for me as well as. Conducting and completing purchases. Giving store credit and answering phones . It was a delightful experience.."
good,"great work environment"
good,Typical day was walk around the store looking for customers to help and products that needed restocking or cleaning. Learned basic retail and first job experience.
good,I learned so much with this job. I learned how to count more money quickly and communicate as well. This job was very fun and was a huge store to help customer and kids to find the toy they want/
good,Good place to work/ worked with employees to balance life and home/ play with the kids that come into the store/ vacation pay and earned time pay/ always something to do
good,"To assist the customer"
good,"Doing schedule, coaching  and training team members. Helping customers find what they were looking for. Seeing the look on children's faces when they walk in for the first time was the best. Stocked shelves. Learned how to read the business and plan accordingly. Worked as a team with other members of management. Hardest part of the job was watching it fall apart because of upper management choices. I enjoyed helping customers find what they were looking for and seeing the smiles on their faces. When we would have  all the Santa's come to the store every year to check out the new toys was so much fun."
good,"This company is bankrupt.  You can only apply for jobs in China and India and Canada."
good,Coming to with packing and shipping.  Receive ND load trucks and restock the shelves.  I liked my co workers and I got discount on things when I wanted to purchase them fir my kids.
good,I very much appreciated the training and room for growth here. I loved my co workers and management. The company however would insist on making employees work on holidays and miss special occasions with family.
good,A typical day would be collecting my case load for the day from my internal and external tray. following up on any discrepancies regarding accounts and managing inbound and outbound calls. The workplace was fantastic lovely colleagues and worked well as a team. The management were great too they were very experienced workers who adhered to a positive working atmosphere. 
good,I enjoyed working with this company especially during the seasonal term. The most enjoyable part of the job were the peak times during the holidays and working with the team to meet company goals. I learned more about promoting credit cards and protection plans here.
good,"great work place, good employees that work as a team. Always make sure customers com first at all times. Made sure employees was up to date will all new products."
good,"Fun place to work, Going out of business end of June 2018, the compensation is good depending on what department you work in, the management is great, and this job gives a great deal of job experience."
good,"Hours sometimes depend on the sales, and sometimes if you are a part time employee you could get very low hours. It can be a fun place to work, but it depends on who you work with."
good,"It was a great place to work, but the store is going out of business. I am beginning a new chapter in my life and excited to start a new experience. I had a positive experience with my fellow co-workers and I look forward to having that experience again. I learned many skills and I am able to multi-task while under pressure. The most enjoyable part of the job for me was seeing the smiles on the children's faces. The hardest part of the job is having to say good-bye."
good,The people make this company a great place to work.  We have had many changes in upper management which has led to the downfall of this company. Was once a really great place to work.
good,company unstable dont now what is happening=Have been closing stores-I want to go to a company where i can advance but not worried about my job.Thats the reason I want to leave
good,Was a fun place to work until the downsized.  Good job for someone just starting out.  Company has some opportunity for advancement.  Managers treated everyone like family.
good,"The amount of work I did there for the pay did not even out. I did the work of 3 job titles within one day. I was with the company for a total of four years. I understand earning your rank, which I did, but this was a nightmare for all of the work I did. I truly felt bad for the supervisors, but the managers got to relax most of the time. Honestly, the fast paced and dynamic aspects to the job made it fun. In hindsight, I'd do it again."
good,Typical work day/night we clock in have a team meeting about meeting the goals for the night and we get to work. I learned how to work better as a team instead of by myself. I also learned little about back stocking and the back house in general. The work culture was good for the most part. The most enjoyable part of the job was getting along with coworkers and getting what e needed done.
good,This job does give you opportunities to advance and can be slow paced or fast depends on you and your desire. The management is kind and very understanding. The only thing is that the wages aren't as high as one would desire (the start at minimum and you earn more with annual raises)
good,"the hardest part was balancing rush hour and everything you had to do, management was alright i guess, i learned how to manage customer service, most enjoyable part was some of my co-workers"
good,"All I did when I worked at Toys 'R' Us was stocking during the night shift, and all in all it was pretty easy. All I had to do was move boxes of toys around and pick up stuff that was left on the floor. Most of the problems came from the other workers there. Several of them were clearly drug addicts and a lot of them were particularly rude. It was my first real job, and I assumed that was clear to the other people, but the people who seemed to have worked there for a long time clearly resented having to help me. They would give me the stink eye whenever I asked how to do something or what I was supposed to do in a certain situation. It's not a good environment for someone who isn't hardened and pretty tough. It was way too stressful."
good,For the most part it is an nice place to work. Not a lot of hours during the off-season. Sometimes there are stressful situations and rules/guidelines can be a little confusing
good,Cool place if your just looking for a part time gig. I've always liked my managers at my time at toys r us and never had problem. Unfortually they just pay enough
good,"Compensation is terrible when you are hourly, however it is amazing once you are promoted to salaried. "
good,"It's a retail job, so it can be hard to find work/life balance during the holidays, but I always felt the managers were on our side, and it was never difficult to work as a team."
good,"A typical day was simple. I would clock in, grab a walkie and keys, then step out on the sales floor. Through this experience I became more comfortable with customer service."
good,"I don't have anything against them, the job was good, hard but good, they start you at 12, they give you like 7-8 hours a day, it's not bad at all but they make you work really hard, the staff is not very good at taking care of their employees, but you definitely can make some good amount of money there."
good,A lot of work for very little pay. Worked 12 hour days doing a bunch of stocking and building throughout the store. Ring out merchandise for customers in need
good,"It was a good seasonal job. I worked 3rd shift so it didn't interfere with my life balance. Time went by fast because you stayed busy loading the toys on the shelves. Management was cool, they didn't bother you as long as you were doing what you were paid to do."
good,"This job was a hard job. I had never done anything like this before, but I am glad I did. "
good,"Good people, good business overall. Fun environment to work in. Sometimes hectic and busy but that's the nature of the business! Lots to do and alot of fun doing it!"
good,"Very friendly crew, flexible hours, works with your schedule if you are balancing work and school. Management is easy to talk to and get a hold of. Easy advancement if you want to stay there."
good,It was far too long ago that I worked here to even begin to provide information about the current work environment.  I have nothing to add that would be useful for anyone.
good,"Working At Toys R Us was an new experience for me, I learned various things such as customer services, promoting items and even working at the till. The staff was very friendly and was a good working environment. The work load was manageable as I did my best each day."
good,"Typical day at Toys R Us could be spent behind a counter / cash wrap all day or walking the store helping customers on the floor.  Great staff, though management could have been a bit stricter in certain areas.  If you have good toy knowledge and like driving sales then this job is for you."
good,A typical day was I would get there clock in then go find what register I was at everyone that I worked with was awesome they all respected each other in never felt any tension walking into work
good,Great place for experience with customer service and sales.  Out of season is horrible with hours but once in season you are eventually at unlimited hours.
good,Working at toys-r-us was a fun place to work at and if you work hard you will move up in management like i did after year. Its a great place to build up your retail experince.
good,I pick thw iteams and i also. Had pack when need it was very easy and easy to work it was a good fit for me. It was a great expense been there. Learn how to do more then I expect.
good,"Toys R us is a good place to work at and has very good opportunities to progress  although training isnt always the best , everyday is never the same and the choice of products is very good and caters for all ages."
good,A typical day for me would be organizing my work areas and keeping them clean. I helped customers create their baby registries every step of the way. The management and co workers all worked together to maintain a fun stress-free environment.
good,"my first day was scary, I was put into something I had known nothing about nd was told basically to do it"
good,Fun place to work. Must have great work ethic and be able to multi task and be cross-trained to make the best out of the experience. Hours can be hectic especially around Season but overall an experience in retail that will let you know if you are cut out for retail.
good,"The job was horrible. I would work 13 hour plus days. Never enough hours, so we were constantly sending people home early. Customers have no respect for us, and nor did the upper management. Great job security but I didnt find it to be the place for me."
good,"Toys r us is a decent place to work.Be careful of being over worked and stressed out about the lack of materials to do the job properly. The management can lack structure resulting in power struggles and confusion. When it comes to unloading the truck, they're asking for a lot of goods to go on the sales floor with absolutely no space. This can be very frustrating.  It can be a good place to work if these issues were sorted out."
good,Working here was a great experience. I learned a great deal about customer service and how the retail work floor is done. Customer service for returns and price adjustments. Inventory and online purchases for furniture. Providing friendly assistance to consumers.
good,"Work at Toy ""R"" Us was fun and not stressful at all. I learned a great deal about customer service and how the retail work floor is done. The people in store were supportive and very happy. the hardest part of working here was just restocking the dozens of items the night before but the best part was hanging out with families and assisting customers."
good,"Managers and Supervisers are fun. You honestly can't tell who has all the power because everyone is so friendly. Only thing that sucks is the pay. Its usually minimum wage or a dollar over. Supervisors only make 10 an hour. "
good,I like it it's fun sometimes. I just want more and more experience than what I'm doing now. I always stay busy at work i love my job. My job title is Pricing and Signage Team Member that mean I change the prices on merchandise and sales for that day if there's any. I love all my co-workers there very nice and respectful.
good,"Pros: Enjoy watching and helping the kids in a toy store."
good,Enjoyable work place with a great team that got the job done in a timely matter while assisting the customers in a fashionable matter
good,"days seem to fly by, there is always something to clean up and restock, stay busy.  Management was awesome and very helpful;. Really enjoyed the community outreach programs"
good,"fun working with the public and the customer helping them with there new mom needs, but a fast paced environment where you need to be able to multi task daily."
good,"Giornata tipica lavorativa: organizzazione gruppo lavoro, allestimento o rifornimento corsie o sala vendita."
good,"the time spent at Toy's ""R"" Us I was hired as temp employee which lasted well into seven months."
good,I'm a good parson looking for a job I'm easy to get along with I love working I just love working   hard so I will be a good parson for the job
good,"Learning job duties of how to care for customers, customer service, stock, greeting customers"
good,"A typical day was monotonous.  Mostly answering emails and assisting with shipping.  "
good,"I have loved working there. the people are amazing but, it's not a career. they don't pay there employees enough to make a living."
good,unload the truck put merchandise on the shelf. how to communication more with people.
good,Overall a decent job. Issues lies in the Compensation and the Advancement. It does not pay very well and getting promoted is near impossible as they always hire from outside of the company.
good,"Everyday in work I get set targets If I am working on tills, my aim is to achieve my goal by the end of the day, the hardest part in my job is not getting a break in less I work over 6h its manageable but I dread it. My fellow co workers are great, very hard working team, I also do floor work which consist of clearing and stocking shelves and helping costumers, The most enjoyable part of my job is helping the customer, it gives me a sense of satisfaction if I have helped a customer to the best of my ability."
good,Very easy to complete tasks. A fun environment to be around. There's somewhat of growth provided there but not much.
good,The job can be very stressful over the holidays because of the long lines and disgruntled customers. The kids will wreck the place so you plenty of re shopping and stocking to do. The hours are good so you can made your extra money. My managers were awesome so i wouldn't complain.
good,I was responsible for unloading trucks. I learned how to use a fork lift and a double jack witch was very beneficial to my job. The management was really great there. The hardest part of my job was that it was only a part time position and they never hired full time. I enjoyed that they cared about their employees and gave us lunches and candy to appreciate our work.
good,"toys r us is great on customer service "
good,"I built toys, what more could a guy ask for! "
good,I thought it was a good place to work.  While working there I learnt to be more organized and production in order to be more efficient.  I worked quite a bit with the other employees whether working on project or in day to day tasks. The culture is customer service oriented. I enjoyed helping assisting and resolving  customers issues through different creative measures. 
good,My time there the only bad thing would have to be that the pay isnt high enough
good,"Come into work, stand at your register"
good,Unloading and loading goods onto tractor trailers using a sit down forklift and double length electric riding pallet jack. Stack and organize goods to be received into system.
good,Babies R Us was my first job. I was in the work program in High school and left school everyday at 1:30pm to attend my job.
good,No Complaints. A good company to work for. With any retail company u wish u had more hours to run ur staff.
good,Assist shoppers with purchases. Restock products. Zone area of responsibility.
good,i use to work as iron man so that kept me occupied during the day and i loved seeing childen smile when i was in the custom
good,Enjoy the environment love and helping customers assisting customers and getting customers the things that they need. Seeing a customer smile just working with people
good,Overall I really enjoyed the Job It was a super Fast paced environment which I loved. Managers were extremely fair never bias and the location was close by my home
good,"Due to hiring ""just anyone"" management could've been better. You never know what you're going to expect on a day to day basis. With better management and understanding the company could be number one."
good,Loaded trailer full of toys at least 3 trailers a day multi task site process with an rf gun label product and ship sometime unloaded with and epj or manuelly
good,Putting items where they belong and re stocking items when needed getting items from the back when a customer needs something even put together bikes if a customer ask
good,"Unfortunately they went out of business , I really loved what I did at Toys""R""Us and Babies ""R""Us. Only wish they would have stayed in business so may employees would still have there jobs."
good,Toys R Us was a decent place to work.  It was a typical retail environment. Unfortunately due to a lot of reasons the company went into bankruptcy and all stores are now closed.
good,"need more work gatherings"
good,"A typical day at work for me consists of processing merchandise either from the truck or from the backroom, helping customers and cleaning up the store. I was cross trained throughout the store so that I could fill in at anytime when and where I was needed. I got along fairly well with a majority of my managers. I loved working with my fellow coworkers. The hardest part of my job was trying to get my job done on time with equipment that was not always working properly. The most enjoyable part of my job was seeing all of the kids smiling and having fun when they were in the store shopping or participating in one of the stores events."
good,"I retrieve merchandise in Pick-up area for customers.  I learned that Customers develop an appreciation when they revisit the store.   Most Managers have always been helpful and respectful.  The Workplace Culture was relatively diversed.  The hardest part of the job was when all of the customers want their Merchandise at the same time I am assembling a bike or other merchandise.  The most enjoyable part is when Customers are happy, work is done and Managers are satisfied."
good,"to be included in more things with staff activities, need more help when you are new and you dont know whats really going on, more creative activities with the children, maybe a day out or two to explore with the children."
good,"If you can stay at the hourly supervisor level, do it. Salaried managers are paid for 45 hours and work about 55 to 60 a week. Paid time off is offered,"
good,Can be very short staffed at times . Equipment does not always work and sometimes there is not enough that works.  They do not always work with schedules.
good,"For every 50 transactions you do you have to have 5 rewards cards sign ups, 1 credit card sign up, 5 battery sales, and two protection plan sales. Too hard when everyone is in a rush and you ask every customer and keep getting nos"
good,A typical day would be signing into the registers and ringing customers up and fixing the candy racks. I learned how to search up customers that were on the baby registry and call them and inform them about their orders. Very organized schedules are made two weeks ahead and the hardest part was getting customers to sign up for credit cards the most enjoyable was getting rewarded for the number of reward or credit card accounts we accomplished.
good,A great experience to get to know new people and make kids smile. The days goes by fast and time is great because you are constantly busy. The smile on the kids faces when they come in for the birthday club is awesome. But over all its a great experience.
good,"Everyone has always been extremely friendly and welcoming. Its been very easy making friends with everyone who works there, and leaving at the end of the season is going to be very hard."
good,"Fun company to work for, lacks management skills though. Great for teens and young people looking for jobs. Offers temporary, seasonal, full time, and part time postitions."
good,"Super friendly people to work with and a great atmosphere for first starting out. Not a whole lot of potential to grow, and one of the lowest pays I've seen."
good,Great place to work at. Worked there for 5 years and learned so much from working there
good,A productive day at Toys R Us is when you get the chance to help customer find all their needs.
good,Coming in to work to see smiling faces and sharing tons of laughs with co-workers kept me with this company for years. This company has trained me to provide excellent costumer service and taught me how to work effectively on both team and individual projects. However at this time opportunity for advancement is hindered. I'd like the opportunity to find something both challenging and rewarding that I can apply the advanced skills that I've acquired towards a more complex position.
good,"working for toys r us was stressful, equiptment felt like it was stuck in the past, no proper training was given and the only reason that everyday was bareable was some of the fellow staff members"
good,"Great place if like toys, organize in some sections, can receive help if needed."
good,A fun place to work. Labor intensive. High volume seasonal.
good,"A typical day at work was coming in, clocking in and getting straight on the cash register. I would work 4 hours straight take a break and when I came back from lunch if our store was slow i would walk around the store stocking shelves (reshop), or bring packages out of the stock room and stock the shelves until the store started flowing again. The good thing about the job was that the hours were flexible and it was an easy going job. however there was not enough hours for all the employees that were there and that became chaotic."
good,Great job a lot of fun. I learned great customer service and ability to multi task. All my managers and coworkers were happy and dedicated to be at work.
good,i worked early morning shifts before cutomers were ever in the store so it was quiet. i always knew what i had planned for my day. i had a routine and for the most part got to follow it. i learned alot of different positions while at tru. so its hard to narrow it all down to one job. i really enjoyed for there. if given the chance i would go back.
good,"The people in finance are great, I just wish that senior management knew where they were taking the company."
good,Clock in after storing belongings in my locker. I would go to my register and wipe it down before servicing the customers. Sometimes I would be on the floor helping customers find toys and with pricing as well as keeping the store clean. I learned that I work well under pressure and enjoy a non-stop work enviroment and that I enjoyed my coworkers. The hardest part would have been black friday and dealing with the sheer volume customers but it was okay just very hectic and something I have never experienced before. The most enjoyable part would be the store itself and I loved the electronics department as well as my manager.
good,It's a good place to work if you want temporary work. I enjoyed working here.
good,"They really care about you as a person, its tough only a few months out of the year."
good,A typical day at work would be clocking in and a soon as you hit the floor customers would stop you and ask questions. I learned alot about working in a stock room they and keeping up with the systems and machinery. Management presence wasnt really there becuase it was always so busy so I had to manage by working with more experienced team members. My co-workers were really great and we worked as a team and we really could rely on one another. The hardest part of the job was trying to learn my role when i first started working yet have hundreds of people demanding your assistance. the best part f the job was seeing how relieved a customer would look after i helped them solve a problem that no one else could.
good,Had me working on a 30 foot ladder holding 100 lb bags no spotter almost fell so many times brought it up to the manager he said “do your job” so I kept working hard as I always do.
good,"A great environment to work in fun friendly employees, majority of the customers weee friendly some were rude and impatient. Overall a great workplace ."
good,"Certain days it was out of hand ."
good,Toys r us was a great place to work. I knew I could always count on that job. The management wasn't always perfect but we knew we were all part of a team and we made any situation work out.
good,"Toy R Us is no longer in business.  I enjoyed working there, however the store and Toys R Us in general was struggling.  I needed to find more secure and higher paying employment."
good,"It was a decent job for a 16 year old and I got a pretty nice work schedule and some good hours.Only thing I didn't like was the work place I should have kept the job and transferred work places. I didn't like the fact that they would call me on my off days alot , sometimes is cool but they abused it"
good,A great company to work for. Very focused on team development and training. I have worked at many locations with the company and the atmosphere is very similar in every store. Only downfall is the pay and the fact that the company is closing all U.S. stores.
good,"staff is friendly but young, overnights get a bit stressful during holiday season. after holidays no hours. 10 percent discount on merchandise."
good,Typically the job consisted of restocking the shelves and managing the back of the store where the merchandise is kept. The training was simple and easy to grasp but my one gripe is that I was typically kept for longer than my hours were for. (If you work till closing which I tend to do then you aren't able to leave until the entire stock is restocked which sometimes added an extra hour or two to my shifts. This happened constantly.)
good,I love the job and most of the people here they just don't have the hours needed to be able to survive.  If you are looking for a job that is flexible and willing to work with you the management here is awesome and willing to help
good,"Easy days, busy work, good management, Hardest part of the job is using the old technology that they have.st enjoyable part was the workers that I worked with."
good,Fun work environment. Good hours pay wasn't as good as I thought it would be but I learned a lot of productive things a lot about the business. I enjoyed it!
good,"Does provide benefits for full-time employees. Very understanding of personal situations such as family/other jobs/continuing education. "
good,"I really liked working for Toys R Us, I have learned that every customer is a different unique individual that comes with a different attitude, And as long as you know how to deal with customers you would get through your day of work. I've had some hard times and i also had some good times but overall working with customers is what im most passionate about because i love dealing with people. My managers and coworkers where all good to me and we made a great team. Everybody got along and everybody did they job they was suppose to do."
good,"Cleaning work area, gathering carts . Low salary per hour .customers was all ways satisfied  "
good,The environment was fun and most co workers were helpful and kind with the exception of one whom did not need to be so spiteful to me espically in front of customers . I understood i was only a temporary christmas assistant and it was very busy but i did not get proper training thus making me alot slower having to ask over co workers for help alot of the time making myself feel very useless and leaving me to figure out alot of stuff for myself . The stock room was not labelled in anyway making it very hard to figure out where a section was i only knew where my section was because i asked .
good,"Greeted customers with a smile,friendly conversations. enjoyed the enviroment."
good,"Everday was exciting, i learned to take on tasks and complete group activities. My co-workers have always helped me when i needed it and i have enjoyed everything i did with them. The hardest part of the job was when i had to be in charge of an activity. The most enjoyable part was being involved and communicating with the customers and staff."
good,I’ve always been a hard worker. I made a lot of people happy. My boss used to act like he couldn’t stand me but he liked me because I was good at what I do and  neat & on time.
good,it was a good place to work good hours hardest part at work was closing up best park was opening up we always had a lot of happy customers............
good,I had a good experience overall. Everyone was nice and easy to work with. I would recommend that job to anyone looking for a first job. They’ll learn a lot from that job.
good,A typical day at work is a good comfortable space.I learned that accomplishing goals and making customers feel comfortable is a the best part of the job. Cons of working at toys r us is the schedule during holidays but overall seeing customers get their needs met is astonishing.
good,"I loved this job they closed down though."
good,"Be prepared to be cross-trained. This is retail, you run into a lot of retail-type employees. So, you could be working with the same crew for a long time, or you could be meeting new employees constantly. Because of this, you could easily, and quickly, be the most knowledgeable employee in the store."
good,"I started working for Babies ""R"" Us when I graduated high school.   I could have left for other jobs, but it was hard to because it had that family atmosphere not a lot of stores offer.  While I was there I learned a lot about the value of teamwork and communication.  I will say that when the liquidation started, managers did an incredible job in making sure that we were taken care of financially."
good,Toysrus was not a bad company to work for. I Started as a Seasonal employee and move up pretty quick to where i'm at now. You had your good day and bad that just how it goes in retail.
good,A typical day working at Toy's ''R'' us is like a relaxed paced setting not a stressfull enviornment. You'd start off unloading freight from the trucks and after that is completed you'd go to the sales floor and start stocking.
good,"As the company is going to dissolve, I don’t think this really matters but let’s give it a try. Most of the managers I worked for - who were great - have left the company."
good,"typical day is restocking toys , helping out friendly costumers "
good,"I liked working at Toys R Us, it was my first job and although it was always busy, it was all around a great job and the staff was great. The environment was great as well, everyone welcomed everyone with open arms."
good,"Laid back job, pretty easy. Receiving team from the department store can complicate your duties because they don't process your items in a timely manner or follow the guidelines Destination Maternity gave them."
good,Extremely racist staff who always follow minorities around the store. Push employees to get costumers to get credit cards but don't have commissions for them. Manager and assistant managers are always sitting down talking to each other but reprimand employees for saying a few words to each other. Only get 16 cent raise a year. Only good thing is that part timers get to accumulate paid time off and work around your schedule if you're in school.
good,A typical work day i come in and clock in count my register and for about 4-6 hours I have conversations wit the customers laugh and joke with my coworkers hardest part of my job is making sure people do not steal and the most enjoyable part is talking to the customers
good,"People come in and work and they go home. A lot of things are changing with new management, but I feel that it's not an place one would like to exchange money for labor over a long period of time. Being there, for me, is draining. I think that the employees feel a strain from the lack of organization on the management side, and the emphasis to have a high productivity, but no or little intensives to do more than the bare minimum. They pay an average amount, but I don't think it's worth it if you have plans to better yourself. I think they'll take your labor, over work you and toss you aside. Time is more valuable than the overtime they force in continuous, but irregular succession."
good,"most of the time i work on cash register but other time i work on the floor which means i help customers, answer their questions, make sure they leave as satisfied as possible."
good,"Large company, many departments to transfer too. Uses publicly traded company standards for a privately owned company."
good,"all day i used to clean around my register, put back items on shelves, and deal with customers on floor or on the register. i learned how to meet new people and seek their needs, help people, how to work on a register, how to deal with customers, and mainly how to work in a team. the hardest part of the job is you need to always keep in mind how to be the best worker. the most enjoyable part is meeting new people and being successful in what i do."
good,working here was a different change of pace for me i have more experiance working in clothing stores but overall i had fun learning about all the kids toys and telling customers about everything plus its the biggest one in the world i heard so thats always cool
good,Busy Which is good for me because i like to work nice customers friendly co-workers
good,I was only in the register because I was only there for the Christmas season. The management we're good. They have genuine concern for the company. My co-workers were very friendly but I didn't get to spend much time with them. The hardest part of the job was the unending line in the register since it was Christmas season. The most enjoyable part is getting to see the wonderful smiles of the children when you hand them their toys.
good,"Associates and management were always very helpful and kind.  Very high volume store that helped further my knowledge in customer service. Long hours at the store during holidays could get very stressful especially when store becomes open 24 hours during the days before Christmas, but can be accomplished having a productive team."
good,Enjoyed the people that I worked with.  Everyone helped each other to compete the job. Management was fair with everyone and treated everyone with Respect.
good,"Majority of my time at that store was amazing. Everyone was close knit. It was a great place to be. However, recent years saw huge shifts in management. That really became a critical issue that was a huge stressor on top of the other issue that it was hard to get to take your breaks. "
good,i dont remember too much. when i was working there i was a young mother and they gave me flexibility when i had a infant being able to get off on certain times.
good,"It Was A Very Good Company To Work For , Wish I Weren't Seasonal . I Loved The Workers , I Loved The Managers ! And Just Helping People In General Is Great. Some Costumers Have Bad And Good Days , So I Tried To Do My Best To Cheer Them Up!"
good,"This job started out good I learned how to become a Human resource Mgr.I really loved doing this job I got to hire all of the associates for the season,my managers were awesome at this job co-workers were great, there was no hard part of the the job it was all around fun.The most enjoyable time was recruiting the new hires."
good,"Working at Toys R Us is fun and interesting. You get the opportunity to work with the public, learn about the different types of toys, and you also get a chance to get the first grabs on the different products when they come out. It was a great experience to be in this environment, especially with a newborn who will soon be using some of the toys in that store! I was only seasonal, but it was a great amount of experience that was provided to me through the fellow workers and the guests who shop there. The management and fellow co-workers there were amazing and made the shifts there such a blast! You also get to see a variety of children in that store from the newborn age and up."
good,its an good job to work for and the managements and co-workers are nice to you but the hardest part of the job is the turck day.
good,"learned a lot as being a manager, and how to prepare my self for the next chapter in my life. when I first got into this job I thought to my self this something I can do. toys r us has great customer service as well as management."
good,"A typical day involved mostly working the register and restocking things people decided they didn't want. Also, sometimes they had you straighten a section of the store before you left, but that was only if you closed. The management was easy to get along with, i liked that. The hardest part of the job was figuring out where things went cause nothing was in the place it should have or you thought it would be. The most enjoyable part of the job was honestly going home."
good,"It was a great place to work. I really enjoyed working there. They were so nice, they are great at training you and they actually take there time to do so."
good,We picked we pack remove certain boxes picking was my favorite you get to go around the warehouse and pick things to get shipped off just certain places
good,Working for this company really made me want to be more social and active with new people. Being an employee for this company really made me open up to new things.
good,if you get a chances to work there do it. Its fun and relaxing and the people you work with are friendly. Also at Christmas its  the best time to work there.
good,I loved the work place just needed more money. I love staying busy and multitasking and the key carrier postion gave me that opportunity. Toys r us was a great place to work for work and school balance.
good,Tried to follow chain of command and turn in a serious ethic issue but was shot down by corporate on different occasions. Company preaches ethics but when brought about issues the company failed to do anything for it.
good,"A place for teenagers to work."
good,I worked there when it was closing. Systems and power kept going out and the customers were very rude. Management was a joke due to them not caring about the job anymore
good,"A typical day at work consisted of helping customers find what they where looking for, cashiering, walking around the store making sure everything was neat and nothing was on the floors.The most enjoyable part of the job was helping and interacting with customers, both parents and children."
good,"On a regular work it was pretty busy due to it was around the Christmas holidays. I've learned to be very patient, it takes a lot of patience with working in this type of environment this time of the year. The hardest part of the job was dealing with customers attitudes if a item was sold out or no longer in stores. The thing I enjoyed most about this job was that I got a chance to meet all kinds of people and kids, I fell in love when I see the faces of the children's facial expression when they entered  into the store they had this glow they were so happy ."
good,I was an HRDS and even though I was HR I was never budgeted for HR hours.  Full time did not mean 40 hours at my store.  It was anywhere from 31-36 hours a week.  Being that I wasn't budgeted for HR hours I spent 99.25% at the service desk as siting customers since we never had cashiers.  Hours were all over the place and the management was never on the same page.  Being HRDS all I did was recruit people via the hiring system...the rest of the tasks the store managers were too caught up to hand over. When interviewing people there was never another backup service desk or cashier so the management would frequently have to do interviews for tou. Employee turn over at my store last year was over 50%.  Benefits were bad.  I paid over 200 biweekly and still had a 12800 deductible to meet.  I had to leave after a few months because I couldn't live on that salary.  Fun place to work though but it was a negative work environment behind the scenes.
good,"Although the atmosphere was fast-paced, I enjoyed the time I was employed there. The compensation could've been more, but it was just a supplemental income for me, so I didn't stress too much."
good,The employees weren't helpful with training. They were very rude. The pay wasn't all that great either. I wouldn't recommend this job to a friend like I was. The managers weren't helpful when it came to problems in the workplace.
good,"Not a very comfortable place to work at but, the nice co-workers made it atleast alittle easier to deal with."
good,"Wasn't there long enough to place an opinion, but the work was easy, environment fast at times and relaxed at others.  Was treat with respect and with little supervision."
good,I worked at Toys r us as a teenager during the christmas holiday. For the most part the job was exciting and exhilarating. The downside of this job was short breaks and most days by the time you got from your section to the employee break area your break was almost over due to the massive crowds.  Also this particular Toys R us had a policy that if approached by a customer while on premises in uniform you must assist the customer even if you were on break on finished with your shift.
good,When I was employed at Toys R US. I was head cashier and I had People from fun. I lead in opening new accounts. I gave all the babies big hugs. People from all over the state of Alabama visited this Toys R Us. It was a beautiful store.
good,not enough pay couldn't pay the bills with how much it cost me in daycare just to go to work.   I liked the job but the hours did line up with the job.
good,Has fun work place events that allow employees to show off a little of their own personalities. That is the only time we can try and be ourselves while in our uniforms.
good,Lack of employee care and concern. Long days with minimum breaks. No breaks are preformed on time. Your first break will most likely be the last 15 minutes of your shift.
good,Had a fun experience working in toys r us even though it was a hectic time working through the holidays but I learned alot that I can use to further me in the future
good,This job was a holiday job for some extra cash. It was very hectic and crazy busy at times. I worked a lot of hours plus working another job and going to school. I only worked here because of all the good toys I got for my two kids.
good,"this is a great job for a college student or single parent. It worked for me while in school and after i had my son, its also a grea make to make new friends"
good,"co-workers and all of the staff ,any time i ever had any type of problem someone willing to help."
good,I learned alot I went from parttime in grandparaie tx at an express store.to full time and departments supervisor .and H.r. I enjoyed the employees and customer's.
good,Very unorganized work space from the start. The store itself was falling apart and needed some renavations. The work hours were poor and very unpredictable overall.
good,Overall it  was a ok place to work at. During the holidays its fast paced and easy going. The managers were helpful with hours and reasonable with personal day to day duties.
good,Toys R Us wasn’t such a bad place to work. Always required the workers to be moving at all times. We had thirty minute breaks which felt like 10 minutes.
good,"I worked seasonally and the manager spoke in a way where she'd try to joke in a very rude way. Other than the store manager the job was very slow and would get boring at times. The managers pressured cashiers to convince customers to get store credit cards and buy batteries. The managers made it clear to the seasonal people that would determine if they were hired after the holidays. The store did provide food and lots of snacks to the employees, the managers even had a room full of snacks for themselves."
good,"In the store I was working at, the managers prioritized their workers above the customers. So whenever a customer misplaced an item on a cheaper price tag and took a picture to try and get a discount. The manager would refuse and read to them what the price tag was for and that the item had been misplaced. "
good,The employees i worked with made my job fun. managers and the occasional nutso customer made the job hard. underpayed and esspecially for stock workers who work just as hard as managers with no appreciation.
good,It was a cool place when I worked there but considering the entire corporation went bankrupt there’s nothing else to be done. All the job opportunities from that place are gone now.
good,Only thing I liked about working there was days I could play with the toys when it was running slow. I would sit there playing Mario kart all day like I was 10
good,Sometimes I wasn't given lunch and i was never given normal breaks and at the time Iwas a minor which meant I was legally supposed to be give a break and a lunch. The managers weren't very nice to employees nor customers. I did have many very nice co-workers.
good,"It was borring, but easy . The people were great, the only reason i stuck around until the entire season was over was because the pay was amazing and got paid weekly"
good,This year they had great bonuses. However they promote terrible people to management. They threaten your job if you don't try hard enough to sell the credit card. No achknolagement of the workers that work hard and do their jobs. The management is truly a joke! Not paid enough for the work you do. Breaks are short 6 hours or more you get a 30 minute lunch. Less than that you get 15 minute break. If they remember to give it to you.
good,"A typical day at work would feel very rushed and you're under alot of pressure over the christmas period, issues are not dealt with correctly, the team are such lovely people and easy to get along with but management lack in communication and people skills."
good,"I was hired first as a cashier , I was asked to stay for over night shift and I liked that shift better . I unloaded trucks stocked items  , cashier ,customer service , sales associate ."
good,Working with different customers everyday was fun. Helping different kids and their parents was very  eventful and always a handful. Working at Toys R Us was a different experience.
good,a typical day was hustle but a good hustle.  saw and gave many smiling faces.  i learned how to better deal with the public at large.  i learned to have love and resect for Christmas as i witnessed gleaming eyes waiting on Santa Clause to arrive. management was very supportive to staff and children alike.  the work place culture was always welcoming. the hardest part of the job was running out of  a popular toy a child wanted for Christmas. the most enjoyable part of the job for me was the holiday season and making smiles and Christmas request come thru for a young lad
good,Unload truck & stock sales floor. In 4 hours 2 days a week. What more can be said for a cool lade back part time job. Not just for any body.
good,more training in merchandising skills travelling in other gcc country and a lot of fun opening a new toys r us store knowing a lot of new friends in other store build trust to the new hire staff and trained them which is a proud moment and learning a lot on hand with the visual team of toys r us
good,"Working at the customer service desk, I was held to a high standard since I was the first face customers saw. I was responsible for greeting and saying goodbye to any and all guests, basic housekeeping, pushing for rewards cards and store credit cards, handling returns and all phone calls."
good,I was pleased with everything about Toys R Us. The management was kind and nice. When there was an issue they worked hard to address it. And while it may have only been a seasonal position I would take the job again if it were offered to me. Would recommend this job if asked.
good,"on a scale 1-10 we stayed busy on and average day at a 6. the coworkers were very nice and helpful when you didn't understand how to properly do something and always took the time to show you how to do things correctly. the management on the other hand was very unprofessional. they would make promises they weren't able to keep such as hours weekly they claim they were going to give you or raise and never did. they would go over hours weekly when doing the schedule and because of that would have to take hours away in the middle of the week and even that exact date that you worked. I loved working with people face to face especially the different kids that would attend their parents in shopping. I also liked the free events we would host on the weekend, just because you got to actually interact with the kids that came in to attend the events."
good,I didnt like that the managers and supervisors were never on the same page
good,"I worked night crew. There is really no room for growth overnight. Only positions to aspire to are a supervisor position and 2 manager positions which are already filled. The job allows you to show responsibility for your department and overall gives management a clear sight to what kind of worker you are. I could really see myself working for the company again, just not as a night crew employee. I would like a position at corporate or other."
good,Fun workplace.  Management expected more than was necessary.
good,overall a good work place to work at if your starting and need a part time
good,"Go in at the beginning of shift, wait and ask what register I will be on, assist guests with purchases for the rest of my shift. I've learned time management and cash handling skills as well as great customer service. Depending on the day management can be the sweetest or most bitter people. All of my co-workers are great, some of them are just like family to me. Hardest part of the job is making sales and keeping metrics up. Most enjoyable would have to be seeing the satisfaction on the guests face!"
good,didnt really enjoy coming to work management was horrible very slow paced
good,"I feel I was unwanted at Toys R Us due to my spinal problems. I was not given the correct support or advice. I gave everything I had to this job, but felt my efforts were not noticed. I do not do things for reward or recognition, bet feel it would be nice to be given a thank you now and again. mI was operating a VNA forklift truck on a daily basis, filling the shelves with stock, Picking and replenishing the shelfs below. My manager was very unprofessional and did not talk or treat workers as individuals. My co workers were fantasic, offering my help and support when needed."
good,Overnight Overstock unloading of the store trucks and merchandise and unpaking of trucks
good,Not sure if it was just me but management was rude and at times unhelpful.  Employees played favorites and there were cliques.  Seemed like rushed work expectations and a lack of compensation for the stress.
good,I learned how to pick orders and how to operate a lift. I enjoyed working for this company and if they were still in business I would still be there. This was just a really fun place to work at.
good,"depending on thime time of year the day would be different , depending on the staff tge day would run different people would treat you differnt because of there frienship work groups"
good,I first started off as a seasonal cashier but as the season went on I got promoted to sales floor associate and customer service associate. They gave me a lot of hours during the holiday season but when the season was over I got 15 hours of work every two weeks. The pay was really good for a a young adult. It’s very chaotic but a fun environment to work in. The only negative thing is no benefits and poor management but it was so much fun
good,As a Company TRU was not bad to work for. The problems all start at store level with the people they put in charge. Some not all have no clue. But this is all for moot since TRU is OUT OF BUSINESS
good,I was hired as a seasonal worker and kept on after. It's an easy job even though they expect you to ask every customer to apply for an in store credit card which can get annoying quickly.
good,"It's an okay place to work. I liked working for the company, but I never enjoyed Christmas because you are always working. I think the managers at this store ran more people off then they helped promote."
good,I usually help organize and help clients and it was really fun. The only thing I did not like was how some of the managers where handling the hectic Christmas season. One of them was screaming at employees for no reason.
good,I enjoyed the environment and being able to help bring smiles to kid's faces and learning a little bit more about being part of such a big important business.
good,My review on Toys r Us would be a good review. Everyone you meet is so nice and friendly. The job is easy once you learn the basics it will come easy.
good,"My opinion is slightly biased. It's been a long time since i worked here, so am not too sure what it's like anymore. Generally it wasn't too bad, but odd occasion you could end up being late leave, after your hours."
good,I'm a hard worker I do my best at what I do and when needed I come to work on time come in on my day off if needed and we'll to work overtime when needed also
good,"Working at toy r us is ok, fun environment, first dibs on the new toys. I learned about up selling. I would recommend if your looking for a seasonal or part time job"
good,"Every day my job is to make sure customers are satisfied and keep them coming back. Also cleaning, stocking and filling my assigned area of management."
good,"Good People, Nice place to work, just not a career, worked before finding my first job out of college. I liked where I worked it just was not a career"
good,"My work day consists of carrying boxes and conversing with customers and ascertaining their needs and wants. The managers are active and manage the priorities for the day. The best part of the job is the co-workers; everyone is friendly and we all get along well. The worst part of the job is when there is only one person on the sales floor, tending to the entire stores needs."
good,"great customers can make any day better. Benefits include insurance, paid vacation, and discounts on our benefits website"
good,"Looked at my emails and responded, Checked in house system for any artworks that are uploaded to system. Reviewed artworks for English copy and brand style. Chased relevant teams to find out what the delay was as we needed to meet ship dates. Management based in US and I was supervisor for 3 people so enjoyed just getting on with things.  Co workers were OK but other departments I sat near were really friendly and I had good banter with them. No hard parts in the job but there were frustrating times as manager based in US and sometimes not able to get response as quickly as I required or not informed of things. I've really enjoyed working here and if I wasn't being made redundant then I would still be here."
good,"enjoyable to work at toys r us but  there's so many children you have to watch as you work so they can be safe, therefore its also a hassle."
good,A Great company with excellent merchandise.  Holiday hours were crazy but customer interaction was a good diversion from merchandising.
good,I had a lot of fun working here. always something to do or someone to help. i was always learning new things. i started out as a just being a cashier but was thought how to do returns quickly and as well as how to locate items in back of house. i wish i would've been kept on after the holidy season was over though.
good,"Working for the ""R Us"" family requires it's employees to wear many hats. Part time employees may not receive the benefits of full time employees but you will have as many responsibilities. "
good,would never work here again . ran very unorganized and management is constantly changing.
good,It was the worst job it has to offer. No team work. No Self Advancement.
good,i work at babies r us and its just not a place to advance for a career.
good,id wake up go to work scan items to let the store know what we have in the back then go to a computer and find out what we needed on the floor
good,"I have only worked for the company for a short time, since August. I have found out some distasteful things in the time since I have started in my position."
good,"I enjoyed my working experience with the company,consistant hard work"
good,Hard working and fast.hepling co workers amking sure all work is done and perfect.
good,"It was a Great Experience working for a couple of years, They introduces new management, which were Non professional with Coworker."
good,"They dont give you hours fairly, lots of favouritism. No appreciation for the good job done. too much gossiping at this location but it was fun if we ignore all the about mentioned issues."
good,"I was just a cashier and floor associate, but it was nice to work where I did. The people were nice, the job wasn't TOO stressful, even during the holiday season, which was helped by my coworkers, and I took personal pleasure in putting things back where they belonged, as well as helping parents and kids find toys and whatever else they were looking for."
good,"I love working with all the toys and straightening up the isles. Helping clueless grandparents, aunts and uncles find the perfect toy for a loved one. The problem was that more often then not it was so slow i never even logged on to a register, and then days i never left the customer service desk."
good,Toys’R’us as a business was a good concept but the people running the business on the ground really let the whole corporation down in my opinion it would have been better if they had a multicultural scene running the store
good,My typical day at work was boring always wanted to go home when i started my day at work and i learned that my job was always busy and management was poor and the workplace staff was always lazy and the hardest part of the job was cleaning every alse and then the aisle was dirty with toys again and there was nothing enjoyable of the job
good,"A typical day will involve emptying the delivery lorry, replenishing the stock on the shelves and being visible to customers on the shop floor for any assistance they may require."
good,"Buen ambiente de trabajo, organización y trato al público"
good,"Not sure why I'm reviewing since this place is out of business but here is is! Don't work here, they don't have any jobs left since they're out of business. Did I mention they're out of business?"
good,"Paid less than usual,never paid on time always late paycheck. All co workers rude and disrespectful to me and customers. Mangers did nothing to help when customers wanted to return or exchange an item."
good,"Everyone was very kind and respectful towards each other, and we all got along well. They did overwork me, especially during December (I was seasonal, but I put down that I could only work 15-20 hours, and they gave me much more than that)"
good,Fun energetic place especially if you like toys. The workers are freindly which makes the work environment great.Unloading trucks is bad cause there is no fan which makes it hot
good,"I worked for TRU for 4.5 to 5 years. And in that time, I learned so much and bonded with so many amazing people. I enjoyed the good and bad times. Great company"
good,"working at a toy store is fun, however there is a lot to do behind the scenes. Stores need to always organized, employees need to be able to multitask, be knowledgeable  of products, solve problems, deal with difficult customers, being able to prevent theft and provided customer service in person and on the phone."
good,"mucho customer service y paciencia, aprender de gente con mas experiencia en el mercado."
good,Working at Toys R Us has been difficult for the last few years it has little pay and no benefits. The subculture around the place is toxic. They are filing for bankruptcy right now. I did enjoy some of my time spent there and I learned a lot
good,Fast pace work environment and lots of lifting. I enjoy picking and shipping all kinds of toys to customers. During Christmas it felt like the north pole.
good,"Personally I love the actual work I was doing at ToysRUs. However the people who work there are young teenagers for the most part who only care about their check. They are not focused on providing excellent customer service and usually have to be forced to even help a customer. Most of the time they are standing around the store in their little cliques talking to each other instead of asking customers if they need help. Also the fact the that company is very pushy to their employees about getting customers to sign up for their credit card, loyalty or purchase a protection plan is ridiculous. Yes, these items to have their occasional benefits but their programs are flawed. The fact employees get talked down on by managers because of their lack to persuade customers into getting the programs is insane. Many of the associates who fail to ""sell"" these programs are actually quite amazing when it comes to customer service. Also the company spends to much money on in store advertising that usually goes unnoticed or just gets thrown away without a second look. There are many ways the company could easily cut back on spending in order to pay their employees better. In many cases companies who pay their employees better usually get more productivity out of them."
good,"My overall experienced is a mixed one. I seen multiple managers come and go. First day i was there the manager himself quit with no notice. The work environment was fine until the most recent manager was hired in which  costed very very low staff and we lost over half of the staff and we had trouble maintaining staff ever since due to the way the managers treated us.  so the past 3 years of my work life was harsh. They dont communicate correctly and always always go against you. They never listen and do not appreciate you.. The list goes on and on. "
good,"Although management was quite unorganized, work environment and coworkers were great to be around. Learned stability when it came to impatient customers and how to bring sales up."
good,"The type of product youre selling is always a bonus and the staff are always bubbly and fun."
good,"Your co workers are friendly, the management was understanding and it was a pretty calm environment overall. I was in a seasonal position, so I was not expecting to stay on past Christmas, but there is that option for some,"
good,At first the hardest part of the job was merchandising and learning where items belong. the most enjoyable part of the job was communicating with the customers in their need of assistance
good,Used stand up forklift to remove pallets from trucks. Scanned items coming off the trucks and took them to proper dock area.Learned how to use scanners and stand up forklift.All of the employees were friendly we all communicated with each other.
good,It's all fun at first when you join during season but then they fire everyone after christmas and keep 5 of us they wanted and expect us to know everything already so we basically have to learn everything on our own. They are very laid back I enjoy working there the downside is getting paid every other week. Also if you do not like star wars or pokémon do not apply.
good,"Working for Babies R Us was really enjoyable for the most part. The main concern and issue that I had while working there was the scheduling. Requesting for days off was really hard to do with one particular manager, and I had some really important days that I needed off and that I couldn't get off. other than that my experience working there was thoroughly enjoyable."
good,"The job was fun for me, I enjoyed my work. But realistically new managers came and store policy changed, and this led to a flighty work schedule and low compensation for all your hard work. The company is obsessed with credit card signups and payroll. They cut everyone's hours at the last minute, then change their minds and demand you come in minutes before your shift was supposed to start, and get upset because you couldn't make it on short notice."
good,Working at a toy store can have its moments where it can be fun. Doing demos for new toys or having events for kids is amazing to do because seeing the kids have a great time is gives you life. The hours can be long especially due the holiday season. There can be really late nights.
good,great place to work part time if in need of job and currently in school. not great pay and no benefits unless moved up within the company or promoted.
good,"The job started out great, but as the holiday season ended they cut hours and the way the management team deliberated task was not according to what was earned but, who you kissed up to."
good,Great fun place to work hard and keep busy and have a good time. as is with everywhere there are always bad eggs in the bunch so besides that it was a blast. one of the best jobs i ever had. just needs to care more about the workers in some aspects. no biggie.
good,Toys r us was a job id recommend to teenagers coming out of high school as a stepping stone to gain experience. It was a great experience but did lack the right people to fill management positions therefore it made certain aspects difficult.
good,I learned a lot about customer service and retail. especially how to interact with customers and get positive reactions from them. I also learned how to work a cash register here and how to do returns .
good,I worked for this company a very long time for the most part I loved my job wasn't until my 21st year I began to have a problem with changes...But I have very good memories of the company.
good,Love the job  love the customers. Management sucks. a typical day is you have to ask each  customer to sign up for  credit card as well as for protection plans
good,"Toys R Us is good company to work for because they are easy access to Public Transportation. The workload is easy , light lifting to deal with everytime and good workplace."
good,"I had this job as a teenager, it served its purpose. I am neutral about this company. The job was not too demanding ir exciting."
good,Toys R Us taught me the basics of sales and retail. I learned a lot from working there. The management and co-workers were great and were really friendly.
good,"Customers were happy to be at toys are us children were often very excited to be in the store.  I could direct customers to needed location in store and almost always could suggest additional sales to complete the experience for the customer."
good,"I love working for this company but the Store Manager doesn't seem to really want to be there. He always talks about numbers not about us, or gives out compliments very much(hardly ever). I love working with my co-workers though they make the time go by so much faster. I don't hang with anyone outside of work but if customers see us having a good time they sometimes even join in on the conversation. Customers have always came first in the job which is great and how it should be sometimes people don't understand that very well. The hardest part of the job is trying to find something that we don't carry or that we haven't carried in a very long time. For example bed rails for a toddler bed especially when the crib has gone out of style, but we try our hardest to find one that will go with their crib. I have learned a lot from this company. They care about their customers more than most would. The best part of working for this company is seeing the kids leave happy and excited about what they got. Parents are happy too because we found exactly what they wanted."
good,"fun and active environment"
good,"Nice working environment,friendly co-workers, do your very best to please every customer, the mangers and supervisors also do there best to please customer as well the employees, from what i've learned even though you deal with crazy, hectic, unwelcome customers you just have to try not to let them make you lose your patience"
good,"I am still currently working here and for the most part the workplace was nice. I am looking for another job mainly because this job does not pertain to my major. I have learned a lot of good skills from this job. I learned a lot about a cash register and also a lot of communication skills. "
good,"Everyday there was some type of emergency because of lack of accountability which put you in a position of urgency the minute you walked in the door. I learned a lot based off this type of work ethic. It made me a stronger employee and person. My manager was very good to work with, but my director was a monster! My co-workers were very helpful and fun to be around which made the day easier to get through."
good,Not a bad business but with every business it is very sales driven and do not really care about their customers. Only care about the numbers.
good,"Aprendí a trabajar sobre compras industriales, aunque el aprendizaje fue difícil ya que no dejan que subas de puesto.."
good,I love toys and this job was one that I could explore all the new toys that came out. Only to better supply the consumer with a need for a product.
good,"Management was not very helpful at times."
good,"Customer Service, returns, answering phone call. Great place to work, friendly and well managed."
good,"The management was ok, not the best. My co workers were really nice people. I learned how to supervise others and how to problem solve."
good,"As a sales associate a typical day would be assisting customers, stocking floors, sales, and organizing products. Management meet staff’s needs, and the staff was grateful for their needs being meet. The hardest part of the job was becoming familiar with the store layouts but after training it became second nature."
good,"Would've like to work more. I did shipping, from store to home. The management were good people. T he workers i worked with were helpful and nice. The hardest part was learn where product was. Finding something and seeing the smile on the customers face."
good,fast pace working...with an easy going work eniviroment
good,"A normal day at work is filled with smiles and laughter. Always when i came to work, i had a smile on my face. Really didn't learn anything, because i was already a cheerful person. I made a couple new friends that i talk to and hang with outside of work. The hardest part of my job was, when it got really crowed, it was kind of stressful, but everyone cooperated very nicely. The most enjoyable part of the job was playing with the toys, and satisfying the customers."
good,come to work go to the back room pick a few items off the shelevs bring down too the floor. replinish the floor build a few bikes. also help customers to the cars with the bigger toys to there car
good,"Days a very busy working between helping guests locate items in the store, explaining details & answering questions, looking up products or info on store computers, asking each & every guests if help is needed, giving info on all store return policies, warranties, & promoting store credit card & asking all guests for donations for charities."
good,"My review of this company, was I love the interaction with the people. I had to help solve customers issue and make sure they had the best shopping experience while shopping ar our store. Although our mangement team was failing the store as a whole, me and my coworkers maintain a happy moral for the store."
good,"Standing on your feet for more then 8 hours a day with one break and no lunch. my longest day was working 12 hour shift and no lunch standing on my feet all day, back hurt, legs, feet. I was not very happy and neither was my mother at the time. so i didnt go back to work when they asked if i could work the next year"
good,Love that I worked at night we I can really see of many different toys there are in this world.Its amazing.My manager wasnt such a good one but we made it threw.Unloading 350 boxes was the hardest part but I enjoyed stocking them.
good,"Great place, worked there for a year, only problem I really had was the hours fluctuate, you can start at 8 hrs one week, drop to 4, then get 12 another week. But when seasonal work comes around you can even end up getting 40 hrs but that's only during Christmas time."
good,I love working in this store it is fast pace enviroment especially working customer service. We only get raises once a year and all team members get along and help each other out that makes me look foward to working because everyone gets there job done right and fast.
good,Insight into a parent's need to safisfy a child's need to have an expensive toy.
good,Have you ever seen the movie Big? I got to play with Toys and meet some great people!
good,The job was honestly the best I've ever had personally. The pay could have been better but overtime and holiday pay was handed out like candy. Management treated the staff well
good,"Staffing was good, just poor management, looking to give warnings for any silly thing. Very strict and mistakes are punishable even if you've never been trained for that"
good,Willing to work with your availability. Also willing to help you with anything  you need. Co-workers willing to help each other and very friendly. Great job to get cashier experience.
good,the job in itself was great the politics made it hard to stay positive. i loved my customers and meeting new people. unfortunately the managers did not always respect they employees.
good,i work hard based on how company and agency treat me i can manage selling item by talking smoothly and meaningfully to our valid customer by building more confidence i will sales talk more customer
good,"working with team member's was a blast, but the night manager could be rude and talked down a lot. little support often asked to work overtime to help day time crew without extra breaks."
good,"typical day at work is serving customers needs and filling shelves"
good,It was a great entry level position for a newly graduated high school student. The compensation honestly wasn't great for the amount of work that was expected. But it was a fun environment to work in. But unfortunately the company went under.
good,This job was a part time job to have my senior year of high school. something to put a little cash in my pocket and help my mom out as best as i could
good,working overnight was a fun experience I learned a lot about organization. typical work day is fast moving with a lot of energy. The hardest part of work was unloading the truck in timely manner.
good,"The pay was minimal no room to advance my carrer there just got sick of being broke and dont need to be working 12 hours a week, i was just there temporarily"
good,it was very face paced during the holiday season so they gave pretty decent hours but pay was low. definitely not enough to live off. I liked working for the company but I needed something more to support a family.
good,"Seasonal  stock  clerk,  very busy  but  had  good management  leading  the  operation.   The  hardest  part  of  the  job  was  lack  of  time  and  co-workers  not  reporting  for  work."
good,"A good place to work.  Learned on job to check inventory and to stock merchandise.  Also worked as Cashier when needed.  Hardest part of job was the holidays, when stores were busy.  "
good,The store was understaffed all the time except during seasonal time. Most management left for better opportunity leaving a lot of management positions up for grabs.
good,"The people were decent, the job was OK, but at the end of the day, I didn't want to come back. I would come in the morning, clean the bathrooms, the floors, do the trash, the parking lot, I didn't really learn much. I can't think of anything off of the top of my head. The hardest part of the job was picking up trash in the parking lot in 90 degree weather. The most enjoyable part was helping customers when I would finish my main tasks ahead of time."
good,toysrus was a great place to work at but wasn't a career choice for me. a typical day at toysrus was that it was really slow and no one came it its best to work there around christmas and black friday
good,Investors drove the company to bankruptcy and they are now bailing at no penalty.  A shame for all the hard working Team members and field leaders who worked relentlessly to save the company.
good,I would come in clear any hazards from isles restock merchandise and get on my register occasionally assisted customers in gift purchase we also had days where we had themes so we could dress up with the kids
good,"This company  was a great place to work, the company had limited job growth. The co workers and manager/lead employees are very  helpful at all. The job itself is very easy but the hours are not guaranteed."
good,I worked for Toys R Us for 32 years I learned How to focus on the big picture and to use all of my knowledge to train other employee's to work efficiently to complete company initiatives. The hardest part of my job will be leaving it.
good,"Toys 'R'Us was enjoyable while i was there.I was hired during the holiday season 2015. We had freedom to stock whatever toys we wanted to, so long as we were actually doing it, and everything was done at the end of our shifts. Rip ;-;"
good,"Working at toys r us is a fast paced, but fun environment. It was intended for kids of all ages, and now it is all coming to an end. An end I deeply regret."
good,"First off, I worked for a Toys R Us Express and it was kind of a shock to me, considering I had never heard of Toys R Us Express before. "
good,They were a great company to work for. But with the bankruptcy and closing they wasn't planning or helping anything. And the CEO and the benefits were a joke. There wasn't benefits and the CEO wasn't looking into helping the company.
good,Very manageable environment with good pay. Develop a productive team and store will run very well throughout the year. Develop good leaders to help you achieve goals.
good,this was one of the few jobs i really enjoyed. We were a family. It was a fun time.At times it was stressful but we always made it through. i became very  cross trained in almost every department in our store.
good,Management is okay. The job was bearable because of fellow coworkers. Not a very difficult job. Definitely would recommend to someone who needs their first job.
good,"This job is for a young working trying to get into the working force. Not too many hours, good for students. Not a hard job but the sales they had to put on customers doesn't make the job fun."
good,"This is a fun environment. Management is always willing to help associates with any problems that may arise with customers. Although, having to climb tall ladders holding heavy boxes full of heavy toys to put on the top of the shelves for overstock  is not the safest thing to do for everyone."
good,"During the season times it can be overwhelming if you're already not accustomed to it. Co workers are awesome, management is very strict. Fun environment."
good,"Creat magic Toys R Us is a magical place for children of all ages "
good,Working in the electronics department allowed meto keep up with all the new games and hardware being released. It was an over all fun place to work as long as you did your job and werent on any bad terms with other employees or management
good,"A typical day at Toys R Us was keeping inventory up to date, and  being a cashier. Providing customer service and being a team player. I learned how to multitask and do inventory. The workplace was hectic at times, but we did what we had to. I enjoyed doing an overnight shift for the holidays."
good,i had a nice time working there. friendly environment. i learned how to use the cashier register and how to speak up when i needed help. I liked how after evey credit card you sell you get an extra dollar on that monthly pay check
good,I work stock and shipment. I love it! not too much interaction with customers. The job may require a lot of work on certain days but nothing too stressful.
good,"Being an employee at Toys R Us is a great experience because it’s such a fun but productive workplace. It’s defintely a good “first job” experience. Like any job, customer satisfaction may be difficult but not impossible. I started when I was 16 years old and it gave me a view of how the real world is but now I’m looking to move on and start the early stages of my career."
good,"A typical day would consist of greeting customers, answering phone calls and straightening the store. It would get stressful at points when managers would tell employees to do different things and have a conflict over the tasks"
good,"The people who work for TRU make the company what it is, the high up management are clueless as to what actually happens or needs to happen out on the shop floor."
good,i liked this job i learned a lot. I started out as part time and advanced to learning to do almost everything around the store dealing with merchandise. positive energy in store somedays. I would've stayed if the managers didn't have drama going on.
good,"The only real issues I had was one colleague is rude and condescending."
good,"Seasonal was not fun. I was told I would be kept, but when the time came they didn't keep me. They kept people that weren't as hard working as myself."
good,"throughout a typical day, I would deal with customer queries, returns and complaints at our customer services. On other days I may be handling the click and collect status, ensuring each product form orders is picked from the shop floor and located accordingly, ready for customer collection."
good,"It was fun working there, I've never seen so many variety of toys before. Working there gave me the opportunity to pick some toys for my sons and grandchildren"
good,"Very easy, very easy and the people are nice. They should just be a little bit more sure about the people they hire. Mc Donalds is mostly open if you forget to bring lunch."
good,Never a bad day enjoyed helping customers with there Christmas shopping. I liked getting to know the different people i worked with and showing the youngsters up getting done before them.
good,"Very busy store, especially during the holidays. Usually worked 40 hrs a week until the holiday season then it was 55+ hours a week. Black Friday was mandatory to work and was usually a 13+ hour shift."
good,Its an alright job for students. Definitely not a career based job. Not a lot of opportunities of advancements. During the holidays expect some overtime but outside of that don't expect many hours.
good,During the time I worked at ToysRus I experienced great ways to improve my social skills with not only children but other customers and my co-workers as well. Not only was it very beneficial to gain confidence with any retail sale but to also understand the consumers point if view. To always be treated with respect.
good,I was comfortable working at Toys'R'Us. I rarely encountered any problems that needed to be fixed. I learned how to use a cashier and the team members even opened up a bank for me.Work was incredibly easy and had no trouble getting my work done.
good,"A typical day a work was you clocked in, went to see what register you were signed too, count your draw and start ringing customers up. I already was a cashier so I knew how to use the register. I enjoyed when the holidays were approaching and the parents can in to shop. It was the best time of the year.. v"
good,"Very fast paced environment which I, love, help time go by faster. Loved   working with customer who where shopping during Christmas holiday.  Personnel was professinal and coworker were pleasant."
good,"worked my way up from a Christmas temp to Key holding supervisor"
good,"There are different departments in which to work and at the time associates were rotated every so often to get a feel of the store as whole. You would be surprised at all that has to happen operationally in a toy store. There of course is the x-mas season to contend with, but believe it or not it can be pretty steady throughout the year. Allin all not a bad place to work at."
good,Good work/life balance.  People are excellent but there is no room for advancement.  Lower Level employees are seldom acknowledged when they take on high level job functions.
good,"This was simple work but you're on your feet the whole time. Getting the hang of registers took a little while but managers were always around to assist. Crew were all nice, even getting together for meals after shift. Managers trusted me to supervise registers and schedule cashiers' breaks after only a few months."
good,Fun place to work. Friendly environment. People are great to work with. One thing I don't like about the job is you never really leave on time. I seem to leave about 15 minutes late every shift. But on the upside u get paid for every minute there.
good,"When working here I've learned new things and already was familiar with some aspects. I will admit the hours are not too great, due to the fact it is not busy enough. So it became diffcult to manage my daily life."
good,"You never know what your day would be like working here. Kids being kids and adults being kids. Another cool thing about it is there would be contests, events for kids and giveaways."
good,"Job Work/Life Balance is almost nonexistent, especially around the Holidays. It seems like there is great opportunity for growth and advancement but its not actually the case."
good,I loved working at ToysRUs depending who was management. If the managers are on point the store works gracefully if management was poor the store falls apart almost immediately. the pay is cool depending on how long you were there or the district and vacation time and paid time off helps (worked for 7 years)
good,"I would come into work on time and clock in. I would wait for the manager to tell our team what needs to be done tonight. I would unload inventory for approximately 2 hours and then unpack boxes to stock the shelves. Also, remove any cardboard off the sales floors and keep it clean and organized."
good,I enjoyed working here during the holiday season. It was fun working with some of the others and had a blast. Some of the management didn't seem to know how to make up their minds changing this alot but all in all was an easy job.
good,A typical work day as a seasonal cashier was to be on call for when you are needed. Greet customers with friendly demeanor and respect. Attend to the customers questions and/or concerns while also ringing up the items being purchased in a timely manner.
good,A day at work could range from serving customers at the checkouts all day to running the customers service desk and tidying shelves. While there I learned how to better deal with customers as I had previously little experience of this.
good,"This job will keep you busy; there are tons of hours available upon request. However a good playlist is recommended, you'll get more work done by sticking to yourself."
good,"The overall environment is relaxed but busy. I love it. However, there is a lack of discipline towards our problem employees. "
good,"I'm only a part time seasonal worker here, but I've had an entire shift cut when I really needed it. I work with a great team, but sometimes feel belittled by managers for things I have no control over. I don't hate it, quite the opposite, it just isn't that great of a fit for me, mainly because of distance and I'm not sure at times if I will even be working when they say I will."
good,Working at this job is definitely a great way to help you with being the greatest customer service rep known to man. It is a wonderful place around the holidays. The front end team and backroom team are great. Team work is a major part of making that place a success.
good,"Direct management usually awesome"
good,"The management team was okay. Two of the managers were irresponsible, Unethical, rude and didn't care about the team members nor customers. My co-workers and I all got along, we worked together and helped each other whenever we could and knew what we were doing. The most enjoyable part of my day was when I was able to provide the best customer service possible to help children and their parents find the best gift possible. The hardest part of my day was dealing with the unorganized management team."
good,The job is very easy and fun. And you always have toys for the kids. Oh black Friday is off the chain. You also meet cool people.
good,Company is fun to work at and holds great experience for young workers. Uplifting to be surrounded by children and exciting co-workers.
good,"I enjoyed working for Toys R Us, it was a fast pace busy environment."
good,You start off getting knowledge of all the product.Its a very fast paced around the holiday time and the month that follows
good,"its a good job but the seasonal part sucks, people are friendly, customers are snobs and act like children more then the children them selfs do"
good,"i enjoyed working at ToysRus because its the only job where you can get paid to bring out the kid in you. we've all had those days where we feel like the adult world can be a bit overwhelming. well, this is the job for you if you need a break from it."
good,i liked working with the company i liked how well the team members got along i liked how nice the customers where when i first started they where very patient with me
good,at my current job i'm a stocker. i offload the trucks life heavy merchandise and pack it on the pallets and u-boats to send them upstairs. i also spot the freight in its designated spot to pack out and fill the store.
good,"Co-Workers are great, and i have learned a great deal from my time there. They do work with you on scheduling to fit a 2nd job or school."
good,Enjoyable atmosphere. Friendly staff. Policies not always followed. Managers didn't back up the policies that are stated when employee reiterates them to customer. Not enough hours to finish work that had been un done by previous shift.
good,Very beneficial work environment where I learned many necessary work and business skills.I learned a wide variety of skills and positions.
good,"I really enjoy working for this company, I think that Toy r rus sell the best toys for children all over the world"
good,IT always felt like xmas. My team was great especially when we all pulled it together in the midst of demanding parents and children. We litterally felt like growns kids in a toystore. it was magical almost.
good,Payroll is what it is all about however culture is consistently changing and it is up to the stores to make sure they are able to keep up with the guests
good,"Some of management wasn't up to par with what was needed to be done, and the work place was not in order."
good,"With a low pay structure for internal hires, this is not a place for one who needs to completely support his/her family with a position with this company.  Wonderful experience for a young adult but not good for a more mature individual."
good,"This was my first job, and because of the great company and the great people I worked with I stayed for 10 years."
good,"You work around a bunch of toys, games and fun things, how cant this be a good time."
good,"A typical work day for me would be to go in at approximately 8:00 AM and open the store for 9:00 AM. I learned how to locate everything in the store. My co-workers were great people, they were always very punctual and responsible. The hardest part of the job was re-shop. The most enjoyable part of the job, for me, would be working on the register."
good,"El trabajo que desempeñamos consiste fundamentalmente en vender, pero es necesario ser conscientes de que estamos de cara al público, debemos hacer de nuestra venta un servicio correcto y adecuado al cliente, a fin de que la sensación del mismo una vez que abandone el establecimiento esté enfocada al buen hacer y correcta atención que ha recibido."
good,"moved trailers around, opened trailer doors,set up trailers for shipping to pull and replace"
good,the most enjoyable part of the job was meeting goals set by management and being cheered on and praised for doing so. I learned the true meaning of teamwork and guest satisfaction.
good,Toys R us is a great first time job for anyone starting to go into  the work force. I learned a lot about customer service.
good,"Working in this Company help me build my confidence, and also help me with my customer service skills."
good,a good company to work for i learned how to drive a turret truck and fulfill supply for the where house.
good,Coming into work was always a fun experience and there was always work to be done. The only negative is the low pay rate/raises and very low opportunities for advancement.
good,I enjoyed working here during the holidays. Good for a high school student gaining experience in retail and dealing with soccer moms.
good,Overall a good experience to work there.  I was a temporary seasonal employee and was offered more hours.  The layaway system was a mess and resulted in frustrated customers at the service desk.  Other employees were easy to work with.  The management system of hollering at the 'back of house' to get things done is not productive.
good,Always trying to help a guest find what they are looking for. Always smile. Its great to have a great team to work together with. Seeing happy kids.
good,only seasonal not my idea of a good growing company. I don't have many good things to say about toys r us or babies r us..
good,"This employer is a nice, fun place to work however, I have felt no opportunity to grow with the company."
good,I started out as a par-time cashier while in high school and once graduated I was giving full-time. I was promoted to inventory manager and would have to clock in two hours before the store open and check the whole store inventory and make sure all numbers were correct
good,"you punch in, meet with the crew. The manager explains what your are going to do for the night. What ever the manager told you to do task wise you would do it. I learned how to scan items into the stores system change prices, set up display."
good,"benefits OK, not a lot of hours management nice, team work, friendly "
good,This was my first job. It was a lot of fun and really taught me a lot about customer service.
good,good people with spotty management.  Great staff. very difficult to learn about new products.
good,"Opened boxes and threw them up on the shelf.  Pretty simple stuff, managers were laid back.  I worked on the third shift stock crew during holiday help."
good,just waiting to move on. no room to move forward. not fair when positions open.
good,"were having a great experience,we alot more on store and help to one another."
good,"My day by day would be merchandise stocking, inventory management and keeping up with all the promotional items."
good,fine. just needed more organization in the management staff..Fun environment.. Nice co workers
good,When I got to work I would clock in (Recieving) i would Grab an RF gun and get a packet with all my skins and po numbers on it. Then from there i would go to my truck and unload it with a forklift or by hand depending on the truck. Now If i clocked in and had to go to Storage I would have to clock in go get an RF gun then go put a Harness on and go run the 1-5 levels of Carton Flow. For CDC i would clock in and go to a conveyor belt and case pick items into boxes.
good,"This is a relatively good place to work with good hard working people. My day consists of checking email for any questions from other Personal Registry Advisers, having one on one appointments with new moms, setting up baby registries and helping guests find items on moms list. I have learned patience and understanding at this job because many people are uniformed about new standards with safety features on different baby products. I have also improved my customer service skills by constantly helping people all day. Management is easy to talk to and if you need them for customers they are usually quick to respond unless it is a busy day. They treat workers fairly and listen to complaints. My co-workers are team players, they are always trying to help each other out no matter if it is in their area or not they are team players. The hardest part of the job I would have to say is not having a set schedule, and being under staffed during busy hours. It puts a lot of pressure on the team members, especially when it is busy and there is only one team member on the floor. I think the most enjoyable part of working here is the people. They are friendly and it is like a family there at TRU."
good,Cleaned and Buffed Floors To Make Them Look New. Worked Through Temporary Service And Was Top Guy.
good,A typical day at work is bringing out your inner child and playing with toys. I loved most of my coworkers. Management however was not very good.
good,"No communication within the management and employees, you always seem to feel like an ""outsider"" but its a good seasonal job if you need quick cash."
good,Did my job and left. Management could have been better.. Could leave during day to get lunch but night shift was locked in and couldn't leave til morning crew got there. No place to smoke for the smokers either.
good,This job was self employment. I had some tools to do lawn so I decided to go out and make some money on my own while waiting on a job to call me back.
good,"A lot of work overnight and fun with employees, but management does not care about your personal life."
good,clean trucks and get the floor ready to open
good,typical day at is going around the store and making sure its clean for the customers. unlodaing trucks and making sure everything is put away at their location.
good,This job consisted of me working on the sales floor during the day and as time passed I eventually worked their 3rd shift stocking position. I would assist in th use of the computerized equipment for stock inventory and label printing. As well as help with truck deliveries and stocking shelves during the night shift.
good,The company was great to work for. The customers were very greatful that we were there. I had a good staff to work with.
good,Retail enviorment that requires customer service and stocking of shelves
good,Excellent to work for but at the time I was only a seaonsal employee.
good,Be ready to stand on your feet for long periods of time. Requires a lot of talking and making sure the customers had a fun shopping experience while at the store.
good,I picked things up and put things down for the most part. I didn’t have much interaction with the management team. I kinda just laid low. Pretty fun to build some of the displays.
good,"It was a fun, but super intense place to work. The place just came back from being under for over a year. New heads are in charge, so I can't speak to that. Miss it every day, though."
good,I had a seasonal position and started out cashiering then doing what I called inventory on the floor while also helping customers. Very crowded during November/December months.
good,"A typical day would be coming in and then looking around the aisles and shelves making sure everything is clean and organized. At the same time, watching over the front and making sure to greet customers and ring them up."
good,"the store is defunct now, but the HR rep at my store gave confusing instructions and intimidated me into not being able to do aspects of my job correctly"
good,Didnt really understand the new management that took over. Got along best with management that hired but when knew one took over cut my hrs back and didnt allow  me responsibilities that previous manager did
good,Fun place to work when there was enough staffing. Learned many different skills. Best part was the events and team members. Sad the company closed down.
good,It was a good place to work while it was open. The team was great to work with. We did a lot of good things for the customers. It was a sad day for us when we had to close the doors.
good,"It was a great working environment, where management knew how to utilize and use their employees effectively. The working culture was adaptable and easy. The breaks were fairly and adequately scheduled. For those reason, Toys R Us had quite an enjoyable atmosphere to work at and be part of the team."
good,"I would go clock in first , than I would walk to the front and ask what they needed for me to do for that day ."
good,I loved working with my co workers.  We normally all worked together to get our shift done and try make the customers as happy as possible.  I loved working there because of the small kids that would come in and just be super excited.
good,"They were a good company but they aren't around anymore to really put a review on them. It was a good very first job, they gave me a chance and I appreciate them for that."
good,Toys r us was one of my favorite jobs because my managers and team members were very great people. The minimum wage provided was not nearly enough to live on however. It was doable as a part time job while I was in college.
good,"Mainly stocking shelves and working with customers around the store for any help they might've needed. We always put the customers first, but cashier work was always a great experience boost because you get to bond with customers at the same time."
good,"Typical day starts out pretty slow then picks up around noonish until around closing time. For the most part, work environment was nice until the last couple of weeks that the store was opened."
good,"fun, fast paced place of employment."
good,"The company gave you the opportunity for advancement if desired. Like most retail companies hours were not conducive to life outside of working. However, with sufficient time you were able to request time off."
good,"A typical workday was relaxed, and when tasks were simple. Customers were always interesting and great to help. Management was terrible due to the the Store Manager's inability to properly manage their managers, and they would ignore complaints. Hardest part of the job was the fluctuating schedule. Most enjoyable was the coworkers, they were the best part of the job."
good,"it was a very good experience, i really enjoyed the time i was there . it was a great opportunity to work at a professional company that was admired by many."
good,"Typically was at customer service, dealt with a lot of difficult guest. I learned how to keep calm in difficult situations, speak loud but clear, and knowing the right moment to get manager involved. Management for the most part was easy to communicate with, very understanding, but on the other hand some were too irrational. Would handle customer complaints poorly in front of customer.The work place was stressful but at the same time a fun place to work. The hardest part and most enjoyable would go hand and hand, dealing with difficult customers but rewarding when issues were resolved."
good,Great place for people who loves kids to work at. Very organized instructions. Managers and co-workers  we're really helpful. Grew so close to everyone I was sad to leave the team.
good,i had fun working a toy r us i had learned how to have patience with kids and customers the hardest part of the job is delling with customers and kids
good,When it was around it was a good first job. Pay checks were actually good during seasonal and they gave u a lot of hrs. Always a fun work environment employee we're nice and helpful.
good,It WAs A Fast But Easy Job And Consist Of Alot Of Work But Thats Always A Good Thing. But The Management Could Have Been Alot BetterAnd ore Orginized......
good,"Viel Arbeit, alles über Einzelhandel gelernt, leider keine Übernahme."
good,I was always busy and management was always willing to help. There was a daily and weekly routine that made everyones job easier. I moved up in the company in 1 year to gear specialist.
good,"Even though this was a seasonal position for xmas and for closing of the store the people I worked with were never nice and helpful and we were always a team. Too bad the company closed down for good, was always a great place for my kids to shop also."
good,They were a great place to work for - particularly prior to the leveraged buy-out in 2008.  While results lagged - people worked together to work towards solutions.
good,It was a fun environment to work at with all the kids and fun activities at hand. With birthday club and geffory. It was always a good time with the kids and with con workers
good,"Toy R Us was a fun place to work most of the time, management was decent, low to average pay at that time, liked working various areas of the store and assigned which part responsible for straightening up at end of work day, I enjoyed working at the check out registers and also working as the customer service station, i would recommend working at Toys R Us"
good,Company now closed. It was a good company to work for the best part was the teams you worked with but the management and the expectations were unrealistic at times
good,"Aside from the hectic environment and lack of communication, it was a nice place to work.  Many employees with more than 10 years working for the company.  Management changed over the years, but nothing else."
good,the company is no longer trading.  however I would deal with challenging customers and general enquiries answering telephones and emails and you never new what the day would bring.
good,The one I worked at in Idaho Falls had a lot of drama when it came to management.  Alot of gossip and fake niceness was happening.  I didn't mind working with certain management but the store manager was constantly belittling people over the walkie talkies in front of customers.  The human resources manager was called out several times on surverys because she has an attitude with employees.  One customer even told her to her face that she was a horrible manager when they over heard her yelling so loud in the back of house.  Way too much fakeness at this store.  ALL other employees were great to work with.
good,check all uploaded data from central computer
good,"It was a great work place and the employees were great but when a job opportunity came along to move up in the company, I took it and I was only there for a couple months. prior to the job opening I was making 8.50, I was later running the furniture department and received no raise I was there a total of 4 months 2 months I was running that department, to the best of my ability without the proper training. I loved that job but it was not enough to live off of that's why I left."
good,"My coworkers were the best I have ever had, more like family. Management in our store was very good. Most of the customers who came into the store was super nice."
good,"Toy's R Us was a good experience for me. When I was a kid, I would go to Toy's R Us often so becoming a worker there was an entirely different experience. I was only a seasonal worker during Christmas season and although it was a busy and hardworking time, it felt good to know I was helping Toy's R Us package and ship their products to families all over the United States."
good,I worked as a cashier here and it was pretty slow paced but I worked with some cool people here. Its a good place to take your kids to try new toys or to get a new toy.
good,was a great first job when you are in young and in school. Gained a lot of experience working fast learning  about new equipment .overall an OK experience.
good,"I worked for ""R""Us for almost 19 years in different capacities from the field to the corporate office. The work was always challenging and rewarding and you got to see a direct impact in children and families lives. The workload was grueling at times but I grew through my tenure there tremendously."
good,"fun environment to work in, stores are closing in United States.  Store I worked at was hard to locate toys due to lack of following laid out plans for new toys etc. Toys were just placed on shelves with price markers, making it hard for customers to navigate the store."
good,"New manager had great ideas and was trying her best. "
good,My tenure at TRU led me to meet an extraordinary amount of dedicated and smart individuals.  Work was always challenging and fun.  Professional and personal growth came easily.
good,It was fun. You get to meet some great people but when it comes to management things get a little rough. They worry to much about credit cards than they do getting things done.
good,"A typical day at Toys R Us is greeting customers, checking them out at the registers and convincing customers to sign up for rewards cards. I learned how to train the newer employees. The hardest part about working at Toys R US has to be dealing with a difficult rude customer,coworkers never actually did their jobs and Management keeping  us late on school nights while we were minors."
good,"The most awesome thing about Toys R Us is that no matter what you do, you are literally working to put a smile on the faces of kids.  That alone can serve as a great way to refocus your efforts when you do feel overworked.  While feeling overworked is not always the case, Toys R Us is in retail and most retail places that I have worked in have urgency in most things.  Combine that with days in which you may have a very small staff and people may have to put forth a little more effort than they would like."
good,"I loved working at toys r us , fun workplace, nice customers, loved the staff, my favorite thing about toys r us was seeing all the new different toys that were selling ."
good,We had quite a variety of great customers and lots of fun. I learned how to work on the register which was quite easy and a lot about restocking. The best part were the kids and the toys.
good,"not enough communication with employees, also it can be very fun,"
good,Fun place to work however not very busy out side of seasonal time. Not a good job for those looking for permanent placement. They are very flexible with work schedules.
good,todo muy desaorganizado no dan mas de 10 horas solo dan los dias mas dificiles
good,Good number of employees heading into the seasonal months to help train new employees. The managers were average. It was mostly a well organized place even through Christmas and there were lots of coworkers to help.
good,"It was calm and easy going even when working security for the company not many things going on there especially during the holidays, the only complaint is they will force you to work on black Friday even if you say you are going out of town."
good,I worked at Toys R Us as a seasonal job.  The work is face paced and I met a lot of great people.  The customers were amazing and even when they were upset or frustrated we tried our best to make sure they left the store happy and pleased with our service. The only issue I felt needed improvement was management.  Most of the managers and supervisors I worked with were great and a pleasure to work with but on the other hand the schedule was always set outside of most of our availability and the store was usually understaffed and overworked.  I would say the hardest part of the job was keeping up with the work that needed to be done when there just wasn't enough staff scheduled to come in and the best part of the job was face pace and the great people we'd meet each day!!
good,It's a good place for your first job. It's not too demanding and will give you a chance to learn about retail. Most employees are in there 20's so if its your first job you'll have lots in common.
good,"Receiving Products,Building Products, Customer Service & Stocking Products."
good,"I learned a lot about retail during this. I worked in the electronics department which is one of my strongest areas to work. I'm very knowledgeable when it comes to video games and I got to help lots of customers find the things they wanted! I also learned how to manage the area. Cleaning, stocking, and taking care of customers was all very fun to me! Nothing is better than making someone's day when you help find the right item they're looking for and seeing them smile and say thank you. It feels very good and boosted my confidence right up!"
good,Nobody is following you around so no stress in that department. You get two 15 min breaks and a 30 min lunch if you work a full 8 hour shift. Moves pretty quickly for graveyard shift.
good,Toys r Us is not slow work Pace working environment. My hours was fixed and the work environment was fun and i was able to communicate with my co workers freely. the hardest part of the jobs was the late night hours.
good,It was a fun seasonal job. fast paced. on feet the whole time. customer service was great. friendly co workers managers were very nice and helpful. hands on training.
good,"I loved working for ToysRUs. The environment was fun, everyone was really friendly but sadly for me it was just a seasonal job. I was sad that I had to leave and ever since they declared bankruptcy it's been hard to go back."
good,"• enjoyed creating web assets "
good,Stores need to be refreshed and possibly opened in new better buildings and locations that would suit customers more easily. The company is awesome to work for but we need to upgrade our computer systems and register stations. The pay should also be more competitive or in line with other big box retailers.
good,"so."
good,Working the overnight shift takes some getting used to and each shift is fast paced.  Unfortunatly toys r us only has an overnight shift for part of the year.
good,The people is why I stayed so long. The employees are great!!! I wish there would be more hours available in the off season. But overall it was a fun job. Very fast paced during the Christmas season.
good,"A fun place to work, with lovely people, however management wasn't as great. enjoyable part in this job would be lovely customers coming in everyday, makes your day better."
good,the holidays are the funnest part about toys r us. all the new toys and smiles on kids faces makes it worth while. if you want advancement then this isn't the job for you
good,It was a fun experience it was like a kid In a candy store . I enjoyed working there it wasn't s bad job . It was actually something I could do . Working with kids is a good thing .
good,"I worked for the Toys R Us company for a bit, I started out as a cashier then worked at service desk and right after that I caught myself learning how to do almost everything, even though I was still just a part time sales associate. I eventually worked my way up to 30 hours a week, still a ""part time"" sales associate. I then got promoted to department manager and signage supervisor. all within 1 year and a couple months of work. As long as the management is fun and prides there work in customer satisfaction its a great place to work. I ended my career with them due to poor management. So just be weary."
good,"The team I work on is amazing, but they seem to dislike much of the upper management. The hours seem to be scarce, and the pay is not worth it for the amount of work"
good,"The staff was very accepting and helped out in anyway they could, whether it was taking shifts or letting off early. Usually no schedule mishaps but every so often."
good,I really liked working here but unfortunately they had to let all the seasonal workers go and I was one of them so I went to Staffing Partners. But it was a nice place to work I would work there again.
good,"I've spent quite a bit of time with Toy's / Babies R Us, going between the flagship store that was Times Square to Union Square and then Rego Park. All of it had great team members or customers who all were enjoyable to work with. Management in both Times Square and Union Square were solid with very minor hiccups, but the management in Rego Park wasn't as comfortable and formal like the previous work environments."
good,Toys R Us is a great work environment. Seeing the kids come in the store and leaving with bright smiles on their faces will make anyone's day. I recommend Toys R Us to anyone!
good,It's a productive work place good environment firm and fair mangement it was very enjoyable because of the positive environment and the working with toys I've even had since a kid
good,Good people to work for. They understand some employees have family issues they need to work around and they assisted employees with that very willingly when they could.
good,"Assist customers with final purchases, answer questions and concerns.  Operate cash register and credit card machines.  Assist mangers with making sure our customer were satisfy.  I learned great customer service and patience."
good,"It was fun for the holiday season but most of the seasonal employees become rather competitive and nasty towards each other and try to hurt, or damage, anyone else's chance of being hired on for more than seasonal. The regular employees are fun and are pretty knowledgeable about the products and are happy to teach you. Everyone just wants to have fun and are a lot like adult children."
good,"This place was super awesome to work at while I got the chance to work here, but they decided to keep someone who didn't know anything about video games because it was a man and transferred me to babies r us because I am a woman and I knew a lot more about video games than the one person. Incase you were wondering I worked in what they call R zone which is the area with all of the video games and gaming systems."
good,Babies R Us was a fantastic customer service based company that allowed you to make sound decisions on a great guest experience. Once they took on the Toys R Us values and way of running a store it created more micro managing of time the associates are there and hurt the customer service end of the busines
good,"The co-workers were great, store conditions were pretty awful. It's as if the company overall didn't care about that particular store. Felt like an overall afterthought. Most management were good at their jobs."
good,Toys R Us is a great starter if you want to get into retail. When I was there the pay wasn't great but this was nearly 3 years ago so I assume the pay has gone up.
good,"I only wish that my time there would have been extended.  I was a good worker and helped out anywhere that I could.  I made a lot of great people.  During the holidays, I would work over night and into the next day."
good,was a nice part time job. The customers were great and getting to see all the toys and stocking was a fun thing to do at Christmas. Was a fast paste job that I liked and was looking for.
good,"had great time just too far to work and need a refence from them asap "
good,"Good for extra money and work experience, not much for advancement, but the people and managers can make it all worth it."
good,Very fun work environment. The store gets very busy during the season and helps to make the days go by faster. The off-season months can be very slow and many/most seasonal employees are let go. This makes it very difficult to find somebody to work for you if you are unable to work a certain shift.
good,It was a great atmosphere to work in however management needs to treat their employees with respect. I understand it was hectic during the holidays however treating your employees with respect is very important and very positive.
good,"I was only at Toy's for a seasonal position and probably overstayed my welcome. However, for the short time I was there I highly enjoyed it. I had to come in in the small hours of the morning to unload the truck, stock the shelves, and ready the store for any upcoming events. While most of the time my coworkers and I kept to ourselves, we got along famously. And the managers were nice people too. They didn't hesitate with giving us tasks and would even join in on our tasks whenever they could."
good,"I advanced very quickly into my HR position thanks to the support of my two managers. They, too, were promoted very quickly and consequently I was left with no more ""local"" connections. I found that I was being asked to perform duties without the proper support or feedback from my new managers. Communication issues within the company have resulted in poor work ethic and declining employee morale."
good,I've only worked for this company on a seasonal basis.  I've gained customer service experiences and team work.  I've also gained responsibilities within my department.
good,Babies R' US is a great place to work! Great people. management is always awesome and  the customers are always very nice (as long as their expired coupon goes through).
good,Toysrus had very unpredictable hours. You learned your schedule for the week a day before it would start. The environment was pretty relaxed for the most part. The pay was however very low for the amount of work. A typical day at work entailed placing new videogames on the shelves then assisting and checking out customers. The hardest part of the job was figuring everything out with no training. The most enjoyable part was interacting with customers about videogames.
good,Not a career but good for people in a first job setting. Had a great team around me in a high stress environment. Pay wasn't anything to live off of but it was honest.
good,I would not recommend working here if you're looking for a career. There aren't enough benefits and the work load is a lot for such little pay. The environment can be fun at times except for when you don't reach the daily goals. The managers can really get on your case about it.
good,"Loved working with toys"
good,Great and fun place to work for teens and college students. Fun work environment at Broadway at the beach and minutes from the strip. Fireworks two nights a week and tourist frequent the area.
good,"Lavoro stimolante dal punto di vista di apprendimento e gestione,ottimo rapporto con i colleghi di lavoro,liberta di gestione della clientela e del negozio i generale"
good,"With a steady flow of customers everyone had a comfortable few hours but then BANG! Everyone seemed to appear from nowhere & it was an exciting environment to work in as you didn't know what would happen next. Bouncing between customer services, the cashiers & customer pick up/information I had a lot of staff to take care of but they all worked so hard. As times & staff members changed there was a huge difference in standards as the management wanted to boss some staff around but be ""buddy's"" with others so as some worked themselves as hard as they could with little to no help others had a free ride to praise. Those who worked hard were the most reliable people you'll ever know!"
good,"Como estuve solo un mes de práctica tampoco tuve tiempo a ver de todo. El gerente estaba bien."
good,"co-workers were great along with management, but there wasn't any possible advancments. the hardest part is definitlly learning every toy in the store."
good,Managers were favoring certain workers than others and giving them favors. The managers were very inappropriate and trying to flirt with the new workers.
good,"good place to work with good management, the hour where good and you could get a lot of extra shifts in. the break facilities were good, the wages could have been better"
good,"My colleagues are very friendly. Getting to meet new customers and learning new things everyday is the best part. My managers are the best because they do not only teach you things based on your job, they let you explore other departments so as to grow and groom your mind. Working long hours is the hardest part of this job."
good,"I work usually the customer service desk, work with returns and orders. My co workers are great and work really hard, management could be better and scheduling too."
good,Loved working at toys r us had a lot of fun and the people i met were  great the hours were awesome and working with the kids was fun
good,"Bom ambiente de trabalho entre colegas."
good,"Great general environment, the people were amazing i just wanted something i could move forward in. My favorite part was working in the back of house on shipping. I would print labels, go hunt down the requested item, package and ship it. I would definitely go back if the need ever came up."
good,"A very demanding job, especially during the Christmas period. Wonderful work environment which teaches you crucial life skills, communication skills and customer based services. My experience of the staff and the job descriptions were fun and friendly with very little pressure. Dealing with millions of Rands in one till point, has made me a very alert and responsible person. Assisting a diverse population with complaints, queries and compliments has lead to my ability to communicate with others in a very calm manner, I also learned the importance of time management and keeping myself occupied when the store was quiet. It's a toy shop... what's not to love?"
good,"Go in and be on my cash register. I learned restocking, how to process online orders, and shipping. management was good, anytime i had a problem it was handled in a timely fashion. my co workers were easy to work with. the hardest part of the job was being on the cash register during the Christmas and black friday rush. the most enjoyable part was restocking the selves at closing."
good,At night i would Re-stock shelves with new merchandise that would come. i would have to stack the shelves plum full before the store opened the next day.
good,The overall business was nice . The employees were nice to the customers and the managers seemed nice also . I didn't like that once the season slowed down they started to cut hours very severely  . I didnt appreciate that so i left .
good,"I enjoyed working during the holidays because it brought much excitement and cheerful faces into the company. Even the employees were n'sync with one another, which made the operation of the company easier."
good,I worked here during the seasonal time of the year. My first day was on black Friday. I wish they would have trained me before so I could know exactly what I was doing instead of just throwing me into the job with zero knowledge. Sometimes you have to restock the mess left behind & you wont get out until around 3am & this is really bad when you have to be at work by 7am the next day. But with that being said I picked up the job really fast.  And it was a really fun place to work.
good,"its a fun place to work, aside from screaming children and the non stop rude customers who ""didn't pay that much for a toy when they were a kid."" There is  no advancement, I was making a dollar less than the full time HR lady who had been there two years longer than me. Good part time gig for a kid."
good,"This is a good place to work if you are experienced with children. I was not and had no idea what I was talking about. They gave me almost no hours each week, and the training was very unorganized. After three months of working there, I still had no idea what I was doing."
good,"Busy with stocking shelves; signage, getting ready for Sunday's ad. Management was good the first time I worked at TRU. They cared about their employees back then. The second time I worked there, management only cared about sales, not the employees, newly hired employees were not trained, There was no follow up with jobs being done. Hardest part of the job second time around was seeing how down hill the company or at least that particular store had gone."
good,Good people to work with. Good benefits but Management is really bad. They don't treat their workers right. They have no compassion for the workers.
good,I learned how to conduct refunds and sell items to customers and also I learned to do a credit card application overall all it was a good place to work
good,"Bring stock to the floor, unpack, scan items in an clean floor. coworkers were nice and so was management. Pay was ok for the job but it could always be better."
good,"Most of the work days were overnights. Got a lot done but no customer interaction"
good,Good place to work. I learned a lot working there about warehouse logistics. I didnt like wearing the scanner all day on my wrist tho.
good,My work day began at 4 am. I started off my day in the back warehouse. I would log into the system and begin printing orders that were made by customers online.Once the orders for the day were printed off i would go out into the store and begin filling those orders by pulling the items from the shelves and checking them against the model number and the order number. once the order was filled I would then go back to the warehouse and print packing slips and shipping labels. I would box the order up for shipment at this time and then would move on to the next order. Once the orders for the day were prepared for shipment I would go and restock the shelves with the items that were purchased. Twice a week the stores delivery trucks would come and I was also responsible for unloading the trucks and item placement on the shelves.
good,I was seasonal help and it was very busy with helping family members find the product for Christmas.  Co-workers were all over the place trying to assist the customers.  The most enjoyable part of the job is seeing all the different products for kids.
good,I enjoyed working TRU for the most part there was times I wasn't sure if  all the managers talked daily. our work days was laid back we would come in and unload trucks on to U boats and take it to the floor to be put on shelves. I liked my managers and my co works. The hardest part was working over nights and losing family time.
good,"i work in the electronics department as a cashier/sales member."
good,"Customer service intells the under standing of the cusotmers emotions/opions vs. policy!!! However when dealing with a child; whom toy doesn't work and would like another one...is quite the eaziest part of my day. While, dealing with auntie, rushing for a last-minute gift and the line is too long and her day is already bad; that my dear can be interesting."
good,"On a typical day... working a Babies R Us is very enjoyable."
good,This was one of my first jobs i say that because i got this job and another one at the same time. i learned a lot from toys r us and the guest. The job it self was not bad it was even fun at times i remember every Saturday this one kid would come to toys r us to to see me and ask me about new video games. My co-works were more like family i can count on them for just about anything. of not for me trying to better my self in life i would still be at toys r us. the only downside to this job is the low.
good,"Typical day at work consist; Upon clocking in I would immediately head up front to LP (Loss Prevention) office and check the log book from the previous day. Walk around store and interact, observe, and document any potential theft/safety issue that need immediate attention. I've learned a lot about the Security/Loss Prevention field and how technical it really is. Management was very attentive, pleasant, and eager to assist with any questions and/or issues needing to be discussed. Co-workers, for the most part, were very nice and fun to work with. I met my wife through this potions and am currently going on our 5th year wedding anniversary in November. Hardest part of the job was having to document, write up, as well as contact outside law enforcement agencies on a fellow employee due to theft. Most enjoyable part of the job was the consumer and employee interaction on a daily basis. Everyday was a new and very different experience."
good,"I worked for this company three times, there were no pay increases,hardly any room for job advancement (unless you were there for years and years), and their hours SUCK! Who can make a way off of 7.25 and barely 20 hours a week?? I gained more customer service skills working here and the management were fine, I never had a problem with them but some were better than others. I enjoyed my co-workers, primarily because they were all somewhat around my age and we always managed to find common interest. Hardest part about my job was barely getting hours for a job that I liked and I liked it because of the kids I came across everyday. None of them were the same and gave me a different outlook on life in a way."
good,Worked with customer which was very enjoyable. The hardest part about this job was being on your feet all day. I very much enjoyed the culture and work environment
good,A good entry level position to learn what retail can be like.  It can be stressful especially during the holiday season.  Overall I learned a lot and was able to utilize my learned skills at another company.
good,a typical day at work would consist of me working at cash register. i learned about a lot. i learned how to be more responsible and also how to deal with people (customers). management was pretty cool and explained anything i had to do very well. my co-workers made the job fun with great conversation and they were very helpful. the job wasnt very hard and the concept was very clear.
good,"Typical work day was always busy and rushed . "
good,"A Typical Day At Work Would Be To Find Out Where You Would Be Working Most Of The Time I Was On The Registers But Actually Enjoyed Working There Got To See A Lot Of Children. Management Was Pretty Good. Never Thought I Would Learn The Floors, How To Toys R Us Credit Card Or Even Refund And Exchanged When I Was Trained There They Told Us They We Wouldn't Be Doing And Refund Or Exchanges But In The End Learned Out How To Do It. Co-Workers Would Sometimes Never Show Up For Entire Three Days."
good,"what I learned from working at toys r us is how to be organize, stay positive at all time."
good,"I ran the stock room, helped customers with pick ups of big ticket items."
good,Toys R Us is a great atmosphere for those who are kids at heart. Assisting the customers both big and small gives me a great feeling of accomplishment towards my customer service oath. Working with people who shares the same common goal and have fun doing it.
good,"Working at Toysrus was great. "
good,A typical day going in every morning discussing the safety breifing mission and how much it's going outbound. Learned how to process in a faster way finding your own techniques to take short cuts on labeling and throwing it to the conveyor. Managment and co-workers are fantastic the hardest part of the job is getting the heavy stuff thru the day. The most enjoyable part of the job is just throwing the boxes constantly onto the conveyor and achieving the day goals.
good,"sales and returns"
good,El ambiente entre compañer@s en campaña de navidad es muy agradable.
good,low pay and lack of management leadership. Much energy and time involved for small amount of recognition and minimal pay.
good,so much to do during seasonal jobs. i worked there most for Christmas season i had it as a second job. so i worked the most on holidays and summer.
good,"steady business year round, crazy during holidays"
good,was good place to work but would of bein a better experience if I was older
good,There was alot of great things about working here. But there was no room for growth and and the pay was awful.
good,"Great Staff, Good Management, Good Benefits, Will work with busy scedule such as college, High guest focus..."
good,As a seasonal job I was happy with what I was doing. I would be on the floor half the day and on the register the other half. I liked my co-workers
good,"Work at Babies R Us was very busy. As a sales team member I had several jobs. I was a greeter, stocker,and baby registry receptionist. I had to always make sure I was there to assist customers. I was in control of inventory making sure the correct merchandise was out on the floor etc. The hardest part of my job was dealing with rude customers. The most enjoyable part was meeting new people and being able to communicate briefly with different cultures. I enjoyed this job a lot."
good,I worked there during Christmas. Very busy but that made the time go by fast.
good,"Me gusta trabajar en puestos que estén relacionados con el trato directo al cliente, al ser dependienta podia aconsejar a los clientes. "
good,"Very fun place to work and great people. They don't hire within the company, so not much room for advancement. Hours get cut quite often."
good,"While working for the company, I arrived at least 15 minutes before my shift. I reported to my manager to see what task had to be completed for the day, and i got straight to work. I really enjoyed my time with the company because the communication level between employees was outstanding. Teamwork was a must and everyone cooperated well with each other. The hardest part of the job had to be locating  all of the layaway items for the returning customers because there were an overwhelming amount of layaway items that season."
good,"A normal work day would consist of, taking phone orders, assisting guest, online orders, answering phones, cashiering."
good,"My days consist of being on the register and checking all the guests out efficiently as possible and assisting them with their needs. I learned how to sell products to customers and how to conduct good customer service. My co workers were pretty helpful. We had alot of team work. The hardest part of the job, was getting people to sign up for credit cards. The most enjoyable part of the job was seeing the children happy when they got the toys they wanted"
good,Co- workers and Managers were GREAT. Pay is minimum wage and hours decrease DRAMATICALLY after Christmas.
good,It is a good company to work for however promotions seem to be based on tenure as opposed to talent the same goes for compensation.
good,coworkers were friendly and management was fair. the pay was low. it was seasonal job but the hours were good.
good,"Toys R Us is a great place to work, but they dont pay seasonal people more than the regular workers which isnt right to me. A typical work day for me was pulling items from the shelf, then packaging the items and shipping them off, I loaded the trucks everyday around the same time. Then after we did all the packaging we would go on the floor to help customers out. I learned that retail isnt so easy during the christmas season it has it highlights and lowlights. The Management there was great, the store manager was amazing, and cared about his employee's, which you cant say that for many other jobs. My Co- workers were all very nice and friendly, rarely did i see someone who hated their job or talked bad about the company. The hardest part of the job for me was getting stuff off high shelves bc i cant climb a ladder because im pregnant and had to ask for assistance from another employee. The most enjoyable part of my job were the breaks, and the people that worked there, ive never seen so many nice people in one work place before."
good,"Overall a good company to work for. Compensation is basically the same anywhere in the retail field. One of the good things about our store is everyone has a defined role. A cashier is a cashier and so forth, just don't ask a cashier a question that you should be asking a floor person, because chances are the cashier will not know the answer. Co workers are the best, loose and easy environment between co workers, managers not so much. Only pitfalls I see is that the company is WAY to focused on Metrics. How many people signed up for Rewards cards, Instant credits and Buyer Protection plans. To them its all about the numbers and nothing else."
good,"I work 'back of house' for Babies ""R"" Us, and one of the main things I love about this company, is that it is organized and clean. I think being organized and visually satisfying doesn't only enhance customer satisfaction, but also company/customer relations as well."
good,•Responsible for unloading freight from the dock stocking to the store with merchandise
good,"A day at work would be overwhelming and exciting because during christmas season ToysRus is filled with new toys,and great offers. Seeing the little kids,babies,and even some adults get excited about just being in ToysRus brings joy to me. Santa clause being there for the kids to take pictures with him and me sitting there beside him to capture those moments and coloring different christmas pictures with the kids was a lot of fun.Some co-workers were helpful and good to be around some not,management was great, I learned a lot about different toys, and the hardest part of the job was taking all the toys back that was at the service desk and putting them back where they belong, there be toys everywhere. The part of the job I enjoyed the most was seeing the smiles on the kids faces just being in toy world, and coloring the different christmas pictures with the kids."
good,"I provided excellent customer service, then continued to work a third shift position just to keep up with the over flow for employees that was needed to stock the shelves."
good,This is only seasonal. I am cashier or on floor sales helping customers.
good,I have always really enjoyed working with kids so this job just fit. I was always working with people of all ages and working hard. The compensation was not the greatest there and you can't move up in the company very well but other then that It helped me open up and be able to talk to more and more people
good,"When I first started I was welcomed in with the idea that this job would help me whenever needed. As time progressed I was faced with personal issues family wise that caused me to have to alternate my schedule and no one over head really wanted to hear it and did not assist with this. Furthermore, the cloques at this job sometimes overlapped which made it hard to talk to anyone unless you knew someone really well enough to trust the,. Overall, like any job, understand it is a job, and the business is big enough to preogress with, or without you."
good,"this job is like the typical retail job. There is alot required around the holidays considering this is a toy store. This is the only part-time job I ever had that allowed me to accrue PTO (paid time off) which is my book is a BIG plus. There is alot of work to be done, but you will have fun with the latest toys and games and testing products."
good,taking customer service calls
good,i loved working with my co-workers the environment was great
good,This is a great company to work for i enjoyed the team work and customer service. The only issues was there is no job security in this company!!!
good,I like working with all the toys. Seeing old favorites and finding new ones. I t was a nice place.
good,Its a pretty good/fun company to work for. You do have to enjoy being around kids.
good,Liked working with the company was wasnt trained well I was thrown into mix and had to learn most on my own. It was during holiday season so that could be why.
good,"worked there as a seasonal worker, good atmosphere. Bosses were nice and fair"
good,"I like working for Toys R Us. There was a lot of down falls to this store. Cretin managers would play favorites and treat their employees different then others. For example most of the employees would not do their work and the managers would not say anything to them, the other employees who would work hard and if they did not finish their job the managers would be a lot harder and down on them instead of the employees who was not doing anything."
good,"Online only now, no physical stores. I was full time overnight (2nd job) and only 2 months (Christmas Season) each year. I would have returned for my 3rd year but all stores closed."
good,"Other jobs should know that Toy R Us is a place where you can make friends & be working in scheduled hours, is a work place that someone  can build from. And become a stronger Team player or any of the Position someone was hired to be. Toy R Us is more about Helping others then just helping yourself."
good,The job was exciting and rewarding. The company did close their doors though. we employees did not get money when they closed and lost our vacation time.
good,"likte det, jeg fylte på varer osv. fikk ikke jobbet på kassen."
good,Was a great place to work until the store abruptly closed offering no severance pay or even the accrued Vacation and Personal Time payout.  Miss my coworkers though.
good,during certain day of the year it can be crazy but it's truly a fun place to work for and to see the joy on the kid face is amazing. so sad to see it close
good,I loved my job as a cashier I could chit chat with customers all while getting them out the door as quickly as possible so I don’t hold up my line.. the retail floor was somewhat of a hump because that’s where u interact with the upset customers...
good,"I worked as a night time stocker and enjoyed my time there greatly. Most co workers were decent, my managers were great and the work was relaxed despite the Christmas season"
good,Customer service and teamwork.  Enjoyed everyone being on the same page with success being a priority.  Great management team with coaching being more of emphasis than Managing.
good,"I enjoyed the job. My job was to pull orders for the customers. From store to online, it was enough to keep me busy for 10 to 12 hours a day. The distribution was located in McDonough, GA."
good,Lovely place hate to see them go it was a great experience helped me a lot from customer service to management I loved everything about the company great staff
good,"Working here was fun. What made it great were my coworkers. Management was a bit tough and at times weren't there to help, or weren't always really involved. Tasks were simple and easy to get the hang of."
good,"Work hard, get as much sales as possible, inform customers about charity or homes that they help out every festive season. Always be nice to the kids and the buyer"
good,The job is always a mixture of work and fun. It was a very team oriented job. There was multiple managers for each department. Jobs mainly stocking and cashier work.
good,Although my time at Toys r us  was short it was a wonderful team building and retain first experience for me. They helped build me to be a great customer service representative with amazing team building and communication skills.
good,"Une hiérarchie à l'écoute, un produit très agréable à travailler, un bon esprit d'équipe."
good,"Fue una experiencia muy buena en la cual aprendí mucho, conocí a maravillosos compañeros ( no tengo queja de ninguno) y en el que atendía a los clientes, rellenaba las estanterías de juguetes, me encargaba del almacén (depositar lo que llegaba, hacer entregas, etc.)"
good,it was very slow at times. I learned how to talk to customers and problem solve more efficiently. the most enjoyable part of the job was too see the kids walk out with a new toy or game.
good,very easy with not much work to do because not very many people went in. super relaxed atmosphere with good people and great service when needed and very nice
good,It was a great working experience over there everyday was a new challenge had co workers who helped to make my experience unforgettable. A typical job that gives stability
good,Allows for part time employees to work a seasonal job with no experience to make a little extra on the side for the holidays. The work force was very interactive and had team meetings before and after every shift.
good,They where a good company to work for before they closed down. I worked on the floor with customers and I ran the register and helped stocked and made sure my work area was clean.
good,job was a secure seasonal job but after the season you might get let go. it was interesting working really rushed holiday seasons. discounts on toys was a plus
good,"This was a long term company that has been around for many of years that was very popular among consumers,That at the time of my hiring status was already facing closure,So it was a short term position that would have been a rewarded opportunity to work for."
good,"I learned how to deal with customers, sort items and working with others."
good,Its a good job and a good work place i learned alot of things such as using a pillet jack a fork left and a cavar belt im a great worker who's always on time.
good,"It was a good environment and had good people there , nice and calm , not too crazy because I knew what I was doing. Nice people there and never really had a bad day"
good,"Overall it was a good to place to work , the workload and expectations could be overwhelming at times but for the most part it was a great experience working there"
good,"Was a decent place to work. Management staff was easy to get along with for the most part. As in all jobs there are always exceptions. Culture was such that loss prevention was present more as a visible warning at the front of the building. No actual loss prevention operations were allowed to be pursued. This error in operational consideration was in my opinion the reason for the companies failure. Employee, and Public shrink became too great."
good,A typical day started with placing new product on the shelves if you're working as a merchandiser. If you're working the cash register making sure your float was correct and setting up your lane way. If you happen to be working in the loading Bay and it was receiving your task for the day unloading the truck placing items in there proper storage areas and taking customer orders to the front.
good,I enjoyed the company of my coworkers and I liked one manager but other Ma agents weren’t so pleasant and I did enjoy working there very much and I would love to work there against
good,The company doesn't exist anymore. When it was up and running it was a good job. Always stayed busy. Training was paid for. Learned new skills such as using an electric riding pallet jack.
good,Great job depending on management. Long standing on feet but very interesting job for those who don’t mind old people and kids. I also found it to be a great place for flexible schedule.
good,"A topical day at work use to be fast paced, picking orders, handling incoming calls. filing organized and set appointments for incoming products. respond to customer complaints"
good,"Nice environmental place to work , easy job duties, very organized place."
good,"Toys R us is no longer in business so, this review is about as meaningful as an AC unit that blows hot air. It was a nice little place to work at. Not a permanent type of job. Just the kind to get you some experience for the future."
good,"Good times was happy to work there  "
good,"Fun place to work with good coworkers. It's a great feeling to have a kid come up to you with a smile bigger than their face to tell you how excited and amazed they are to see so many toys and fun things in one place."
good,A typical day at work included ringing up customers and restocking shelves. I learned customer service and time management. The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting new people and helping people find what they're looking for.
good,A normal day at work would be being on cashier and serve customers. I have learned how to handle difficult customers and how to stock suitably and work long hours. The management was good. The hardest part of the job was managing customers as there were customers who weren't very happy with what they had purchased. The enjoyable part of the job was stocking as it was a fun part for me.
good,"I enjoyed helping people with what they needed, but just like with any retail job it comes with those rude people who feel they are entitled to be rude because you are paid to be there. But honestly what made this place great was my co workers."
good,So sad that they are gone. Great company.  They had excellent hours and benefits.  Took good care of their employees.  Stable work and benefits.  Miss this place.
good,"I enjoyed my time a lot at Toys R Us, it was a fun job that helped me feel better by bringing joy to people of all ages. It was a job that did require you to be doing something or helping someone at all times."
good,"A typical day of work for my position was to organize orders for local and in-store pickup and during that, we would focus on customer service and general store organization."
good,My job was easy and i enjoyed clocking into work on most days. Toys R Us had many different and interesting toys. Customer service was good and customers that came in were frequent customers. Work area was kept clean and neat
good,I really loved working at Toys R Us. It was fun and the customers were great. I had so much fun and i loved my co workers. It was a new experience for me. It was only for the holidays though.
good,Loved working there the enviorment was nice employees and customers was respectable and easy going.Working 3rd shift was nice. Pay could have been more
good,"first job, seasonal, strict, some employees were okay. willing to teach positions, long hours which wasnt bad. overall was okay to be there, nice people"
good,"I worked as a cashier, seasonal shipping associate and as an customer service representative,  I learned how to be a cashier and I became a better customer service representative."
good,"Toys “R” Us was a great place to work and it was amazing to work with the children and seeing their faces light up when we had the toy they’ve been wanting for a long time. We went bankrupt and had to start liquidating so after that, it was a stressful environment."
good,"I used to love to watch the commercials.  Wow, I can't believe they closed their stores.  I enjoyed the weekend activities like parades or parties or Pokemon events."
good,"If the managers prefer a Good Sales Associate to be in the parking lot as a Lot Associate when there's barely any cars outside meanwhile there's a whole bunch of people inside running wild not knowing anything to buy and there best Sellers SUPPOSEDLY are in the back room all together huddled up in a circle just talking chilling while everyone needs help. Than I get fired for helping the customers out?? "
good,Venlige kollegaer og ledelse. De fleste arbejdsdage bestod af vareropsætning.
good,"worked there while in school and another part-time job.  its was great just seasonal, learn warehouse skills, and great for high school. placed was enjoyable"
good,The typical day at work was clocking in and then help the other employees fix the shelves or help the other cashiers with the line. The hardest part of the jobs is the overtime work.
good,It was an excellent secondary job. I loved helping people find gifts for children and adults. It was a fun job and I enjoyed the atmosphere. I only had one problem and everyone was younger than me.
good,"Everyone was pretty cool, but customer flow was always either dead or non-stop and it adds a lot of stress. Otherwise coworkers are fairly friendly and it there are always shelves to clean up"
good,"I did stocking, customer service and many other things like mopping and being a cashier, so I would move around a lot at this job but it wasn't always filled with customers"
good,"•Focus on the company and your individual experience while employed there"
good,"Typical day of running the store would involve Stocking, Selling, and Helping with General Questions. The store was always well staffed and there was plenty of us working in the warehouse. Everyone I worked with was nice, and typically there was never anything too stressful going on at a given time."
good,i work there and the people there are nice someties i get bored and i go and sit in the break roo for hours because there is absolutely nothing else to do and the managers just sit in the office and do nothing else so i never get caught and basically i want to find a job where i actually work because beliueve it or not sitting down for hours and getting paid while doing it can get boring
good,Good plave to work. Some days are slow and some are busy. Rarely ever have overtime. Good training. Some managers are childish are ignorant. The pay is poor.
good,I learned a lot about dealing with customers and providing service to people. This was a great friendly place to work for a first job. I really enjoyed it.
good,"Trabajo en equipo, apoyo por todos en el momento de las tareas."
good,"part time job whilst i was at college. fulfilled everything i wanted from work at that time."
good,liked working here alot just sucked how the store was closing down this was a very fun environment never stress i had my own department there it was awesome
good,"Toys R Us is a great place to apply to for your first job. The work is fairly easy and all that is needed of you is what they ask. Hours are very flexible but pay could be better. Overall, great experience"
good,"Toys r us taught me how to run a inventory system and keep a count on big ticket items. The average day consisted on helping customers, stocking selfs, and keeping the right count."
good,"This job is best if you love kids and toys because you're surrounded by both all day long! It can get stressful during peek times such as around Christmas and closing times, but it's always nice to see a kid walk out with a toy they adore!"
good,not a very busy store but when the holidays come by the store gets crazy. The store would be unstaff sometimes so they would not go over their budget so it would be x2 more work for us.
good,Is was a good place to work. It had a fun atmosphere. We got to play with the toys whether we were sampling them or not. I loved my job and the others that worked with me also loved their jobs too.
good,"I Enjoyed working at toys""R""us i enjoyed my team we worked very well together. I also enjoyed the merchandise an discounts. Management was fair an understanding..."
good,I didnt get to spend to much bet they seemed disorganized and a little lost thats why i didnt stay long plus business was very slim to non the only time ot was busy was during Christmas
good,I really enjoyed working for them the company needs to reopen the experience was cool it just takes time to advance within but other then that it was great!
good,"A typical work day at Toy's R Us in Tukwila, Washingtion was very busy, fast paced, and always had a friendly energy. I gained retail and sales experience there and all in all it was enjoyable for my time being there."
good,The days at toys r us were very fun. It almost made me feel like i was a kid again.The staff were very friendly and the customers were as well. I enjoyed going to work. Its a place to be yourself and enjoy your time at work.
good,"For the most part working there was fun in working there, and most of the co-workers were pretty great. I learned how to  deal with finding items for people who may not be sure what they want, helping the customer find applicable price match deals, how to correct prices, and how to pull and put items in storage."
good,Was a good company to work for. Provided some training. Good benefits with 401K and health insurance. Too many leadership changes created uncertainty within the company.
good,"I took on this job during the holiday season, and learned how to do overnight stocking, along with online orders during Black Friday and Christmas. It began as relaxed, but as the season picked up, so did the pace. At times it could be really stressful, but I really enjoyed the challenges it posed to my work ethic and time management abilities."
good,"The pay was decent for a 16 year old, wasn't a fan of being underestimated but overall the atmosphere was warm friendly ad pleasant, i wish they never closed."
good,"The Team at BRU Greenwood was awesome, like a 2nd Family.  All US Locations are now gone and the Toys R Us name have left the states.  People are what made this job fun."
good,"I really enjoyed Working and helping with all the "
good,I'm pretty sure I was the only one there that actually enjoyed my job there. The management always had a blind to problems we had as a team and the employees did not give a single care whether or not the floor was clean at the end of the night.
good,Toys R Us was my very first job. It was a very out going job especially dealing with Children & parents. Toys R Us showed me a lot about team work and helping others.
good,"I know it was Min. Wage, I know it was Toys R Us but my manager was the absolute best and I will forever miss working overnights here. Good bye Toys R us. You will be missed forever by a lost generation. "
good,really sad to see this business close. had many fond memories of me shopping here as a kid and shopping for my kids. to bad the people in charge had no idea how to run the business.
good,I really enjoyed working for this company so sad to see it go pay wasn’t great but work environment and flexibility was great company tried to promote within but also did seek outside if no one qualified but did every Employee the opportunity to advance
good,fun pace to work. meeting the customers making them feel welcome. Christmas music adverts were annoying to listen to however the spirit and upcoming events were exciting.
good,Toys R Us was a very fast paced work environment while working there. It gave me lessons on customer service and how to deal with situations while multitasking.
good,"working at toys r us was a great experience. Very busy during the holidays. For a part time it is a good job. Hours were okay, a lot of go backs and restocking."
good,"Well, all the Toys 'R Us's are closed but... I'm required to write this review, so... I enjoyed the work because I really like kids and talking to customers and knew a lot about toys. I think if you didn't have all of those in common, it wouldn't be any more pleasant than any other retail job. But I will say, I'm really sad to see this company go under. It was fun while it lasted!"
good,"At Babies R us I worked in the back of house/ stock room. I used to have to get strollers, car seats, cribs, etc. to  the sale room floor. It was my first paying job and made me realize how retail jobs are different from office jobs. The hardest  but also most enjoyable part was the customers."
good,"I didn't want to leave but they went out of business. It was a decent job, i got to do what i enjoyed doing. Assembly & unloading sorting trucks. thats all."
good,"I spent 24 years working for this company, had they not gone out of business I would still be working there. It was a fun, fast-paced, family oriented environment."
good,"Good company to work for; boss was great.  Would still be there if they didnt go out of business. Made some good friends. Work day was pretty decent unless it was peak time, then it was a 6-7 day work week."
good,I started working for this company as a Seasonal Cashier and gained the experience to provide excellent customer service and product knowledge. If the company was still in business I would still be there providing my customer service and knowledge to guest and new employees.
good,"This company was fun ti work with, as teamwork was essential. Although this store personally felt mismanaged as many of the managers had their favorites and it was noticeable upon looking at the weekly hours. Although this was not the direct reason for its closure, it felt like management stopped caring once the closure was guaranteed."
good,"Flexible scheduling,  fun ,fast paced job. Maganement3was professional and knowledgeable.  Very busy during Holliday season. Nice timely breaks with break room."
good,"Each day before a shift you were briefed and you knew exactly what your job was that day. "
good,"I had a chance to place orders online for customers , working with people all over the world that were ordering toys. I worked on different programs microsoft, and I would also look over applications and call in applicanys for interviews."
good,"It was a nice place to work at, kind of shows how human nature is (customers) but over all fun. the co workers were fun and some mangement had your back but there was this one asst manager who swore he ran the place. got on my nerves"
good,It was a pretty easy job and I loved seeing kids smile when they got the toy they wanted. Most coworkers were very nice. Job got stressful when there were rude customers or lack of help. Sometimes it got really slow and boring. Overall a pretty good place to work though.
good,it's been fun working at Toys R' Us for just 3 months i experienced alot of things like providing our customers what they need and communicating with them what their kids likes. but sadly this just last month of june we sadly announce that we are closing for good.
good,"It was fun while it lasted. The job was simple; stock. The managers were strict, but fair on how to stock the toys and keep track of inventory. It was good to be surrounded by toys for the company's final days."
good,Enjoyed working with new and expectant moms. It was a joy to go into work. Creating an environment where new and expectant parents ( and grandparents) could come and experience new beginnings was personally rewarding.
good,Management there was terrible. Favoritism was always showed between management and employees. The work loads were unfairly split up. They allowed customers to be completely and unnecessarily disrespectful saying it’s retail they can do that
good,Depending on the time of year the job can be very demanding . There are many thing to look out for because that specific work place can become a hazard zone if your not paying attention to what is placed out on the floor .
good,"I would help a lot of kids, parents, siblings, and grandparents find the toys they wanted and that was wonderful. Management was kind, friendly, and flexible. Everyone was friendly towards each other and very helpful."
good,"A great place to work. The customers definitely made it worth our while. Working at a specialty store was such an eye opener. From organizing events to having the knowledge of all of the popular toys, we remained the best toy company in the world."
good,Company was good to work for however the company does have some issues that has lead to their company having to file for bankruptcy protection and res
good,"Toys R Us manages their stores with as little staff as possible and has expectations that all the tasks and projects get done efficiently. The culture is focused around family and it does provide a close-knit atmosphere with co-workers. Store managers have little to no accountability with how they treat team members and this produces low morale at times. It is a fun environment, but it becomes stressful due to low staffing."
good,"While working at toys r us, I did not receive much training and my first day of work was on black Friday so it was extremely stressful. Managers were helpful in this situation"
good,"Typical day would be review emails, check payroll, account for all team members to show up and provide direction to what needed to be worked on. Open store and process deposit on day is was going to get picked up. When closing the store I would make sure to walk around and help any customers that needed help looking for certain toys or product. I would also cashier when needed. Handled any customer complaints without getting to corporate level. Also I would be scheduled to unload a truck and merchandise it to the floor and process it within a certain time frame. Hardest part was when employees would call off and other employees would not answer their phones. The most enjoyable part of my job was when I would put a smile on children's faces when looking for their favorite toy."
good,"Fun place to work, long retail hours, ok health insurance, flexible scheduling, comparable pay scale, season is hardest part of the job, most enjoyable part was customers returning and asking for you"
good,"good for almost 33 years,great team,strong relationships made,wanted to retire with company.learned great customer service skills.over all great career and hope to finish out career with strong company."
good,"I worked an overnight stocking position and it was alright; pay is low for the area I lived in, hours were inconsistent but typically anytime between 9pm-9am. There isn't much more to it than that; it was average."
good,"To begin with toys r us really helped me grow more. Also matured me as well, I've enjoyed the experience and I am truly thankful for the opportunity to work there."
good,"It was a really messy environment because whenever I would check out a costumer and their object that they were buying was 40% off and it would be in the computer but couldn't put it in because I am still a minor, the people I worked with were nice, some, they barely gave us a ten minute break I normally wouldn't get one for hours and keep working."
good,I learned to work in a fast paste environment and deliver the task on time. The opportunity I had was quick because it was just a seasonal job but I enjoyed the time it last.
good,"I don't mean to say I wouldn't recommend it as a place to work, but the company may not exist much longer.  Company is in liquidation, and will soon be closing its doors forever."
good,I enjoy working at toys r us. I really enjoy working everybody I work with. My boss was cool..Well everybody I work with was cool.Never no problems.Geart
good,It was a good place to work. Job opportunities were available. Helping guest - back up cashier - stock shelves - management open door policy - hard part of job is a slow day. Helping people
good,Store was great to work in.  Work days were very pretty ordinary.  Definitely loved working with the team and felt like a family.  Toughest part was dealing with the corporate office or receiving enough communication from them.
good,Toys R Us was definitely a fast paced environment especially during holiday season which is when I was employed there. Also a stressful job when you're not completely familiar with all of the products and place settings for everything.
good,"Unfortunately, the company no longer exists as it's final stores are currently in the process of closing as I write this, so there really is no point in reviewing my experience."
good,"Job is fairly easy and relaxed. A great temporary job, but definitely not meant for long time employment. I personally only worked as a part-time employee, so I never received employment benefits, but the pay rate was fairly good. You are only scheduled by how many metrics you achieve at the store."
good,"fun atmosphere to work especially during christmas season, but you got to work hard.good benefits if your full time,no benefits for part time employes. going out of business"
good,Toys R Us is closing all it's stores and Corporate office.  It was not my intention to leave this company.   I was laid off as a result of bankruptcy.
good,"I make sure that the store is secure and safe for everyone, its a toy store you cant help but to have a little fun, but along with the fun i learned how to increase my communication skills through dealing with guests on a regular basis. the hardest part of the job is when things get slow it drags time, i like to be active and involved when working, that gives me s since of purpose. the thing i like the most is the interaction with the people."
good,"Staff and team were awesome, would love to still be working there, unfortunately the company went into administration and i was made redundant due to this."
good,Throughout my years with Toys R Us I have meet many wonderful people.  I was able to mentor and train new team members throughout my tenure with the company.  My biggest joys were seeing people i personally help develop become better at their current position or got a promotion.
good,"The mist enjoyable part of the job is full of challenge as I am putting off fire everyday. The hardest part of the job is I would never know what issue I will be facing next second and I need to ensure issues are fixed ASAP, which is also the fun part."
good,"Toys R Us is a fun place to work at times. It has it's ups and downs like any place of buisness.  During the non season (Christmas) days were slow.  During in season days were fast paced, those were the best. You encounter so many different types of people and over the years I have made friends with co workers as well as customers.  I have so many customers that started coming in the store when their children were toddlers and now they have children.  I even hired one of the children that had been coming to the store during my 22 years of service."
good,I never would have though that the worlds biggest toy store would go out of business. I guess everything comes to an end. It's been fun everyone. I hope everyone lands a good job.
good,"Toys R Us was a fun place to work, but was not able to dig its way out a financial hole that was created in 2005.  As a result, the company had to liquidate and will be going out of business."
good,I was very satisfied with my job overall it provided stability for me and my family i raised my daughter over the 20 years i was there so for that i am very thankful.
good,"typical day was faced paced. Hardest part of the job standing for 8 plus hours as a cashier, the most enjoyable part of the day was helping the customers, management was fair."
good,I enjoy the management and staff that are there they're very helpful and nice and they always get the job done. The hardest part is when dealing with customers during season but i always managed.
good,Good company to work for. Time off and holiday when needed. Management are helpful and staff are friendly working hours and and shift patterns are easy to manage.
good,Toys R Us is an extremely busy shop where customer service is always top priority. There is a wide variety of daily tasks to be completed and an ability to be flexible and think on your feet is essential.
good,Great company to work for.  Benefits good.  Enjoy the customers that come in.  Stock room gets over stocked especially at Christmas time and seasonal workers need more training.
good,"Great work life balance, flex hours to accommodate personal needs, personable team members to work with, fun in office events,  helpful coworkers to help learn and train employees"
good,"Working here was enjoyable. This was a seasonal job for me, so I wasn't there long. I enjoyed helping customers and unpacking boxes to stock the shelves. There was always something to do to keep busy."
good,toys r us is a good company to work for with great people and management and opportunity. Some days over christmas can be long but always worth the work to see the finished job done.
good,Having been with Toys R Us for 12 years I can say that it has been an enjoyable place to work. The team is amazing and the guiding principles of the company are inspiring.
good,"As with most brick and mortar store, Toys R Us is struggling to stay alive. This has affected the ability to put money back into the stores. Payroll is very tight,  systems need updated, and the pay scale vs other big box needs reevaluated."
good,"The company is full of great people who work hard to deliver in challenging conditions."
good,"Can be hectic in the summer and winter seasons, but is completely worth is if you want the day to fly by or you enjoy talking to and helping out other people"
good,"Toys""R""Us is a great company to work for.  Most teams work well together, some struggle to excel cross functionally.  Management always has your back even in trying times."
good,"My co-workers were great people, outgoing, and funny. The work environment was okay, there has been some bumpy days. There was rarely a bad day when I worked there! It was sometimes patchy because the guest would want to see a manager, but they were always busy. It seemed that things went slow and the customer started to get frustrated by long waits. I always tried to make the customer satisfied when they come to shop."
good,everything about the job is fair to a punch your free to help out more if you wished for some possible overtime pay there isn't anything really hard about the job and i can't say there's much to really enjoy management did his best to keep the job entertaining and to make it fun a typical day has you sorting out what could be put on the floor from returns or from the previous nights till the back room starts rolling out stuff from the truck then placing each box in it's correct aisle and then after all the box has been placed go through each box and determine if it can go out or not on the floor other wise it's get taken to the back later after all boxes have dealt with we must gather any and all boxes that not filled crush them and remove all boxes and palattes from off the main floor to the back of warehouse for the next night to be dealt with. i can't say i've learned a large amount other than the entire process of working in the back and on the floor working late at night till the morning will require you to be awake for this job so getting proper sleep during the day is a must. i think the culture of the work place is wonder place for us to see the smiling faces of young kids looking and anticpating their dreams to have fun with toys
good,"Great atmosphere to work in, lots of team effort. Good for students to start out getting retail experience. If you like hard, fast paced work you will like this."
good,"Great place to work at. While my tenure there was a seasonal graveyard shift, the experiences that I learned have helped me better understand the retail environment."
good,Toys R us and Babies R Us is a good company to work at! They care about their employees and have a great way of showing them! Would definitely recommend working here!
good,I loved my job there..its just that it was a temporary Christmas position. I would definitely recommend the position and the store in general to people
good,"hardest part is working during holiday. Company has a lot of resets with very little payroll. Not many associates to schedule based on company payroll. Overall great experience, every retail company will have its ups and downs but currently with the chapter 11 bankrupcy its tough to say how long the company will stay present."
good,Was a good company and very busy store as it was run upto and over christmas period that i worked there.only left company as they didnt have the same hours available.
good,The in store branding that changes with every season demanded a creative and new look. This was exciting since it was catering to the retail market. i enjoyed working with bright colors and creating exciting designs.
good,The atmosphere in the store always made you want to push forward and have fun. We were the mascots and photographers. Bringing laughter and joy to all who entered the building.
good,I was able to complete my work efficiently and productively while still being able to enjoy conversation with interesting and charismatic people. It was a good experience.
good,"A decent place to work, although there is little room for advancement past a certain point. I worked there only temporarily, however it was good experience, especially regarding sales."
good,"A typical day at work was quite normal. Wasn't too stressful but if they rushed to get things done quickly, then it became a stress. I learned registry and sales. Management was not bad. Workplace culture was good, employees were friendly. The hardest time in the job was when one of the worst managers came to work. The most enjoyable part of my job was co-workers."
good,The work wasn’t too challenging and it was a really easy job but wish it paid more. It was always slow in the mornings but sped up as the day went on. The managers were really nice and helped with whatever concerns employees had.
good,Alot of picking and packing very good Bosses and coworkers alot of team work done they have a very good pay salary and if its a holiday they usually pay time and a half wich i loved.
good,"The management team was big, some managers were very unorganized and some were so sweet and fun to be around. Most enjoyable part was organizing our selected section."
good,Only woirked there while i was at college. Team were lovely and kind. was a fun place to work and the management made sure you got all the training that was needed.
good,"A pesar de ser solo media jornada y por temporadas, es un trabajo que te llena como persona ya que ves la felicidad de los niños al entrar."
good,"A fun work place with kids and enjoyment ,very peaceful and had no worries . The management was great , they worked with me with my schedule, and they always support you to keep going"
good,"This place had a ton of people from all different walks of life! Each department teaches you something new. Management is usually on hand to aid in any way, which makes refunds fairly easy. The hardest part of the job I'd say, is finding somebody to relieve you for your lunch break; since there is no set time for people to go, you have to wait for someone to return to relieve you, and in such a big store, you gotta find somebody. The best part is, the customers are usually warm and inviting, and like a bit of conversation when ringing them up."
good,"Its a alright place to work from my point of view. I was working seasonal overnight stocking an the times varied an days too, was not consistent with the days you work. Great people cool atmosphere."
good,"It is basically a part-time job, in which you unload freight from the truck. Then you go pack out work until its complete. The management was cool, but as with any employer they tended to act different when they boss arrived, acting as if they been on your back for completion of all things before leaving."
good,Fun seasonal place to work. Mainly running back and forth answering customer's questions and bringing stock to the front of store. Also filling in holes in floor inventory.
good,"I would mainly stock shelves and assist customers, management was nice and they were flexible with the hours, the job is kind of hectic around Christmas time."
good,"A great place to work if you're team oriented and enjoy working with people. Customer service knowledge will help you succeed in this work place. Patience is also key, especially when working with the public."
good,"co-worker are nice, always fun meeting new people. i love working for this company but sometimes they will make you do things that aren't related to the job you applied for.  overall i love the job."
good,"Management was good, hours were ok, benefits lacked, work place was always clean. If you go and work hard and people notice you will get places in due time."
good,Fue mi primer empleo remunerado.
good,"Daily looks at metric (numbers) goals. Perform at or better than previous year and supervisor will rarely bother you. Corporate staff is out of touch with what works in stores, the whole company is blanketed with same expectations and it does not work for every store."
good,working retail means every day is different.  Loved working with the public but unfortunatly retail work does not pay very well. The most enjoyable part was making children happy
good,Toys R Us  was kid focused and customer focused. a fun place to work in and in the heart of NYC time square i met all types of celebrities and people from all across the world
good,"Toys R Us with my first real job, I started off part-time as a temporary sales associate and got moved to a permanent sales Associate. My first couple of years were amazing, great management, a lot of fun to work there, and overall the job is really easy. Over the course of the next few years things kind of went downhill, but that's expected with every job. I made a lot of good friends there, some of which I still talk to, the work environment was really nice, the only thing that I didn't like was the scheduling and lack of advancement opportunities. The majority of the management and supervisory staff there have been there for years, and they weren't going anywhere so there really wasn't any room for advancement. The pay was moderate, started off at minimum wage, and gained at least $1 after that, but they weren't really about letting you make money. I was there for five years, and can say that I enjoyed most all of it, I would recommend this job to somebody looking for a starter job"
good,"The Toys R Us company is a good company, they are retail, so if you enjoy that type of environment I would say it's a good fit for you. It's nice to be able to connect with the customers."
good,continuous learning and improved management skills. Learned more about sales techniques to improve turnovers and improve profit of the business. building customer and supplier relationship.
good,"Working with kids and parents to help provide a service to all."
good,"applied in store and then got a one to one interview that day, happy because i didn’t want to do a group interview. got the job on the spot then didn’t hear from the manager in like 3 weeks so i had to call in an check but she was just waiting for my references to reply to her. got a call later saying again i got the job and i need to come in for an induction. came in for induction just went through paperwork like your card details, health & safety etc. and was shown around the store and given the uniform. bit upset because it’s a christmas temp and i want to stay for longer as overall it’s a good place to work in."
good,"Lately the company has been headed downhill but, when I began with the company, I loved it because of the variety.  Never a dull moment and never doing the same thing everyday."
good,"I enjoyed helping customers find the right gift for their children, the wage was a bit low, the schedule was perfect until the season ended. Management was very hands on and let the employees know they were there to help."
good,"Nice balanced environment ,not hard if you dont have a learning problem.Id recommend to other people.The hours are cool ,i am trying to work my way up ."
good,Job starts with a smile and end up with same smile. Toys industries survive with the customer service with smile epically with kids. Every day new product need to update about the latest toy in the market as well as in the store. Reward if you reach your target either financial or with appreciation letter or gifts.
good,I didn't work there long enough to give a review that would really benefit people of not. I was only there for a short time due to just making extra money for the holidays
good,Sehr freundlicher und atmosphärischer Arbeitsort immer wieder gern
good,"I didn't work there long enough to get a good sense of how everything worked, but I was really happy while I was there, I felt like a kid in a toy store and the people were friendly."
good,It was a very entertaining place to work. It was very rewarding to be able to help customers find what they wanted. I learned a lot about toys and what the customers would mostly look for.
good,"Enjoyed working at Toys R Us for 11 years holding numerous positions due to internal promotions from hard work, loyalty, and dedication.  This retail environment was fun with a more luxury shopping experience as opposed to what might be a necessity retailer, i.e., grocery or drug store business."
good,"Being on your feet all day straightening up constantly behind customers was my big problem, but other than that the job was cool. The most enjoyable thing about the job was being around all those cool toys, seeing the huge smiles on kids faces when they come into the store."
good,the day at work is very fasted past. i learned management skills. the hardest part is all the paper work and having people that you work with not doing what they are told.the enjoyable part is is the friendly costomers..
good,Working at Toys R Us was a good experience for me. I got to experience a lot of customer service and my manger gave me a lot of mini projects to complete on my own
good,Not really a work-life balance. As a manager achieving metrics is one of the most important things to the company. Lots of tasks to be done but must be customer oriented.
good,it was awesome working here due to the friendly people and its great environment. I never felt out of place and I would say the hardest part would be working during the holidays but other then that its very laid back.
good,"Good work place easy place to move up in work field leave room to progress .Helps community outstanding community service available ,fun place for family"
good,"was good as a first job for a kid, but would not recommend as a permanent job, wages were low , and hours relied on how many credit cards and protection plans you could sell,on a scale i would rate 5/10"
good,"El tiempo que trabaje en esta empresa aprendí mucho,el trato con mis jefes fue siempre muy bueno al igual que con mis compañeros, mi balance fue muy positivo."
good,"enter work, clean store , restock store, final clean then get off. From this i gained customer service skills , communication skills. i would say the challenge of the job would be working at night. and the easiest part of the job was having a team to balance out the work"
good,"a typical day at work would be , just use stocking the aisles and greeting customers with a smile and compassion. the hardest part of work would have been unloading the truck with only 3 people."
good,A fun environment for a first job or 2nd job. Will not work for a full time/need to pay the bills job. Hours are few and far between unless during season (Oct-Jan) when they expect you to work way more for the same pay.
good,"good energy in the building, everyone there was happy and thrilled to help out the soon to be moms or the guardianes of the young kids coming inside, which kept things peaceful"
good,"-Extremely busy during the holiday season, Slow foot traffic any other time of the year."
good,"good place to work, good environment to be in. fellow co workers are open to help when you are first starting. for the most part costumers are respectful"
good,Toys R Us is a dream come true type of job if you have an infatuation with toys and do not mind constantly being around children. The atmosphere to me was great. We were given certain goals to meet every shift and there are times you will not meet the quota but all you have to do is keep your head up and keep trying.
good,A job that involves receiving and shipping stock. Associates must restock all low inventory as well as help any store customers that need assistance with merchandise
good,"Typically fast paced on weekends and round hoidays, while some other days it can be a bit slower, but it's a great place to get customer service expreience. Great leadership from managment."
good,"I enjoyed working here, they just couldn't provide me enough hours tor salary to balance my cost of living. Every morning they have a meeting, which is for team building but to create a daily plan."
good,"I worked at TRU for over 5 years, and I loved it. I enjoyed all the staff, and just being able to help other people. I definitely takes you back to being a kid again."
good,"Assisted guest checking with out."
good,Checked inventory for correct products per customer orders. Assembled bicycles per manufacturer’s specifications. Communicated with team members successfully.
good,"I would work about 5 to 7 hours a day, I learned to work hard and to learn  as much as possible. It was relaxed work. I had fun stocking in the back with my coworkers."
good,"A typical day at work was fast paced and organized. If you weren't either of those things you were doing it wrong. I learned to use a baler, to dispose of our trash and cardboard from the boxes. Management was friendly and understanding. The culture was diverse and very open. The hardest part of the job was unloading trucks and loading the pallets; that's not saying much though. The most enjoyable part of the job to me, was being able to listen to music on the job. And the baler. The baler was fun."
good,This work place is an OK place. Just certain employees are gang members and love to steal from other people and that is pretty distracting and annoying not to me but to others.
good,toys r us is a great company to work for but can be stressful in terms of advancement. moving up within the company seemed to be something that was not quite easy
good,was a fun environment. seasonal job. glad to see the smiles on kids faces when i got to help them out. i got to learn more about teamwork and gained customer service experience as well.
good,"•	Efficiently received and inventoried trucks from the warehouse and maintained clean and organized stock room"
good,I loved watching the kids find and enjoy the toys they were going to purchase. I loved the seasonal employment around Christmas. The crew members went out of their way to help one another. the hardest part of the job was being busy during the chrstmas rush and some customers could be rude.
good,"I loved working at TRU! My coworkers were energetic, funny, and always helped me get through a rough day. The hardest part of the job was, like with any retail job, dealing with particularly difficult customers, but that's to be expected. The most enjoyable part was definitely feeling that sense of teamwork and community with my coworkers."
good,It was a great place to work at. There were nice people that worked there. The managers were flexible and willing to help. Other employees were willing to teach new employees.
good,Many of the managers have high knowledege of how the day to day operations work. Employees work together to achieve team goals. Work hours are great for school students and part time work.
good,Calm place. Well organized. Managers have high knowledge of how the day to day operations work. Employees work together to acheive common task: such as keeping store clean.
good,"A day at work consisted of unloading trucks, putting merchandise in the correct location, staging and assisting guests with questions. The days went pretty quickly due to always having something different to do."
good,"The managers at the location I worked at were awesome! They have numbers that they need to meet everyday (credit cards, warranties, batteries, etc.) but they don't punish you for not meeting a certain goal as an individual like other places. Work environment is usually fun, but hours are horrible. When I was there, almost everyone was getting maybe 12 hours a week."
good,"Aside from weekends and the holiday rush, the store is quiet and low stress at most times, but when ti's busy it's a hurricane. The job is easy enough, but you're constantly hounded to get people to sign up for the credit card, protection plan, and loyalty program, none of which hardly anyone wants."
good,Overall staff are great individuals to work with.  This facility is a great place to learn more communication skills along with customer service skills.
good,"Having a opportunity to work around toys was great, being a big kid at heart. Seeing kids come in looking for that certain toy or just playing around with a few until, they've found that specific item. Was indeed a pleasure. Helping service the kids and parents or consumers look for what they came in for was a happy experience. Sometimes you'd have some rough ones but, overall still pretty good. Benefits and compensation is an area that could of greatly been more prominent while working with the company. As well as advancement opportunities."
good,The job was alright. I wasn't able to get as many hours as I wished for. I felt like people were very disorganized. And there was never anything to do in the store because there was always a lot of people working there.
good,"fun place to work, very busy during Christmas time, but when the right group is together than it makes the experience so muc better when working in a toy store."
good,"Supervised 5-7 employees "
good,"Working at Toys R Us was a great experience in that I got to exercise my versatility. Depending on the day, I would start out with inventory counts or unloading trucks and stocking. It was always fast-paced and a good workout. Following that, I would perform various duties as required throughout the day, including working at the customer service desk taking in returns, helping cashiers when they needed a manger override, assisting guests with their inquiries and pulling large orders from the back. "
good,"I actually had fun working at Toys R Us. It was around Christmas so the store was in rush hour. I was given a list of shipment orders to go find throughout the store the package and label the completed list."
good,Nice environment to work in. Fast-paced and always something to do to keep you busy. Can be stressful at holiday time and time management is important.
good,"A typical day at work started off unloading and sorting the truck. After we stocked the shelves, cleaned up, and zoned. Some nights we picked items, packed, and shipped them out. Some nights we pulled items and fixed the merchandise in the bins. Management was great and every part of the job was easy. I enjoyed the whole job."
good,working here is so fun. you get to see the excitement of every child and parent that walks through the door. working at a company like this makes you feel like a kid again.
good,I enjoy working with good employees. That make my job  easy to come to. Working with toy can be fun to see you customer and their children was super. Looking at kids buying toys with there on money was super i enjoy that.
good,"I really enjoyed working at Toys 'R' Us. I enjoyed being in a place where a kid can be a kid.  It was a learning experience ,being that it was my first time in a corporate retail store. I'm grateful of the patience my mangers had as I learned quickly. It was definitely hectic at times, but everyone was a team player."
good,staff and management are easy going which makes the job there more enjoyable but it was ashame it came to an end but it was a temp position over Christmas
good,"senior management was great, pay was very good, no work/life balance for 2 months during the holidays, 12 to 14 hour days 6 sometimes 7 days a week.holidays are filled with temp workers and off season barely staffed"
good,my time at Toys R Us was fun and worth experiencing. The management was good and knowledgable about their job. Time working there was flexible. The most enjoyable part about the job was meeting all the people.
good,"the store is neat and organized,the staff are helpful and excellent team players. Working in shipping and receiving was fun and exciteful and everything was organized and easy to process."
good,"When I was working with Retro Fitness in Hewlett; I would sell memberships, trained staff members, make drinks, stocked drinks, closed the gym and opened every other week. Froze and cancled memberships on request. Cleaned the gym."
good,"Trabalho é bastante acessível"
good,Management is very friendly and helpful. Not much room to grow and expand in company. Great with working with a flexible schedule. Employees willing to work together as team.
good,Group meetings. Great training. Room for advancement. Highly social. Breaks and lunches in a nice break room. Secure lockers for your personal belongings. Obtain product knowledge through vender and other team members.
good,All management from Store Manager to Assistant to Department supervisors work together to ensure a smooth run of the store. They encourage and motivate each team member to do the job diligently.
good,"i had fun working at toys 'R' us, the manager is a really fun guy to be around and the rest of the team is very supportive of one another."
good,"The store is nice. Your coworkers are great, supervisors are great, and the job is easy. Although, management could use work on how to treat employees, and it's a literal struggle to get more hours. If you're new, you will have very little time to adjust, before they move you and you get yelled at. There's no real security."
good,"Great for a first job, however they never told us any important information. Didn't tell us when the job was going to end, then all of a sudden it ends."
good,It is very hard warming when you have colleagues who are willing to reach the goals set by the team leader. I have learned that a happy employee will always perform to the best of their ability and that being in a retail for so many years one has to be very patient and be willing to go an extra mile for the customer. Management support is very crucial cause they are the driving force behind the company. if all the staff members are loyal and motivated then most goals are achievable. the hardest part of the job is when you are part of management and your subordinates are negative and their moral is low. The most enjoyable part of the job is reaching and achieving the target.
good,"I was a seasonal worker, but was allowed freedom to do what I felt necessary during the shift, moved between warehouse and sales floor. Great coworkers, sometimes very slow shifts, but overall a positive experience."
good,management does communicate with each other and days off and requesting off has no system. customers have no respect for eachother or others. i did not enjoy working here
good,"Maintained a well stocked store"
good,"i learnt a lot at toys r us, such as customer service skills and how to work in a team. Also, i learnt valuable skills such as how to merchandise and how to work on a till. The management at toys r us is overall very good, the mangers are very caring of their staff and personally being part of the front of store staff was very good, my manager was very helpful when first started and was getting my head around everything. My co-workrs at toys r us were really nice, nothing was too much trouble for them and were always happy too help out whenever possible. The hardest part of the job was probably, at Christmas, the shop becomes very busy and the amount of customers does become at bit overwelmig at times. The most enjoyable part of the job has to be the satisfaction you get when you help a customer get what they want."
good,At toys r us working overnight stock is tough.  It takes a toll on your body as you cannot get a normal amount of sleep and you basically just work and sleep the two months you work there.  You will work a lot of overtime and be offered extra shifts.  I was able to make a good amount of money but was very tired by the end of season.  The management is very easy to work with.
good,Toys R Us was a fun place to work at during overnights. The managers were great for the short time I was there. The people I had to work with was nice and friendly.
good,A place where I can be myself and do my job. Following job policy is the best way to do your job and get it done right the first time.
good,It is my first and current job. Everyone is friendly and very helpful. It became a bit complicated when my work schedule started clashing with school. Overall good job.
good,"This was an extremely busy place to Work, I enjoyed the people I worked with. This was a  seasonal position so it was hard to leave once I completed the position."
good,Great Benefits from discounts to much more. Have the opportunity to meet many different people. Good job overall. But was seasonal.
good,Toys Road Us is a wonderful and fun place to be around the holidays. There are so many things to do for the changing seasons. The staff is friendly and helpful to who ever walks in the store.
good,"Upon arrival you must have badge scan gun and vest . Vest is for ppl who drive tripples or any other machine so that they see you . Scan ggus are for when you begin working ,every cart or pallet you scan you get credit for which adds to a score you get per week . never drop belove 95%. You also have to lift and stack pallets and put heavy boxes on conyeyor belts."
good,would unload trucks and place merchandise either on the shelves or in storage. Help customers with their needs. Had chances to check out new products and play with the various toys.
good,I like the people. Mangers were nice. Good amount of hours. The pay was good. I didn't like getting paid every two weeks though.
good,A nice fun place to work. I enjoyed my co-workers. I loved seeing the kids face light up with their new toys. I just wish you could get more hours.
good,"I'd have to say it was a good job helping other people out, and not having coworkers who are always upset about something."
good,Very fun and charismatic atmosphere. It's a toy store so there is always something to do to keep yourself busy as an associate. It is a specialty store so sales are very important
good,"I have worked during the holiday season at a retail position before and Toys R Us was no different. There were many shoppers every day of the week and every hour of every day, thus the store was almost always messy. I was only trained as a cashier and the down fall was that I was also never trained on much else about the store or other programs the company provided shoppers. Since I was only seasonal (and most of my time was only at a register), I didn't have to use the knowledge that I knew I lacked. This also meant that the hardest part of the job was helping customers find products in the store. Yet, management was very patient and most other co-workers were friendly. It was easy to ask questions and feel part of a team. Unfortunately, due to the little training, it would still take longer to complete certain tasks with so many people always asking questions."
good,"management was always there to answer questions, interacting with children was the most fun, price changes were the worst, always made the best of restocking shelves with co-workers, the hardest part was dealing with irate customers and smiling through the ordeal."
good,"Only worked there as a seasonal cashier, they are a great company and fun to work for, only thing is they are not very understadning when it comes to family emergancy, or your children. Pay isnt the best"
good,I love working at Toys R Us. My co workers/managers are amazing! The pressure for metrics is a little insane. Especially during Christmas time. And closing can sometimes be a bummer. But overall a good part time job!
good,"Coming to work and preparing dept. for the day. Learned much about inventory and displaying merchandise. The management was helpful for the most part, but sometimes separate. Co-workers all seemed like good people and quick learners. Hardest thing was trying to keep  1/4 of store inventory manageable daily, weekly, monthly, and so on.  I enjoyed talking to customers, learning about new things, and demoing toys."
good,"It was a fun place to work at and everyone was very friendly, I learned a lot working there and I also like helping the kids."
good,"It was quite a while ago that I worked there but I enjoyed it."
good,it was a very good company to work for. i really liked the people that i worked with. it was a very professional company and they treated everyone as family.
good,"*most days during the week would be somewhat slow until the evening when people would be getting out of work or picking up their kids. Weekends were ALWAYS hectic especially in the morning."
good,Contento y satisfecho. Los superiores eran agradables y el ambiente de trabajo era el adecuado. Los descansos eran suficientes y los compañeros se involucraban.
good,"Assisting customers ( mostly kids ) with locating different merchandise. I learned about teamwork, and balancing school and work. Management was always helpful, nice, and easy to work with. My coworkers were easy to get along with, and helpful at the same time. Th hardest part was having to leave after the season was over (seasonal job). The most enjoyable was working with kids and helping the parents locate various merchandise right before christmas."
good,"Environment is fun and enjoyable as long as you are knowledgeable in all departments and policies, required to make a certain quota per month on signing up customers for rewards and credit card programs."
good,"Either 4 or 8 hr shifts."
good,Great place with wonderful people. Everyone love the customers and willing to do anything for them. If you love toys kids and being around people this is a great place to work
good,My typical day at work was handling money and helping customers. It was my first job and the management and coworkers were very helpful and fun to work around. The hardest part of the job was the scheduling. The most enjoyable part was helping kids find their perfect toy.
good,"I unload boxes from trucks and sort them in three different ways before finally stocking the shelves and pricing the merchandise."
good,Coworkers were nice and everyday was different. I always enjoyed seeing all of the little kids that would come in and how their eyes would light up when they found a certain toy or a barbie doll.
good,typical work day consist of customer service backroom and stocking merchandise.As an employee you get to see new merchandise before they are release to the public.
good,"This job allowed me to learn the apparel side of retail. Stocking shelves, working through back stock and restocking returns, I was able to become familiar with current trends and the process of fashion displays."
good,I was able to go to work and do my job. I did not feel stress. I knew my job and how to do it. It was nice not to have someone always looking over my shoulder. My coworkers were nice as well. I learned new skills.
good,"I enjoyed working here, I was pregnant when i worked here and they really looked out for me. My co workers were really nice and the pay was not bad."
good,"Ambiente bueno de trabajo"
good,"At Toys R Us, I provided the customer with information toys, baby  gear, and worked the customer service desk. I also processed transactions and return everyday. On Saturdays I was responsible for restocking the the sales floor."

good,"I work Monday -Friday cleaning the dock, cycle counts, stocking toys, transferring items from store to store, RGD,RTV,RTW,scanning in venders items, and sending out equipment to be repaired when need. Co-works are helpful and always took care of the customers, the hardest part of the job was the new manager, the enjoyable part was when he was off for 2 days out of the week."
good,Was a fun job for what it was. I enjoy being in the environment as it keeps you feeling like a kid all the time. Also if your a toy collector or just needing gifts for kids it had a decent discount.
good,"This workplace gives opportunities to grow in work experience, and to grow as a person. Easy job to pick up on and work at, not very hard to learn the system."
good,"aprendizaje de colocación de etiquetado, colocación de almacén venta al público"
good,"While working at Toys R Us, during seasonal it was very fast paced and busy. I learned how to interact with customers better being able to boost my communication skills. The manager were very helpful but not all the time, I think they could be a little better in how they handled certain situations, but as for my co-workers, they made it a fun work environment. The most hardest part of the job was trying to encourage customers to apply for the store credit card, and the most enjoyable part was helping many people just to put a smile on their faces."
good,"I was here for seasonal so it was pretty busy all the time. I loved all the people that I worked with. It was a fun environment, I enjoyed working there. Best part was closing because you could stay later and gain more hours. That was plus. What I didn't like was closing also because of all the re-shop you had to do. It was always a lot of re-shop items in a lot of carts but it was very time consuming."
good,"Working here was okay, the pay was good but there wasn't much to do during the day other than answering the customers questions, cash them out or straightening the aisles."
good,A overall review of my job is that i was able to learn how to drive a forklift and learn the safety  procedures. Also i enjoyed working with some very down to earth manger believed in each of there workers to get the job done.
good,"The company is a great work environment, where there is different experiences with customers and colleagues on a daily basis."
good,I was only there for the season. it was  very unorganized but i made it through with a smile every day. i was actually glad it was temporary. I didn't like the way management right above me treated the employees
good,The job was great and smooth not to much pressure the only thing is the job was seasonal I would have loved to continue my career here but hey there's always next time.
good,"nice place to work. decent hours during off season, but they own you 4th quarter. pay was low compared to similar retailers"
good,just worked seasonal not much to say. just worked here for about a month. it gets crazy during the holidays. it was fun for that one month.
good,Great staff and management. Good benefits and discounts and lets not forget TOYS. Busy times are normally during the holidays. Great place to move up in the company.
good,"Toys R Us is a really fun place to be employed. It is very laid back, yet well coordinated, and you get a lot of opportunity to help people find the perfect toy to make their loved ones happy."
good,I really enjoyed working with the employees and I really enjoyed helping the customers. I would work for them again even though it was only seasonal.
good,the night shift was pretty relaxed but there was work to keep busy and let the night go by fast.  the staff was nice and down to earth while still maintaining authority
good,"This was a seasonal job that I acquired shortly after high school. I learned a great deal from the job such as how to work register, how to stock shelves, and customer service."
good,I have held a variety of  positions and have used these opportunities to grow.  I am just looking for new opportunities with another company.
good,"I worked for the Babies R Us side of Toys R Us Inc. I truly enjoyed working for this part of the business. With Special Events, constant room for advancement, learning and growth opportunities, if you work hard, show your dedication, and keep going through the constant change, you can go wherever you want with this company! They do provide ETO for sick/vacation days, and schedules are posted 2 weeks in advance."
good,Work was always fun. Management was always on top of things and responded quickly to any situation between a customer and employee. During the holidays are always hectic but everyone is always professional.
good,Being able to get to know my coworkers and how different each one of them was. An average day was helping different customers when they asked for assistance and mainly restocking product while keeping the store presentable.

good,"Staff becomes like a family within the store when you work regular hours. It's a positive, friendly, fun environment. A positive attitude and friendliness is a must to be happy and successful with this company."
good,"Toys R Us is a Great place to work atmosphere is always Happy. The Down Side of Working for the Company is, the Pay and Hours. there is No room for advancement with this certain Location. Management is Very Professional, However there are a Few Members Of Store Leadership that Don't Care so Much for some of their employees or Customers and it shows in attitude. Worked for the Company for 3 years and i  feel in Love."
good,If you love toys you will love this job even thou you might get broke every time you get your check especially around Christmas time. Management here is like every other management around you have the good the bad  the parents and children are the fun part they make your job easy or difficult just stay happy and positive to get thro the day

good,working at toys 'r' us was a fun experience one i will never forget it was a seasonal job while one day i was at work and Randy Orton came into toys 'r' us and was shopping for presents.
good,"Toys R Us is a good company to start out working for.  They have many opportunities to move up within the company if you work hard for it.  The most enjoyable part of the job was helping the customers, hands down.  They made my working there worth it all."
good,Only busy during holiday season so there is a lot of downtime without a whole lot of work to be done. Not a lot of hours to get during off season.

good,"I liked working there. I only worked the Christmas season, but I liked it. I wish I could have worked there longer. I loved working in a toy store. It was fun."

good,"Basically its E-commerce based project."
good,The company was great to work for. We were all a close knit family. The hardest part of the job would be organizing the store after busy days.
good,"Great, friendly environment to work in. The team itself is superb. I would easily accept a job as a seasonal team member again."
good,"Every day at Toys R Us is pleasant yet very stressful. My job is very challenging, and the biggest accomplishment is resolving an irate customer's frustration or bringing a smile on a child's face."
good,they make you stay more than 8 hours a day and you don't even get to chose even though is paid you have to get to choose to stay or not
good,A great place to work but lacked in advancement of its part time employees.It offers a lot of different areas to work in and learn new things but job security is an issue that should be addressed but overall is a respectable place to work if your starting off fresh.
good,"A typical day of work for me was to come and open the safe to get the register draws out and put them in the registers and get the registers ready for the cashiers for the first shift.  Get the cash out for the customer service desk put cash is the change drawer and get the registers ready.  Count the cash and make the deposit from the"
good,"loved working in the cash office and customer service desk."
good,"This job was always different every day, but it was never stressful which i found to be nice while going to school. The co-workers were nice and treated me with respect. The hardest part of the job was the large amount of time on your feet, but it wasn't that bad. The best part of the job was just how relaxing it could be."
good,I really enjoyed working there but then the store location was closing. they promised me they would transfer me to a store of my choice and they were unable to do so.
good,"Fast and fun workplace that taught me how to arrange stock on the shelves, help out confused customers about toys, and learn more about how the business works."
good,"good place to work if you want to put in the work, many people hear toy store and think they can lollygag, not true. meeting customers, and interacting with the children were the most fun. Management treated me fairly, but I did what was required too."

good,It's a fun part time job. The people I work with are great. Can get chaotic during the holiday season. Difficult to get full time work/upward mobility.
good,The most enjoyable part of my job was providing assistance to employees out on leave. I also enjoyed the many department parties and gatherings we had.
good,Was a very enjoyable working opportunity in my life. I moved up with the company so sadly the promotion pay was poor so I moved on.
good,"I held a few positions at Toys R Us. I was an overnight stocker, a cashier, and a customer service cashier. Everyone there was really great people. The hard part was that it was just a seasonal job and the hours weren't the greatest. The best was seeing all the kids."
good,"I honestly enjoyed this job, loved the people I worked with, sad when I had to leave this position for a full time one. I plan on doing seasonal again next year if I can, it's a great place to get that customer service experience."

You start to learn the purpose and the reasons they make certain toys. the mangement is excellent, and the co works are helpful and filled with joy. The hardest part of the job is getting customers to purchase an ""R"" Us Credit Card. The most enjoyable part of the job is to be able to help customers and satisfy their needs."
good,Working at Toys R Us has been beneficial for my work experience. They were great to work around my school schedule but the hours are sporadic and never the same.

good,"It was wonderful to help others. from building bikes and cars, to running the back of the house to running to the cash register to the video games section,and then back on the floor tiding up and further helping out. My day was never done you turn around one person needs help and then another it made me happy to help. Sometimes if a costumer needed I would go in the back of the store where inventory is kept and go out of my way to find the product that was needed. Helping a costumer during the holidays to make sure that if a bike wasn't built that I built it just to make that kid happy. things like that made my day and made me love working at Toys'r'us."

good,"I assisted costumers, kept shelves stocked, ran cash reregister when needed. It is a laid back work place. Like most places, it has its problems but they are not manageable. If you like toys and can relate to kids this is a good place to be. Once you find a department you like or know well, you will be fine and fit in anywhere."
good,Various functions using rf scanners as well as pick equipment to effectively pull inventory. I would sometimes work in shipping loading truck to maximum cube. In storage I would use a reach truck and turrot truck to store
good,"I always wanted to work in a toy store. It was fun learning and seeing new toys and old ones coming back."
good,Always kept busy and surrounded by people who makes the job fun. The toys bring out your inner child and remind you of when you were a kid. Never a dual moment!
good,Wish the company could have stayed at the same location and kept a lot of the workers.
good,i was in charge of putting the toys on the shelf and unloading trucks filled with toys
good,Who doesn't love working with toys? It was fun and endearing working with kids!
good,A typical day at work includes handling transactions and refunds at the cash register. I learned how to proficiently operate a cash register and interact with customers. My management was very friendly and productive. My co-workers were fun and nice to work with. The hardest part of my job was working on Black Friday at this toy store until 3am because the demand for certain toys were high and our stock was running low for my shift. The most enjoyable part of my job was seeing the look on a child's face as their parents or grandparents bought them a new toy.
good,it was a very busy job as a toys shop at christmas was very busy and tiring but i  enjoy it.

good,"At Toys R' Us, a typical work day for me begins as soon as I clock in. Most likely I am a closer and I am in guest services handling returns, exchanges or refunds. Also, in guest services I process layaways, and online orders. We get many expecting parents and newly wed couples. It's exciting and refreshing to see new faces everyday!"
good,Fun environment. I enjoyed working with my co-workers and customers.
good,"The evening's work typically began with unloading boxes from the truck and sorting them by section as quickly and accurately as possible.  Then we moved onto the floor and stocked the merchandise from the boxes onto the shelves, working as quickly as possible.  While we were pressured with verbal encouragement to get the job done as fast as possible, we were not overwhelmed or unfairly criticized.  My supervisors and most of my co-workers were friendly and easy to get along with, and willing to help when needed.  The hardest part of the job was trying to get everything done in time, and finding a place for new merchandise when the shelves were already full.  The most enjoyable part of the job was that there was always something to do, so the hours went by quickly."
good,"My typical day of work is to get started as quick as possible. co-workers really enjoyed working with me, was very accurate with information  they needed. Management didn't not have to pay attention to me, because i was so hard working. There really isn't a difficult part of my day, i adapt very quickly to situations and get them done. I really enjoy greeting and working with guest,  it gives me a chance to study body language."
good,Great company to work for with good benefits. Teamwork and support for growth in your career lacks from upper management in certain stores.
good,"Depending on your management and co-workers, you may have a great day at work, or a not so great day. Along with how the customers interact with you their children can also make or break your day. In a toy store you must have patience and compassion for the customers and their children, because in reality the children are your customers although they may not be providing the money, they are supporting your salary by asking for new toys."
good,"High energy environment a lot going on at one time, but very clam at the same because of the freedom you have meaning if your a good worker always finding something to do or someone to help you'll be find with management and your days will fly because theirs always someone to help."

The hardest part of the job was dealing with unhappy customers.  If they couldn't find what they wanted.  One time I was working the Customer Service Desk.  The customer didn't like the fact that he couldn't return a toy, so he throw it at me.  My manager was there and blocked it. The most enjoyable part was to see little kids walk out with a smile on their face."
good,Toys R Us is an upbeat place great for young people looking for work. They have many departments and you gain many skills of you have the desire to learn. They also have great opportunities for promotions. they do believe in recognition of their employees .The bonus is the benefits even if you are part time.

I learned a great aspect to retail attention for guest needs and satisfaction. Management always set the tone as an example to the team and the import of being professional. The biggest challenge was insuring all leaders to work harmoniously to the needs of the store. After this need is met, the joy of seeing the entire team of management and employees with motivation, drive and determination for GREAT CUSTOMER SERVICE is met and satisfied by the customers."

good,This was my second job ever. I was comfortable being around kids and toys though I was not that prepared for some of the adults. People wanting the rules of return policies bent to meet their needs. It was a great place to learn skills of customer service. Constantly meeting people and helping them find the toy that they desired. Treating children to balloons and a Happy Birthday announcement over the intercom was always entertaining. Love children's smile. Co-workers were just as fun as the children that came in. The hardest part was some of the really early (like 5 am) shifts.
good,It was fun to help people find toys or gifts for children and to see the joy on kids' faces when they got something new!

good,Did pretty much the same thing everyday which was layaway but I had some friendly guys in the back to spark up a conversation with to keep things from being boring. Their wasn't anything hard about what I did. Management was always checking up on us to see how things were going.
good,My position there was a sales associate which meant that I had to mainly work behind the register.
good,A typical day of work was restocking the store and make sure the store is fully stocked before the store open.

good,most enjoyable part of the job was interacting with the customers
good,Great flexible workplace! Not an ideal career job.The hardest part about the job is that EVERYONE who already works there wants to be the boss and not the worker. The most enjoyable part is working over night . The actual manager is very laid back . I learned how to use a forklift.

My managers and co-workers are all still good friends of mine and we always had a wonderful, professional relationship.

This was one of the most enjoyable jobs I have ever had."

Other than that everyone else is amazing, the hardlines manager and softlines managers are both incredibly nice and helpful."

My co-workers were very helpful in pointing me in the right direction when I needed help or finding someone who could.

good,"On a daily basis, a worker restocks shelves, keeps them tidy, and handles any and all customer questions on the floor. The managers were always roaming the store, so they were easy enough to find if needed, but they were not usually required. The coworkers were the only issue. I worked the morning/early afternoon shift, and the people that worked the floor with me were spectacular. However, the cashiers were rude and disrespectful to everyone, and the night crew would leave the store a mess every day without fail."
good,This was a fun job to have. I worked here while I was in school. I learned to become organized and became a people person. The hardest thing about the job was some people not taking it seriously and cause others to pick of the slack.

good,The only downside to working in the cash office is not being able to take any home :)
good,Once your a cashier you just get all the customers through the line and out the door as fast as possible. The night stocking you get there from 9pm to 8 am and the whole night you are stocking shelves and making sure its clean and ready for the following night.
good,it was an overall challenging jobin which constant productivity was a key aspect of everyday.Most of the management was fair and easy to get along with the only problem was the lack of promotion from within.
good,"learned how to make bales,unload trucks, scann in inventory,"
good,"I worked there and had experiences over the holidays there that I will never forget. I rang up toys for customers and their cute kids, including situations that were memorable in helping a child find exactly what they want and them finding it, and saying ""THANK YOU!"" with the sweetest smile. But management never cared much about that."
good,"Very fast paced job, alot of bending and lifting. Management was somewhat unstable,never knew what area we would be in until the last minute."
good,Working as an associate allowed me to assist customers with toys and other products. The job was extremely busy during the Christmas season
good,Working at toys 'r' us consisted of customer service with children just as much with their parents. It has a fun loving environment where you can't help but play with a toy as you are stocking the shelves.
good,Tons on smiles as you enter the store..... the people are super happy an make shoppers feel the same...
good,working at toys r us was realy good and the co-workers were great. the management was good and respected the work you did and also had good communication with myself and other workers. it was only over the christmas period but very enjoyable.
good,"High energy, fast paced job...Ran cash register, greet customers, restock merchandise,"
good,a day at toysrus involves a lot of fun and adventure. a typical day would involve some stocking and be a cashier
good,very fun nights packing out the frieght
good,babies r us was an amazing place to work. with the coworkers you have it makes everything a lot easier. you become a family with the people you see everyday.
good,Store was in need of a massive change up and the transitions that were applied made for a much easier work experience.
good,I have learned various parts of the company. I was lucky enough to learn several of the departments and become a supervisor in 2 of them. The job is very rewarding. The most enjoyable is sharing in the joy of their news of becoming expecting parents.
good,To unload shipments of toys and other supplies and place them in their appropriate areas throughout
good,I straightened shelves. I assisted customers locate toys. I put away returned toys.
good,"working over night at the flag ship Toys R 'us location was a seasonal position.very large stock team. Assisted supervisor with pricing,displays,also helped out in other departments replenishing stock as needed."
good,"A typical day for me was to come open up the store, make a daily deposit bag, create cash drawers, create signage for upcoming sales, delegate task to associates, audit cash drawers, clean up the store, close and lock up the store. What I learned at Toys R Us was a lot. I learned to be a manager and all of the duties that go along with the title. Well as for management that was partially me, but for the big guy above me he was a great teacher and a very understanding person. He was there to help with problems in and outside of work. My co-workers I would say were some of the best co-workers a team could have. Hardest part of the job would be a call out right before a shift or a no call no show. Most enjoyable part of the day would be making kids and parents happy when they could come to a clean friendly environment and leave happy."
good,"the managers made it fun, it was never a hard day even when it was a busy day at work. had a great feeling to the work place. pretty enjoyable job overall."
good,I worked during Christmas and I some times did not leave out of there until 2 or 3 in the morning due to the amount of stuff that was misplaced.
good,Good place to work. Gets really busy and hectic during christmas time
good,"My employees ranged in age and at this job in particular is where I was first introduced to backstock processing, and on the weekly basis, also intense customer service during a seasonal time of the year. Job advances available, and eventual promotion to different branches also available"
good,Toys r us was the best job that I think I had. The customers were friendly and so was the managerial staff. All of the employees were nice and friendly.
good,"Great work place, friendly employers, constant work pace. You always worked with a friend"
good,"Started as cashier, working into full time associates, merchandising and sales. I was also in charged of Juvenile Department, within 7yrs I was offered a supervisor position which required me to supervise over 25 employees and open and close the store. The hardest part was probably working over time through out the holidays. I must say I enjoy satisfying the customers knowing that I made someone happy..."
good,I enjoyed working with everyone as a team to keep the store stocked and ready for children and parents to enjoy. The staff was friendly and it made for a better work experience.
good,If you love kids Toys R Us is for you. Hours during Christmas are long but it is a challenging and rewarding experience.
good,"A typical day was checking customers out at the front register, bringing items from the back room, and facing the aisles. And or Stocking the entire store on the days I worked morning."
good,The most enjoyable part of the job is seeing the smile on someones face when you have helped them.
good,"co-workers are great and most of our managers actually do a lot of work, so I can say the one I work for is actually a good job. I've worked in retail before, and I have to say I prefer Toys R Us to the theater or clothing store I used to work for. It's not a hard job at all, seeing all the kids is fun, and as long as you can take the complaining parents, you're good to go!"
good,great job if you want something temporary if you are going to school or got something else going on. the pay could be better because of how demanding the job is and how there aren't enough employees to help customers.
good,I worked customers service most of the time. I answered a lot of the phone calls and I did a lot of returns. I worked in the cash office in the morning. They management was horrible they talked bout people behind your back a lot. My co-workers were ok. I enjoyed working customer service. But I got a raise out of working there.
good, Able to navigate management work station in order to maintain all daily Store inventory system reporting and metrics.
good,Great place to shop but to work not fun at all. Working for minimum at $8 and work hard especially in the receiving area not fun.
good,I was in floor sales in the babydoll department. I enjoyed helping little girls pick out dolls and helping people pick out gifts for their loved ones.
good,A pretty good company to work for. Somethings could really be worked on as a corporation but each store as its own is a little different.
good,"Great part time job , learned alot on the job , was given more work when i asked , good managers"
good,It was fun and I enjoyed the sales and discounts. And my regular customers and their families.
good,i have learned to manage and the co workers and i are very close
good,"As soon as I arrived, within minutes I knew what I was doing, and as soon as my manager knew I was in, he came and found me to say what I was covering today."
good,Working at the cash register.
good,"Loved this job! The night would start off with a group meeting of job plans and we would start working efficiently until luch afterwards we were encouraged to keep working. Management was great , friendly, caring and understanding. Co-workers were hard workers similar to myself. The hardest part of the job was leaving the position ( i really oved the job) . The easiest part of the job was assisting the costumers ( I work well under pressure) ."
good,"The kids coming in and out made the day go by real quick, and when you're on on the floor you get to actually show how the products work to the potential customer"
good,"Typical day at work was stocking shelves, cashiering. Co-workers were easy to work with; the hardest part of the job was not having a study work schedule, enjoyed working with the public."
good,A typical work day as off hours stock crew at toys r us could be pretty hectic depending on the size of the semi load of goods.
good,"I absolutely loved this job, all that I learned, and grew and was able to accomplish, the breaks were always scheduled, I worked the shift I was scheduled, the management and staff were fantastic. I am just disappointed it was seasonal."
good,Great place to meet people. Relationships with customers can get personal. Sales work is very involved.
good,"Not much is asked of you, just help customers find toys that fit them and there kids."
good,Company staff were welcoming. Job duties clearly outlined
good,it was a fun and very enjoyable work experience and i wouldn't mind going back to do it again. supervisors
good,Toys R Us is a great place to work. You have to deal alot with the public so for that reason you have to be a patient person when dealing with toys. Gave me opportunity to show other skills
good,I started working here when I was 4 months pregnant and I have a great time.
good,ToysRus was a wonderful company to work for. It was very family oriented and the people were awesome. Working with toys and electronics were exciting to analyze and this made the job a lot more interesting.
good,i was able to pick up skills like changing prices loading the store unloading the truck and about to just learn
good,"Working here seasonally was very fun, yet busy and fast paced."
good,"this is THEE place to be, when it comes to toys and a ride on the ferris wheel."
good,nice and friendly enviroment with respectable staff and managment
good,"Employees work together when one employee needs help. For example, when a cashier needs to verify a promotion, the cashier would call the department. Back up cashiers would come and help the cashier on duty to improve customer satisfaction."
good,This is a good seasonal job to hold you over for extra money. You can really learn how this chain remains top in its status amongst toy stores and babies. The sales items be very good but at times supplies can be limited.
good,this type of work has to deal with a lot of movement and is fun with the toys and products that you have to deal with an help sell.
good,"Fun, fast paced envirionment, constant cashiering, putting toys away, strong customer contact. Selling credit to customers as well as sighning up for the rewards program."
good,"This was my first job and it was a nice job, very friendly people to work with. Management was very nice and the had great benefits"
good,"Helping kids and parents find the perfect gift for their loved ones. Super fun environment, busy at all times & dealing with many different type of customers. Fast pace as well."
good,A typical day at work started with the manager on duty informing me of what register I was working at that day. I improved my cash-handling skills through this job. Management was full of kind people who were motivated to keep customers happy. The hardest part of the job was learning closing procedures. The most enjoyable part of the job was helping a parent find the perfect gift for their child.
good,It was great but they closed so I was out of a job and the ppl were in clicks with management other then that I lived it I wish they would have stayed open on Baltimore it was a good place to shops for kids they had everything
good,Toysrus is the best ever. We were giving the costumers good customer service and the business was performing very well also the management was fair enough. It was very a good place to be.
good,"It is a nice starting job, not to stressful and the pay was very decent for the work you're doing. I would recommend if you need a quick job with decent pay."
good,Love working with this company sad that they went out of business. This store made it eazy for alot of peple to shop for what ever event. I grew up in this store sad it closed.
good,"I enjoyed my time at Toys R Us, working with my team made it enjoyable to work everyday, I mostly enjoyed helping and communicating with customers and children and making their visit also very enjoyable and memorable."
good,"Fun work place. Very patient co workers and supportive. I was pregnant at the time and they were understanding most of the time. I could have my water with me during work just no sitting during work, which was hard due to being pregnant."
good,"The store manager disliked me a lot. Not sure exactly of the reason. I did my job properly. I only called off when it was absolutely necessary. Even customers noticed that he disliked me. His treatment made me very aware of the fact that I would not work with him ever again. So, it was not Toys R Us the company, but the manager that made me uneasy about going to work. I dealt with the best I could and was glad when I did not have to work for him anymore."
good,"Easy tasks, fun work environment, but ultimately we need more staff to help alleviate rushes of customers and to enable time off/shift coverage. More staff would allow better customer service, lower wait times, and aid in staff burn out. Management also needs to have more team meetings to establish mutual rules, roles, and policy observance."
good,"While working at Toys' R' Us it was a fun fast paced stocking job, I restocked shelves from products in the back, helped retrieve customer online orders, moved big stock items from the back to the customers car(sometimes weighing up to 100 pounds.), and helped to organize store through out the day."
good,"The staff and management are all very friendly and easy to approach. Being a toy store the overall environment is mostly enjoyable. The christmas season is especially tasking, but feels rewarding."
good,"work days are busy no real down time which was great. Management was not always easy but they were fair.Toys are us had ttheir own way of doing things which was great."
good,"Unloading truck and stocking shelves "
good,Toys 'r' us was a nice and friendly place to work.the supervisors were nice and I always had an opportunity to get extra hours. I was working third shift and that was convenient for me and my family.
good,A shift of being at the tills for purchases and customer services and refunds. the environment was safe and the co-workers were very nice. Management was very nice and helpful. the whole workforce was very helpful and worked as a team.
good,Company was fun to work for. Lots of room for Advancement. Faat past never dull customer service driven work experience. Upper management was a lot to deal with
good,"Buena organización, óptima relación horas trabajadas y salario, se trabaja las horas establecidas y formación previa."
good,"Out of business now but at the the time  merchandising unloading trucks and setting sections to planogram very valuable lessons. The workplace culture at the time was positive and focused on our children shoppers and their parents. The hardest part of the job was doing it all in the payroll guidelines given, but I think you find that in every job. The most enjoyable part of the job was working with the children in picking out toys for them,"
good,This was my first job and I can honestly say if they were still a business I would go back in a heartbeat! I had so much fun here and my coworkers were like a second family!
good,"Toys R Us for all intents and purposes has gone out of business. No review necessary. The corporate culture was the inevitable death of the business, not the so called debt burden."
good,My manager worked with my schedule because I had more than one job. The team helped each other out to make sure all of the assignments were completed.
good,"I worked there got good hours at first then less and less hours. Got off work at midnight some times would have to unload truck at 5am in morning. Management was great on a personal level,but stricked"
good,"I would go restock, straighten and clean shelves if there wasn’t many customers. I learned how a work place is ran and how it functions. The most enjoyable part about the job was asking how a customers day was."
good,"Toys R Us was a very fun job and my first foray into retail. It really is a great place to work and a fantastic company as well. I learned a lot there and while it's been forever since I worked there, I still remember it fondly."
good,"The workplace and environment was nice it's just that if you didn't work register, you would be constantly busy, and always on the move. There wasn't anything hard about the job at all."
good,"The compensation would decent, $10/hr and $13 on weekends and willingly gave Holiday pay. Most of the management was easily approachable and willing to work with a student schedule. The one downside was that there was no clear lunch/break schedule ever."
good,This was a very busy operations for the Cincinnati Distribution Center.  The team worked hard and overcame obstacles everyday to ensure all trucks were on the road timely.
good,I liked to work at Toy R Us.  We had opportunity to advanced. However the pay was to low for the work that we did.  The incentives to get a credit card was not good. I loved helping the customers.  The company gave me opportunity to work on my own or as a team
good,Great work/life balance. Compensation and benefits are excellent. Good department communication. Wonderful company events. Clean and safe work environment.
good,"I had a great working experience as a cashier.  The staff were very friendly and team oriented.  Because it was seasonal they were only hiring for Christmas season.  I would like to have stayed, great people to work for."
good,"This was my first real full-time job. I started in the warehouse, picking large ticket items for customers, storing items, and unloading trucks. I moved up over the years to IRS, Inventory Receiving Specialist. I was given much more responsibility and keys to the doors and trash compactor, which was usually limited to management only. I left after 12+ years for Horizon Hobby. I sometimes wish I would have stayed. However, now the business is closed."
good,Toys R Us gave me an opportunity to work in a new environment and meet new people. Despite it only being temporary I will always be thankful to the company that was willing to give me a chance to prove what I was capable of.
good,"There is never a dull moment from infants to even adults who need or want there specific toy, from pacifiers to legos the list is endless. You get the full Monty to the different types of customers. You get your easy customers and your difficult ones but is how you find a way to please the customer in what they want trying to pull stock from other stores. But in my time I was there i found if very productive and fun I was part of management and found very interesting on how the buyers strategise or budget on toys. Toys r us is not only about toys its about babies or first time moms who want the different strollers of formulas, to nanny cams to nappies. There are different wants at different ages digital gaming, or family time games try to scrabble it together. It was just very fun time."
good,"Working for a company with rapid growth required rapid plan execution across all areas of the company, which I enjoyed and thrived. "
good,Too bad the company had to close. Some companies do everything they can to do the right thing and Toys did up until they couldn't anymore. I can think of lots other companies that should have been closed before Toys. See Shopko as a example...
good,"Es un puesto de trabajo donde juegas con la ilusión de los niños, por lo que se pone mucho empeño por parte del director como por los trabajadores en hacerlo todo lo mejor posible."
good,Working at Toy R Us was a great experience. Management was also helpful with training and growth which helped me performed my task better. I really enjoyed my time there.
good,"they were respectful managers, flexible hours, understanding caring team, employee discounts, they made work enjoyable, i had to put away returned items, did cashier and customer service throughout the day"
good,Going to work was always fun it never really felt like i was working. Everyone always had fun with each other. Customer interaction was okay we did have to deal with some unpleasant customers but that happens anywhere you work.
good,I thoroughly enjoyed my short time being employed here. Interview was fun. They worked with me as a single mom at the time. I had awesome managers but co-workers were hit or miss. I enjoyed the holiday benefits.
good,Buena valoración. Muy contento y contentos conmigo. Buena flexibilidad laboral y salario asequible. Nulas oportunidades de promoción o permanencia como punto negativo.
good,I really liked working for toys r us it was a very nice & friendly place were kids love d & looked forward to coming to this was a place that I really did not want yo see close down my time with toys r us was beautiful I loved talking yo the people very friendly & my co-workers I loved are relationships they were very outgoing people I loved my job & I would truly miss working for toys r us
good,it was an extremely fun place to work and a great company. its to bad they had to file chapter seven bankrupsy. I could have seen myself working there for many years to come.
good,"fast pasted work days and competitive co workers, management was lacking communication skills with employees but over all a great place to work. I was sad to know that they were closing."
good,i enjoy working to help the customer and helping them to find and help them through all the way until they leave the store.thank you for getting me top were i am.
good,"A typical day included assisting customers with locating merchandise as well as retrieving big ticket/electronic merchandise."
good,My overall experience working for Toys R Us was a good one. The work wasn't to hard and we would always help each other out. Every was really nice. And there was always snacks in the break room.
good,"I think Toys ‘R’ Us has a nice, friendly and cheerful  atmosphere. It can get stressful around the holiday season because customer’s want their items, but it is bearable."
good,"Everyday we would get equipment and depending on your role in the company you would start on projects or do busy tasks.  Supervision was dependent on how long you worked on company.  If you were newer you were more scrutinized because your performance was important if you were to be kept for longer than season.  When it was busy, it was a bit stressful, but your coworkers were there to help you in tense situations."
good,"Like the work, fun place, great hours and great customers. Would have like to stay there more. weekends and holidays was busy.  children would run...."
good,"Typical day was from before open until late afternoon. I'd set my team up for success and ensure our customers were taken care of. "
good,Working as a stocker was easy. It was only stressful when there were huge trucks to unload. If you want to advance in the store you had to put forth the effort otherwise no one would teach you.
good,"I enjoyed my year at the store near my home town. Unfortunately it closed down exactly one year from my start date. I quickly advanced within my particular store and thoroughly enjoyed not only the people I worked with, but the work that I did."
good,"I thoroughly enjoyed my time at Toys R Us, I felt very comfortable working for the company and especially liked seeing the smiles on the faces of children.   I was deeply saddened by the news that they were going out of business.   Overall it was an amazing experience."
good,"Learned a lot.  Associates were helpful , most willing to teach you if you didn’t know how to do something.  Some management were better than others.  Some just expected you to know how to learn new systems without training."
good,"Decent enough place to work during its foreclosure. Days were spent straightening out products on shelves, working the registers and assisting customers as needed."
good,"Very fast paced during season, family friendly environment, a little behind technologically but catching up."
good,At Toys R Us it was a very fast work pace which meant we had to restock before or even while the customers were there no matter what we had to keep the shelves full. There is always something that needs to be done rather it’s walking around helping customers or walking around making sure restocking was or was not needed
good,more work then could ever get done with the size of the teams in place to do the work. had to constantly work as fast as possible to keep the store going and get other projects done.
good,"You constantly had something to work on. Managers, for the most part, were easy to work with. They worked with you rather than you just working under them. Fellow co-workers were easy to get along with and made the more mundane workdays enjoyable. Everyone helped each other out and worked towards the same goals."
good,"I enjoyed being trained is several different dept so i could be more flexible. I enjoyed the atmosphere and being able to work with and around people. This company is very understanding and willing to work with you,"
good,"Toys R Us is a good company to work for, I wish they were not going out of business. Management was great to work for, never had a manager I disliked."
good,"This job was a lot of fun for a first job, the staff was super laid back. It was a great place to learn the ropes, and by the time the store shut down I was able to teach others what I had learned. I loved the people that I worked with, and I really enjoyed the calm atmosphere that was provided. However as the store neared complete closure, I began to dislike my position because there were not many customers."
good,I started here when I was 5 months pregnant and was able to work til I couldn't work any longer.  The management was very understandable of my circumstance.  I was able to gain the knowledge I needed to assist customers and myself with my first child.  I enjoyed assisting other mothers-to-be with their shopping essentials and questions.
good,"Begin the day in our group meeting with the store manager to know our goals and find solutions to reach them. Then we would all maintain our designated areas by stocking, facing, and cleaning our areas. Greeting and assisting customers was my primary goal. The work was easy and interacting with customers was always a pleasure, but management often pushed credit card sign-ups down everyone's throats... including customers."
good,"As the company struggled financially, the rules (both company and legal) were pushed aside. The amount of work expected of a supervisor and manager was not realistic. The amount of hours allotted to each store was cut dramatically, thus at times, causing an unsafe work environment."
good,"Toys r us was a great place to work, very unfortunate that the company is closing.  Management was easy to work with.  Hours were flexible.  I only left the company to go to college in another state."
good,"Cool place to work."
good,"My experience with Toys R Us Inc. has been great. The main reason I am leaving the company is because it is going out of business. Typical day required to meet with the store Manager and gather feedback and latest information about the store. Manage my shift includes Customer service, customers complaints. Overrides, cash drawer functions, closing the store. Managing Team Members and assign tasks."
good,"If you love working with outgoing fun people and a love for toys and meeting new people, working overnight it's a job for you. The management team was very helpful and telling you what's to be done"
good,they offered good work hours. it is very fast paced from the second you hit the door its go time. they are team oriented. you feel a sense of achievement when done.
good,"the job is easy pretty fun. had to memorize all the aisle and toys."
good,"A very relaxed environment. On your feet most of the night organizing and delivering merchandise. Customer service is a big deal around the holidays, always keep a smile."
good,"Good place to work, everybody helped each other, generous coworkers, helpful and enthusiastic managers, good schedule and opportunity to work overtime in the peak of the season"
good,"While ToysRUs was a great place to work, the company is now in liquidation and will be closing all stores.  Unfortunately, this iconic American brand is now coming to an end due to its heavy debt load."
good,I really enjoyed working at toys r us as it was a fun and friendly place too work. There isn't one thing I enjoyed about working in toys r us as I enjoyed the whole job. I loved going to work. The hardest part of the job was in the first week as I was just getting used to the job.
good,"At it's prime Toys R us was a great company,"
good,"A typical day of work at toys R us is cashing people out, putting away carts full of product, and then fixing the store. I have learned how to be a good worker and how to do my job correctly. The management is good there. They are very organized and know what they want from someone. The hardest part of the job is putting away all the product. The most enjoyable part is again working with the customers and making their child's day by finding them they toy that they wanted."
good,I have fun working there for ten years meet a lot people make fun for kids when they used come looking for a specific toy it was joy to how they eye would light up that make me feel great ...
good,I enjoyed my time with the employees and children. However there are many of us losing our jobs due to the Toys R Us stores closing. Toys R' Us was a great place to work.
good,"This place was a blast to work at, loved my co-workers and the over setting. Sadly toys, is closing all across the US so it wont be a job available any longer."
good,Toys r us is a good job but the only thing i bever really had a off day management was ok and some of the management is very dissrespectful i worked full time it is a very tireing job only 3 people unloading a 3000 box truck
good,Working at TRU was very insightful. I learned a lot about working in a warehouse-related area as well as more and I learned how to do tasks I didn't know I could do. I honestly wish I had a little more time at my position but the fact that it looks like the entire company is about to go down I can't stay there.
good,"Overall, a positive place to work. Toys R Us recently filed for bancrupcy and I'm seeking a new career with an up and coming company,"
good,"I loved working for this company. Wonderful coworkers and a fun, fast-faced environment. Great benefits/salary. Sad to see this company become extinct."
good,"I enjoyed working there. Plain and simple. I needed work for the  Christmas season, and this took that spot, my coworkers were all of an agreeable sort, and if I had the chance, I'd like to work there again."
good,Strategy of the company has been inconsistent over the years. Great people and atmosphere. Enjoyed my ability to be creative and business minded in one role.
good,I worked during the Christmas holiday season in the Baby R Us Dept and it was ever-changing and quick-paced. I enjoyed working with customers expecting and sharing in their lives during an exciting time.
good,"great management - feel apart of the team as well as equal. I can talk to management and not be put down or feel like my opinion doesn't matter. "
good,"A typical day at work changes by the hour.  I check email and reply to if needed. Then travel to stores to visits, give feedback on differ way to drive sales and service.  After every visit I send a recap the District and Regional managers. I host conference calls on Tuesday every week.  I present on updates to our specialty business on weekly regional calls.  "
good,"If you enjoy working with children and have great patience, this is a place to work. Very fast paced and always must be available to relocate. Have to be willing to put in extra hours during Christmas season"
good,"Complicated at times, but always rewarding at the end of the day. Everyone has fun, it's never boring in a toy store, and the majority of management was incredibly friendly and helpful. The most difficult part was high stress environment due to being extremely understaffed, but resulted in me learning how to multi task VERY well, as well as get things done successfully and quickly."
good,Each day presented new opportunities. We had a great kinship amongst employees. Everyone worked well together and that made it a fun and engaging place to work.
good,"In my many years working at Toys R US there were a lot of ups and downs and in the past few years more downs then ups, but it was still a fun place to work."
good,"Fast pace fun place to work. Learned great product knowlwdge, learned what toys are hot with each generation and learned a lot about the technology world of toys."
good,"As someone who worked retail for Toys R Us as a seasonal employee I can confidently say the experience was average. I do not have many complaints about it due to the fact that I knew what I was getting myself into working at a toy store during the holidays. However, there were many good things when it came to working at Toys R Us such as kind co-workers and managers, the people who came into the store were usually happy and if you like kids then there's no better place to work you to get to see them everyday. I worked mostly as a cashier but also went around the floor and brought in truck deliveries hours varied but we're not something that was unmanageable.overall my experience was pretty good."
good,"I loved my job here. However, through misunderstandings Mistrust and Lies, I was forced to leave my job. It was a huge disappointment as I saw myself as a long term employee."
good,I had too do a lot of lifting and physical work. I learned fast and also work well with others. Hardest time there was having too do truck with just two ppl cause no ones else came in but we got it done. No matter how hard the work or task is it’ll get done correct
good,"it was a great experience for me, learned so much. The crew had a great initiative and were very friendly. I would recommend thisjob to anyone that qualifies."
good,"Nice store manager and most of the time it is a relaxing environment. Although, it is very much like a high school in ways to where the gossip can overflow within just a few minutes."
good,A typical day at Toys r us is making sure every aisle is full with toys & electronics with a team. I learned how to assist customers better. The workplace culture is a good environment everybody comes to work hard & work as a group. At toys R us there is no challenging work.
good,great job and fun place to work for. I enjoy it and enjoy begin around co-workers. met a lot of great people. working graveyard is relaxing. def good.
good,i come in and wait a few minutes til im told where to go i learned how to use a inventory online the mangement was good and the hrdest part is how slow it can get and the most enjoyable is the customers
good,Good work place good people to work around very busy place which is good because time fly's . I will love to work there again for the holidays  good experience.
good,"Peers make the job bearable. Overnight stock is physically demanding, and perhaps on purpose or coincidentally they scheduled me on days that were spaced out at first, which was nice because it gave me time to get use to the physical demands. Management was mostly nice. Biggest complaint is that in an 8hr workday you're supposed to get a second 15min break and they didn't disallow it but it was sort of strongly discouraged to take it."
good,"I worked in"" Toys R Us"" Hyannis, Ma.,during the Christmas season(2017). I did the overnight shifts.(no longer available).,Altho extremely fast paced and hectic, it was fun and thoroughly enjoyed my fellow employees and management!! As a single mom who has my only child in college it was an amazing opportunity to get out of my normal ""day to day"" routine. If they had overnight shifts year round i would certainly have loved to have stayed!!!"
good,"Learning new things everyday, the fun of it one feels free to learn other job for experience purposes and one learn to olways keep come with a custermer and I'll so to know how to treat custermers ,it was a fun job to do to see the smile on young ones holding their toys in brings lite,the hardest part of the job stock taking couse you will never know what happens for the shortage,"
good,"It's a job like any other."
good,nice job long hours all the overtime you can get. rude managers . only leave on asigned off time everyone once in a while most of the time its mandatory to.
good,".slow in the beginning"
good,"My husband was admitted to ICU, I couldn't return to my seasonal job. I can't fairly rate this company, I wasn't there long enough. I felt the merchandise wasn't competitive enough with places like Walmart."
good,"worked a lot of hours, learned that it takes a lot of technology, employees were friendly, too many places for mistakes, lots of activity made for a lot of variety."
good,I was supervisor in infant and toddler colthing at kids R us. It closed all the stores. they lrt us unload the truck then told us. We were given choice to go to toys r us  or babies r us . I was scouted out by the manager of babies r us tto be Special Promotion coordinator. I accepted the job and was the top rated spc. and started first spanish carseat checks and parenting classes.with the help of orlando zappata spanish speaking firefighter.Also partnered with Well Star for breastfeeding classes and wellness seminars.
good,"Babies r us is a pretty chill job especially for those with no experience. It was my first job but I do plan on leaving in pursuit of other jobs. You WILL have to be able to multitask and do a little bit of everything. You will eventually learn how to do almost everything in the store but it makes you feel like you don't get paid enough for all that you do. I know how to do everyone's job and most of the time it feels like it do it too. You get minimum wage and annual raises that are usually anywhere from .07-.25 (if you are lucky). They pressure you a lot to get credit card sign ups and if you are a cashier it is a requirement; They will cut your hours if you do not produce results. It's not bad as a first job to have for a while but definitely not something to be doing long term as there is little room for advancement and moving up within the company. However, the staff is pretty good and you do get paid vacation and earned time off that you accrue with every hour you work; You can use this time whenever you like as long you request off 2-3 weeks in advance."
good,"I enjoyed working there. I didn't like the pay, but I had to do what I had to do. I wish the starting pay was more than 8.00 because it is more to that job then just assisting customers. I think more people would stay if the pay was better if given the opportunity."
good,Locked in the night shift prepares the store for the next day. We would divide the store into sections and stock products for the next day. I enjoyed that I could listen to my music and just do my thing. Breaks were very regular and everyone took one at the same time.
good,"It's a good first job, you learn a lot and they are willing to let you learn how to do everything around the store. Pretty fun working environment. a lot of independent work easy to keep focused."
good,"nice company and works enviroment but not enough salary given..always need to work overtime buat unable to claim.."
good,"Toys R us as an overnight stock was very chill and easy job to do, at times it felt slow.  The people were nice and helpful when you needed help on how to do something."
good,i learn so many things in toys r us company. The store management i face was so playing politics with me and other staff also.we cannot breath easily inside store always pressure of work and merchandising always.
good,great customers help them fins the items they were looking keep the isles organized and clean try and sell product protections and warranties as well as credit cards provide excellent customer  service cash out customers
good,"Toys r us where kids can be kids.Great employees and customers. Fun, fast paced environment. Ability to move up if intrest is shown does hire from within for managers."
good,"My coworkers are family but the corporate management is terrible. They expect you to go above and beyond for them while giving you no incentives. The raises are laughable at best, and they have zero appreciation or loyalty for people that are loyal to the company. A lot of great employees leave because they are not paid fairly or recognized for the job that they do."
good,"A typical day at work during the night was pretty slow until Christmas got closer and closer the store became more busy. I learned that i should be a better customer when going places because working at customer service can be difficult dealing with different attitudes and things, but now that I am experienced I realize you cant let and unhappy customer affect you personally its just apart of working. the hardest part of the job was getting on the cash register experienced. the most enjoyable was being able to get along with everyone at work."
good,"It was fun and joyful, but managers were favoriting and inconsiderate and the discounts are nothing.  Practically paying full price. No security,  and not enough time for breaks and lunches."
good,"Typical day at work was handling online web orders, pick-up orders, customers requests for certain items and unloading boxes for overnight crew. Making sure every isle is fully stock and neat and clean"
good,toy's r us benefited me in my costumer service skills. i learned how to be a sales associate and work in a quickpace enviromet. overall toy's r us was a great learning ecperience.
good,Decent work environment for a first time job seeker.  Room for growth and ability to transfer/move to other stores for job progression within the company.
good,Pretty good place to work overall. Work expectations were realistic and the other employees were fun to work with. The only complaints I have were the store manager at the time I worked there who has since left the company.
good,"I enjoyed working at ToysRUs very fast passed and nonstop busy during Christmas season. I don't like the way they let us go. I came in to work and said thank you and told me to go home, others also."
good,Assist guests with any questions or concerns during the holiday season. Restock and maintain clean stores. Must be able to work in a fast paced and chaotic environment.
good,I was a seasonal stocker and actually loved the job! Though I had another job at the time so it took a toll on me. I would recommend anyone to work there!
good,"it was okay, i worked overnight during the winter season so it was always busy, everyone was very nice and for a first job it was great. i would do it again if i could,"
good,"typical day at work is busy , co workers helping customers. getting down bikes , strollers , anything check if we have thing available for them.  making it easier for them."
good,"Fancy a job using the finest technology 1994 can offer?  Love clunky DOS-based computer systems, intermittent internet connections, 9-5 IT support in a 7-day week shiftwork environment and management who view you as a minimum-wage monkey in a polyester polo-shirt? Then come to Toys R Us!"
good,Toys R Us has a very fun atmosphere with a generally good community of people to harbour it. typical work can be very time pressing as work loads are often large and time frames are small but can often be achieved when hard work is put in.
good,You tend to notice everyone there is lazy. Store manager was a push over. Assistant store manager doesn't know how to do a majority of the work he delegates. You very well might end up being the only one doing any real work. Don't let them take advantage of you. Do your work only and let the rest struggle or else they will never pick up the slack.
good,At Toys R Us I worked seasonal overnight shift.  One big crew would be split into at least 5-6 groups.  The shift leaders were always helpful.  We unload the trucks and packout the toys.  At the end of every shift we clean up the cardboard.  Overstock goes to the back or on the headers.  Recover the toys or facing.
good,As far as an entry level sales job goes it's not bad. Didn't see much of an opportunity to get promoted/ get a pay raise but that's expected from a minimum wage sales job. Environment and co-workers are fun in and outside of the workplace. No benefits or paid time off.
good,Toys R Us is a very good entry level job.  Responsibilities are very simple to learn such as basic cash register use and merchandise knowledge. On a normal day I would help guests in the store locate items and then make sales on the register. At the end of the day we would be assigned a department to clean up for the next day. The workers as well as management were really supportive in helping guests and each other as well as making any day enjoyable to work in. Every now and again you can get a difficult customer that will test your patience.
good,"A good job but lacking in adequate employee compensation for those who weren't applying for a managerial position. I was hired on as a seasonal employee. TRU was the first job where I'd learned how to operate a cash register and help incoming customers. I was, later the next year, asked to return but had already found another job and moved on."
good,"this was a temporary work Experian's for one year"
good,"For me it was just a in the mean time job, I wouldn't say its for a career, but not a bad place to work to get a start or gain work experience. The pay is decent and you can work your way to high levels if you wanted, but wasn't for me."
good,a place where i stay longer than my family a place where you can learn everything.You cannot feel the pressure of  having a job because working at toys r us is almost playing the whole day.
good,i worked there to different times first was right out of high school i most deff learned a lot in the work force enviroment and got to meet lots of people
good,"Excellent training and , skills taught in a variety of areas. Customers we diverse , children of all ages."
good,"I really enjoyed my time at Toys R Us. I think it was a good concept, that couldn't really keep up with a brand that was already well established in Ireland and had a loyal customer base. I can't fault the workplace though. I enjoyed my time there."
good,Muy agusto en el desempeño de funciones asignadas y buen ambiente laboral.
good,The people were generally nice especially since they were mostly parents. The only complaint would be the forced work at other locations the management had us do during holidays and peak sales months such as black friday and christmas.
good,"Very challenging work environment, ever changing business requirements, must be self motivated and capable of learning on your own, very hectic work days, the hardest part of the job was dealing with management because they do not communicate strategy and do not delegate and is not open for new ideas without explaining reasons. Most enjoyable part is the nature of the job it self dealing with international markets in over 10 countries and delivering systems & solutions to support all different business models & requirements."
good,"公司很體貼,同事相處融洽,令我投入工作,邊的同事都有很強的凝聚力,大家都有很強的凝聚力,令我獲益良多。"
good,"My time working at Toys 'R' Us was seasonal only and limited hours. Aside from standing for many hours at a time, there were few things that I disliked. The staff and management I worked with were great, aside from the training staff. Being a toy store, the environment was usually positive and filled with smiling children. I would highly recommend the job to someone who enjoys children and enjoys working with customers."
good,"If you love kids, toys, and electronics- this is the place for you. There is always something to do there and you get to meet a lot of truly awesome people."
good,The people where very friendly to work with and helped with any problems i was having. I had courage to go to any other member of staff to ask for help.
good,"Buen trabajo, dinámico aprender de la venta al público, montaje tanto de bicicletas como de material de puericultura"
good,Either you know someone or you don't . If you do the. Your promised the permanent jobs but if you do not know someone then your chances at a permanent job may as well be slim to none . A lot of good employees are overlooked .
good,"I enjoyed what little time I was with the company, it was a great overall experience. Management was great and helped the reduce the learning curve of my new job. I learned a lot of new leadership skills from the management there and how to make plans for the week and how to delegate task to my team members."
good,"Not enough hours or pay to live off of this job alone. Had to have another source of income. Management was unfair, there wasn't much opportunity if you weren't one of the managers favorites."
good,"Toys R US is a good company to start off if you are looking for customer service and cash handling experience. The environment is okay, it does get pretty busy there on the weekends and especially holidays. The store is really big so be prepared to learn different departments. I wish the pay was higher and that there were more hours. Overall pretty okay place to work at."
good,Working specifically in the FC Department I found the job satisfaction is mainly based on the other employees there. very basic tasks and simple training.
good,Finding difficulty transitioning to modern consumer behaviors.  TRU has been in a whirlwind of change for change sake for near a decade.  Associate experience is not high quality
good,The company stride to treat the workers equal. The management was very nice and wanted every co worker thoughts. There was nothing hard about working for Toysrus/Babiesrus company.
good,The atmosphere is childlike and lively. I learned how to be a cashier from an amazing staff. Team work was key. The hardest part of the job was knowing that it was only seasonal. The environment including the staff made the job all the more enjoyable.
good,"Typical day of work consisted of assisting customers, answering any incoming phone calls, neatening up the store to ensure cleanliness and stocking items to make sure all shelves were stocked. What I learned is to be a lot more patient with customers if they are rude. The hardest part of the job was telling customers that we didn't have the product we have in store and having them to go to another store. The most enjoyable part of the job was assisting guests in making sure they got all the toys they need."
good,"Working here is really fun, and you must be able to stand on your feet all day, so wear comfortable shoes. I enjoyed helping people the most at this job."
good,Trained by staff in cash room. The environment was unorganized but I could usually find a permanent employee to answer my questions.
good,"It was a great place to work but getting people to sign up for credit cards is huge. "
good,A typical day at work is clocking in and going straight to work on the register and checking out customers. The day was very busy and hectic but it was still enjoyable because it was fast paced and energetic.
good,"my work day consisted of going into work at 3:30pm and work until 2am. the whole receiving team had to reach a certain goal by the end of the night, we had to work as a team to get trailers unloaded in a decent amount of time. the management was pretty good. i dont have much to complain about there. my co-workers were great everyone got along, the hardest part of the job was getting motivated at the beginning of some days. the most enjoyable part of the job was working in a friendly environment. the team was always so happy to help."
good,"Toys R Us provided a comfortable workspace. The co-workers I had were pleasant and amusing whilst the Manager was fun but also very strict. I worked as a truck/stock crew member, unloading, sorting, stocking merchandise and maintaining our work-space to be as clean as possible. I also helped customers from time to time, when we were open."
good,"Its n OK place to work, Only thing bad is they don't pay well and the only Employees that gets hours are the Managers/Supervisors."
good,"* During the night shift  I stock every toy where they belong."
good,"As an employee at ToysRUs, I admit that the benefits for both employees and customers are amazing. I don't agree with the fact that they work us extra hard for such little pay."
good,"only hire seasonal.. notheing to depend on. Good people , fun job but wont pay bills. loved going to work , help customers find products . But when it gets slow everyone gets layed off"
good,i loved working here but it was very stressful. i would go back under different management. good company to work for if you don't mind lack of communication between employees
good,"its a fun place to work at, the people are friendly. theres a lot to learn at that place like time management. it also take a lot to work there especially if you work in the back of house or if you are helping them out."
good,I learned a lot i worked at two different locations and both were excellently managed well. Great managers co workers were outstanding people. I learned plan o grams and brwaking down and putting up fixtures cashier position was great a little hectic at times but overall great.
good,working in a quite happy environment made things alot peacefull my mangers were great and my fellow employees were not difficult to work with at all.
good,I worked overnight so I mostly stocked shelves. I also helped with the online orders and had to get them ready to be shipped.
good,"A typical day of work for me includes with my walking in gathering my equipment and checking in with my manager and seeing what is going on and if there are any tasks for me to begin with. Afterwards I will check with my coworker who is leaving and I am taking their spot to see if there is anything that he needs to tell me and keep an eye out. Once he leaves, I begin with my task that is assigned to me by the manager and work on that until I am finished. While I am working on the task I am listening to my walkie and see if my coworker needs help on registers. If I do then I go and assist them; most of the time is by pulling a guest and making the line go down faster. Once the line is clear and everything seems okay I resume my project. Even though I am working on the project I am asking guests that walk past me and see if they need assistance with anything, If they need help with anything I show them to what they are looking for and answer all of there questions. Once they are satisfied I return to my project and finish it. Once it is finished, I clean up that area and put whatever equipment I do not need away. I then spend the remainder of my shift walking around the store assisting guests and making sure that the store looks good; picking up toys off the floor, fixing an aisle so it looks more presentable, and organizing the shelves as well."
good,"Unfortunately, I only worked here during las Christmas because I was just seasonal but I really wanted them to keep me after the holidays. During the holidays the store was full of people and Christmas music was playing all day and while it was stressful running back and forth trying to help 10 different people at once, it gave me a real adrenaline rush. It was kind of fun being put to the challenge and some of the managers were really nice exept for one. The toys in the store were nice to look at and helping customers find a specific toy made me feel better about myself. Also the HR girl is really nice and will buy food for people to eat and buy did I eat a lot of it."
good,fast pace not for everyone. great seasonal job. lots of room for advancement. its not a bad place to work. pay is not as competitive as one would assume
good,"It was laid back and the job was not hard. I like more fast paced jobs. The people in store were very nice. Not to mention I got to ""play"" with toys all day hah! (not really)"
good,Greeting customers and sharing my product knowledge with them.   My co-workers are very helpful and eager to work as a team. The hardest part of my job is a customer who we are unable to satisfy.
good,"I am grateful to have the opportunity to work for Toys R Us. It has been an excellent learning experience for me and I have connected with some of the greatest people within the company. I am thankful for my co-workers and the many friendships that I have made during my time here. Although it has been enjoyable, it also has been challenging to work in the toy business as I wish to advance in the Fashion industry where I truly see myself thriving in. I am seeking to grow within corporate retail to take on more responsibilities and new challenges."
good,"Culture and management varies from store to store, but generally a more relaxed and fun environment than most retail jobs. "
good,"I liked it and probably would have stayed if I wasn't a seasonal employee. The only thing that wasn't so great is the employee discount, I think it was like 10 percent off but that isn't a cheap store, at all. so it was basically nothing."
good,Unfortunately I did not have the experience as the previous employees but I self taught myself to complete the tasks I was given to the quality of what my co-workers expectations. The hardest part of my job was to learn how to use the cash register by myself with out causing any hassels.
good,A typical day at Toys R Us I would greet the customers as they walked in and I learned about a lot of toys. The management was ok. The coworkers were great . The hardest part about the job I would say was the holidays and the enjoyable part was I could get a discount..
good,creo que fue una experiencia bastante buena porque me enseñaron muchas cosas para trabajar en el ámbito de mozo de almacén y re-ponedor
good,"-I was basically on the floor most of time, doing a lot of the mainteance work. Collect Trash, Sweeping, Helping Customers sometimes, outside collecting carts."
good,"the coworkers are the main reason to remain employed at this company . Its a fun place to work , i mean after all you are working with toys :) and helping the children find exactly what they want makes one feel real good to see their little faces light up , the down side , corperate. seem to appreciate dedicated hard workers .paltry wage increases  awful benefits that you have to pay through the nose for ."
good,I was always working with families who were expecting or already had children. They were there to make their lives and the lives of their families better.
good,This was my very first retail job. I started off as a seasonal employee and became permanent. I enjoyed working at Toy's R Us. The managers and supervisors were great and I got along with my  co-workers.
good,Fun place to work. The most enjoyable part of the job is helping kids find the right toy. Enjoy working with my colleagues and learning from them.
good,"Worked at the customer service desk working with customers who need to do returns, do orders on our website and also talk with customers about complaints.  At the end of the night we stock the entire store"
good,Fun work place with supportive management team and co workers you have your back just wish they could impove there hiring
good,"A typical day consisted of helping customers, working the phone lines, cashier, and stocking the aisles. Learned about all kinds of toys, bikes, baby products, and electronics. Management were fun to work for and coworkers were awesome and informative. Hardest part about the job was during Christmas time and the most enjoyably are you get to see the new toys before everyone else."
good,"A typical day at Babies R Us is about doing the best in your position and sometimes helping other departments. I learned a lot about the merchandise, and different approaches to help me do my job more and more efficiently. All of the management really seemed to want all of us to be successful at our jobs and to be in the best fit position for you. I could tell by all the constructive criticism and all the willingness for the managers to help you find the right department for you by moving you with your permission. My co-workers mostly worked hard, were dependable, and easy to get along with. The hardest part of the job was not getting paid enough for it to be considered a living wage. The most enjoyable part of the job was the flexibility in job titles so I could find out which positions were best for me and Babies R Us, becoming a more and more essential part of the Babies R Us team, and all the encouragement and constructive criticism from all managers."
good,It was a job. I didn't dislike or like it. It was easy and everyone was sweet. I enjoyed working with the public. I worked really  hard but I wasn't paid enough and not enough self fulfillment.
good,"*Busy store"
good,"From what I remember the night started with assigning where people would stock. I learned that there a lot of toys and that store has a very large selection. The management at that time was very polite and I wish all were like that. My co-workers there all very nice and polite to each other. I think the hardest part was listening to the same music and ads over and over. The part I enjoyed the most was stocking video games. I love to play them, but stocking them for someone to buy them was a little fulfilling."
good,"Toys R Us was a great lace to work. It was always fun, and enjoyable. I gained so much experience from here. I met wonderful people here who made it an easy job to go to."
good,working for toy r us was a good experience learning the picking and packing process toys r s was a good company great learning experience
good,"It was my first job, great first job. I learned how a business worked day to day. fulfilled my daily requirements, helping guests, answering calls and questions, answered when needed around the store. Management was great, they are patient and like the chance to teach. I learned a lot from them quickly. Co-workers are nice and easy to get to know and work with. The most enjoyable part of the job was (personally) all the co-workers don't lord over each other, even management, they're very down to earth and treated it like one big toy store.the hardest part of the job is sticking out the off season, which is everything but 3 months into Christmas season."
good,"Working for Toys R Us was, at times, very faced paced and even stressful due to high seasonal traffic and lack of training for sales team members. The store I worked at had a high turnover rate so was constantly training new employees."
good,"A typical day at work included: making the store presentable (i.e. making sure the floor/aisles looked neat), restocking items, displaying items for customers, answering phones, looking up items for customers, sales/returns."
good,A typical night at Toys R Us was pretty fun every single night as far as keeping busy with co workers. Only thing that sucked about the job was the overnight supervisor whose attitude sucked big time!
good,"Grabbing a cart of returns and placing items back in the appropriate spot, answering customer questions while out on the floor. Ringing up customers purchases, answering questions on the phone regarding products, location and hours."
good,"Typical day at work. You get to work with the public. A place to start to build retail work experience. if you love working with toys and interacting with the public, then this a busy place to work. The hardest part of the job is dealing with the crowds of NYC locals and tourists."
good,"Excellent place to work if you enjoy working with kids.  There is possibiliy for advancement for those who work hard.  Much of the work is done during holiday months, when the store triples it's staff."
good,"A typical day at work during the seasonal period was getting there, clocking in. Listening to what was to be done that day and who was being put together or where everyone was being placed for that shift. Most of the co-workers and managers were more than great to work with. The hardest part of the job for me was remembering where everything was located, trying to help customers during black Friday sales, on only my 3rd or 4th day of working. The most enjoyable part of the job for me, was helping unload the conveyor line and get merchandise out on the floor."
good,"Working for Toys 'R' Us was my first experience in retail. I learned how to go through a transaction for the first time. I also learned how to socialize with the public for my first time as well. Although the management was professional in some cases, they weren't that encouraging on doing better in anything. My co-workers were very nice, but not everyone was professional or willing to help. The hardest part of this job was being unable to answer certain questions about certain products and not getting any help from anyone else. I enjoyed doing the transactions, but i enjoyed being on the floor and organizing the products more."
good,"I was a cashier for front and electronics department. I answered phones, cashed out people, help customers when needed, answers customers questions, open and close."
good,Very fast paced environment geared at advancing company initiatives through aggressive projects. Change management is a big focus. Office atmosphere is engaging with a casual dress code. The HR department really makes a big effort to keep employees engaged and motivated.
good,"The time I spend at Toys R us showed me that even the little ones deserve to have a great customer care experience, that they need attention and understanding as any adult if not more, it was fun working at toys R us because everyday it was like a show and tell  for the kids. it also allows the associate to truly appreciate the holidays and what they mean to each kid."
good,"Mostly seasonal support and overnight work."
good,was a fun place to work and fun people to work with. enjoyed the customer but did not feel valued as a worker. discounts and scheduling were always a plus but did not like the hrs of closing
good,"You get to work with a bunch of different people. Having the option to work more than one department such as service, sales floor, stocking, overnight crew and electronics. You do have to be able to handle a lot of parents that are unsure of what they are looking for."
good,"I would stock and put out merchandise.I learned how to unload a truck, scanner, handle costumers, stock and/ or put out merchandise, and collect merchandise people ordered online. I got along great with my co-workers they were a lot of help when i first started and i caught on quickly with there help, there were great vibes between us all and all got along right away. In all the job would get difficult when we would have back to back trucks in one night but working quickly and all together we would get the job done on time. i think the most enjoyable part of the job was having such great co-workers and being around toys and little kids all day long."
good,First job while in high school. Not a bad experience. Hours were fine with school schedule.
good,"A typical day at TOYS R' US, there could never be one.  A really FUN place to work, and in the heart of Times Square, who could ask for more? Fast but FUN place to work, the time on the job flies by. Co-workers are fun and very creative. Hardest part of a shift would be when a child's heart is broken because they are not able to have that ""toy""."
good,Toys r Us is a very friendly place to work. All of the employees and management are understanding and extremely fun to work with. You get to interact with kids and adults with the latest toys and tablets on the market.
good,"A typical day at work consisted of Easy Customers, Easy Work, Easy Small Tasks, And a lot of friendly faces. I learned how to use a newer computer register fairly quickly, the use of team work correctly, and tips on how to deal with customers anywhere. The management was very nice, calm, collected, and straight to the point. Not once did I ""not know what to do"". My co-workers were very friendly, considerate, and never asked inappropriate questions. The hardest part of my job was telling a customer that we don't have an item they showed up for, because you know that's all they came for. The most enjoyable part of this job was meeting/seeing all the friendly faces, and interacting with new people every day."
good,"Here I basically got what I expected from a job. My job consisted of cashiering, organizing shelves and restocking, as well as customer service in general. The managers were really nice and did their job well. I got good hours and the work load wasn't too bad for seasonal. I really have nothing negative to say about this workplace and wouldn't mind actually working here again."
good,I've learned how to work in very very busy environments. How to keep a steady pace without freaky out or take to long. My managements were very easy going.
good,"toys 'r' us was a great place to start off getting me into warehouse work, it was very hard and began with reconstructing the entire store for a re-model. after a few months of that the christmas season arrived and i got a lot of experience in fast paced stocking and recieving, as well as storage."
good,Good company with fun toys!  The work life balance was OK.  Good company culture.
good,Typical day at Toys R Us during the holidays it is very very busy but I learned to helpful with customers and direct them the best way possible.  Management were very helpful while co-workers were nice and friendly and we helped one another as a team.  Most enjoyble was when we had our team meetings and when we had an employee night shopping spree.
good,"Working at Toys 'R' Us helped me gain a lot of customer service experience and how to solve customer problems to my best extent. A typical day on the job was cleaning and organizing the assigned department and assist customers in need of help, as well as work as cashier. Being at Toys 'R' Us has taught me many things I will carry on with to future jobs such as maintain organization, being a team player, and working well with a diversity of others. The most enjoyable part of the job was interacting with customers and fulfilling their needs of purchases. The hardest part of the job was difficult customers but we never denied their needs and assisted them the best way that we could. My co-workers also impacted my experience on being a great and enjoyable job."
good,This was a fun place to work.  I enjoyed all of the co-workers and customers that came into the store. It was a nice place to work even on the busy days.
good,A typical day at work for is basically meeting the customers needs. Ive learned how to pace myself to in order to do multiple things in once. My co-workers are very helpful and understanding. The hardest part about my job is the rude customers. The most enjoyable part of my job making people satisfied.
good,had to fix all the printers they had sent to the depot for re-delivery back to original site.
good,"Worked here seasonally for my first job, was fun and ended quick."
good,When im working at Toys R Us i get to interact with kids ands adults looking for the right toys and games for themselves and there children i learned management skills and guest service skills. i always loved to greet and assist guest with a smile so it wasnt hard to enjoy the work place. i helped my co workers feel welcome and helped them understand the job and what they was required to do. the most enjoyable part of my job was just interacting with guest building there trust and reaching metric goals at the end of the night .
good,That there are a lot of different toys that are all kinds of sizes.
good,"I love working at Toys R Us, its a fun place to work. I met different people everyday, I have customers who come back to shop at our location just for me service. The most enjoyable part of my job is seeing the smile on the customers faces, after I have found the toy for their child or grandchild to providing them with the information about all the baby products. My co-workers and management are very fun to work with, we are there whenever anyone needs a hand."
good,I love helping customers find toys they wanted. I learned about new toys.
good,Hardly any full time employees so no benefits. Great co-workers but very stressful during holiday season.
good,"Unloaded trailers, stocked shelves, assisted expectant parents with registries and purchases, operated Point of Sale system and returns."
good,"I moved up pretty quick, I enjoyed the Seasonal time the most.  I hired, trained, and managed our seasonal team members.  The customers service experience was great. The hardest part of my day was making sure that Team Members were providing exceptional customer service."
good,"Always busy, I learned to listen better. Oour managers were very cool. Co-workers were easy to get along with if they pull their weight and did their job. Hardest part was closing. The thing I enjoyed most was being able to have fun with the managers and co-workers."
good,"I worked as a sales associate assisting customers on the floor however I believed that management was more focused on building their credit and rewards program client base than actually assisting customers to find the products they need. Overall I enjoyed working at Toys 'R' Us during the year I spent there. The part I liked most about my job was the variety of tasks I was expected to perform. In a single day I could be working with customers, stocking and labeling products, changing displays or working with the back of house."
good,"When I first started they said that we would be training for all the positions there ( cashier, sales associate) being that they might need us when ever. The management did not train me for either position, they put me straight on the floor for sales, I did not know what I was doing it was very off putting not knowing where things were when the customer asks you."
good,"I have a great deal of experience with special needs child, it's natural to me to seek toys that will stimulate different parts of the brain to enhance learning."
good,A typical work at was very busy. I learned how to deal what people on a different levels. I knew how to manage my attitude while at work because never let my problems get in the way of me doing my job. I had some good co-workers that help me get the job done the rite way at work. The hardest part of the was finding where the items go in a very big store. The most enjoyable part of the job was the people because I like meeting and talking to knew people
good,"A typical day was 8 hours or more. As an employee, you learned how to deal with adversity and make every effort to get the job done in a timely fashion. As far as management goes, a majority of the work is based on self-sufficiency. A lot of the work is completed independently. The most difficult part of the job is having only 8 hours to train someone and still managing to complete your own tasks. The most enjoyable part of the job was assisting customers, especially around the Holidays."
good,"•	Scheduled all interviews for all seasonal candidate selections"
good,"As an assistant manager I would open the store and count the safe and registers to ensure that all the money was accounted for. I would print out the sale signs and begin to place them on the items. I would look over emails from corporate and send any emails I felt that was needed to be sent. Once the store was open I would delegate work for my employees to complete, receive phone calls and complete online orders for customers and help along with any daily activity that needed completing."
good,"Cant really say too much since I was only seasonal, but from my time there it was alright"
good,"relaxed and fun place to work, sometimes at holiday season it can get stressful"
good,Stocked shelves with merchandise.  Good management and work flow.
good,"A typical work day would comprise of ringing sales, stocking/straightening shelves, and assisting customers. The hardest part of working there was when the shelves were rearranged and a new layout had to be learned."
good,I enjoyed being able to work with many different people and being able to be a big part in their decision making process
good,"Handled purchases made by customers every day. In addition to ringing up goods, answered customer questions, handled money, and performed multiple customer service duties. Sometimes stocking, inventory management, merchandising, and other administrative duties."
good,A great place to establish and develop interpersonal relationships. deal with customers of all ages and nationalities.
good,"I would come into work late at night and unload the truck full of merchandise. After unloading the truck I would then merchandise it on the shelves in specific area's."
good,"Packed out store items."
good,I loved working here all together but at some points the managers would raise their voice at me or make me feel less of a person in front of a customer. other than that I had a blast learning about the place and the people. it had flexible house and the store manager was wonderful. she understood if I was busy or not.
good,Major work was to charge customers and watching my embers area always clean and in order.  Help in closing the store to do the balancing of cash register and organize toys that were out of place in the store.
good,"Management constantly fighting with each other, managers seem to play favorites."
good,"I generally enjoyed going to work at Toys R Us, the costumer kept us smiling, the coworkers are all nice and like to make jokes, I started to feel at home within a few days. The worst part about it was closing and that wasn't even half bad. All the managers are friendly and understanding, they will push you to do your best in a nice manner. I never felt unappreciated or anything, it was a great place for a first job."
good,"Muy buen ámbiente de trabajo, gran trabajo en equipo y buena organización."
good,positiba.carga y descarga de camiones como colocacion de pedidos por ciudades y un trato bueno con el trabajador
good,"It was a great family environment to work in. We had a great family team at Toys. To be able to find that specific gift for a grandson, grand daughter, son, daughter, etc was the best feeling in the world. I've always enjoyed working with customers knowing they are walking out of my store satisfied and ready to come back."
good,"good as a part-time job, too much expectation for full timers at minimum wage, loved my three and a half years working there."
good,I worked here as a temp over the Christmas period a few years ago. It was only a temp job but I really enjoyed it. It was my first proper job and the staff there made sure I felt welcome and ensured I received any necessary support.
good,"I was an off hours stock crew member. I liked the idea of working third shift and welcomed it. However, my co-workers did not and were something left to be desired. Management was nice but definitely too lax. I couldn't handle that at all. Especially, when I was working hard and management allowed employees to do whatever they wanted. Nice people, just poorly managed."
good,"A typical day at work was more like a day at play, but we all got the job done."
good,I like working for the R Us company. I get pretty good hours a week and I was able to make friends.
good,I enjoyed the management and the freedom to manage myself as well as other associates as a trainer to get work done efficiently
good,"So far, my job at Toys R' Us is decent. They are willing to work around my schedule. Since I have proven to them that I want to work more hours, they usually provide me with the amount of hours I want. They are willing to work around school schedules if I ever become a student again. The people are friendly and helpful. The customers are happy with my service. I've persuaded many people to sign up for rewards and credit cards. The hardest part of the job comes when there are very few customers; it becomes a bit boring. I enjoy seeing children happy with a new toy."
good,"A typical day would be to greet customers with a friendly personality. I have learned quite a bit working for Babies R Us. Running cash registers, completing returns, answering telephones, stocking shelves, having great communication skills. My co-workers were always fun to be around, up beat and always had a great attitude. The most enjoyable part of the job would have to be helping customers and seeing a smile on their faces."
good,"Can be busy."
good,"A typical day involves going to work clocking in and making sure each and every child and parent has an enjoyable shopping experience."
good,I started out just seasonal and then became a customer service manager. I enjoyed to see each kid come in the store and have a big smile on their face. 
good,"I enjoyed working here. My coworkers were friendly and enjoyable, pay was good, I learned alot."
good,"very enjoyable, friendly staff, makes you feel like a kid again"
good,"Toys R' Us was, overall, a great company to work for! The only downfall would have to be that Seasonal Employees are hired at a higher rate than regular employees, and are given a pay cut if kept on as a regular. "
good,"cashier, stocking shelves, cleaning the store after hours, consult with customers regarding merchandise."
good,"I stocked shelves during the hours which the stores were closed, so it mainly consisted a lot of me being by myself and sorting and distributing products, putting some into overhead storage when it wasn't needed. I learned how to work in a retail environment, how to service customers properly when I did work during store hours, and how to operate a sapphire scanner. Management wasn't the friendliest, and I hardly got to see my co-workers enough for it to matter. The hardest part of the job was it grinding on, at times. The most enjoyable part of the job was knowing that you were helping to put toys into a child's hands."
good,"Extremely fun place to work, filled with Toys and kids. Management was nice and extremely passionate about their jobs. Co-workers were super excited everyday at work. Hardest part of the job was probably telling customers when we were out of a certain product. Best part was being around toys and kids on a daily basis."
good,A fast pace learning environment that requires well developed communication skills and the ability to adapt in an ever-changing environment.
good,This was a fast-paced time of year my day included assisting bi-lingual customer services sales normal day to include working certain areas of the floor and cashiering. I learned that this is a very family oriented company and overall good place to work if you love children because after all the cleaning was an on-going process throughout the day after the isles became cluttered with toys :)
good,There seems to be very few people who actually know very much as to what is actually suppose to take place in the store. Training is not nearly as sufficient as it needs to be. The management and staff however are very friendly and helpful and usually keep the place going smoothly. Scheduling and work times are in a constant state of flux.
good,There was always something to keep busy with. I learned how to be great with customers. The management needed some impovement. I loved all the people I worked with. The hardest part was leaving. I loved seeing customers leave with smiles on thier faces.
good,"A work day would consist of clocking in on time at one of the many kiosks located in one of many aisles which was very convenient for the employees. I would check in with the manager on site that day and she would then let me know which area of the store I would be in charge of. I would then proceed to make sure the aisles were clean, in order and every item was in its proper place. If a customer looked as though they needed help I would ask if I could help them or they would simply find me and ask for help. Teamwork was a big part of being a sales associate because we would need to go back and forth with each other if we needed help."
good,It was a good opportunity. Assisted many customers and found items they were looking for. Excellent customer service skills.
good,"I really enjoyed working for Toys' R' Us, even though it was seasonal it was still a great job. Espeacially if your a people person and are knowledgable and confident in your work, amd what your doing"
good,i have learnt a high standard of customer service you get nice customers and bad customers but i have learnt how to deal with all aspects of the good and the bad
good,Very fun and outgoing environment. Was kept on permanently after being hired for the 2012-2013 Winter Season.
good,"Co-workers were friendly, store and hours were perfect, the managers on the other hand could have used their time actually taking care of the store operations instead of hiding in the back eating."
good,Buena experiencia aunque el contrato fue para campaña de navidad el trabajo en equipo era muy bueno
good,"Cashiering, maintain apparel and toy shelves, putting back reshop (items customers returned or didn't want), collect empty carts around the store, and help guests with any questions or concerns."
good,"Great company to work for. Hard to move up in this company though, felt very static. Benefits were okay, but they offered something. Their ethics are good and treat their employees relatively fair. Would work for them again if the pay was not so low."
good,Toy store! Great place to work. You get to play with toys and sell them. I learned a great deal working there and management was cool and all my co-workers were fun and full of laughs. No part was hard really; except green Friday or otherwise Black FRIDAY..lol...no really no hard parts. Most enjoyable job...loved it.
good,"come in go straight to work, co workers are easy to work with."
good,"The first manager at this holiday express store was not as professional as he could have been, even going as far as telling some of the staff that they were not as good as the others. After he quit, the other managers were very nice, fun, and did not verbally abuse their employees. I really enjoyed working there after that."
good,"Its a good place to work , Must be in good shape to endure the amount of work"
good,i unloaded trucks and stocked shelves after hours management and i got along well. i unfortunately had to leave because of one manager leading me on and i wasn't gonna have that. otherwise tho its a great job
good,"My time at TRU was a dichotomy. The first six months were great, and the last six months were not. My skills at getting people to sign up for Rewards Cards was unmatched in the store, and I was exceptional at getting people to buy protection plans and batteries. Because of these exemplary sales numbers I was kept on from my seasonal hire status and made the main service desk employee. I was responsible for providing the utmost customer service to desk, in addition to keeping my already high sales numbers continually elevated. A bunch of the ASMs were huge fans of mine, and wanted me to be promoted. After the SM left, the company decided not to make one of the ASMs the new SM, and the SM they hired did not know how great of an employee I was. In the coming months, he would hire less qualified, less tenured employees to advance to supervisory positions over me. As a result I quit."
good,"There was never really a typical day at work. Sometimes I would be at the guest service desk, and sometimes I would work on the floor. If I was at the guest service desk, I would check guests out. I would do returns and exchanges, and I would provide the best customer service I possibly could. If I was on the floor, I would assist customers in finding things they were looking for. I would set up baby registries and assist the new parents and give them tips on things they would need. And I would help guests shopping off of a registry find different items they were interested in buying."
good,Working at toys R us was a fun summer job. Sometimes i worked on the sales floor or behind the customer service desk.
good,starting the working day to being able to punch the working card on time and be able to create a very good attitude working environment. having good relationships with lots of men and women. and never being tired of learning new things.
good,I was a cashier. I worked days and nights. The main focus was customer service. Most of my days I worked Guest Services which I really like to do because it was always busy there. I did both returns and check customers out. On slow days I took the initiative to learn different things that wasn't in my job description but helped a lot to know. There was a lot of great people that worked at Babies R Us. Management was pretty good. They were very busy but for the most part they was there to help when you needed them. Hardest part of the job was learning baby registry but eventually I got it down. The most enjoyable part is working the area that i loved the most which was Guest Service and Baby Registry.
good,It was overall a good place to work but not somewhere I would intend upon making a career.
good,"During the holidays the store is always busy but afterwards business is slow, with sales every week. Found merchandise Ive never heard of but loved. Great customers & coworkers. Would love to work in similar environment."
good,My main complaint was the lack of professionalism among the stock crew managers
good,"staff were very friendly, hours were not a problem, only seasonal employment though"
good,"I loved working here for the holiday season. I was usually the last person that a customer would see, so I made sure to make their last impression a positive one as well, making sure they had all of the components needed for a specific product (such as batteries that were not included)."
good,"helping the guests find what they need and getting the store ready for the work day, co-workers are always willing to lend a hand and working hard. The hardest part of the day is having the customers that you cant please, no matter how hard you try they're just not satisfied. The most enjoyable part of the day is seeing all the other guests smiles and hearing them say you really helped them and their gratitude makes the job all the worth while."
good,Stocked shelves in the store before it opened. Hardest part was unloading the frieght truck in a timely fashion.
good,it was a seasonal job it was a good job to work not much i can say about toy's r us did not work there for to long.
good,"Good for a entry level job but bad career path. Promotions aren't alway base from within which is hard for Advancement. Wages not fit for living on your own unless you collect other benifets. Its a great place to work for if your in high school or college student, hours are based uppon sales so fulltime or not ..your hours are based on sales from the stores forcast.."
good,Being 16 Working Here Was Fun Learning How To Operate The Toys Put Together Bikes And Electric Scooters Battery Operated Cars And Motorcycles Was A Great Overall Experience.
good,This store is very busy during the Christmas holiday and I was able to learn how to do speedy transactions for customers. One flaw I have with this store is their sales signs. There are always confusions with the customers about what the deals are.
good,i apperciate the opportunity to work as a seasonal employee
good,I worked for Toys R Us for only a short time but in this time I met some wonderful people. The environment which I worked in was very friendly and full of people willing to help the newcomers along the way. The management staff was very fair and easy to communicate with.
good,"It's a good environment, management was very nice and friendly. It was a good environment to wrok in. I really nothing negative to say about working at Toys R Us."
good,I loved toys r us because i loved seeing little kids faces whenever i would ring their toy out and they couldn't wait to hold it and play with it.
good,"clock in and help customers with merchandise, while simultaneously re-stocking shelves, running a register, and making sure customers had an overall good time."
good,This is a good job for a young kid looking for his 1st job. A great way to get your feet wet as a part time job while in school. I enjoyed my time there.
good,I learned how to work at a fast pace and to handle money in a different and easier way. I learned some new things about how to go about situations with customers.
good,"It's a low tier job like working at fast-food places but personally more rewarding to work as"
good,"Although the pay could've been better and the place was a little unorganized, I can be honest and say it was a joyful place to be employed to and I loved the atmosphere. The customers were difficult some days, but kind words and a Good Attitude can change anyone's mind."
good,"Well managed, always had enough employees on shifts."
good,"Colleagues were great and easy to get along with. "
good,"I started working at toys R us in October 2017 as Christmas staff, I settled in well and quite liked my job."
good,"Really enjoyed my time working here, the training was excellent and helped me a lot. Fun people to work with. However super crazy during Christmas time and can be quite stressful."
good,"working there is like working any other place, you have you good days and your bad ones, you have the days you're excited to go to work and there's those days you gatta drag yourself to work. Then there's some coworkers you're happy to work with and others your're just praying for the day to be over. You just have to make the best of every day and don't take the negative energy home from work."
good,"A typical day at Toy R Us was fun and energetic. You always learn of the new toys and games. Management was always developing and deploying staff and their skills, the skills of individuals employees. The workplace culture at Toy R Us was always satisfaction and happiness.The hardest part of working at Toy R Us was that you couldn't play with the toys, game, and bikes.The most enjoyable part of working there was seeing a child smile because of their new toy."
good,I was only a seasonal hire so my experience was very limited but Toys R Us was a fine company to work for. The managers were good to us for the most part and hours were good if you were dependable. Black Friday wasn't too chaotic and it was very well run.
good,i loved my job there it just didn't last. the company shut down and they let go all there employees including me. if i still had this job id be in upper management by now.
good,"Great environment/culture, lovely and friendly staff. Adequate training to ensure the position is done efficiently. Management at the time were great - not overbearing but always offering assistance when needed."
good,Worked here for a few months before they decided to close down. loved and enjoyed my time here. loved the atmosphere and the people I worked with. I was very sad to learn they were closing fro good.
good,"Christmas seasons are obviously crazy, if you can survive working here during a Christmas season, you can work anywhere. Being promoted from a seasonal to a permanent employee is easy, as long as you’re good at selling protection plans and obtaining donations. Requesting days off is almost impossible though."
good,It was good. We didn’t do much talking cause it was an over night thing. All we did was pack shelves and make sure it was done by morning so morning crew didn’t have work to do.
good,"To the surprise of no one, working at a toy store was actually pretty fun. Thanks to my own prior knowledge of the products and store layout, assisting with customer needs was simple. On a good day, there's always something to do going on, and you're always on the move. My managers and co-workers were all great to work with as well. The managers were all very helpful and fair with both customers and employees while my coworkers and I were always able to come together to get things done like a well oiled machine. Though I was something of a new guy for most of the experience, my easy adaptability quickly made me one of the 'go-to' guys when it came to problem solving. If there was any major downside however, it would be that there were more slow days than proactive ones. That and the obligatory slew of rude, downright entitled customers. Still, the generally pleasant atmosphere coupled with the excited cheers of the kids made the whole experience worth while."
good,Loved working for the company and literally by choice worked about 50 plus hours a week during christmas season. I was offered to remain on as a permanent employee but you are lucky to work 2 days a week and may on occasion be sent home or called prior to shift and told not to come in due to poor sales. Since i relied on the income to support a family i had to seek other employment. Miss toys r us
good,Easy way to train for bigger retail jobs. Fast-paced but also lates back because of the fun work environment. Weekly special events for promoting items
good,"My review was fair and consistent with sales trends and operational  Achievements and/or deficiencies, That was though a manager I was rated a 4 out of a possible 5 I ran a fish and store and brought shrink numbers down by over 1.7% in my 1st year"
good,"I loved it. I worked Seasonal. I was a Cashier, and had to put toys back in place. Loved helping people find items on their christmas list. You had to sell credit cards to customers. once you knew how to sell it to them , it was super easy. The customers were sweet"
good,Toys R Us. Was a great company to work for. Toys R us had a fun atmosphere and a fast working environment . The best part about working their is all of the relationships I forged.
good,"was a good place to work for, learned a lot from them. customer service, marketing and how to handle certain situations so this way the customer is always happy."
good,"It was very fun. Great people, and always something going on. Very welcoming, unfortunately they have closed down, so I would not reccomend applying.."
good,I like toy's R us.. the pay wasn't that good.. but I like seeing the kids come into the store. They eyes would light up when they see all the toys games bikes..etc..
good,"Overall, i enjoyed working at Toys R Us on both occasions. Very few blips. Great people around me made for a healthy working environment. Wish that TRU was still around."
good,It was a great place to work but unfortunately fell victim to bad upper management and corporate greed. It was enjoyable to work with almost every single employee and the atmosphere was enjoyable. The work was fast paced.
good,"My job there was rather boring, and while I was hired seasonal, I was dropped without much warning. The store is gone now so, not much else I can say."
good,this place is so toxic... please do not work there. I mean you get the full time hours but what you put up with during just one day is outrageous.....
good,"It was over a year before it the actual end arrived and all the stores knew it too, too little too late. They should have better prepared for that event"
good,"I had a blast working for Toys R Us.  The job itself is alright, but it was the people I worked with that really made the place shine. I would recommend working for Toys R Us."
good,work was great good atmophere hours were goid. Management were lovely I only left due to my son being ill so I had. No other option than to leave unfortunately
good,"All my managers were very nice and was good to work with , got a decent amount of hours for the week. Overall a very good job. Would recommend to all."
good,I really enjoyed working with the co-workers and some of the managers. The lively atmosphere and fast work place during the Christmas rush I found to be engaging.
good,The toys r us I worked at was upbeat everyone was positive and energetic. The managers were helpful patient and understanding to new comers and very motivational
good,"I satrted out over six years ago as  a seasonal temp employee. After the Christmas season was over, I was hired as a part time. Dzespite the low wages, it was a fun job."
good,"Warm and family oriented atmosphere, worked together as a team,knowledgeable staff ..I enjoyed and learned alot.The days I worked, Everyone was nice and friendly, to other employees as well as to guests..I was a seasonal worker who did whatever was required and was always welcomed back the next season..."
good,"Stock & refill all shelves in isles after store closed."
good,People were friendly. Pay was fair. Culture was supportive and I enjoyed the job. Unfortunately the company went out of business so I was forced to leave.
good,I worked there twice both times were cool. And I like working with the public. And helping guest. Seeing all the newest toys and games that was the best part of my job.
good,Over good place to work to bad the closed put a new store has opened and can’t wait for new jobs to return. The Akron area needs more jobs since everything at the mall has closed
good,Led a sales team of 13 employees where I provided input and feedback directly to the District Manager.  Managed the daily operations of a profitable pop up retail store.
good,Only thing was the pay.we were told how great we were and the when evaluation time they don't show it in the raise they give you.cooperate got greedy and caused the company to go out of business.
good,"If you need a job to supplement income and you can manage working overnight before going back to your day job, this is a good fit. Chill and independent work environment."
good,"it was a great place to work "
good,"Worked during the christmas season of 2016, enjoyed a steady roster of 3-4 shifts per week doing night stock and occasionally register work. Easy going coworkers, ready to help if asked and generally a nice place to work."
good,"This company treated its employees fairly. The provided OT pay, training and the ability to try out new and more intensive roles. There was seasonal work, work with more pay and the chance to move ahead."
good,A fun place to work with great coworkers. It was an excellent first job that afforded me many opportunities to learn and grow. Management was always compassionate and willing to work with schedules.
good,"Great work experience "
good,Had several good years at Toys R Us. People working there where very friendly and worked together to get projects done on time and budget. Too bad upper management failed the company.
good,I enjoyed working for Toy's R Us. I enjoyed seeing the happy faces of the children. I learned every postion in this job. I would not have left if it was not for health problems of my son.
good,The people I worked with were great and I made a lot of friends there. Relationships bloomed and everything works out great. The work was sometimes hard but it pays off in the end and I enjoyed myself doing so. Fast paced and always kept you busy so you'll always have something to do.
good,a typical day at Toys R Us we spent stocking up the store and we made sure everything was organized neat and the right way before it was time to open.
good,"I only worked part time but it was fun a few hours in the evenings and on the weekends, but being able to help customers with purchases was a great and fulfilling joy."
good,I loved working there. It was very family oriented. Very nice environment to work. Great training staff. Staff members are very friendly. I wish they hadn’t closed because I miss that place!
good,I worked as a seasonal worker and its sad that they had to close but my experience here was sometimes fun and at others very stressful due to the pressure we had for getting people to sign up for rewards or credit cards.
good,"Work was usually fun, though that depended on the people you were working with as opposed to the tasks themselves. Management was pretty easy to get along with and they were always willing to be flexible with hours. Most job tasks were relatively simple. Outside the store-level is where things in the company stuttered and were weakest. Mixed signals when it came to promotions and in-store incentives made things messy. The company would have differing opinions on focuses from week to week it seemed as it struggled to find a purpose in an ever-changing market."
good,It's unfortunate the 2017 holiday season was not sufficient to help keep the doors open.  It's disappointing that a full service toy store has been come to an end.
good,Toys r Us was a excellent place that taught me the basics of how to use a register as well as communication with customers to help them find anything they needed.
good,Not alot of hours. Poor pay. Not alot of help. Short on staff. Not paying attentiont customers. Not all are friendly. Some people have bad attitude. Lots of no show employee
good,"The job was only demanding physically. A typical day was unloading trucks and stocking shelves. The job was a good workout but not very mentally stimulating. I learned a lot about todays workforce, many of the new hires had a poor work ethic."
good,"This was a fun place to work. There were events several times a month, fun and friendly competition between workers to drive sales and the team members were always helpful and friendly."
good,"Enjoyed working for Toys R Us and Babies R Us. There were great people at this company, who were a pleasure to work with. Wished the company had survived it many challenges."
good,Lo bueno de este trabajo es que cada día me tocaba estar en un sitio distinto. Desde la caja a estar en la puerta. O bien estar en almacén manipulando material o en tienda a tendiendo a los clientes
good,the day was repetitive and filled with regular retail things but on average the customers were nice and the front end largely filtered out the angry people so in the 4.5 years i worked there no one yelled at me which i hear is rare
good,"Was a very relaxed, quite place to work, was a temp, so dont know too much, but enjoyed learning on the equipment and the workers and management was great."
good,Productive work environment. Fun and friendly co workers. Fast past. During Christmas season. Very overwhelming and exciting at the same time lots of hours offered..
good,"I really enjoyed working with Toys-R-Us because I got to help people all day long. Also I always got a work out from unloading trucks, climbing up and down platters, and running around helping customer. It's a great job when you are young and just want to have fun at work. Overall, I had a great time working there."
good,"I enjoyed working at Toys R Us before they went out of business. They Job was easy, the hours were nice. I’m going to miss working there. Especially during the holidays."
good,It was ok. The days went by kinda fast. The work was not too hard. The people were ok nd nice.The Managers were ok and very helpful and understanding. I can say I like it
good,"In our store we were family. We worked together as a team to help customers have a great experience shopping with us."
good,"Was a good experience for a seasonal job, learned how to do layaway which I didn’t know how to do because I only worked in food places only thing I wasn’t comfortable with was Management they seemed to try to take short cuts and when GM found out they would blame someone else"
good,"A ""typical"" day working here was always different. Most co-workers let their emotions run they're day. Management rarley did what they needed. If a customer needed help in anyway and I needed a manager that poor customer had to waste their time waiting for 30 minutes, just for a reply from the manager."
good,"I enjoyed working with the quality assurance team during season. It definitely was a lot of hard work, however, I had an amazing team and we got things done. A lot of overtime was done to make sure that the children got their Christmas presents on time."
good,Everyone was nice and it was fun working in a toy store. I only had a seasoned job but I bought on really quickly and was able to help other people when they needed it.
good,Toys R Us was a very fun and laid back environment that allowed you to have fun while you worked. Everyone was held responsible for their own duties and completed them without complaint which made everything run smoothly.
good,"don't get me wrong it was a pleasure working for the company, long hours and your constantly on your feet, especially around holiday time, but I love helping the customers"
good,"I was working there in December, there was alot of workload because it was Christmas times but 12 hours shifts felt like 2 hours. Everyone was helpful to each other and there was music playing at all times. It was a great experience. Would rate 10/10."
good,I would always be on cashier and see kids playing around with toys and parents tries to talk to me. I help them out with anything they ask for so I can get a smile from their face.
good,TOys R' Us was a good experience for me in communicating with people.  I grew up loving going to this store for toys.  It brought back memories as a child.  I would be on floor duty helping customers find toys and climb ladders for toys that were high up to reach. I would collect and gather shopping carts. Management was good to work with. Everybody seemed to try and be nice unless you were being rude.  Employees were helpful and easy to work with. I learned how to communicate with employees through blue tooth walkie-talkie system.It s sad to see this company go down
good,Working there was Okay. I didn’t really learn too much i didn’t know already. work place was fun but they were going out of business so not that many people were there. i didn’t get enough hours but i did get paid 11 dollars an hour.
good,A typical day at Toy r Us was pretty slow but during the holidays it gets pretty busy. I learned how to help customers and I learned how to work a cash register. The hardest part is finding out where everything is suposed to go.
good,I learned a lot about retail shops. The store closed before long but I had the opportunity to learn more about the liquidation process with the liquidation consultants that we had.
good,"Handled customer complaints and perform cashiering duties. Help customer find the gift that would meet their needs! The management was amazing as were the employees and work environment. I will miss working with such amazing people, this place was my family."
good,"Toys R Us was an ok place to work for a holiday season. Replenishment is pretty much the same wherever you are; take things off the truck, organize them based on department, and take them out onto the floor."
good,"Typical day would have been walking around assisting guest. Cleaning and fixing shelves, toys and maintain the register clean. The best part of this job was seeing all the new toys come out and being able to see all the cool stuff it had."
good,It was a cool environment except for some of the people that worked there. Bad vibes were there but for the most part everyone got along despite their attitudes.
good,unfortunately my time with toysrus was cut short due to the fact that the company was closing. It was a great experience with great people and i couldnt have been more thankful for the opportunities i was given.
good,Outside of season the job was not bad at all.  During the holidays however the hours went through the roof and being salary there wasn't any additional compensation.
good,"I learned to be very patient, management was fair, clean neat. the hardest part working for TRU was he clean up. the best part was seeing smiles on the kids faces, and the satisfaction on the guest faces. I beleive kindnes is free and if i can make someone smile! then it a great day!"
good,It was fast paced during the holiday season but very slow the rest of the year. It was a good place to work at to learn the basics of customer service.
good,"Working at Toys'R'Us is a really fun work experience. I've made a lot of friendships with colleagues, as well as managers. The management is very kind, and they are very lenient and understanding of all types of situations."
good,This was my first supervisory position and i found that a lot of times there were too many projects to do and not enough time given to do the task.  The most enjoyable part of my day was my other co-workers.
good,"Stocking, working the register, etc. Hardest part was dealing with angry upset customers. The most enjoyable part was looking at the toys and reminiscing lol. The staff was pretty cool too."
good,Co workers were always willing to extend a hand to help out and enjoyed interacting with customers. My hiring manager and store manager were very encouraging.
good,Was nice to see and meet new mothers and help them understand all that was needed for their new babies.  I had a good team of managers that always helped when needed.  The hardest part was being short staffed in my department
good,It was fast paced and fun. The management team back then was awesome. I enjoyed my job. The team that i worked with was enjoyable. The customers were friendly from great customer service. A nice place to work and a great city.
good,"campaña de navidad. atención al cliente y mantenimiento del local en la sección de puericultura y ropa infantil.  una gran superficie en la que  te especializas , sobre todo en una sección. Me gusto la experiencia. Lo que pasa es que sabes que solo es esa temporada porque luego ya tienen su plantilla estable y de muchos años. Las veteranas muy buen trato con   las "" nuevas"" te enseñaban y explicaban  todo . Muy agradecida con todo el equipo. El cliente te consulta dudas, no obstante, noté mucha diferencia de  trabajar en una tienda de barrio ( algo mucho mas personalizado y donde te tienes que esforzar mucho mas para ganarte al cliente ) que en esta caso , que el publico acude al local atraído por un nombre... y un marketing - una oferta que salio en la tele......el cliente ya entra convencido... en la pequeña tienda te lo tienes que ligar y fidelizar."
good,"I had a pleasant working experience at toys r us. it was really just for seasonal work only, but I did enjoy the overall experience there. I had hoped to have been picked to continue to work for the company, but unfortunately that was not the case. too bad they are going out of business, it was a nice place to work at."
good,Toy's R Us es una buena compania de trabajo y respeta a sus empleados con igualdad y equidad
good,"It was a nice and organize place to work, clients are really good , the managers and employees are really good at what they do, every employee its strategically trained."
good,"A typical day as Toys R Us Manager would include; setting up the day to day activities for the staff members, focusing on KPI targets and how to maximise sales."
good,"I am sorry to see Toys R Us go.  Children and parents loved the large selection and the ability to see and touch products, unlike online purchases.  Most co-workers at my store were team players.  During busy holiday seasons, management would often bring in refreshments/snacks for workers.  Regular put-luck events/holiday parties.  An effort was made to balance work schedules to meet employee needs."
good,"Fun fast paced retail store chain.  Every store is different, but majority have a fun atmosphere that is child aimed to create a fun place to shop for all ages. The company recently filed for bankruptcy and all US stores are closing."
good,It was a hard job but felt rewarding even if a lot of times credit wasn't given when needed. But it did teach me a little bit about every role in a store and that your co workers are your biggest back up if they are bad at their jobs everyone else suffers. Helping the kids and making them happy was definitely the best part of the job but dealing with the parents and constant thieves was the hardest.
good,"The job continued to change and evolve which kept it interesting. My job afforded me opportunities to work with many different people and departments throughout the company, having input in all different sorts of initiatives and brick and mortar solutions."
good,It was fun to work there. The pay is not competitive with the surrounding retailers. It's sadly going out of business. It would have been nice if the company could have adapted better to the changing times.
good,"It was a great place to work.  The campus is wonderful... our project teams were filled with great people, willing to collaborate to get the job done."
good,TRU was a great place to work. It is unfortunate they are closing. I have made many friends here and consider them Family. Loads of opportunity for advancement.
good,"I had fun with this company even though I only worked for about a month and half for them.  The reason for this was this job was a seasonal job during the Christmas rush.  There was always something to do but the pay was just minimum wage, so nothing to write home about."
good,"Run reports that is sent to the corporate office, daily."
good,"My time working for Toys R Us was fun, educational and rewarding.  I have enjoyed my time working for the company. Do the company closing I must move on.  If the company was in a different financial situation I know I would remain a loyal employee"
good,"A typical day is very busy. I had to learn to multitask and work with upper management, middle management and subordinates. I learned patience and compassion while being a trainer. Management is very demanding but supportive. The workplace culture could be a lot better, I make sure my team knows that attitude is apart of culture. Safety is always first and quality and team work is a huge part of the culture that I want to stress to my team. The hardest part of my job is motivating new team members with little to no work ethic and the most enjoyable part of my job is motivating and encouraging my team."
good,"Interesting work, fun products, great coworkers, good wellness and health insurance benefits, convenient location, flexible schedule, fun corporate environment."
good,"A good place to work, overall. Good people, very nice campus. Positive atmosphere. Unfortunately, at the time of this review, the company is on the verge of being liquidated - so, I would not recommend working here."
good,Overall Toysrsus is a great place to work. Outside of the Christmas season we typically work about 45 hours and have a great time bringing joy to the Lives of our customers. We have fun and exciting events and have exclusive product you can't find anywhere else.
good,"Communication,  organizational skills, project management,  technical team member mentoring and providing a strategic vision are part of my skill set which I employ daily as an senior IT manager at ToysRus.  The key benefits for the company are cross trained staff which quickly fulfills the needs of the business."
good,"I had fun working overnight stocking. We unloaded the truck, sorted boxes and them took the out to the sales floor. We were responsible for putting our items that needed to be stocked."
good,Toys R Us is a great place to work for those who have kids because we have good discounts on a lot of popular toys. A very friendly and energetic retail store.
good,The management was very helpful and kept employees apprised with the current company situation. Company updates  were provided. Management was also willing to work around employee scheduling problems.
good,A typical day at work for me was walking around the store and picking up and placing the toys back where they belong. I learned how to work under pressure in the loud environment I was surrounded by. The management at Toys R Us was very helpful and the workplace culture was fun. the most enjoyable part of the job for m was making the kids and parents smile.
good,Enjoyed helping others find what they needed to make their children smile. Coworkers made the workplace fun and enjoyable. Hardest part was the high traffic and high stress times during the holidays.
good,"Fast paced at times, most of the times your were putting toys back in their correct places. Dealing with kids was the fun part for me. Goodluck on Black Friday"
good,"'Back in April, I reviewed Volume 8 in Paramount's ongoing DVD series.' 'There are so many aspects to consider when reviewing a film, that the plot is probably the least important.' 'One reason that avant-garde film wasn't reviewed in newspapers during my time as a critic had to do with the avant-garde film world.'"
good,I worked for babiesrus for about 6 years. Everyone was great to work with. I loved seeing my regular customers come in on days i worked just so they could see me.
good,"Overall  Toy R Us was a wonderful and fun place to work at and i enjoy everyday i work there from helping customers and there kids finding the toys and products they come to find, to the party's and birthday party's Toy R Us would provide, the kind coworkers to a fun an not stressful working at Toy R Us."
good,Toys R Us was my first real job. It was challenging at first but I soon found my feet and realised that working with people is what I was meant to do. I found dealing with aggressive customers difficult but used my communication skills to calm and resolve the situation. I enjoyed enhancing the appearance of the store by rearranging and tidying. I enjoyed the responsibilities given once appointed supervisor and gained a massive amount of confidence from this.
good,"overall the experience was enjoyable although the early morning hours and holiday rush of customers could be stressful. Shifts ending in early afternoon were nice, as were the managers that I worked with. They were flexible and accommodating."
good,"A typical day at work consisted with unloading items off of the trailer and stocking them out on the floor. I like that every work day was a collaboration of different people. Some days the store manager would be there, helping us restock the shelves. So, the work environment is definitely team-oriented. The hardest part of the job is loading and unloading because most of the items are going to be heavy and require much lifting and bending. However, the most enjoyable part of the job is getting to work with a diverse group of individuals. Lastly, I also would like to add that the company is very flexible with scheduling. I like this because I attend school full-time and I would like to have an employer work with my schedule."
good,Toys r us is a great company to work for. The management have made working your shift a challenge by making it a game rather than just selling the wares of the company.team members and individuals are rewarded for their participation in this .
good,"Very calm, You get your assignment when you get there then get to work. Stacking the boxes and placing the items on the shelf was easy. You can be to yourself and or listen to music sometimes if they let you. I enjoyed it."
good,"This was probably my favorite place to work ever. The other employees and managers made me excited about going to work every day, even going in at 4am to unload a truck was extremely fun. We were a team there, a family and everyone bought into that work environment. We were working in a toy store, so making kids smile was a wonderful perk of the job and no one took themselves too seriously. Somehow we were still able to be extremely productive and accomplish many incentive goals. I made some of my best friends there, friends I still have to this day almost 10 years later."
good,"Toysrus was a fast paced job. It was very challenging and I loved the sense of accomplishment at the end of the shift. I enjoyed customer service with the patrons. There was a lot of lifting and carry outs. However, If I was a little younger I would not have had a problem. All things considered, I really did enjoy working there."
good,Fast paced unloading of trucks and sorting product unloaded from trucks. Days go quick when unloading trucks ranging from small trucks to larger trucks. Management informs you of what you need to do before starting the day.
good,toys r us during the seasonal hiring is great for a first job and gain work experience which consist of lot of restocking helping customers out and being a cashier
good,Have work almost 90 percent of the time. Good ways for job skills. Not very good for earning for as hard as you work.great atmosphere for working. Doing expansive mobility in the storr
good,"this job is a steady decent paying job but compared to some other warehouse the pay sucks, lacking benefits and hours. also the countless number of technical issues."
good,"Fun workplace, easy work freindly helpful co-workers, great and helpful supervisors. The work was easy to learn. And the pay was worth the labor. The walki g could be a bit much sometimes but on tge flip side it's a job that'll keep you in shape."
good,"My time at Toys'R'Us was awesome. I learned many different ways to interact with all types of customers. Never was there a dull moment, and co-workers were easy going and fun to work with."
good,É uma boa empresa para quem se quer lançar na área de logística. O ambiente entre os colegas é óptimo.
good,Overall good but wish was told when hours changed. alot of moving around and lunch different even if same shift hours. I as a personal preference would prefer office work.
good,You never know what to expect at work when you come in but what is guaranteed are the laughs and frowns of the wonderful children. I learned to leave my problems outside of the work facility. i have also learned that it does not matter if you do not make friends with co workers as long as you satisfy the customers especially the kids everything will be fine. The hardest part of my job is trying to satisfy more then two three customers at a time.Th e most enjoyable part is seeing the faces of the parents when you find or have a toy that they have been looking for on their list for their kids that they cannot find anywhere else.
good,"Had to unload truck, stock the shelves, hours were never the same especially during the holidays. Might have to open the day after you closed, there was no set number of hours between when you got off and when you had to start the next day."
good,Learned new things everyday. Very fun and exciting atmosphere to work in. Enjoyed greeting and talking to all of the guests that come into the store to shop.
good,I realy enjoyed working at toys r us and i would highly recomend a friend to work at toys r us.. I havent gor a chance to order pick but im looking forward to order pick for toys rus and they pay pretty good ..
good,Very face paced environment. There is lots of customer service involved while ensuring you complete your daily duties. You must have a high sense of urgency to succeed in this company.
good,Typical day at work was to assist customers. Print daily sales reports. Check customers out as fast as possible. Management was great. Work environment was great. The most enjoyable part was working with the public.
good,was a good experience- but lack of advancement and semi unpleasant work environment led to seeing new employment.The staff were mostly team orientated but a large amount of preferential treatment applied to duties given.
good,"badly organized aisle and constantly malfunctioning equipment, not the worst possible job but still it's up there. management is confusing and you have 2 managers telling 2 different orders at once"
good,"Vendedor, buen ambiente de trabajo y buenos compañeros."
good,You will be dealing with costumers face to face. Help the with everything they need. You are always on you feet.
good,Typical fast paced cashier's job. Long hours because of  holidays. Management was great and all my co-workers were great. The hardest part of the job was standing all day in the same spot. The most enjoyable part of the job was working with great people.
good,easiest job ever. you have to check out the customers make sure no steals anything and clean and restock the store. managers are very nice and they work very hard.
good,"A typical day at work would just be tending to customers and fixing the store. I learned customer value and employee value. Management was awesome, he was very understanding. Workplace was not so diverse but it was calm and collected."
good,"Worked there during High School, and at that age was not allowed to work a lot of hours. Managers did work around my schedule with after school activites. It sculpted my work ethic, and I worked with some amazing managers and coworkers."
good,"if your in school this is avery good job to have. flexible hours and easy going people to work with, the guest are sometimes alittle aggressive but overall its a good experience."
good,"Enjoyed working there, but not enough hours/days scheduled. I would have preferred to work part-time, but the position was seasonal. Co-workers were fun to work with."
good,"Great place to work overall . friendly coworkers , fast paced, enjoyable enviorment.such happy place. Clean awesome energy . easy work when with a great team"
good,when you walk in  you automatically see everyone looks happy and in the mood. I have really enjoyed working there. the customers are great. The staff are great.
good,Greeting with a great big smile. Making customers feel welcome and comfortable. Helping customers with selecting products. Listening to the customers with interest in purchasing products that they are not familiar with. Assistant in events that were performed in the store. Demonstrated with products to inform the customer.
good,Hardest part of the job is high volume during the holidays but most of the time customers are very friendly and open to dialogue. I found it fun helping others find that perfect gift for their child. As a father of two it was pretty easy. Management was okay. Co-workers were great. I must say it was one of the best retail environments I've been apart of. Pay wise was a little disappointing but the hours during the holidays make up for it in a way.
good,Overall I was a cashier but I did stock and stand at the door a couple of times closing can be a long process especially during holidays because of all the people so just be ready to stay long if you close but working early is the best
good,"It was a fun experience working during the Christmas Season, especially learning about the new toys. Helping  customers finding just that right toy for their child was enjoyable."
good,This place is a fun environment to work. Everyone there is like one big family. I have learned a lot about the analytical part of the company. They treat their employee's very good and do special outing for them as well.
good,"This is a great place to work for someone with no experience such as a college student. It is mostly either working the cash register or light physical labor. It can be super crazy during the Christmas season, but that is only about a quarter of the year. The bad part is, since toy stores tend to be seasonally popular, they are usually dead the other times of the year, so it is nearly impossible to get too many hours during January, February, and March. They can usually run the store with just the supervisors during those months."
good,Working during the holidays you receive customer complaints from stressing getting their child what they want. Teaching you how to handle customer complaints the preferred way in customer service to continue to leave a smile on their face.
good,this job is great for people looking for part time work. past that the job fails to provide great opportunities to work up in the company. the pay is as close to minimum as possible and raises are not very good.
good,I worked as a Night Stocker for Toys R Us and loved the job! It involved pulling stock from the back and stocking your department. I was in charge of the Game Wall. It was organized alphabetically which made restocking very efficient and easy. We worked 11 p.m.-7 a.m. so didn't have to deal with customers which was a definite plus. The management was nice and we got all of our breaks on schedule. I wouldn't mind working there again. This position was seasonal around Christmas.
good,"This is a great Job for teens, Toys everywhere, games and is where a kid could be a kid. Good managers and great associates. I started as a temp then I moved to part time. I have good memories with clients and team members."
good,"When I first applied to my job, I was told that I would be shopping around for store pick up. Instead I was cashiering most of the time. Although I didn't complain due to the pay."
good,The most enjoyable part of the job was all the different tasks associated with back-of-the-house and it allowed me to experience many different aspects of a job.
good,"Great, relaxed place to work. Interaction with people and toys made the day go by quickly. A typical day consisted of being a cashier that had the responsibility of upselling/suggestive selling, providing gift recommendations, and reshelving after the store closed."
good,"I have nothing bad to say about this Company. You are treated with dignity and respect when you work there. It is tough getting through the Holiday Season, but you are fairly compensated for it after the Holidays. Lots of pressure to sell Company Credit Cards, and to land suitable Customer satisfaction ratings."
good,It was fun and a wonderful experience. I Loved working there.
good,My favorite job of all time!! I worked only seasonal but wished I could have worked there full time.  The pay was minimum but I never realized when pay day came.
good,Constantly around friendly happy people and get to see the latest and greatest toys before anyone else. Overall a solid work experience with decent hours and okay pay.
good,This was my first job and I have to say it was a reasonable start for me or anyone. I worked during the holiday rush so I always felt useful and that I was working toward something.
good,It was good team work and the workers was fear and there were room for moving up.  The supervisor was pretty good with the workers.  The lunch break was one hour and we was able to utilize the lunch room. We got paid for overtime and we were able to get paid vacation and personal time.
good,This job was overall a success even though I only worked here for a short amount of time. I learned a lot being a cashier.  I appreciate this job opportunity I was able to have.
good,"Enjoyable work experience, good management and employees. Work as straight forward. Your experience mostly depends on your store cause i have heard some really bad stories."
good,"I can only work after school at 2:20 on weekdays but one weekends I can work from motioning to night. I would like a place kind if busy so time code faster, but also so I don't stop from what I'm doing. I love to be moving"
good,This is a great place to work if your looking to expand you customer service skills as well as problem solving skills. The discount is not great and they don't do paid holidays.
good,"Busy working environment to work in."
good,"New management may have changed the way things are but it was an enjoyable work experience."
good,"I have made all my jobs work for me because of whom I am.I am very energetic and bring a thriving atmosphere to work."
good,"Their was only about 6-8 of us who worked that shift. It was during Christmas season, so we always stayed busy. It really taught me how to prioritize. As long as you get your work done management had no problems they were great. I was the only female who worked that shift, and I think the first season I worked there they were surprised that I had stayed and finished the season with them.due to the fact that our working hours were from 12 am - 8 am. They were really surprised when I showed up the following season."
good,"Toys R Us was my first real job and has been good to me so far; however, it is time to move on to something new. Working for this company I have been able to acquire good customer service skills and warehouse or inventory management skills."
good,show up at 11pm stay till 8 am. job required to work in small teams to unload shipping truck and to stock aisles and to clean up store before open. learned how to work in a very fast paced environment to communicate on a team and how to use different kinds of equipment necessary for the job. hardest part of the job i guess were the hours but at the same time a simple sleeping schedule change can fix that. most enjoyable part of the job were the coworkers.
good,"Buen ambiente de trabajo, grandes compañer@s, mucha carga de trabajo en campaña navideña"
good,During the holiday seasons the fast pace is nice. Off-season it can get very slow. The assistance managers are fabulous - always up beat and smiling. Working in a Toy Store can be fun if you know how to do it righr!
good,"Starting the day to deliver dropped waves with a crew of 30 in a warehouse that is 1.5 million square feet. Trying to communicate and have translated the work detail to team members."
good,"when i worked at toys r us, at least in california, it was an okay job for being seasonal, the management was alright, it payed good and good hours as well"
good,"Learning how to juggle work life and social life, perfect job for young starters"
good,Enjoyable job that unfortunately was only temporary. Spent a lot of time laughing and engaging with the public. Hardest part of the job was dealing with people just in the store to play with the merchandise.
good,"good first job environment. learned to deal with a cash register, stock shelves, and deal with different personalities all day."
good,"Dia sempre alegre , não só pelo ambiente criado no seu redor, como a maneira de estar nesta empresa, a capacidade de motivação e de ser motivado é constante, aprendi muito em todos os níveis , valorização pessoal , gestão tanto a vendas, stock e pessoal.Excelente ambiente de trabalho e claro o facto de trabalhar com brinquedos, está automaticamente ligado a crianças , logo o dia é feito a pensar nestes. Parte mais difícil a altura de Natal, onde há uma pressão enorme de ter tudo feito a tempo e horas, onde a formação e procedimentos têm de ser assimilados rapidamente."
good,"Toys R Us have good culture of work, people where respected and everybody were nice. "
good,you unload the truck in the back make sure you put the boxes were they have to go.restock the items on the sales floor and stocking in the back of warehouse if needed
good,"Fun work environment with great co-workers. Everyone is willing to help one another and great at communication. Great for a part time job, especially for high school students who need an after school job."
good,A typical day for me was during christmas season at the customer service desk. I've learned that I work better in a stressful setting. My co-workers were fun to work with.
good,Was a nice company to work for the hours was reasonable the salary was worth it for I only worked weekends and school holidays .  I worked under good management
good,"I'd never worked retail before and I got hired for a seasonal position. The job was pretty easy other than being on your feet the whole shift. I'd defiantly recommend working here if you have kids in your life. You gain knowledge about what toys are out there, but you only get a 10% discount."
good,"Fun workplace overall, but you won't get many work hours. This job isn't really that good for a full time job, this is more of a part time job. But can be a fun place to work at."
good,"This job isn't the worse, but definitely more of a stepping stool job. It can be busy during the holiday like most retail jobs but boring rest of year"
good,"usually very upbeat people to do team duties and didnt mind having to deal with the cons or downs of working their,stock and un-stock boxes,lift diffrent things around the store,maitence like sweeping.i learned how night shifts worked compared to day shifts"
good,"I started off as a Christmas Temp and then became a permanent staff. Upon starting I learnt how to my duty and other duties quicker than I thought, reason being that the staff members were very helpful and welcoming. They helped me settle in and were always willing to help me if I was stuck or need help. A typical day at Toys R Us is to help customers and give them the best service in the store. Management are fair, and encourage and support their employees, and progress them further if they see they have the potential. Overall, the team in Toys R Us are fun and caring and make the experience of working in the store worthwhile, the atmosphere is always lively, which has an impact on the success of the store."
good,"Sometimes there is a fast pace and busy environment, other times it's slow but there is always something to do. The co-workers and managers all had good vibes."
good,ToysRus is a very exciting and fun place to develop on your customer service skills as well as to understand more about retail. ToysRus has helped develop my confidence and boost my ability to converse with customers.
good,"I have not worked there long, however they have really made an effort to train and make me feel included and confident.  The other employees seem to be satisfied and confident."
good,"I am able to assist customers with making decisions on purchases, interact with parents and children alike during the interactive classes we offer. And work with an awesome team of individuals everyday."
good,Overall it is a nice place to work but they don't like to work with my availability because I have two kids that need me to. I like to work mornings while my kids are in school and to be home right around the time they are so I can help with homework and make dinner. The managers are nice and do help out with customers but make the schedule to fit them not the people who work there.
good,"Wasn't a bad place to work, its work it's the people whom you work with that make it enjoyable. I had a great time working at Times Square. I really loved it there"
good,"A typical day is long and non-stop busy. I learned a lot about retail and management, met some great co-workers that will be lifelong friends.  The disorganization of the company certainly made your job challenging and the constant doing and undoing the same things with the change in leadership felt defeating at times. The Team mentality made it more bearable."
good,Great company. Enjoyed working here even though one of my many supervisors was always on my case. Got a long with my coworkers well and wouldn't mind working with them again.
good,It was a fun place to work. The people you work with are very helpful and easy to get along with. The only thing is that there isn't really room for advancements and there really aren't any benefits.
good,I love helping people. Greeting customers talking to the kids looking for whatever they want. The customers are so great full.
good,"this was a xmas job"
good,It is nice to work with the public but I also really enjoyed the chance to work with children also. I would have loved to had stayed on with the company after the season if there had been a position available to me.
good,"It was a great experience just wanted a one on one situation with a client for example vodacom, call centres etc. But working at toys r us was great fun,got to interact with children getting to know all these different kind of toys."
good,Very rewarding to be able to provide the children with the toys they requested for birthdays Christmas and etc.  Co-workers are very helpful and are willing to help out when you need assistance or have questions.  Environment is very friendly.  A good job to work while your trying to finish school
good,"For the most part, a good place to work.  I often worked out merchandise to the sales floor, helped customers, and filled orders.  My co-workers were great, and I learned different aspects of retail."
good,This job is great for those that do not want a lot of hours. I liked my job and the staff I worked with. The one thing that I did not like was the lack of hours to go around.
good,"Working at a job where you make kids smile and help parents save some money while doing it is what retail should aspire for. The being said management is the key to any successful location. At the store I worked in management was ill defined and upper management was rarely there. During my time there the store manager had taken two month-long vacations, there wasn't an assistant manager until after a month in, HR rarely had time to leave the office, and the department managers were so overworked that hours had to be cut from everyone to compensate. The department managers were the ones who hurt the most by this set up as there had to be a manager on the floor at all times. The location I worked at had only 5 or 6 department managers. Without the assistance from upper management and few people to relieve them the department managers worked upwards of 10 hours a day 5-6 days a week. While acting as store managers for most of the day their personal departments were slowly falling behind and due to their high mandatory hours all employees took hour hits."
good,"A Great environment where people had fun, and worked hard.  Team Members felt like family and every day felt enjoyable."
good,"Friendly's became my first job at the age of 15, Dishwasher and food Prep. wonderful workplace, enjoyed the work environment."
good,Did not work there for long but enjoyed my employment. Friendly management made me feel welcome despite being somewhat shy. Was allowed to work independently and was capable of cooperating with other employees on task in a civil manner.
good,"Start at  6am run bay audit then fill fgos then stock the shelves "
good,"First to ensure that all staff has reported to work. I always took 10 to 15 minutes to  have a staff briefing and go over the days objectives."
good,A typical day will consist of waiting on guests. Helping guests with their purchases. Greeting and Assisting guests. Very fast pace environment.
good,"Medium paced business, stayed at cash register and maintained area or stayed on the floor the whole shift to put returned items back on shelves. "
good,"A typical night at TRU was fun."
good,"fun and friendly team. I learned more of inventory."
good,"Working day to day can get a bit repetitive, but it's never boring because so much happens in one day and we are always busy! Working at Toys R Us, I learned patience, you have to be patient when dealing with children and also sometimes with parents! My coworkers are amazing, they always make the time go by quickly. The hardest part of the job is probably product knowledge on the Babies side of the store because I work on Toys side. The most enjoyable port of the job is being able to see the new toys and games before they come out!"
good,the work place is always different as different jobs are given to you. Sometimes go weeks without hearing from them. wish hit had more places and ways for advancement at certain jobs.
good,Very simple job with little responsibility. Learned how to speak to customers professionally. Enjoyed the helpful and friendly managers and staff. Slow days were difficult because they were boring. Enjoyable and calm environment
good,Productive and fun environment to work in. We were put in the best position to succeed. My co-workers is what I will remember most because they were kind and friendly.
good,The staff all seem to get along really well to get through the day. No one takes each other too seriously and there is always a bright outcome to any problems that arise.
good,Was fun being able to watch the babies and families grow over time. You learned basic money skills and the people and coworkers because all close.
good,I enjoyed my days working at toysrus and dealing with a customer base that continually kept me on my toes. I personally loved seeing the childrens faces light up when they found the toy of their coice.
good,"Travel to market and prepare for the week on Mondays. Conduct audit and coach management Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday. Travel home on Fridays."
good,Toys R Us was a great first job. Time Square always had us working and gave me more time to interact with people on the floor.
good,"Overall the job was good fast pace always busy but the job security really wasn't there, co-workers were great to work with"
good,"Working at Toys R Us is exactly how you would think working in a toy store is. Yelling kids, angry parents, but fun because you get discounts on cool stuff. Daily you have to pick up after kids and their parents alike. (That whole ""this is what they get paid for"" mentality) This involves putting toys back in their correct isle, damaging out toys that the parents let their children open, and even throwing away food or drinks that apparently is okay to leave behind. (Can you tell it makes you bitter towards parents?) You also cash guests out at your register and you are responsible for your own til."
good,I loved working for Toys R Us. The work environment was very diverse in which I wasn't doing the same thing every day. I was the Baby Registry Consultant but I still had to run the register and stock inventory from time to time. The managers were always willing to assist me when issues occurred. I didn't want to leave the job but had to because the commute was too far for me.
good,I started off having toys r us as my first job. I definitely learned a lot and valued toys r us a lot because I was able to start at a job that was so perfect for me. I was able to gain work experience while being in an atmosphere I was very comfortable being in a family fun oriented surrounding.
good,"Toys R Us is a large company. Because it is so large, it was difficult for management to effectively communicate enough on a consistant basis. However it was a fun, high energy environment that catered to the customers and their children no matter how old. I learned so much here. Primarily how to use their COSA system. I counted all the cash drawers and dispersed them to all the registers. I also prepared cash deposits and did cashier audits. The hardest part of the job was having two different supervisors depending on the department I worked in however, they did the best job they could and everything always got done. The most enjoyable part of my job-Playing with the toys of course! Customer service is always enjoyable as well."
good,I enjoyed my time there as a seasonal employee.  When they decided to hire people on I was offered a position but only as a part timer.  I could not afford to take a cut in hours.
good,i was only there a short while but i enjoyed my time there and would recommend the job to people and would go back if i had the chance
good,Getting to se the clothes before it goes out on the floor and seeing the price was perhaps the most benefiting because I could determine if i wanted to buy it or not. Pro I think so.
good,Toys R us... good place to work at. Nice coworkers as well. great work environment. I would go back to the company if my position was created again.
good,"The only down part was that it was only a seasonal so I did not continue working there, like I would've liked. It was a fun work place and a fun job, I really enjoyed it there."
good,"nice overall work experience, great team members, good job flow process, fair equal work place, nice work schedule, paid weekly"
good,typical day at work consisted of fast moving work as a cashier. hardest part of the job is restocking non purchased merchandise at the end of the day after closing. the most enjoyable part is being able to assist all customers to satisfaction.
good,It is such a happy place to work.  Love the kids and helping them as well as the adults find what they want and are looking for.
good,The only bad thing I can say is that it is seasonal. Therefore there are not enough hours to be able to afford any benefits. However they worked great with me while I had to sign up for state health insurance and gave me the letter that I needed since there were at the time no hours. I plan on returning thee part time after I get my career started.
good,The company was great to work for and the day to day was always busy. We strived on our customer service abilities and made sure it was the number one priority in any situation.
good,"I was working at Toys R Us for about a year and a half and i can honestly say it was probably one of the best jobs i had, the majority of my co workers were awesome and im still friends with them now"
good,"overall not too bad, pay could use a little work. decent hours and customer service friendly. would work for again. lots of ways to advance."
good,The best set of people that I have ever worked with. The nighttime manager was always there to help. Never a dull moment while working there.
good,"Everyone that worked there was very nice, managers and co-workers and I learned how to communicate with customers. The most enjoyable part was making friends with all the co-workers."
good,I worked for Toys R Us for two Christmas seasons.  It was a lot of training for so short a season.  The training for Front End is very basic and it takes a while for you to know where everything is located in the store.  Customers during this season can be extremely demanding.  You must have a good attitude and be able to deal with a lot of stress during this time.  It is a fun place to work and I enjoyed seeing all the new toys that were available.
good,"Its a good atmosphere in which to work. I always enjoyed working there, the coworkers are always positive & upbeat & that would shine through to create a pleasant atmosphere in which to work. a typical day is filled with helping customers, cashiering, and closing involves doing go-backs and cleaning your department."
good,"We would get told where we would be for the shift, for example on the tills, customer service or shop floor. Managers and co workers was really easy to talk to which made the job a lot easier."
good,learned that toys r us is busy environment even though its a toys store. Did not like how they let me go when it was seasonal without any notice.
good,"Able to interact with kids and their parents, usually mothers, whenthey come to check out toys"
good,"Toys R Us gave me the skills and experience needed to branch out and grow. I originally started as an off-hours stock crew member, and progressed into cashier, back of house, and eventually pricing and signage coordinator. They give you the opportunity to try different positions and are very flexible in their scheduling."
good,Great part time job to have. Very understanding when it comes to your personal life. Diverse group of people to work with.
good,"- Arrivo in negozio, apertura dei programmi aziendali e di cassa, variazioni eventuali di prezzo, consegna fondocassa, apertura al pubblico,scarico merci dai camion e rilevazione con palmare ,sistemazione scaffali e gestione clientela. Chiusura negozio, chiusura cassa , deposito versamento giornaliero in cassaforte chiusura programmi aziendali, inserimento allarme negozio."
good,"A typical day at the toy store:"
good,My typical starts out with counting money and ensuring that cash registers are equally balance and putting out the registers for daily operations.  I also merchandise the apparel department by following monthly planogram and floor plans.
good,"Greeted customers, making sure everything was safe and cleaned. Interacting with customers daily with a wonderful attitude in a fast-pasted environment."
good,A typical day at work would  be making sure we keep our guest happy and our store running by making sure the store is filled and clean .Our coworkers are great people to work with they make it a fun place to be like a second home .The hardest part of my job is not having the support of some managers .
good,The most enjoyable part of the job is to watch the kids run around the store playing around with the toys. Even though you have to put them away it is still pretty awesome to watch. Maybe you could even try some out yourself if you are lucky.
good,"A typical day at work consists of checking the payroll, time reconcialiation, morning meetings to go over the metrics and set a game plan for the day. Customer service thereafter."
good,spent most days on the cash register but when wasn't too busy got to walk the floor and help customers find what they are looking for. I learned you cant please everyone all the time. you will make mistakes but its good cause you can learn from them. management was hard to work w/ cause they wouldn't fully train you on certain things then get mad when you didn't know how to do it. most of the co-workers were easy to work w/ and easy to talk to. so it was easy to just ask questions and not feel embarrassed about it. the hardest part of the job was dealing w/ management cause most of the time you would get told to do something then get in trouble for not doing something else. there was a lot of hypocritical things that would go on. the most enjoyable part of the job for me is when you would really help out a customer on a sale and the customer was really happy about the whole interaction. it was really cool when you would give them the information they were looking for and they felt really good about it. also when they would come back just because you were so informative about the items you were selling. (Despite most of what I've said about this job I really did like working there and it was a fun place to work.)
good,"This job let me grow as a person and become a leader not only for the store but also outside of work as well. The hardest part of the job is dealing with rude customers during the holiday season but when you know your making a child happy by playing the part of getting that special toy to them, that just makes everything better!"
good,"I started with TRU as a Supervisor, promoted to Department Manager then to Operations Manager.  There is growth within the Team.  "
good,"Serving customers and children at the checkouts, management and co-workers were nice to work for,so enjoyable talking to the children as it was Christmas time."
good,"A typical day at work would consist of clocking in at 10 p.m. , unloading the freight, then stocking the shelves for the remainder of the shift. Co-workers we're great, the hardest part of the job was adapting to the overnight hours."
good,"Usually it's pretty straight forward, you go to your section of the store and you restock items that have been collected by you or your co-workers. As you are re-stocking these items you might find other misplaced items. At this moment you have two choices: re-stock it in its' rightful place or take to the cart that we have collected other misplaced items. I learned that you don't always need to re-stock the item in its' rightful place, especially if it doesn't belong to the section of the store you are working in. My co-worker gave me some advise once and it was, ""never say 'I don't know' either tell them something you know or refer them to a manager."" and with this advise i have never encountered an unhappy customer. The hardest part of the job, in my opinion, was on Christmas Eve. The most enjoyable part of working in Toys R Us is interacting with the customers. You never have a more gratifying experience than right after you just helped someone."
good,"i would stock shelves, i learned how to work the cash register. i work in the game department and showed people where certain items where in the store."
good,"Imagine that!  Every day you learn something new in this business.  Typical day was very busy restocking, helping customers, and running the front end.  The hardest part was coming into work around 5am, working till 9pm, then having to come back into work around 5 am the following day."
good,"Encourages professional and personal growth.  Very clear on expectations.  I work two jobs.  Babies R Us was the second job.  The management works around my other job's schedule.  Most of my shifts were early morning so I could have time between jobs to change, eat, and mentally transition."
good,"La relación entre compañeros, encargados y jefes muy buena"
good,Loved the job but moved out of state. It made me feel good helping customers.
good,"A typical day at work starts out by restocking merchandise and satisfied customers with the best offer and product. Working with my management and co-workers inspires me to do my best and be the best of person i can be. The hardest part of my day is on a slow day, however the most enjoyable part of my job is on a busy day where i get to meet and interact with customers and put a smile on there faces."
good,"Worked with the night shift crew. Would stock the store shelves at night to prepare the store for day time hours of shopping. Was fun, received discounts on toys and items in the store. Was good because it allowed me to be home with my toddlers during the day and take them to daycare."
good,a typical day was to help out kids with their toys help them adding on with purchases
good,The work was challenging but extremely rewarded as we helped anxious nervous parents find the best products for their kids. I learned that parents will do whatever it takes to find a deal (kids are expensive) and we were constantly finding ways to save money for the client. Many of the co-workers were college kids balancing classes and work life. All in all the management was very responsive and flexible with scheduling. The challenges parts of the job was dealing with over zealous parents during Black Friday and Christmas. The most enjoyable part again was instilling confidence in the parents and making sure we listened to all of their needs.
good,Needs to pay more per hour. It was a fun place to work. The employees were good. The pay not so good.
good,"Ein angenehmer Arbeitsplatz mit sehr variablen Tätigkeiten!"
good,"Positiva a excepción de alguna encargada. Buenas compañeras y trabajo agradable al ser para niños. descagaba camiones de juguetes, controlaba mercancía que entraba y reponía en tienda."
good,They keep you busy. It is a fun place to work if you like toys and kids.
good,"It was a lot of fun working at Toys R Us.  In addition to my regular duties, I especially loved doing live demos and workshops with the kids."
good,"A fun place to work. Friendly and professional co-workers/staff, decent communication between members and managers. Hardest part of the job is during the holidays when we get a high volume of customers and working long shifts such as closing the store one day and opening the store the next day. Aside from having a high volume of customers, you get to meet people from all around the world and have some fun while doing so."
good,started this job and within four days got promoted from assembler to head assembler. got along with co-workers got along with most of supervisers. just moved
good,Had fun working here and playing with the toys. It was always a joy to be able to interact with children and their parents.
good,"Management team was great. Truly am grateful for the opportunity they gave me. Toughest part of the job was working the overnight shift plus and extra shift during the day. This normally happened during the holiday season. However, excellent place to work if you're in need of a part time."
good,it is a great place to work for the younger generation. Very energetic and fast paced.
good,"I loved working at Toys R US because I Loved the opportunity to work with the children and see them smile and appreciate their earnings. Management changed often during the short time I was there, causing the labor to become a bit difficult."
good,Working in toy's r us was never a typical each day was a new experience. Learning  something new everyday was the best part about the job.  The hardest part of the job was getting a short break and not enough time to get food or anything. I enjoy most about the job was the customers everyone had a story about toys when they were younger.
good,"Typical day was being with customers and putting all the merchandise back where they go on the shelves. I enjoyed working with customers and co-workers. Everyone seemed so friendly all the time, yes there was times you had that one person who wasnt but it was never hard to deal with. The hardest job was probably remembering where everything in the store went. learning the section of the toys could never stick in my mind since there were so many. Management however i'd say was alright, better than most of the jobs i've worked though. They were intiminating, i didnt really feel comfy going to someone and asking for help. They seemed to be really uptight when holidays came around, i felt the tension when you asked for help."
good,"I was a cashier most of the time, I liked upselling, what I liked most of all was being on the floor stocking shelves, helping customers by showing them around the store and picking out toys or other merchandise."
good,"Checking sales and payroll daily, i learned a great deal how to manage people. There was never enough time to complete the daily store plan. I really enjoyed the kids seeing them happy getting the toy that they wanted ."
good,I like the fact that we always had work to do to keep us busy the stocking crew worked great together as a team.
good,"I love my team workers , enjoyed the hours I worked. I learned a lot at this job that I can take with me to future jobs"
good,"Great workers "
good,"Toys R Us is a great job to work if you are working two jobs, you will not have enough hours to support yourself. The atmosphere is great and is generally enjoyable."
good,I loved working here. I was sad to leave. I only left because I moved out of state. I would return to this location in a heartbeat if I still lived in Michigan. I love my co-workers and miss them very much.
good,"TOYS'R'US/BABIES’R’US, GRAND RAPIDS, MICHIGAN CASHIER (SEASONAL) - OCT 2012 – JUNE 2013"
good,The customers where very nice but working there the salary wasn't enough to help me through school. They didn't want to understand my school schedule at the time.
good,Unload delivery trucks. Stock shelves. Customer Service.
good,"Tras tomar una caja , se cobra al cliente, se le resuelven sus dudas y se le complementa la información."
good,A typical day at work would be assisting guests with questions about the different toys and products in the store. Depending on the time of year it is it can be either very fast paced or very slow. I learned a lot about customer service and going above and beyond to satisfy them the best way possible. Management was great in assisting with help and taking care of the guests in a timely matter. Co-workers did good in assisting with back-up. The hardest part of the job was disappointing a customer when we didn't have something they wanted in stock. The most enjoyable part of the job was working in a kid friendly environment and being able to put a smile on the children's faces.
good,"The management could use some help.  The arrangement of the store lacks organization.  Most of my co-workers were ok to work with, however there were some that needed better cooperation skills, more of a Team Spirit.  A day in the life at the greatest toy store, consisted of doing re-shop of merchandise that was returned.  Assisting customers with their purchases and gifting ideas.  There were opportunities to assist in the refilling of merchandise to the main floor."
good,"This was only an xmas job, so was only there for 3 months at a time."
good,"On a typical day at Toy's R Us, I worked on a cash register dealing with customers who are well mannered or a bit rude. I learned how to work a cash register as well as how to work with written checks. The management was usually pretty friendly and always willing to help me out when I miss a step on how to do something. My co-workers were also generally very friendly and they were willing to spark up a conversation when our lines were empty. The hardest part of the job, for me, would have been the extremely long lines. If I had tons of people in my line and other lines were also very full, I always felt rushed to get everyone out in a timely manner and try to keep everyone calm."
good,"I held a seasonal position at Toys R Us, it was fun but sometimes frustrating. Management was not so good. One manager would tell me one thing and another would tell me something different. I received a lot of hours and pay was decent."
good,I learned how to manage different tasks during their busiest times. The most enjoyable part of the job was being surrounded by all the nerd culture.
good,"A typical day at work is being in contact with adults, children, and employees and helping in different areas of the store."
good,Fun job. I always learned about the new toys that were coming out.
good,"I worked as a cashier about twenty years ago at Toys R Us while attending college part-time.  I worked will with management and had a good relationship with my co-workers.  The hardest part of this job was the holiday season, the store is especially busy but it makes a shift go by in a flash.  The most enjoyable part of this job was just seeing children happy and working in a positive upbeat environment."
good,"I enjoyed my job at toys r us, the management was very nice. It helped me establish my first job and work on my skills with customers."
good,"El problema de esta empresa es que solo llaman a los empleados de otros años para hacer campañas navideñas que suelen ser de 2-3 meses aproximadamente. "
good,Toys R Us is the world's greatest kids brand.  The team I worked on was one of the best I've ever worked on.  We worked hard and had fun.
good,"I am a sales associate so I walk around the floor and make sure every customer is getting help at finding the product they want. I've learned the value of working with others. The management is awesome. They are really nice and they give constructive criticism. My co-workers are awesome and we all really get along well. The hardest part of the job is the fact that I'm kind of short, I have trouble reaching products for the customers. The most enjoyable part is that the products that I deal with, everyone loves. So everyone just wants to have fun."
good,"Sharpened customer service skills"
good,"My review for this job is communication skills mostly . All different type of people you come across. My fellow co-workers  are great people , enjoyed all the loughs . A typical work day is clean, clean clean , keep a smile and met all needs. The hardest part? there really was, nothing hard it was a simple job."
good,"Stress free days with management that attempted to make the work day as comfortable as possible. I learned great group leadership skills being a clerical assistant/ trainer of warehouse functions and equipment. Many of my co-workers were either seasonal or from a temporary agency, but gave all they had none the less in such an exhausting work environment. The hardest part of the job, in my opinion, may have been the retraining of the multiple warehouse functions and different equipment and also assisting in management during our seasonal and busiest time of the year. The most enjoyable part of the job was getting to know so many different people, from our core employees to the seasonal and temporary employees the company would hire throughout the year."
good,Fue una experiencia muy contributiva a mi vida laboral dado que siempre mostraban interés en que aprendiésemos lo máximo posible y que realizásemos un trabajo perfecto en nuestras labores.

good,I worked here seasonal for black friday two yrs in a row it was a great experience.
good,work was fun and you choose what you would like to work at  good management and team work I learned to work together to get what it needs to done faster.
good,"The average day at Toys 'R' Us including interacting with children and adults alike, selling products from Barbies to iPod Touches. I learned how to work as a member of a team and how to handle and resolve customer issues. Management was strong and helped with whatever questions I had. I worked with people of all ages and backgrounds who were friendly, knowledgeable and competent. The most challenging part of this job was adjusting to the different needs and concerns of each customer, but I found this to be a very educational experience and appreciate how it helped me cultivate this skill. What I found most enjoyable was helping people find the perfect item to give to their loved one."
good,"I would generally come in and work in the customer service area. I handled returns, exchanges, and disgruntle customers. I initially was just a seasonal cashier but 2 weeks after being on the register I was training new seasonal cashiers. The management was very friendly, and diligent in making sure that the employees new the policy's and procedures. The most enjoyable part of the job was dealing with the children. The hardest part of the job was being asked something by a customer and not having an absolute answer."
good,enjoyed my time working their had many fun moments and gained many friends and life long friends learned many skills that I still use to this day and appreciated everything they offered me and taught me
good,"I liked it because the job always kept me very busy, and it allowed me to meet new people every day, while being fun."
good,All in all had a good time working there. Most of the managers were very understanding.
good,"A very fun experience.Didn't seem so much like work as it did an enjoyable time.The ambience was always one of remarkable flare.It all made it so pleasant and easy to work for this company.I was just immature back then and did not understand what it all meant.Now,given the opportunity,not only will I do a great job,I will excell and strive to make the overall experience for our customers one to remember..."
good,"Came in after school or on the weekends to work, clocked in and took orders either at the front or in the drive-thru,made food on occasion, helped with hosting family night."
good,Working at toys r us was such a fun place to work. Everyone was always cheerful and created a great environment to work in. I learned about all the different products and services toys r us had to offer and why the corporation is so successful. My co-workers were all good team members and helpful. The most enjoyable part of the job was being around all the toys and being part of that great experience for children.
good,"A typical day at work includes serving customers, replenishing stock & ensuring deliveries are dealt with promptly. "
good,"When I started working there I looked forward to each day. I was being trained to be a Front End Supervisor. I learned a good bit rather quickly. I was hired just before Christmas season was starting and it being a toy store there was a rush."
good,"Basic cashiering and customer service as needed and assigned."
good,Babies R' Us would be a great company to work for if it wasn't for the very low compensation.  I learned a lot about furniture and guest service procedures.   The management was friendly and understanding.  I enjoyed my co-workers.  The hardest part of my job was managing multiple departments when we lacked department supervisors.
good,"Toys 'R' Us is a well structured organization but requires personal flexibility, which unfortunately, I did not have at the time and was unable to keep my role due to my financial needs."
good,"working there was fun because i was working with such great team. since day one i felt the team spirit at work, which made things easier for me and the other employees."
good,"For working seasonal, it was really hectic. Not recommended for anyone without patience."
good,"typical day is i would assemble bikes and power wheels,"
good,"Handling returns and overrides, the customer were very friendly. It was a great learning experience."
good,"I learned a lot about apparel and other baby products. the people I worked with were awesome I never had any problems, "
good,"A regular day at work would involve unloading packages, organizing mail, handing out mail, and fixing work orders which were sent in by other employees. I learned how to input delivered mail electronically, organize mail, approach strangers, and put cubicles together. Management was great. to people I worked for made it easy to ask questions and learn more. Coworkers were easy t work with and made things easy and comfortable. The hardest part of the job was finding out where the mail was supposed to go. The building was very big with many cubicles and sometimes it was hard to find which cubicle needed packaging because I was there at a time where many people were moving to different cubicles. The most enjoyable part of the job was putting cubicles together. I like learning new things when I am interested in it."
good,"This has to be one of my all time favorites. I worked as an over night crew member and we got to do things the day crew could not. But we did have to do our jobs before playing games. I learned patience, time management and organization. I was the only girl at times restocking the shelves but that didn't stop the rest of the crew from helping me out. My co-workers were great people and loved to help. The hardest part was when the store was open for 72 hours and customers would come in demanding for certain toys they were looking for last minute. The most enjoyable part was this was my home away from home, helpful co-workers, great management and overall fun place to be."
good,I had fun showing kids the new toys out on the market. I learned how to  pull items from the warehouse and unload trucks in a fast pace. I assisted customer with any questions they had in a timely manner. The co workers were fun to be around. They were all happy and great to work work with. There was no had parts of the job. I was happy to work there. 
good,Nice place to work if you are a student and its your first job. 
good,It was a fun place to work but it is not my long term job due to I want to be a computer technician.
good,I liked working at toys r us because it was fun to learn what kind of toys they had and how much kids enjoyed them.
good,I worked there as a single and the job helped me to raise my children. Thankful for that part of job.
good,It was a fun place to work with decent hours. The employees were helpful an friendly an made working fun.
good,I love working for Babies R Us. I have been working for them for over 2 years. My managers always work with me and have a flexible schedule. Many of my co workers have been there as long as me. We're like a tight family.
good,"Overall Toys R Us is a good company to work for, recommended for a first job. They teach you pretty good values and how to really focus on routines and a guest centered mindset."
good,The staff has completely changed since I worked there but the work was fairly easy most of the time. God help you during the holidays but that should be expected.
good,"nice laid back work at your on pace, but manager was fern. i`ve learned out to unload a truck, read inventory stock, how to use certain equipment they have. My coworkers we`re great, everyone got alone.the hardest part is taking the items out the boxes and there stacked hi. Having a job and learning different shops and having more knowledge."
good,"A closed environment and great family oriented, as well as team driven, qualities"
good,"A typical day at work was fair. I've learned organization, cash handling, and how to on load and offload merchandise. My co-workers took me under their wing and taught me everything they knew and if they didnt know the answer they would go out of their way to find the answer. The hardest part of the job was the rushes and high demands for toys and gifts during the holiday season. The most enjoyable part is helping a family member pick the perfect present or gift out for their loved ones."
good,"Toys R Us was a positive experience for me. Most of my days were spent at the cash register and phones where I assisted guests. Some of the time is spent restoring unwanted/returned items. The most challenging part of the job was being thrust into an environment and having to adapt at a quick pace, but once you understand the general tasks you settle into a pretty easy routine. All the co-workers were friendly and helpful. I would work here again, given the chance."
good,I Learned how to get along better with others. i day at work was just helping others and putting smiles on customers faces. i got along with my co-workers as well as my managers. the hardest part was just dealing with rude customers. the easiest part was just finding everything.
good,It was fun to come in each day not sure of what was to be expected of you. Just that you had a job to do. Make the shelves look presentable so people would want to buy the product. The other employees were fun to work with.
good,i enjoyed the people I worked with. they were friendly and helpful when need be. They were very helpful with flexible schedules
good,Seasonal Help...Not a bad place to work for the holidays. Overnight work 8 hours a night durning the holidays as xmas got closer the more hours you got
good,"A typical day at Toys R Us during On season was busy busy busy. From punch in time until punch out time one would always find themselvs with something to be done;from cashering to reshop, and also answering any questions and/or concerns from customers.I Learned to be more outgoing and the value and importance of team work. I enjoyed all co-workers met during the short time of seasonal employment.All of them took the time out to inquire about how the job was going and made sure that I was mentally alright during the chaos of the Christmas Season. The hardest part of the job was dealing with angry/rude customers in a professional manner.The most enjoyable part of the job was the children that came in to shop with their parents."
good,Overall my experience at Toys R Us was enjoyable and well met. I really like the atmosphere and people. It was a great experience and I would definitely recommend it.
good,Customer service/Cashier was a typical day at work. I learned how to operate Toy's R Us cash register and developed people skills. The management team was excellent in work assignments etc. I got alone with all of my co-workers and customer's. The most enjoyable part of my job was getting to meet people and expanding my people skills.
good,the employees are friendly and warm hearted
good,The hardest part of the day was putting toys back in their right place .
good,I loved working in the back. Management was on you only if you were lazy and didn't work.
good,Proficient in and able to navigate computer systems
good,"A typical day as a store associate includes helping guests, cleaning the store, and operating a cash register."
good,high energy place to work. the managment was cool.all the employees were always happy.
good,"It's a fun job, where you get tho put a smile on a kids face. The co-workers are all nice. And everyone gets along."
good,"A typical day at work for me is going in at 7:00 A.M unloading and processing truck every friday, while also doing some cashiering and working sales floor. I every day that i work, i think i learn something new on the computer or the scan gun, because i ask questions if i don't know. Management i am not to crazy about; they try to bully us lower ranked associates, instead of talking to us like we are people just like them. They kinda talk down to us. There is no hard part of the job, if just some small changes were made it would be awsome."
good,Report to store. Work register ringing up customers. Help customers find items. Stock shelves. Close store.
good,"Most of the time I go into work and have a job to do and it'll last me the entire work day. Other days I go to work and there isn't a purpose for me to be there. I do not enjoy walking around the store acting like I'm doing something. Managment could be better. Nobody knows when or if they will advance. The managers do not communicate with the employees very well or even to each other. They also do not take bad actions from co-workers seriously either. Most of the co-workers I work with never want to be there and do not do their job very well due to lack of interest. The most difficult part of the job is probably truck day. Unloading the truck, separating the boxes by department, putting what you can of the truck onto the floor, and then over stock has to be put up the correct way in the back. It's the longest process I'd say. I love learning new parts to the job. It makes me feel like I'm moving up in the company. I enjoy that I'm able to do things in all areas of the store and not limited to the register. I also enjoy doing markdowns every Sunday."
good,"A typical day at work is never quite typical, you never know how many customers, how much reshop, or how well the store would do that day. Some times it's amazing and every thing you've done you were able to accomplish, but even on the days where it seems like you're at war with the store the managers are always able to understand just what needs to be done to make the store okay again."
good,"It was a regular kind of job. You go in, unload the truck or pull backstock, and then get to work."
good,"I really enjoyed my Time at toys r us, the overnight shift is rough for a student but the management was fair and hours were plenty, pay was bare bones but ends were met"
good,"I worked here in high school as a volunteer and it was a very enjoyable experience. I got to work with customers, restock toys, and organize aisles."
good,"Usually, I would clock in and start off work right off the bat. This would include stocking, pricing, assisting customers, running the register, whatever needed to be done. If closing, I would straighten up the merchandise and tidy up the store, as needed. I never had any problems with co-workers. They were always friendly. It was a fun place to work. I enjoyed being able converse with customers and help them find what they needed."
good,"Our day starts early, so that all of our merchandising and stocking can be complete before we open for business. Once we open, we are all about customer service. Our guests, many times need our help as they are shopping for new babies and don't always have the expierence or knowledge to make fully informed decisions. Whether it be a new mom or the mom's aunt shopping, they require your knowledge of the product lines and your opinion to help them make their decisions."
good,You meet a lot of interesting people. I learned a lot about what it takes to be a great customer service rep. I had some really great managers that cared about the customers and the employees. Iam still friends with a lot of my ex coworkers.
good,"Can go from a hectic day to a calm, fun day. The week is usually slow, you can get things done around your department. In the weekends you have a lot of customers, most of which might have questions and need of assistance."
good,"I have been with the company five years, and it is a good place to work. The people there are what make the work day go by faster. I've learned many skills being at the company. I've learned to multi-task better than I normally do."
good,it was the usual requirements customer services. the co workers were kind and friendly. there was nothing that was hard.
good,Baby Registry was the best part of the day. Helping mothers-to-be make decisions about things they should get for their newborns or things for the baby shower.
good,"I enjoyed my time working in the stockroom of my local Toys R Us. It was hard work at time, especially during the holidays, but it was rewarding."
good,"Fun, colorful, friendly and great people to work with. Flexible with scheduling and little people customers that can't wait to shop."
good,The people you work with become you second family. The management is always fair and never unreasonable. The people that open on Black Friday were always taken out to lunch by the store manager. I loved it.
good,"Overall a good place to work, organization was a big part of the job."
good,"The reason why i put 50/50, is because when i first started i did enjoy my job until my manager had yelled at me in front of 40+ customers during the Christmas season. It was very embarrassing, the customers looked at me as if i didn't know what i was doing. Terrible."
good,"Foi uma boa experiência. Foi só reforço de natal mas deu para saber como é a loucura pelos brinquedos. A nível de colegas são agradáveis e a gerência é simpática. "
good,its was fun an exciting place to work great energy and good people tro work with don't see how the place went out of business must of been amazon that took them out
good,"I would come into work and log into the cashier that I will be working on for the day. Then while waiting for customers to shop, I would start organizing the front of the store by the registers, to get everything in place and looking nice for the customers. Throughout the day, we have to  work around the store and put away the toys and products that people didn't end up taking at the end of their visit there. After closing, we all have to make sure the reshot products are away and the aisle are looking clean."
good,"The job itself was enjoyable, and my coworkers were friendly and easy to get along with during and after work hours. Working there, I learned that there is more to a job than just what is shown on the surface. The hardest part of the job was the work hours I had during my employment. The most enjoyable part of working there was working with others and helping the customers should they need assistance."
good,"Working here was arguably my best job experience. The whole team was fun to work with, everyone got their tasks done on time (unless it was anytime between Black Friday and Christmas) and the management had your back."
good,"I worked in human resources with managers from a local store and worked with all departments as needed. Our customer service desk was swamped at times, and even though there were customers who took advantage of our ""customer is always first"" policy, we honored our policy."
good,the job was good while it lasted. I was able to fairly advance. my biggest issue was pay i simply wasnt making enough to support my growing family. they were extremely flexible while i was in school they worked around my schedule.
good,"It was an enjoyable place to work, my favorite department was the baby department and helping with baby registries for expecting couples. Sad that the company closed down"
good,Muy buen ámbito y mucho compañerismo me dio mucha pena que hicieran reducciones de plantilla si me dieran la oportunidad de volver volvería
good,"I miss working this job .... i wish they return back to union , i loved everything about it , work hours was good ... i liked working with the people that was working there"
good,Toys R Us was a fun work environment and my coworkers were very nice and welcoming when I first came in and that was great. The management needed work
good,It was a fun work experience. People from different backgrounds working together to make sure the customers are happy and satisfied with their shopping experience.
good,C'est au Toys R Us que j'ai fait mon entrer sur le marché du travail à 16 ans et c'est un excellent premier emploi! C'est une initiation intéressante au service à la clientèle et à l'art du marchandisage. Les horaires sont très flexibles pour les étudiants (et pour les non étudiants aussi).
good,not bad just lots of standing around with back pain from no pressure relief mats. was good for a job because I knew things and had goals and objectives
good,"liked the job  @ hours , the stress level was not to bad , we were promised  a $1.50 raise every 6months, after the first raise , it was lowered to  $ 1.oo . we were not told that the warehouse was going to close. heard about it on the news"
good,"The most enjoyable part about working for Toys’ r’ Us was definitely watching the kids go crazy over the big store, or getting the gift they most desired."
good,Enjoyed my time working at Toys R us in the two different locations I was. Management was not always the best but still enjoy my time there. I would go back in a heart beat.
good,I learned how to talk to people and the management was decent  . The hardest part was being on my feet for hours but I never ran out of energy . Overall it was an okay job .
good,I loved my job here. Worked almost 10years up til the day they closed here in Parkersburg WV. Management was always understand and all we're very caring for your family.
good,Toys was awesome! I've learned a great working environment fosters a culture of happy and productive employees. The kids were my greatest joy and closing the store my saddest.
good,great company to work for... they are very accommodating for students that need flexile schedules. Very clean working environment and great staff. Pay is good for work that you do
good,"Toys r us was a good company but sadly was put out of business. The people there were still nice, helpful and very understanding. They knew how to make employees happy and run a store."
good,"It was such a blast working at Toys R Us, I felt kind of like a little kid again walking around the store and being in the department I loved, being electronics."
good,"Fue un bue trabajo  ,muy buenos beneficios, yo lo extrano quisiera q vuelva  pronto  ,me gustaba lo q acia en el departememto de reciben descargar los truck y muy buenos amigos encontre en toys"
good,"Cool job during the holiday season. Had a good manager, and a group of people I liked for the most part. Enjoyed the job, and had a fair amount of fun during it, and got some decent deals. Hated working on Thanksgiving/ Black Friday, but it's a shame it went out of business"
good,"Overall working for Toys R Us was a step in the right direction. I was responsible for managing, record keeping and placing orders for maintenance supplies/materials. Overseeing the janitorial duties including maintenance of building’s exterior. I also ensured all maintenance staff complied with company’s safety laws and regulations"
good,"Can work flexible hours "
good,"Working at Toys R Us I was an sales associate so a typical day consisted of running a cash register, assisting guests, and maintaining a clean workplace. The most enjoyable part working at Toys R Us was helping parents and children making sure they had a pleasant shopping experience. The management was amazing and the workplace culture was very diverse and everyone tried their best to work as a team."
good,"Muy buen ambiente entre trabajadores, horarios a turnos. No necesaria mucha titulacion pero si conocimiento de la materia."
good,"Toys r us was my 2nd job ever and ended up being my 1st real job with responsibilities and recognition. I ended up in the electronics department which was known as the ""r zone"" which was great because I was a young kid that loved video games and more. Anyway...loved my job but corporate made some bad mistakes and as we all know toys r us is no more."
good,It was a fun workplace with opportunities for advancement. They provide their employees with incentive closet to Christmas time but you pretty much make minimum wage.
good,"Trato personal bueno y cordial, llevandote a realizar las tareas encomendadas a una eficiencia total."
good,"Toys R Us was a really good place to work for a first job. I loved the managers (except our HR), I loved the environment, and I loved the kids. Only issue were the angry parents and bad parenting I would see. It's hard to keep that stuff to yourself when bad parents are yelling at their kids and dragging them across the floor. Hardest part of my job was selling credit cards, but a lot of the other stuff was enjoyable. Co workers were all 16-18 year olds so we had a blast."
good,"Overall a great company to work for,Great opportunity to be known as a professional cashier,with the wuality of gaining skills of satisfaction to consumers."
good,enjoyed meeting new customers daily helping making decisions on purchases. fun cross training in other areas. fun during holiday seasons. nothing hard about the job.
good,Alot of tasks in which i had to fill alot to carry from the stockroom etc due to it being a specialist toy store but overall a friendly environment which i enjoyed working it
good,"Working for Toys R Us was a job I always looked forward to."
good,"a typical day at work was great it was a fast paste and stress free environment.  i learned how to use a cash register and the management was great. the workplace culture could use more diversity, the hardest part of the job where the customers."
good,Toys r us was s great company. They helped when you needed help. It was a fast paced job which I liked. They gave half time when working on holidays. They were really nice coworkers and managers
good,Creating a funfilled environment for parents and children through a one of kind shopping experience. The most enjoyable part of my day wasn’t making a difference for children and seeing their face light up.
good,I really enjoyed working at ToysRus during the holiday seasons. I have a lot of nice memories and I do not regret working there. I would like to see ToysRus re-open in the near future.
good,"The job was wonderful at first. I worked with friends and co-workers easily. We all became skilled in the after sale purchases and buyer protection up-sale. However, the final manager I had in the store ruined everything. He first badgered and bullied most of the workers into quitting and finding work elsewhere. he then slashed hours for some and forced mandatory hours on others, even knowing that they had prior engagements that would interfere with work. His goal, I discovered later, was to bring in his own friends as employees. in the end, after I was gone, he was caught stealing from the company trucks and was summarily fired and arrested..."
good,"I only worked there for a seasonal job but all in all was great."
good,it was a pretty fun job overall i really enjoyed it the management was friendly and the environment was fun to work in.my co-workers were really cool and friendly too.
good,"I loved TRU, working there was never difficult. The coworkers were fun & amazing to work with. The store was clean and well organized. Overall a great job to work at, I would definitely recommend a friend."
good,"At Toys R Us it was very fun and kid friendly, we always made sure to keep the kids happy. We tried to keep the store neat and organized we tried to keep the shelves stocked and provide the option to order anything we didn't have in stores."
good,"Working there Was Great , got a To Talk To a Lot Of Different People Enteract with The Children && Parents . Work Was Always Fun , People I worked With I Loved . They was a awesome , Management was Great ."
good,Great place to work as it is flexible to your life but paid under minimum wage. It allowed room for self growth. Unfortunately it is good as a partime job and not a full time.
good,"ToysRUs was the dream job in highschool. Higher than minimum wage pay, good hours and you work at a toy store. During the holidays you could pick up a lot of hours and make extra money."
good,"Unfortunately, the company closed down. But at my store, we worked very hard to keep the store up and running and followed company standards to the best of our abilities. It was a very positive and happy working environment and I enjoyed it."
good,"I started as a holiday temp, stayed on after season. I loved my co-workers and managers, they were a ton of fun! The job was okay for what it was to me, a second job for just some extra income. Shortly after i left the standard rate for the position went up from what i made but i never really fused considering i had my own reasons of being there and didn't have much of a demanding role."
good,this has got to be the most fun workplace although busy and always have something to do your sure to have fun with colleagues and customers as you twirl your way round giant toy store defiantly for the big kid inside
good,"ToysRUs was my first real job after high school.  I went from a shy and quiet individual that started at the bottom, to an openly engaging member of management in my time there.  The pay wasn't the greatest and there was always the inevitably irritating customer or coworker, but after twelve years of working at the same store, many shoppers and fellow employees became a second family.  I owe a lot of credit to them for who I've become and where my life is now.  While I will miss these things and other experiences that came with it, I will use the valuable skills they taught me to gain success for myself going forward."
good,"My work was adequate. Hours were plentiful during the winter, the summer was very limited. There was never a wall that prevented you from training in another part of the store. Sometimes getting lunch was difficult due to how busy it may be."
good,"Estuve contenta, pero el sueldo era bajo y no era un trabajo estable, ya que me llamaban solo en Navidad"
good,I knew my job for the most part as a receiving clerk. There were some technical errors and paperwork was always backed up. We could never seem to catch up. We were always short staffed. High turnover.
good,You have to keep up with your quota and have to sell o many buyer protection plans and credit cards in a day and if not you get talked to about it daily.
good,"The management was great, they were always motivating us to do a little bit better job with in-store competitions. It was understaffed and we could tell that the company was going under. All in all it was a good experience."
good,"I enjoyed my time working for this company.  The managers were fair and I got along with everyone, customers and employees alike.  It's a shame the company went out of business."
good,"Toys-R-Us was a creative, fun place to work.  It felt like one giant family while working.  The management went out of their way to make it an exciting and carefree environment while still reminding us that it was a job."
good,Working for Toys R Us was good job to start with. It was my first job and they helped me as much as they could with training and questions. Sadly I was seasonal and they were starting to close down. I liked it there but my hours were starting to interfere with high school. Overall it was a good first job.
good,Toys R us is a workplace where you can feel good during working hours. Managers are organized and the store is always nice and clean. I had fun and I learned everything I could. It's a shame that they went out of business
good,"I liked Toys r us "
good,Management was friendly and worked well with our problems both in the job and personal life. After the first couple of years hours kept getting slimmer for everyone and eventually it went to 8 hours a week and it just wasn't worth it to get to work anymore. The people I worked with were awesome and the memories will remain forever.
good,"It fun if you like seeing kids excited about their new toy that was being bought ."
good,Started as a Seasonal employee and worked up to an Assistant Store Manager in 10 years.  I enjoyed the fast pace and dealing with customers and being responsible for my team and the results of the store
good,Toys r us was a great place to work. Filled with happy faces and I felt like a big kid every day. I loved being a cashier and having that good interaction with the costumers and the children.
good,"I enjoyed working there for the holiday season. It was quick pace and likeable place, co-workers were kind and had no problems helping you when needed."
good,A typical day I have my position chosen for me if I wasnt on a register I was walk arounds trying to help customers. Our assistant managers were sometimes better than the real manager depending who cared. We were diverse to an extent mostly hispanic.
good,"Assist guest locate items they are looking to purchase, if not available in store, see if available on line and place order."
good,The culture was good and everyone got along fine for the most part. Most people were willing to help out when it was needed even though it could be stressful at times.
good,Something new to me in the Retail field.  The most  enjoyable part of the job.  Was seeing the kids face light up when helping find the items they was searching for
good,"There is no need for a review of this company. The Company went out of business and all assets were sold off. I did enjoy the time at the Distribution center,"
good,"I loved working there we all were like a family I moved up from seasonel TO becoming a lead in the out bound department on line orders,wishing the distribution was still open , My day started off morning meeting assigning team members work station, walk around to make sure all team members are working end of day s"
good,"It was fun working there ,i didn't have a hard time considering i was young so i have a lot of energy  and worked most of my time and i lived very close to my workplace so i never had a day where i couldn't come in or have came in late."
good,I worked at toys r us for 5 years and I seen people come and go I would have to say that the last mgt was the best I worked BOH and stocking and working the floor. I was happy when I got to find what the child was looking for . I made a lot of friends that I will miss.
good,"The workplace culture was amazing, it felt as if you were part of a family. I learned a lot about customers and how to best reduce there stress level and solve their problems. I loved going to work everyday there, the hardest part was saying goodbye to everyone I loved on our last store day."
good,Fun work place great employees humble working environment nice management decent hours pay rate was okay just wish it was weakly good training for communication skills with customers
good,"My typical day involves processing online orders , picking and packing, merchandising, serving customers, point of sale, filling, customer service, and many other duties."
good,Will working at Toys R us I learned how to count down the drawers and balance the vault. Most of the managers were nice and helpful. It was a fun place to work and you could play with the toys as well.
good,"Was a lovely place to work, had to leave due to them only doing 6 hour shifts witch don't work around school runs, very friendly staff and customer's ."
good,"My manager was always understanding. I will truly miss working at TRU.... the department I worked in was one big family. I hope that the next company I work for will have the same type of people. Team work, reliable and friendly."
good,"No two work days felt the same unless it was particularly quiet."
good,"The world of retail is a hard one to work in, but Toys R US is a better to work in than others. The environment is not backstabbing and it feels like you are working with a team and not just by yourself. The seasonal times of the year are stressful, but bearable."
good,Overall great atmosphere. Got paid well and worked hard for it. Always a positive experience at ToysRUs. Everyone would motivate each other to work harder together as a unit.
good,"Working as an unloader, the life balance did not work well, except when christmas came. During the holiday season, i got a good 40 hours a week and maybe more, and pay was increased. I had not seen an 800.00 check in about 6 years and it felt great. Just about everyone i worked with was awesome and i don't know if i will find such great people in this kind of job again. I guess a toy store just attracts neat people. The managers were great people i could look up to, and i haven't had that in a while either. It's sad the company is closing, because i will miss them."
good,Toys R Us offered a unique work environment that was complimented by its fast pace and incentives to metric goals. It really relied on teamwork in order to meet customer satisfaction. In addition to being flexible with employee schedules it provided a great place to learn great work habits.
good,"i enjoyed helping customers, i liked seeing the new products we were selling, like learning about the different products didnt like that we barely got customers nor that we closed down."
good,The most enjoyable part of the job was that they gave the opportunity to learn other functions in the workplace culture. The job was flexible on changing shifts.
good,"Although my interactions with customers and fellow employees were generally excellent, my interactions with management and corporate representatives left much to be desired.  Each manager had their own unique take on how to berate and belittle employees.  I would not recommend working there long-term."
good,"I would manage item eligibility for several departments as well as the Hot and New shop and Checklanes and Endcaps. Also coordinated many feature shops."
good,The store I worked in had a great team spirit and desire to do well in meeting our targets. The staff were very friendly and easy to get on with. They took to me very quickly and so I was able to settle in and be comfortable in the workplace. The managers were very accommodating of hours although they did tend to put you in for extra hours without confirming availability. The company clearly had issues higher up the chain of command that reflected in how certain stores operated though this didn't necessarily effect me much.
good,"The work environment early in my employment was so exciting into my midterm. I have learned to problem solve situations, manage  a team and store solely, opening & closing the business and meeting goals of the company while maintaining company standards. The  most enjoyable part of the job was developing relationships with my team and the customers...they were family. The hardest part of the job was feeling undercompensated, unappreciated when reviews are scheduled. Also, not being able to have a voice for my team members when problems arose, due to tainted protocols from management to corporate & corporate to management."
good,If you're a Kid at heart like I am. Then you would've loved working here. I worked at Toys R Us for a very short time. I moved away. The management team was One of the best set of people I had ever worked with. If I could I would work for them again. Unfortunately they are going out of business.
good,Responsible for working with team members on customer
good,"Toys R Us taught me various skills such as being able to operate a cashier, how to provide customer service, as well as patience. Fun and flexible environment, where the atmosphere was friendly. Hardest part of the job was dealing with difficult customers but overall a great experience."
good,Productive and generally a fun place to work.  So many collaborative projects and energetic/willing people.  Amazing teamwork that has allowed us to quickly respond to issues.  Great campus.
good,"Responsible, punctual and detail oriented line production worker."
good,I enjoyed working here and made many friends. Management is good and helpful. There is a team environment to working at Toys R Us which is part of what makes it fun to work there. You don't have to worry about competing with coworkers and focus on working with them.
good,The work environment was always friendly and the management was great to work with. I was able to climb the corporate latter starting as a team member all the way to seasonal manager.
good,A wonderful company to work for. have been with them for a long time managment was amazing. could have worked here for a very long time. very sad that itll be closing its doors forever.
good,"Working at Toys R Us was very fun. I enjoyed being around a lot of new people, making customers happy, children happy from being around all the toys and learning customer service skills."
good,"Fun place to work in. Friendly staff and customers. When trained you are focusing on many aspects of the company not just one, so you aren’t stuck in one thing the whole time you work there."
good,"Had a great time Learning, Layed back at times and being able to be available . Learned  bout team work , that their are good people fair management, Put up merchandise and making shelf's look full, I think be my favorite part of job."
good,I was hired for a part time position and was only offered half of the part time hours. I was unable to really strive and show my skills since I was limited due to the hours and pace of the job.
good,With over 10 years working for the company I can say it was a pleasure but unfortunately the business is no more. I would probably been there for many more years.
good,"As someone who worked for the company for 7 years, I have seen people come and go, as well as seen the insides of what it takes to be in the business. I loved working for this company. The only reason I am looking for new employment is it's recent decision to close all stores. It was a great company to work for. I have a huge rapport with my team there."
good,"toys r us was a great place to work the culture was outstanding."
good,The company was good to work for but went bankrupt. The team at TRU was great to work for.  I enjoyed the over twenty years that I spent at this company.
good,"Buenas empresa ,la mayor en el sector del juguete y puericultura."
good,It’s Great To See Kids Happy. A Typical Day At Work For Me Would Be Just Making The Kids Happy Including My Very Own. There’s Nothing a Better Than That
good,"Helping parents find the right toy for a child."
good,"Work/Life balance in my role could have been better.  However, it depends on what team you work for.  Summer hours were great.  Very laid back dresscode.  However, a lot of expected from the employees.  This is not a place where you will get bored.  Unfortunately, medical benefits are not that great.  The most enjoyable part of my job here was that I was constantly challenged."
good,Working at Toysrus I have worked with some fun and friendly people I have leanered to work on my own and as a team to achieve targets. I really built my confidence working at Toysrus working with customers.
good,I had a great time with all the kids at toysrus i enjoyed seeing all there smiling faces when they came into the store. I loved dressing in the mascot costume and doing all the birthday events with the kids. I loved being able to come in and help people and make some little kids day
good,This company is a rarity because it allows a good work life balance unlike most retail companies.  It is unfortunate that it is no longer a viable company to work for.
good,Once you learn the basic do's and dont's of this job you will quickly catch on to your every day duties and instantly become comfortable performing them each and every day. Along with the assistance of co-workers as well as managers.
good,"I loved my job with Babies R Us. However, I needed something with a more stable, consistent work schedule. I also needed a job with benefits, such as health and 401k"
good,The job was very easy to work.  Task kept me busy on my entire shift.  Manager and employees were very easy to work with. It was a work environment you  look forward to going to work.
good,"A typical day at work would be helping stock the shelfes, and help customers find the item they are looking for. Also price checked items for customers."
good,"I throughly enjoyed my time at toys r us. It is a fast pace, fun job. When my husband and I decided to start a family, it was a tough decision to walk away from my position at toys r us, to seek part time work. But a necessary one."
good,"I am thankful for this company and all it has brought me. I've learned how to handle money, how to make sales, introduce people to the credit card, how to maintain a clean shopping environment and the best part is working with great co workers. I've had great managers that take time to listen to concerns or if I had questions. Hardest part of the job is satisfying customers that want a return or exchange without receipt when they want a full refund, or instances that require a manager. Also, doing exchanges, returns, purchases, online orders and answering the phone can be overwhelming when working at the service desk with few people. Dealing with customers is key to the position. This was a great first job and has made me appreciate retail and the company."
good,"There was definitely some stressfull moments, but I believe that's anywhere working in retail. Very helpful management that always tried to understand any situation you had. Expected you to work accordingly to you position."
good,working here is fun and exciting though the hours are long but we get to meet different types of people and although customers can be difficult i enjoy working with people and pleasing them and putting a smile on a kids face when they get what they are looking for
good,"Fun, fast place to work. Holidays get really busy and can get overtime.  Have to have a great deal of patients and sense of comedy.  Staff easy to work with."
good,"My typical day at work consisted of me running check out lines help customers find what they wanted and help them with returns. I learned that I am very good at multitasking and keeping a cool head under pressure. Management there was very nice and always looked after everyone, so no complaints there. The culture around the workplace was fun and supportive even through the most crazy of times. The hardest part of the job for me at least was the down time after a big rush of people it seemed to slow down to a crawl but it would eventually pick up again. My favorite part of the job was helping everyone getting what they wanted I enjoy seeing smiles on peoples faces so knowing that I made their day easier made it all the better."
good,I love working here it’s just hard to get the pay you need to survive. They have helped me out with time I need off to raise my children but being the only income it’s hard to pay my bills with the salary.
good,"Each day i would go in and check what needed to be put on the shelf. While doing this you also had to help each customer that was near by while stocking the shelves. I personally did not learn any new skills but you can learn to be a team player, using a ladder, customer service skills, and working in a fast pace environment. The managers were friendly and easy to work with. Be ready to be moving the entire time on your shift, there is very little room for a break. The hardest part of the job would be getting used to the fast paced environment. The most enjoyable part would be working with the customers and putting toys on the shelf."
good,"I learned much about stocking the items properly, fulfilling the orders of online customers for shipment, and working with others to get the job done. The management was friendly and helped whenever I had a question. I had an overall good time working with Toy-R-Us."
good,Working at toys r us was a great experience. I Enjoyed the atmosphere as well as my co-workers. Everyday was a fun learning experience dealing with customers of all ages.
good,I have been there 9 years and have moved up from Seasonal Team Member to Departmebt Supervisor.  So there is room for growth from within.  Management is great.
good,Toys R Us has a fast pace environment that requires you to be able to multitask so you don't forget about a customer waiting. There is times where you will be running around and then times where there is no one and you do re-shop and clean up.
good,enjoyed my time working at toys r us. was addition sales associate when extra cashiers were needed. job was pretty simple and easy and only grew hectic because of the holiday season.
good,all staff are fantastic and are willing to help anyone learn and progress within the company. The job is made easy as it is enjoyable and a fun place to work. hours can be demanding over the busy period but nothing unacceptable.
good,"I wasn't there for very long, but it was a nice place to work. It was never too crowded, but there was always something to do or something new to learn."
good,There are opportunities to grow in various aspects within each department. I have learned some of the functions of each department that I work most closely with.
good,"If you can handle Toys R Us during Christmas, you're golden with handling customers everywhere else. "
good,things at toys r us is actually pretty fast pace and busy you have to stay on your toes and do your your best to meet credit card sales goals you will be rewarded in the end. i personally enjoyed it there i love a good challenge.
good,"I was with Toys R Us corporate group for a little more than one year. I enjoyed the team culture, the friendly environment and the solid management team."
good,"Stressful environment during holiday season. do a mass hiring of temps and seasonal workers that are let go after christmas day. Training for temp staff is limited. Company is currently in a rebuilding structure due to filing for bankruptcy, Bank makes decisions for company overall,"
good,"The niceness of the people you work with made this place really enjoyable. Although it was busy and yes it is busy, the people were fun and there was always lots of laughs going around."
good,Fun place to work and the co-workers are easy to work with. Management is nice and helpful.  Hoping to get more hours in the week. The shifts are long but it flows smoothly.
good,Great opportunity to work in different areas of retail from cash control to receiving in or merchandising freight. Long hours including around and on holidays.
good,Working for Toys “R” Us for  three years was pretty good.  For working just for the holiday season is very reasonable.  But for the off-season is the only work like one is needed for seasonals like Valentines or Halloween.
good,"There were no benefits, only the opportunity to be hired permanently, in a different department. "
good,"Great for an entry-level/dead-end position. People are nice and you get the opportunity to work without stress. Very friendly and casual environment, so long as the work gets done."
good,"How could you not enjoy working in a toy store? It is very fast-paced and offers competitive wages. It does get crazy during Thanksgiving to Christmas, but during that time they allow you to work as many hours as you want."
good,Working here you have to be quick with the cash register as the line tends to get very long very quickly. It is competitive in a way because everyone is trying to get people to sign up to get the Toys R Us credit card.
good,The staff and management are very accommodating and take very good care of their staff and conduct all the proceeding effectively and accurately which makes for a very peaceful an cohesive workplace.
good,"Being in management at Toys R Us can be very demanding. We do try to have fun especially during Christmas time, when you see the faces of the kids. They bring such joy to your job. The demanding part comes from corporate."
good,they are good about flexibility about your hrs and your availability when you are part time. management is good. sometimes there isn't enough cashiers so the lines can get long.
good,"Not bad if you just 'need a job'. Gets busy which is good. Not somewhere i'd particularly see myself working as I get older to be honest, but a jobs a job"
good,You had a chance for advancement and you worked with different departments and gain knowledge of different products to inform the customers to fit there needs.
good,Toys R Us is a great place to work. There is always a positive attitude with customers. They treat their employees and customers with respect. Toy's R Us also give employees a great opportunity to advance in the career field they attend.
good,i say its a great first time job period.  if you never worked on the books this job is super easy to learn what to do and if you are a kid at heart and like to be around a kid orientated environment like i do this job will be a walk in the park
good,"Although there is progression through the management chain and into the offices in Toys R' Us, I do believe it can solely be used as a first stepping stone into working life, being as it is a retail job, you quickly learn to deal with a multitude of people across a great spectrum. It enhanced my problem solving skills and built relationships amongst staff."
good,It was a great first job. It was a great way to learn all the aspects of working in retail. I was even fortunate enough to learn what kind of work goes in behind the scenes.
good,You must be productive while working here. The work load will back up if they don't meet there daily goal and makes it harder to keep up with the weeks carton count
good,Running a Toys R Us is both rewarding and challenging.  I have learned a lot and respect everyone who does retail management as a career.  I love seeing the children's eyes when we make them happy.  The past few years have become very challenging in the retail environment with a lot of turnover within our company.
good,"Pick up box, put down box, repeat until finish; the work seems hard as you start but quickly becomes easier. They stay true to their word, giving jobs regardless of disability or convictions."
good,"This job depended on the day. One day everything was perfectly fine and everyone got along great, other days if management was in a bad mood so was everyone else. There wasn't always the proper amount of communication regarding issues of store ads."
good,Most enjoyable part of my jobs was being able to help the parents and children find the toys they were looking for. Seeing the excitement of children when they first come into the store was exhilarating
good,"I enjoyed my time with the company. The hours are flexible, and the Assistant Managers create a warm environment. It's busy during the winter season, but slow any other time of year."
good,This was one of my favorite places to work even though it was only seasonal I'm glad I got to experience working in such a great environment. The manager was nice and my co-workers were great.
good,Work environment is not but bad but could be better. Everything revolves around getting customers to sign up for credit cards and our rewards cards. Most enjoyable part is making real connections with the customers that we meet.
good,"Toys R Us is a alright environment to work at,its fast paced in some areas and not so much in others the management seemed busy at all times so not much seeing of the managers and the leads were alright."
good,i learnt how to pack and send produce as well as doing stock rotation and becoming a team leader. it was a good enviroment to work in and they all make you feel compfortable.
good,Selling toys was fun but it got really fast paced and stressful. All in all the people I worked with were positive and made the experience more weightless for me.
good,"Typical day includes helping customers, assembling products, unloading trucks, operating a cash register, stocking merchandise, and cleaning up at closing time. One can learn how to assemble things like bicycles and large toys (play kitchens, doll houses, plastic wagons, etc.), and part of the training is focused on how to actually ""play"" with the merchandise in the store so you can better show customers and encourage a sale. Management is good if the manager is good. Dress code was non-denim pants and a provided shirt and name badge. The hardest part of the job was during the holiday season. The most enjoyable part was the employee discount, good staff, and ""playing""."
good,"Not a bad place to work. I enjoy the work at Christmas time."
good,it A Good job i didnt rreally work there long but i would like to go back when ever they need help. it wasnt really that hard i just worked over nights lol staying up all night was the hardest part
good,"Great People to work around. "
good,My time over at TRU was a over all good time from stocking shelf's to talking with customers to help them find what would suit them or their children's interests in my experience people listened to what i had to say and the customers and staff were always polite I felt welcomed by the staff and felt like i was part of a team
good,"In my option I would like to make the company more fun, meaning able to express ourselves in fun clothing decorating the store in fun colors. For example letting the kids hand paint the counters or something. I also feel the company needs to take more recognition in the overall team as far as getting the store visables, not just reward the top 3 but to reward and encourage the entire team because everyone tries. I also think corporate or big bosses should take the time to hear from the ones that work on the ground., let us get ideas out to make the company better as a whole. The company is a great place to work but that's it work, we need new spice new things and lots of fun color."
good,"Like any other retail or department store, weekends are usually the busiest days and that's when different people get tested in different ways. Team members usually start of as cashiering and then later on get moved around the store to learn different things. The one thing I hated about it was some people didn't work well under pressure and it showed on already stressed out new parents. "
good,"Dealing with any issues customers had, inquiries, answering phone calls, locating stock, putting through transactions, welcoming customers, doing security checks within the store and manning the front door, lay-by."
good,"While working here your named job title won't be the only thing you do. When they need help with cashier, customer service, they will look at the first available person. It gets really fun around Christmas when all the parents are freaking out but by the end of the visit they leave happy."
good,"I worked part time as a cashier and it was very busy during Christmas. Other than that, it was pretty calm. Management is good and helpful whenever you needed them."
good,"Toys R Us was overall a good job, but scheduling was crazy as well as not enough hours. Training was very minimal as well with what I felt was a 5 minute training and the rest was for me to figure out."
good,"My job consists of customer service on a daily basis. I greet and assist every customer, answer phones, provide knowledgeable information on products and ensure company metrics (selling rewards, warranties, credit cards, ect.) This is a fast paced work environment and I interact with different people daily with a variety of concerns and questions. I strive to provide excellent customer service to everyone."
good,"Buen ambiente de trabajo, como trabajo temporal esta bien, pero el sueldo es algo complementario, no se puede vivir hoy en día con un sueldo de un empleado en toys r us."
good,"my time at toys r us was great , they are flexible and able to accomodate , it is a great place for students to get their foot in the door with work experience."
good,if you are a student this is the place to work for the holidays. i worked here during school because it was year round and the hours were a good balance with my schedule.
good,"I looked forward to working with my team members, it was always a good time. I learned a lot with the company, glad i got the chance to experience it."
good,"I was a seasonal cashier a typical day would be helping the customers find toys and checking out, or helping with returns. Friendly people all round but it was the holiday season."
good,During the offseason there are not too many customers but during  days like Black Friday time flew very fast. The employees and managers were very friendly. Easy job to learn and understand.
good,"Typical retail job. Had rude grumpy customers as well as the nice enjoyable customers. Working on the ""baby side"" was the best part of the job by far!!"
good,"It is a good to place to work. I have good co-workers to work with. the management is good, they don't watch over unless you're not meeting production which is easy to do. All in all Toys R Us is a good place to work"
good,"The customers were very disrespectful and rude but it was manageable. The work space was a little messy and there were long nights,into mornings. Overall a great experience."
good,"While I was at Toys 'R' Us I learned quite a few things including how to approach customers, and how to open up the glass cabinets where the store the electronics. I wish I could have learned more while I was there unfortunately I was there for only a Seasonal Job. I feel as though if I hadn't been there for simply seasonal and were there at an earlier point in the year I would have received better training as well as more experience."
good,Great place for high school students to get a feel of the sales and retail environment. Friendly staff help guide you to developing customer service and retail skills
good,not a lot of full time postions when I worked there but other than that its toys r us its fun and positive environment not a lot of stress besides for black Friday of course
good,Highly demanding work. A few managers and customers were the worst people I'd ever interacted with. Impatience from both sides. I loved the idea of helping people find the right toy/game/bike so it was bearable. I worked certain toy departments and filled guest orders so I didn't have it as bad as cashiers.
good,I learnt how to use a RF gun to label shelves. I learnt new customer service skills and got to make new friends amongst my co-workers. Most days I did recovery which was taking items that didn't belong on the shelves out and putting them in their appropriate places.
good,i enjoyed working here i loved everyone i worked with nice easy enviornment hours werent as stable as i would have liked nice short shifts variedddddd
good,"the environment was ok, the job scheduling wasn't flexible enough. the manager was randomly scheduling me at certain times of the week and the timing was completely off"
good,"Great part-time job. Low pay. At the location where I work, shifts are kept to about five hours, so that employees do not have to punch out for a lunch break. Management are the only full-time employees. Not many shifts per week (except closer to the holiday season), but there are often opportunities to cover shifts for call-outs. Positive, team atmosphere. Varied tasks. Good communication for efficient customer assistance. I do not enjoy the constant pressure to get customers to sign up for credit cards, but doing so is always recognized, celebrated. Most people enjoy working at Toys R Us, and it's almost always a fun place to be."
good,Toys R Us is a great place to work. A typical day is stocking and getting product ready for the day. The most enjoyable part of the job is seeing all of the kids happy when they find their toy.
good,Usually the work day is very easy going . Managers are mostly joyful. You may get hard to please guest but mostly everyone is relaxed. Theres a lot of holiday spirit and they are very interactive with guest.
good,I loved this job. I enjoyed going in and being able to help others. Loved the vibe that my co-workers had. Too bad it was only a temporary seasonal job.
good,very Organized and standard. I enjoyed most is to be able to talk to the customer as they wait for payment and grow a bond with constant customers
good,Worked for 7 years very friendly people easy to move up. Staff is very helpful and polite . Overtime is available regularly and
good,Great atmosphere workers do there job good place to work manager's put in work as well all about working as a team keeps u busy fast pace job
good,This is a great place weather you want to try to build a career or just a first time job! and great for someone thats in school or wants to just work to make some extra cash.
good,"The company is a decent place to work for.  Benefits are fair, but expensive.  Energy is improving.  Building is nice.  Workload is heavy.  Overall a fun place to work.  The people are the best part of the company."
good,Employees worked as team. Love the hours just had to move back to savannah from florida. Hands on training. Gave great customer service. Worked witj employees schedules.
good,"Working at Toys' R' US has been a positive learning experience. As much fun as it is working with and around children, parents, and a wide toy selection, you have to remember that above all you're still responsible for providing excellent customer service. The company promotes a customer centered approach to business and advocates going above and beyond for customers so that their needs are met and they leave having the best experience possible."
good,"great place to work but didn't for fill job expectations, wanted more to do in the job role and better hours. in the four days I did I managed to know where ever toy was placed in the store."
good,Challenging to get better in all phases of the building when you have a hard time keeping management and valuable team members around.
good,"This store has a fun atmosphere, a fun staff, and is fairly low pressure. Pretty much everyone on staff is willing to support you as long as you do your best. It being a toy store, it helps if you enjoy toys, interacting with children, and helping people in general in order to best assist them. Sometimes you have to be very patient with guests of all ages and listen very carefully to very vague descriptions of toys in order to figure out exactly what they want which can be tough. You have to be willing to research the products on your own outside of work a little too because customers except you to be able to give them informed options on products and how they work. But that is worth it to see a kid's face light up when you have helped them find the toy they have been dreaming of."
good,"Don't like morning shift, some customers are rude & sneaky. Night shift is the best shift because the pay is kind of cool for the work that is required to do."
good,As per most retail jobs it is hard being on your feet all day leading vast amounts of customers around the store and given the sheer size of the Toys R Us store I found myself walking an average of 6 miles every shift. But unlike some other retail companies I've worked for Toys R Us felt like a family and the jokes and friendly smiles from colleagues made the long days worth it.
good,The hardest part of this job was working from midnight to 8 am and then having classes from 9am to 6pm the next day.  I never got any sleep.
good,Excellent experience. Everything about the company was great. Management was very understanding and considerate. Everyone felt welcomed to the company as soon as they were hired.
good,"was always busy in some area at the register or floor, good management, co-workers that had been there a while were always willing to help, let you know how valuable your work was to them. The most enjoyable part of the job was the feeling of being able to help customers."
good,"Toys r us is a decent entry level employer,  with room for advancement, however there is a very high turnover rate. it's a friendly and fun environment a great place to begin in the retail world"
good,Fun workplace and environment but I did not receive enough hours. A lot of crazy activity so you must be on the look out at all time during your job.
good,"My job as a clerk there was seasonal, but the good thing about it is that you don't have to deal with customers out on the sales floor. I just wished the clerking job was part-time."
good,"it was a very good job. the only con was that they tried to push credit cards too much sometimes. "
good,Amazing job to work. I had just graduated from high school.This job helped me before I went off to college. I was able to save money and buy the things I needed. Great seasonal job as well.
good,A typical day at work was helping customers or even children find what they were looking for. The co workers and management was very humble helpful and positive. Every shift was something positive to look forward to.
good,"Working for Toys R' Us has by far been one of the greatest families I have ever had the blessing of being a part of. The staff is fun and will become your closest friends, and seeing smiles on kids' faces is the best part!"
good,"The job itself wasn't bad at all. I enjoyed it for the entire time I was there, and built great relationships with all of my co-workers; however, the job was temporary to begin with, as I did not see myself there forever."
good,"Each building is different, but as much time as I spent angry and irritated throughout my day, it is a retail job. The pay isn't the greatest and annual raises are a joke, but it's to be expected in retail."
good,"I worked here for 10 years on/off while I studied. I made a lot of great colleagues and love talking to costumers, so this job was perfect for that."
good,"Enjoyed working there during the Christmas season.                     The management team was not the best , they didn't really seem to be interested in what went on.                                                     During the Christmas season, we were kept busy which I prefer. After season not so much."
good,"I would restock itms from the go back when not busy , fix shelves and cases in between isles, work mostly at register and help people check out. 2 months in customer service sales and exchanges."
good,"The work atmosphere was nice, my colleges were all very efficient, helpful, and courteous to customers. Hours were great, pay was sufficient, all in all a great place to work."
good,"I loved this job because it taught me alot and also helped me to gain my certifications, it taught me how to have character, how to guide and train new people as well."
good,"I don't have any bad things to say about working at TRU, it was a great experience. The job itself doesn't pay well but you learn valuable skills that will help you down the line."
good,"Came in as a seasonal hire. Store is one of the smallest TRU stores in the region. This makes for many unfulfilled shoppers. Management is wonderful to work with, they are willing and open to assist employees with changing schedules for another job or school. I had a blast working there over the holidays and would do it again any time!"
good,"Customers to toy stores should be famously recognized as the neediest. They don't know precisely what they want, and oftentimes don't know what to even look for (""I'm shopping for a three year old girl that I don't know what she likes""), so working at a toy store can be extremely challenging when it comes to customer service. As well as that, most positions at the store are part-time only and you start at the minimum with once a year evaluations for nickle-and-dime-raises being your only hope for a pay increase. Part-time shifts are typically 30 hours a week or less, typically less, and full-time positions are few and far between since most full-timers stay for a long long time. "
good,"I come in go straight to my station of work in the back and build, build, build. But if they are low in staff I step in and help them on the floor when they need me. I learned how dependent people are and how to deal with aggressive customers. I learn to listen to customers first and then explain how I can help them. Coworkers are friendly. Hardest part of the job is that nothing is hard everything is fairly equally. Noting is easy or hard its fair. The enjoyable part was the people I meet there."
good,"My typical work day involved me either working at a cash register, or being out on the sales floor helping customers find what they are looking for. Sometimes I went from one to the other, and I was always straightening up displays in my free time. I learned a lot of valuable customer service skills, and honestly I enjoyed the job for the most part. My managers and supervisors were all great, and my coworkers were nice. I think the hardest part of the job was dealing with particularly difficult customers, as they would expect me to go against protocols to make them happy. I really enjoyed helping customers, though. They always seemed happy to find someone to help them find their Christmas gifts for their kids."
good,I worked at the Burbank location during the winter the toys were season. The employees and managers are friendly. However the customers were not. i understand it being Christmas time and the toys were in high demand. Sometimes i wasn't able to take a lunch or break due to all the customers there.
good,"I'm part of a new project which is European Supply Chain, so it's very exciting and challenging, I get to talk from people from different countries and learn from them and their knowledge's, it's very rewarding. I can also apply my previous work and personal experience."
good,Simple job requiring order in the store. Learned cashier and handling money. Coworkers were friendly
good,This was a learning experience. I love the culture and the vibe of Toy R us specially on the holidays. Coming everyday to work with kids is amusing.
good,A great place to start off and get to know the retail workplace. Constantly on the move and there's always something to do.
good,"Everyone is nice. The pay is good and i get a nice amount of hours."
good,Always something to do there and great people to be around. Never a dull moment and I learned a lot being there. Seen different aspects of the store and where I can contribute more and didi to the best of my abilities
good,the job was ok. I built long lasting relationships with co-workers and management was understand and actually cared about its employees
good,Lots of work but coworkers make it fun.  If you work hard and are a good performer you will be recognized.  Benefits are not great.  Everyone pitches in an is willing to help.
good,"There is a general expectation to have fun working at a toy store. More often than not, this expectation is met or exceeded by the quality employees the company tends to employ. The benefits are extremely competitive, provided you are able to secure full time employment status."
good,"Its overall a fun neat place to work at but its hard to get good hours if you aren't full time employee there, hard to get scheduled but give you days you cant really work. Late minute call ins for replacements."
good,"A lot of what this job entails is paying attention to small details. We make sure that the store is clean and bright, and that we engage every customer. "
good,I loved my time at Toys r us the staff and overall experience was abit manic but i loved it .It was chistmas so it was a busy time alot of people was stressed out and over worked but everyone worked well as a team.
good,I am a child at heart so being at a toy store was a dream come true. I loved seeing all the kids come through and seeing their faces light up.
good,"It was a fun place to work with few bad points."
good,A very young company and plenty to do.  My work day was always busy.  I interacted with many different departments and was able to work independently.
good,"great place to work, very easy to learn the swing of things, good management and helpful co-workers, strong family-like environment"
good,"I generally worked in the electronics department. I would either be at the register or on the floor. While on the floor I cleaned and would head back to the register or assist a customer when they came in. "
good,"A typical day as a cashier, you would go to your register and ask customers if they had a rewards card, if they would like to sign up for one, and continue to ask them questions . Management was okay, nothing bad to say about them. The hardest part big ticket items/delayed pick up forms. The most enjoyable part was the people."
good,"Working at Toys 'R Us was one of the most enjoyable jobs I've ever had. It was busy and is definitely not a job for people who are easily stressed out by crowds, but I had a great time working with customers and recommending toys to them or helping them find a toy they were looking for. "
good,"Fun environment, exciting sales & activities during the holiday season. Most people that work there are seasonal employees as well so they're full of spirit a make fun."
good,"Um dia tipico de trabalho começava as 9h da manha e terminava as 18h. Basicamente as tarefas realizadas eram as mesmas que trabalhei em outras empresas mas posso dizer que aprendi a                                          desenvolver  a língua espanhola. É uma empresa bem organizada .e  que Adá  muitas  oportunidades de trabalho. A  nível de colegas de trabalho era um ambiente familiar. A parte mais dificil era lidar com alguns clientes mas com o tempo foi se tornando mais fácil. A parte más agradável era o convivio com os colegas que muitas vezes se estendia  para além do horário de trabalho, como a organização de jantares,"
good,My job consisted of interacting with children and creating an easier shopping experience for parents. I was mostly in charge of setting up walls with items we needed to sell the most. Working at Toys R Us gave me the opportunity to use my creativity side.
good,"Trabajar rodeado de juguetes es una experiencia bonita, poder asesorar al cliente es una tarea satisfactoria ya que es una ilusión para ellos encontrar el juguete que sus hijos desean tener por navidades."
good,"It was a fairly average workplace. Fun employees made it better. The management was strict about getting rewards card and credit card numbers higher, but even with that it wasn't a hard job."
good,"Only Worked Here seasonal so not much to say about the company rather than good average weekly hours, and great environment"
good,Worked for the company for 30 years.  Looking to leave because of changing times and the economy.  TRU is doing what it can to stay competitive.  I have enjoyed most of my years with the company.  Worked from a part time team member to assistant store manager over the years.
good,I liked the job. Doesn't pay well for the work we have to do. All the workers were social and fun to be around. If the pay was raised I'll go back.
good,If you put in the work you will be acknowledged. The pay was very small however i would have a blast working. The schedules were very flexible so if youre in college this is a cool and fun place to work at.
good,Provided speedy service during the holidays. Seasonal position worked through all the holidays. Learned a lot about working in a very fast pace environment.
good,would have been a much better experience if there had been better management. There were to many bosses in the work environment and not enough actual workers
good,"Fun environment, not much to work load just do your job and no one will be on you. training and asking questions with customer service."
good,"Working in a toy store during the holiday season is fun, challenging and rewarding.  I liked working here and also got experience mentoring younger inexperienced employees."
good,Great workplace to advance and enjoy helping guests and your coworkers.  Great management that will ensure your best foot is put forward.
good,"Working at Toys R Us has been mostly a great experience, So many great opportunites to learn at the National Headquarters, management is very transparent regarding the activities and performance of the company. Colleagues love to bring the joyful culture to life by working and celebrating together."
good,This was my first job and I gained significant experience here.  I had a great time with the employees I worked with and I did not dread a day of work.  The pay wasn't very great but it was a fun seasonal position overall.
good,"Helped customers, organized the store, worked with other sales associates to get the job done. Did not like the health benefits. Pay could have been slightly higher"
good,ToysRUs is nice place to work and I have enjoyed working there ... During the past 7 years I've made lots of friends in here.
good,"this was my first job ot to mention it was a seasonal porsition. for someone who is just starting their resume this would be a great first job, only because it allows you to have a couple of errors here and there in order to learn from and thus better yourself. its a fast paced and straight to the point. not only is it a kids store but it is actually a pretty thrilling job with seeing the amusement and joy come from the kids once they get that one toys they have been constantly asking their parents for. it has to make the kid insinde everyone smile."
good,My work experience included me keeping count of stock and returning products to the correct locations. However at time i assisted customers in there purchases
good,"work environment was fun and stable, co-workers were entertaining but very work oriented, management are very understanding and help you with alot of the work load"
good,"I learned to put together bicycles and Power Wheels while having fun with fellow employees. I enjoyed sorting truck and putting product on the floor along side my managers. My store manager made sure work was fun and often brought in food especially for those of us stuck working on holidays. The hardest part was adjusting to the overnight hours when I first started the season, but I quickly got used to it. My manager was always accommodating if I needed time off for something with my kids. Any problems were quickly resolved."
good,"Very nice managers "
good,I learned excellent customer service skills. Made a decent salary and got along very well with my co-workers and managers.
good,"Toys ""R"" Us is a fun place to work when you get time to focus on the customers to help them find the right item for their baby, birthday or holiday needs.  A successful person in the company must be able to learn many areas of the store operations and be a team player.  The most important skill is educating the customer on products and services that the company offers to receive the most benefits and money saving options."
good,"The management was good, but was very bias toward the employees. part-time employees with seniority were only given 15 hours a week while new employees were given 25+."
good,"On a normal day I would make sure all the alarms are on all of the tablet displays, clean the tablet screens and the credit card screens, make sure spider wraps are on tight, all the merchendise is in the right place, and all the tickets are right when I could. I also was the one to check out or to help check out.While working there I had learned to be a bit more social toward people. The management was great, they helped me my first few weeks there and talked me through everything. The co workers were great and awesome to work with, they were fun and bursting with personality. The hardest part was standing for 6-8 hours, during Christmas it was sometimes nonstop. I loved seeing the kids come in and thanking me for helping/ringing them out."
good,"Got hired as a seasonal worker during the holidays, Stayed on as a shipping and receiving clerk. I enjoyed my time working here and the people I worked for and with."
good,"me formaron como frutera, cajera, pescadera y reponedora dándome la posibilidad de independizarme y adquirir conocimientos"
good,"The work environment was great. Everyone was friendly and really nice and we all got along. My manager was very generous, he paid for so many of our pizza parties out of his own pocket. He was awesome."
good,"i enjoy the people i work with, most enjoyable was seeing children as newborns and before you know it they are 10, a day at work included answering phones, waiting on customers, doing a few things on the computer, working on a cash register and also doing markdowns for apparell"
good,Toys R Us is a very exciting place to work. I learend how to provide excellent customer service for both adults and children. Management helped me through ever problem i came across. My co workers were very friendly and we always work together to complete task in the workplace. Hardest part of the job was probably reshopping the store. The most enjoyable part of working for Toys R Us was them teaching me the fundementals of team work.
good,"I worker here seasonal, so it was constantly busy and you could never catch a break! I enjoyed being around kids all day every day. I loved everyone i worked with and got along with them all very well."
good,"assist customers, take conference calls, count down registers and make sure safe is even. keep store and backroom organized. help employees with how to sell and assist customers. check store totals and check emails. give daily goals to employees."
good,"Worked overnights and it was quite easy. Just about 5 of us total worked the overnight. We unloaded the trucks, stocked items and scanned items into the system. It wasn't hard at all. The only issue I ran into is if the truck was late and all the work was done beforehand you were just standing there. I'm the type of person if I stand still for too long I get more tired than if I'm moving. So if a truck is running late, always find something to do. Managers were great, coworkers were cool too. This was my second job and I left due to only wanting to work there until after the Holidays for some extra cash."
good,"A typical day at work usually starts off slow being that majority of the shoppers are at work, but once the afternoon and evening comes around, everything starts moving."
good,You stand a long time on your feet but you are surrounded by friendly coworkers. They have great managers that are willing to help you and any costumer. The overall environment is fun makes you feel comfortable.
good,"•	Marked items with identifying codes, such as price, stock, or inventory control codes"
good,This company is a great place to work at to learn a lot of information at a short amount of time. Training is always offered. The only thing that could be better is the pay. The pay is not competitive.
good,it was hard at first but in the end every one worked great i liked the job and i would love to work there again
good,"was a fun place to work. All ready know retail. the management was nice, My co-workers where fun to work with. Christmas. help people with their chooses"
good,"Toys R Us was a great first job. It taught me many valuable skills and everyone there was so friendly and helpful. I always looked forward to coming in. A couple policies are a tad ridiculous, but overall it is a good company and I enjoyed working here."
good,"i would say this is a work place if you want to work for a short term basis since they are really tight on the contracts, it seems like they  don't have really much work going on apart from the september to december rush for christmas. they do not pay more for overtime which is making people not do the overtime saying it is not worth it for the money."
good,"Everyone from management down to the new team members were always friendly. The hardest part of the job was trying to prove I was prepared for a better position, even after being on call during almost any time except early mornings and sundays. "
good,"great place to work as management loved to get new employees started as soon as possible and get them involved straight away, colleagues are great to work with and fun to chat to."
good,"•	till operative "
good,"my everyday task is to run service desk. I count the money in the mornings and help verify paperwork. I assign draws and tasks for the cashiers.I do returns/exchanges,answer the phones,place online in store orders and i make sure i help every guest in every possible way  to make their visit satisfying.My co-worker love how hard working i am and how well i sell their products. I would have to say the hardest part of my job is,having to make sure all task are being completed by the cashier and having to assist more than one guest at a time and placing orders on line and answering the phone all at once. the most enjoyable part of my job is making a guest satisfied and hearing then thank me because i made their day so much easier."
good,I was a sales associate and customer service when needed or assigned there. At the end of my time being there I was always scheduled at the baby registry desk creating registry for pregnant women and wish list for birth days. I also created furniture orders or anything the guest wanted to order from online.
good,"This is a very customer friendly atmosphere.  I love interacting with the children and their parents.  I have learned that during my interactions with the customer I can better understand what they may need from me.  My co-worker are very friendly and easy to get along with.  The hardest part of my job is giving negative feedback to my team, but I know it is necessary to keep order in the store."
good,Not as hectic and more relaxed than a regular toysrus so you get to really get to feel like you are making an impact
good,.Hay dias que no se para y otros mas aburridos.En cuanto a mis compañeros de trabajo el ambiente era de camaraderia al igual que con los encargados siempre estan pendientes de que estes comodo y puedes acudir a ellos para cualquier contratiempo
good,"providing customer service as i walked the floor, keeping the aisles and shelves stoked and orderly, storing layaways and retrieving in store pick ups. "
good,"Normal day at work clock in start are daily stretches then we go to the work station in sart on the assignment in have 2 15 min break in 1 30 m  in lunch the co workers are friendly in good environment ,the hardest part about job you got make sure you reach the number the best thing about the job pay is good"
good,"There are not many workers and everyone is around the same age. It is like a small family as you are in the building most of your day. Work is harder around peak times of the year such as holidays and budget reset. It is a typical retail environment dealing with guests all day, but each department, and each supervisor are given one part of the business to maintain. It gives a sense of self worth and gives workers a reason to strive for high achievement."
good,"Most enjoyable part of the job:"
good,"On a typical day at Toys R Us, I would be assigned a section of the store to clean and keep organised. I would spend most of my time working cleaning this section, unless I was needed up at the front of the store to cashier. "
good,"Toys R Us is mostly a pretty standard retail job, however there can be a few perks to this store in particular. For example, as part of my job here, I got to drive around R/C cars in front of the store to attract customers. I would definitely say this is one of the less stressful retail jobs."
good,Most days where spent assisting parents with their needs. If I wasn't on the floor assisting customers i would process large ticket orders that needed to be picked up. I learned how to work efficiently especially during the Christmas season. The staff was always very helpful and willing to help me. The most enjoyable part of working at Torus was reminiscing about my child hood.
good,"I loved working there, it was a very loving place. My co-workers were very welcoming and helpful. I learned a lot about their company, their store, as well as the products that they sell. I loved seeing all the little kids come in smiling waving to everybody and saying hi. It was nice to see kids live happy because they got the toys they came for."
good,"Toys R Us can be a fun place to work, especially when there are workshops and events being held for the latest toys and electronics. It is a fast paced enviornment since the work keeps the workers on their toes. We must learn the whole system and functions of the computers, and also the rules of every aspect of what we are providing, stay up to date on every new and old toy, as well as learn on-our-own of our latest sales and offers, all while helping customers and remaining professional and knowledgable. It is a tough job if you dont like hard work, especially since their are not enough employees working considering the size of the store and the demand from our customers. It has been an amazing learning experience working under the current management. Everyone is for the most part laid back and very helpful and understanding. Although the hard part is multitasking 100 different things at once, that has also been the best training i could have asked for."
good,Busy during the weekends and especially during the Christmas season. Management was always helpful and gave workers support and were very accommodating to the employees. Too much weight was placed on pushing numbers sometimes to the disadvantage of employees and the customer.
good,"1º revisar catálogos y ofertas "
good,"Those who need a part time job, works well. Basic customer service."
good,"I worked during the holiday and it was really busy. Work never stopped. There was always work to be done, so it made the time go by faster. My manager was really patient with all the new hires on for the season. My co-workers were nice, and worked really hard along with me. The hardest part of the job was remembering where every toy was. The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting customers."
good,Helping kids find toys is always a great day at work. An working in the baby section was always great to see mothers to be and new moms
good,"Enjoyed ordering, assembling, and dressing furniture. Enjoyed working with guests and on register. Handled money. Registered guest for Baby registries. Called guests when needed. Enjoyed working with team members as well as managment"
good,"I did everything from opening the store to cashiering, stocking shelves, unloading trailers. My first real job out of high school and it lasted 12 yrs!"
good,"This job is very busy in ""season"" which is Oct.-Dec."
good,"typical consisted of demonstrating how to use remote control toys and running a cash register ,there wasn't really anything challenging about this job, it was an okay part time employment opportunity"
good,"My managers were smart, good at what they did, and allowed their employees to do their job without micromanaging."
good,"It was fast paced, customers asking you questions left and right. The management was fun to be around. The most enjoyable part of the jobs was hearing and seeing the kids in shock."
good,I enjoyed working at Toys R Us because I wasn't at the registers all day. In fact the best part of my day was being able to learn the store and the products by walking around and helping people. I find it more fun and productive for me to be able to help people before they get to the checkout because that it what I'm good at.
good,"As an Electronics Associate, I was able to mingle with the customers, teach them about the new 'hot' devices and systems that we carried and what would interest them. My co-workers were fantastic and dependable. The draw back was that after closing employees had to stay to straighten the entire store - so, scheduled 8 hour shift could potentially become a 10 hour shift depending how the store looked. However, it did not take away from the fun and understanding of the staff, management, or company. "
good,Wasn't really trained well. Took all my training courses after 3 months of working here. Management is great with the customers and resolving problems and workloads. All coworkers are helpful.
good,It was an excellent opportunity to get into the retail industry. I learned about running stock and the sales floor. Management was not too over-expectant. Co-workers were great! Moving heavy items. Stocking and interacting with customers.
good,"I was a casual employee and only worked on weekends, school holidays and on some weekdays so my day would begin with my arrival at the workplace, getting ready by clocking in, changing into the prescribed work uniform, sitting in at the meeting and then the doors would open and we would begin serving customers."
good,The mangers were really nice and very understanding to students. They created a very fun atmosphere.
good,"Great location due to living so close allowing me to easily continue with my studying at Lincoln University. Also living here with out car or major transport, location is important. Fun workplace as it was mostly students and christmas and children in need was all happening so dressing up and getting involved with raising money all added to the enjoyment of working there."
good,At work I'll ring guest out or process their return. I'll answer the phone and solve any guest issue. I'll clean up my area and stock any merchandise
good,"A typical day at the job would be tracking my orders and making sales as well as up-selling, making sure everything in my section was neat, guest services help, baby registry help, cashier help, introducing product knowledge to the customers. I learned to multi-task and work in a fast paced enviornment, learning pretty much how to do every task in the store, product knowledge, and how to be a sales person. The hardest part of the job was learning how to upsell. The most enjoyable part of the job was the experience I gained overall."
good,"overnight stocker"
good,"The  job was fantastic I enjoyed working with the people around me."
good,All of the staff was very friendly and welcoming made you want to come in to work everyday.
good,My co-workers are great people and most are hard workers. Management is okay but when it comes to hours they never have set schedules for anyone and call you in at last minute.
good,Working in a toy store is as fun as it sounds! The management and coworkers were great!
good,built lots of toys for some great people. the staff awesome. lots of good friends out of working there
good,I stocked shelves on the sales floor. I learned how to stock shelves. Management was okay. My co-workers were hard workers. The hardest part was getting to work. I had to find rides or take 2 buses every night. I liked the job it wasn't hard labor at all.
good,I enjoy working at toys r us. I only wish that the job wasn't temporary and i could work there full time.
good,I really enjoy this job and my co-workers. However I wish the pay was more.
good,"Learning, Fun Staff/ CoWorkers, Clean Environment"
good,"Greeting customers"
good,"I loved working at Toys R Us.  All my co workers were very friendly, and helpful. Management was awesome! And they made work fun!"
good,"Overall a good retail job.  Everyday can be different if you learn a bit about the areas of the store.  Good coworkers and management, willing to help you when you need it."
good,Planning out the nights tasks with my overnight team.  What I learned when training new team members is that following up on their progress is key to forming a great team.  Management at Toys R Us were a fun and a creative bunch. My co-workers were a hard working crew.  The hardest part of my job at Toys R Us was the requests from my family to buy toys for them.  The enjoyable part was setting up displays and getting the store ready for opening.
good,It was enjoyable I loved working with the coworkers. This was one of a kind of experience
good,"In the heart of the city, Times Square's ToysRUS brought in new culturally diverse people everyday causing the job to be rather interesting. Everyone was so excited to see the amazing props in the store. The job consisted of greeting guests and helping them in every way possible."
good,"Came to work with a smile, counted my drawers, did my paperwork, helped customers, played with kids, stocked, checked food expiration dates, cashiered, did returns, answered phone, cash box duties, cleaned and worked with management."
good,UN trabajo ameno y divertido en el cual se vendian juguetes de todas clases y se trataba con niños y/o mayores para las fechas claves de navidad y carnaval sobretodo.
good,"My typical day at Toys R Us started at the register in the electronics department where I handled sales, provided customer service, re-stocked inventory, and set up displays. I learned how to talk to customers on a more personal level to get a better understanding of what they need. Also I learned how to handle customer complaints and provide guests with a solution that will keep them loyal customers. The hardest part of the job was learning on the job skill on my own, but what kept a smile on my face where my fun and helpful co-workers who knew how to make you feel like family."
good,"I enjoyed working with all employees at ToysRUs. It was just a seasonal position but it being my first job it taught me a lot about handling customer questions, and handling things professionally. The hardest part about working at ToysRUs was Black Friday, and the most enjoyable part was seeing all of the happy children."
good,I worked there in high school and it opened alot of doors for me in the customer service world
good,"Daily customer interaction"
good,"Stocking shelves with merchandise, ringing up customers, etc... Learned customer service and cash register skills. Everyone was helpful and friendly. The hardest part of the job was lifting heavy items. Enjoyed the Christmas atmosphere every day."
good,"Since this was only my second job, It was definitely a great workplace. My days usually consisted of lots of paperwork, and cycle counting. The associates were amazing people, and they made the work day enjoyable. The management team did have it's flaws, but at the end of the day they got the job done. I think the main issue I had with the company was training. I noticed how a lot of new members of management were never trained properly, and made it difficult for them to complete their task. "
good,"I worked seasonally in a graveyard position, and though I absolutely love graveyard, I did have a bit of a craving for human interaction since I almost always worked alone! But at least the overnight stockers were very friendly. I didn't have very much contact with management, surprisingly. So due to that fact, and the fact that I never had a real one-on-one time with the supervisor meant to train me, I did make a few mistakes. I did learn along the way, and by the time the season was over, I had gotten the hang of it all! My favorite part was, believe it or not, working on Black Friday. I enjoyed helping some very flustered and frustrated customers find their way."
good,"great work environment to learn how to use a POS system, meet store sales and learn to work as a team."
good,"Typical day at work was managing all the associates to make sure they were interacting with guest and making sure there visit with us was what they look for when going to the store. Great guest service is what Toys R Us strives to give. For my 18 years that I put in with them, I learned to put forth all I got to manage others, to train others, I learned how to adapt to different changes, and Multi task. Multi tasking is a major plus in most jobs these days. I loved all the co-workers the whole building was like a second family to me. They welcome all new comers to the team with open arms. The hardest part of the job is when the company was when they were cutting payroll and you had to run the store with few employees. When this happened you just had to make the best of who you had and put the employees in the place that fit them the best. The most enjoyable part of my job was when I seen the smile on little kids face when they found the toys they where looking for or when I could find the item the parent or grandparent was looking for at the last minute for a child's birthday and they tell you how wonderful you are and there is a special little one that will be so happy that they will have it that day. Making a customers day is the most enjoyable part of the day "
good, Overall a good place to work. Management for the most part never left employes in the dark. I learned how to be a better leader for fellow co-workers. 
good,Fun place to work especially of you are still a big kid. Nice staff to work with.
good,Had a great store manager. It all depends on who your manager or supervisor is. Fast paced job during holidays.
good,i love working here ! Not alot of off season hours .I usually work on the baby side . I enjoy helping people pick gifts for baby showers . My co workersare great it is always a team effort . 
good,"Typically working at Babies R Us is a fun environment especially at the registry desk, helping expected mothers prepare for their bundle of joy."
good,"Great Company, overnight stickers were a great team along with management"
good,"Hours are sporadic, August through November is the only time you are gauranteed the hours you are scheduled. After Christmas hours are hard to come by until about February and then it dies down again in April and picks back up again in the summer months."
good,"A typical work day varied from day-to-day. Most of my time would be toward the back of the store in the shipping and receiving dock. I participated in imports and exports for management. During my 3rd shift I made sure merchandise were put in the correct places throughout the store. My co-workers were mainly students most of the time so the turn-over rate was pretty low, most of them stayed until they graduated from school. The hardest part of the job was excepting growth of being in costumer service when I did not desire the change or growth."
good,Toys R Us is a very professional work setting. Since it is a corporation the rules were followed very specifically . Each employee stayed at their register until the end of their shift. I learned how to use a cash register and organize merchandise. The managers were very fair and helpful. I enjoyed seeing the excitement on the face of a child when they got a new toy. I didn't care for customers who became overstressed when an item was out of stock but learned how to redirect their frustration by suggesting either another store or item.
good,With the morning rush and nightly rush you have to stay on top of it. There will be times that multiple guest ask you for multiple things and you have to be 3 places at one time. The best part is seeing the child or the guest smile after you have assisted them as best you can.
good,Overall a fantastc place to work and would keep this job even if I had a Full-time job elsewhere. Meaning I'd work both.
good,I was a seasonal employee but they are very understanding and fun bunch to work with. I love to work with electronics so i was stationed in the Electronics section. I was invited back the following year!

good,great place to work day or night.
good,"I am very happy with how Toys R Us treats me and others. It is a great environment to be in, and the manager's good with scheduling."
good,Once again another job requiring me to work with my hands which I love. I was off hours which made it 10 times better because I could get work done.
good,"Practicing accuracy,teambuilding enhancements,serving the customers,I had great leads,trained new people.The hardest part of the job was when machines were down."
good,"Typically, you go in, put misplaced items away, your shift ends and you go home."
good,Working at Toys R Us was an extremely great experience. I would consider working there than any of my other previous work places. Toys R Us does a phenomenal job at making children happy especially on their birthdays. I enjoyed hearing the special birthday guest announcement when ever a child who was a member of the birthday club checked in the store. The job was not hard at all. I loved all of my coworkers. We all got along quite well. My managers were always understanding and helpful.
good,"A typical day of work was constantly working, there was no time to slack off. I Have learned from working here that your priority is making sure the customer leaves satisfied. I got along well with my co-workers, and gained many friends while working here. The hardest part of the job was bringing boxes down from above the top shelf alone. The most enjoyable part of the job was interacting with the customers and their child/children knowing that they were happy wit their products."
good,Toy's R Us was a great place to work at. There were many happy moments and even during the most difficult days you went home feeling exhausted but with a awesome feeling of self fulfillment.
good,The workers are lovely and the environment is fun. You have to be a energetic and proactive person.
good,I worked 3rd shift as a seasonal employee. We unload new shipment and place it to sales floor for xmas season. The management team was awesome and help you when needed. It was really a hard job.I enjoyed working there seeing different types of toys and gadgets etc..
good,"A typical shift at TOYS'R'US was fast paced. I also learned a lot about teamwork during my time there, through the need for me to pull my own weight. Although a few of my co-workers were unwilling to show me the ropes, there were always a few associates willing to guide me."
good,"Most of the time sales are good and people get along with each other, I learned and gathered more skills on sales and customer services, the manger for the most part are uptempo-ed and easy to talk to. Same with my co-workers they are generally friendly and polite with guest and each other. The only hard part is try to sell customers the Buyers Protection Plan that gives them a coverage of everything except ""lost and Stolen"". I like the environment and the interaction with people (co-workers and patrons)"
good,"it was a fun place to work, with friendly coworkers and approachable management. it was seasonal, but great experience"
good,Good job to start off with great hard working supervisors. schedule is somewhat flexible. compensation is pretty good
good,"I like it. My Co-workers are hilarious and very helpful. Some costumers can be a little hostile, but it is a costumer service job. The most enjoyable part of the job is seeing the smiling face that I'm responsible for on my costumer. The hardest thing about this job, is being late. It's nearly impossible for me to be late, it's something I will not let happen to me."
good,While working at Babies R Us I learned many new things about infants and children that I didn't know before. I also learned how to work in the clothing department of the store and became skilled in helping guests throughout the store. Managment was friendly and professional. The other workers were kind and fun to be around.
good,"A typical day at work consisted of stocking product including toys and apparel, using the cash register, and dealing with people. I learned patience through Toys R Us, as well as leadership skills and efficiency. Management can be improved, but overall was good. My co-workers were helpful to me as well as our customers and were very efficient in their work. The hardest part of my job was stocking apparel and doing markdowns because this department received the least attention. I enjoyed working with my co-workers and helping the customers the most."
good,"I check all of the alarms, exits, and the theft system towers in the build when I walk in. Then I fill out the reports for the day. Then I watch cameras and stand at the front store for the day looking around for potential shoplifters. My co-workers are fun I enjoyed working there. The hardest part of working there was standing in the front for 8 hours not doing much when the store is empty. The most enjoyable part of the job was reporting thefts and the people I worked with."
good,"i would go to my desk pull up the necessary programs for the prob res clerk. than we would research different warehouse problems, such as toys lost, item in wrong locations, and customers recieving wrong merchandise."
good,I would go to work clock in and work in the R zone witch was the electronic zone.
good,Interesting company to work for but the compensation is not enough to support oneself
good,"A great place to work at with great employees, customers are always very friendly"
good,stock shelves
good,No two days at Toys R Us were ever the same. Management was always cheerful and always raised moral to keep everyone going. Multitasking and problem solving is one thing you can't walk out of Toys R Us without mastering. The customers will want something that team members are obligated to retrieve and at the same time we still have to complete the tasks given to us. Toys R Us has a great eye for picking helpful and good natured employees. Maybe I can't help but see the good in people but I loved working with my fellow team members in both Toys R Us locations. I know it sounds cheesy but I feel that the best part of the job was completing a task for a customer and seeing the satisfaction on thief faces.
good,This was a really great place to work especially for the youths and people who its their first job.
good,1. Unlaod the truck highly intense
good,there isnt much wrong with this place other than the job security. people get layed off alot at this place. i know because i was layed off
good,"Very fast paste , learned how to get things done when needed had very friendly co workers."
good,"I've worked with the company for about 5 years now and everything is mediocre as far as a retail company is concerned. Pay is below average, management is decent, they at least listen to you. Hours are decent as well when they're actually available. Would recommend if you cant find another retail job."
good,"Its a fun place to start , as far as first time job seekers. It helps you grow as a person working with different people every day. It also allows you to learn things for the future being a parent"
good,"I loved working at Toys R Us, it is such a fun atmosphere to be in.. who doesnt love toys? and kids are pretty incredible too. I loved working in the Video game section.. Good times at Toys R Us."
good,"Sometimes, the age factor can cause hardships in the workplace. Condescending attitudes and seniority is usually an issue, but that is not the case concerning an environment meant for children. The only thing to look out for is peer jealousy."
good,Fun place to work at. Training is great. Very long work hours from October to December each year.
good,"the job was simple once learning the ways of the job. other than the physical work, the job was easy."
good,"it was a lot of work to do, but it is a good job to keep you busy and motivated."
good,"I worked during Christmas so it was busy, busy, busy! I'm still a big kid at heart so I loved working with games and toys and seeing kids everyday."
good,I really liked working for this company part time through the holidays it was very fast paced and it was very customer oriented. You had to make sure you greeted every guest who came in your department and also keep the shelves looking stocked and organized. Managers and supervisors at this location were superb!
good,Good Benefits but doesn't pay a whole lot. Ive worked in Customer Service for more than 10 years and couldn't pass $10.00/hr. It is a fun place to work and if you can get hired full time it is worth staying for a period of time.
good,Kept me on my feet the entire work period and was very content with breaks and how the energy was everyday. Did work overtime on some nights and reshop was never too much for me.
good,This job was very interesting. I worked with many smart people who taught me how to work efficiently.
good,"Working for Babies R Us was mostly enjoyable. I worked there for almost 2 years, I never received a promotion but the raises were good and fair from my point of view. The management was always open ears if you needed someone to talk to but some of the best ones have left the company. Still there are a lot of good people in the company."
good,The managers are always willing to help.The department was always busy. Many times we need to get temporary workers to help out.
good,"I had fun working at Toys 'R us, it was so heartbreaking that i closed. The work schedule is very flexible and our manager is very considerate and supportive."
good,Toys r us is a work environment that’s friendly and respectable. I’ve learned a lot from warehouse experience and also on the floor experience placing toys where they need to be .
good,Overall great opportunity.. Great working involving people skills an other fast pace skills.. Great benefits.. Great people to work with... Great management
good,Very good and great work place and employees are very helpful. Great management and very helpful with workers. I had great experiences and great memories.
good,Absolutely loved working at Toys R Us back when it was still around. It was always fun coming into work and never a dull moment. Weekends and holidays were busy and management were always awesome and caring towards staff.
good,"Mais quand on postule par écrit à la direction, aucune réponse..."
good,Work environment was good with supportive and nice staff. Busy during the holiday season so it was important to learn quickly on the job. I would recommend working here.
good,Working this job was great I built long lasting relationships with co-workers and  the management  above me was understand and actually cared about its employees
good,"It wasn’t hard at all just had to be prepared to do you’re job. It was very calm and easy to maintain , the management wasn’t bad at all either , the night shifts were also not bad we used box cutters to unload the boxes and lined up carts to sort the toys on where they needed to go"
good,"It was a wonderful place to work for, all of my co-workers were friendly and management was helpful and kind. The company worked with my schedule and it was a great disappointment when the company closed."
good,"A typical day at work include clocking in at work, going to the break room to grab your name tag and put any personal items away in your locker. Then, report to your supervisor to see where you are needed. Sometimes I would be at the register assisting customers and their products and making their visit very good to want to come back, or, I would be on the floor, straightening up the aisles and helping customers find any thing they need."
good,"It was fun working at Toys R’ Us. I loved every bit of it. Always looked forward to each day. Job culture was top Notch as well. However, Management could be difficult at times."
good,"J’y étais du temps de Toys r Us et pas de picwic Toys !!! C’etait Une entreprise où j’ai exercé la fonction de responsable adjointe. J’y étais très bien. J’ai passé 2 belles années sur le magasin de Castres. Les directeurs régionaux, les différentes personnes du siège et le PDG étaient toutes des personnes très à l’ecoute Avec un super management. On a vraiment bien bosser tous ensemble !"
good,You making kids happy in seeing a big smile on there family face also in seeing new people in learning new things its more like w family working at toys r us
good,The pay was ok for the cost of living in that particular area even for part time. Overtime was always Available. Great fun work environment. Only downfall was the company went bankrupt and there was no job security once the stores closed for good.
good,"Fast paced fun place to work at."
good,"Very fast pace,  holidays very challenging and stressful.  All other time if year it's great. Very competitive pay scale for exempt managers. Dept manager pay needs to be re evaluated and be more competitive with other retail stores"
good,"This is one of my top jobs that i would go back to without thinking about it! the job, the coworkers, even the management! The only part of it that I hated was the quota of new credit card application that we had to get or get in trouble for."
good,Toys R Us was a really good place to work at. was not very busy and I had a lot of time to walk around and organize everything. It was a great experience.
good,Una. buena empresa con gente muy tesponsable y competente gran nivel de exigencia y buen ambiente el sueldo al nivel de todas las empresas el problema pocas horas y dificultad para pasar a formar parte plantilla
good,Its a nice place to work.fast paced at times.great diversity and while busy you also can have a little fun on the job.great knowledge about what children are into as well.
good,I really liked working there. I wish I would have gotten a permanent position there while they were open. I really liked the people and most of the customers were polite!
good,Working at Toys R Us was nice. I got to have cashier experience and add on more experience to being a sales associate. The hours were long but worth it. The pay was decent. Schedule fluctuated and was annoying at times but I got my job done. At the time there were statements that the company was closing down and because of this some managers were extra harsh and did not know how to deal the the employee's. Sometimes the pressure got intense but all in all it was a good experience.
good,i learned a lot of patience working at TOYS R US also because there were so many children on a  typical day. they'd mess around with toys but you learn how to manage and still have fun at work and a good attitude no matter the circumstance.
good,"Toys R Us was a nice and decent work environment. Very family oriented and friendly. The hardest part of the job was lifting heavy boxes, but overall I enjoyed it."
good,Every day was a different learning experience from the people you meet to the employees you worked with. Most of the management was great but a small fraction of them were the complete opposite.
good,I was a seasonal worker and had to move fast. There was never a dull moment. So sad it closed down. I was there on the last day when there were only about five shelves of stuff left.
good,"Loved working there. Became employee of the month of February 2017. Learned front end and back end within 30 days. Started to be a coordinator for events such as : pokemon trade event, Geofferys Birthday Party every month. Very fun place to work."
good,"ToysrUs was a learning experience for me while working part time. A typical day for me at work was sorting out labels and putting them in order, being organized is major for me. Or finding out which department I was going to cover. What I learned while working at ToysRUs is that, for me it was ok to help others who was overwhelmed with work. Sometimes management would confuse purchased orders then had to get supervisors assistance."
good,"Working at Toys R Us was never boring, as there was always something to do. Management was helpful and considerate of employees needs. My duties included various jobs which kept things interesting. I left because I wanted full -time employment."
good,"xmas temp for 4 years"
good,"I like to work at Babies R Us because it was a challenge every day, got to do different stuff, help customers, work on different stuff from time to time. Learn different things."
good,"On a typical day, I would arrive in the morning. I had my own locker with a communal fridge. We had a large break-room for employees.  I typically worked in the back of house and occassionaly worked the register."
good,I was kept busy through out the day and the people I worked with were great.  The hours fit my schedule and the atmosphere was relaxed and fast paced.
good,They in general had good thing going that time. Everything was fun even with management in overalls. I enjoy worked with toys r us. The company was very understanding.
good,I liked working there because I learn to feel comfortable to work with others. I love kids and that’s a kid store. I like to organize so sometimes be a stocker was cool. It was hard being on my feet all day but I mange to do it when I thought I couldn’t.
good,"Sales team members typically handle customer service encounters and stock replenishing duties for a Toys R Us retail location. Toys R Us sales associates often field customer questions and complaints about products, services, and store personnel."
good,Everyone worked together and was always on the move to help others in the other departments when the job was done that you finished. Everyone would be on the same page with good comunication...
good,"It was a nice place to work,  the people were awesome and the management was cool. It was an easy job with not alot of stress. I looked forward to coming in every day."
good,A fast paced work environment that involved collaborating with team members to execute our daily goals. During the holiday time we would work countless hours a week doing 15-20 hour shifts. to ensure we kept the Toys R Us standard for our guests.
good,Toys R Us was a wonderful place to work. It was a family atmosphere  where everyone worked well together and team members enjoyed the one of one interaction with guests. Working with guests to show them products and share knowledge was one of my favorite things to do. The training programs were easy to navigate and we were always supplied with new product information so we could share features and benefits with our guests.
good,"I enjoyed my time with TRU. I will say that they did expect more from you than the average company in the way of upper management. You were expected to do more than your role required. It isnt a problem, but if it starts affecting your ability to do your role, they were not very understanding of that."
good,"All in all, the R Us company was a great place to work for. It's very uncommon to find a place that you can make friends of both coworkers and customers alike. Not to mention the sense of fulfillment at the end of each day when leaving the workplace, having felt as if the day was well spent. "
good,Welling to stay asap .. need a job to pay my bills and take care of my kids just moved .. I’m going to do my job to the best of my  abilities .. I’m a quick learner
good,"meet & great new customers   fun to see new items I enjoyed watching the kids face looking at new toys, I did not get to work here long enough to give a real evaution"
good,Learn how to work as a team player and get the job done..be on time everyday ready to work. Learn more than one department to advance quick in leadership..
good,"This store was great, I advanced fairly quickly. I hated to see the store close. It was great to work with events and HR was solid. This job was fun and helped people."
good,whilst working at toys r us it was surrounded with a great culture where I thoroughly enjoyed the time spent at the company. While fulfilling my job role I learnt that having good communication skills is pivotal to  a working environment.
good,"My day at Toys RUs is I worked 2nd shift"
good,Working at Toys R Us was an enhanced experience for me. It kept me on my toes in a fast-paced work environment. I learned to stay aware and be alert to everything that went on in the work place from employees to customers.
good,"I enjoyed working at Toys R Us. I had a flexible schedule and was able to work around schooling and family. I feel that if you did what was asked of you then the job was pretty easy and the shifts went quickly. I enjoyed watching kids and adults alike, light up when they walked into the store."
good,Management was never on the same page. Meetings were never held and that made everybody have their own way of working. Fast pace environment which doesnt make your job boring.
good,"I had the opportunity to work with a number of amazing people who were willing to mentor me and ensure my success at Toys R Us.  "
good,"I enjoyed the interaction with the guests at Babies R Us. Every day brought a different experience, whether is was helping ladies to register for their baby needs or helping grandparents to shop for their new grandchild. The company was very flexible in scheduling and allowing time off when necessary."
good,My work hours were flexible depending on workloads. Warm weather and holidays were very busy with more assemblies to come from guests and floor needs.
good,It was a very impressing job i like it mainly because it involved kids toys and things they'll do good for i loved my job it was cool calm and collect if i can i would re open it and get kids back into being happy with toys from Toys R Us
good,"Great place to work. The teamwork was the best. It was like a family, if someone was sick the management team would reach to them. It was just a great place to work."
good,Would be on the sales floor in assigned department. Shelves would have to be straighten. Recover your department and fill a basket full of the recovered items that belonged in another department
good,Fun to work there.loved interacting with the public.Helping kids find their favorite toys was pure excitement.I also worked with great people we were like family.Such a great place to work.
good,"A typical day would be seeing to the needs of our customers and dealing with children on a daily basis. I have learned many skills since I started as part time seasonal and worked my way up to overseeing the front end. I never had a problem with management, I always did my job above and beyond expectations. The hardest part of the job was pricing and signage as Toys R Us changed from one minute to the next and hardly ever had in stock what was on sale. The most enjoyable part was meeting new people."
good,I don't feel like answering this at all thank you We had a lot of order to fill and we got them done they even sometimes let us get out earlier when got got are work done and we we even finish half of the next days
good,"Things were usually quiet, everyone was nice except one manager, and a few co-workers, but nothing out the ordinary. I came to work did what i was supposed to, went home, and got ready for the next day."
good,Always enjoyed the company there. Fun times running events and bringing smiles to children's faces every year for the holidays. Building was older though and had heat issues and would get overly hot year round.
good,"I really enjoyed the work environment, and it was a very nice place to work. They were very welcoming of new employees although the training at my specific location could have used some work."
good,"There was great fun working in a toy store with awesome kids of all ages."
good,great people to work with  and great customers. always had my questions answered by management. fantastic coworkers. always felt included and appreciated.
good,It was a great place and I’m glad u was kept and hired there the people were very understanding and relaxed let you go at your own pace but also got onto you if you need to be.
good,"I was hired to go into their temporary leased store in a mall and simply supervise this this. I believe that I did it with dignity and a little pride. I was determined to run a clean, fun ship. Children and their parent's seemed to enjoy the store the little while that we were there. I had no complaints from the big store."
good,"Working at ToysRUS was much more fun than working at a regular retail store. Since it was a toy store, there was constant interacting with customers. Management knew how to have fun, it always had a positive atmosphere, and I always enjoyed at least part of the day! Will definitely miss the coworkers and the memories made."
good,"This company is now out of business.  Like most business failures, it was the result of poor executive management and long term planning.  The company did not invest in store modernization and system upgrades."
good,A lot of positive energy inside the store. It was great being able to see smiles on the kids faces when they got the toys that they have always wanted.
good,I enjoyed working here although it is a physical job if you unload trucks.Seasonal work is very stressful but you get more hours and pay during this time.
good,"It’s fun , it’s a calm place to just work and interact with your customers . You have work to do like clean up by your register or sweep when you need to but it’s not hard . Being a cashier for toys r us is super laid back and fun ."
good,the overall work environment was average to above average when it came to working with my fellow co workers. i mostly enjoyed working with everyone. only occasionally would the higher ups become a bit too pushy when it came to unrealistic goals that just brought down the morale of the employees. customer service is not for everyone but you do learn a lot about communicating with others and how interact with people.
good,"My typical day at work was well run and organised, I always have something to keep me occupied and busy whilst I was on my shift. I learned very well communication skills from this job as I was coming into contact with people of different age."
good,Enjoyed working there. Do d not leave because of the company. Left to get married to fellow associates ate I had been dating. It was a fun place with fun people an good managers.
good,"From a Project Management perspective we dealt with different anomalies on a daily basis.  We worked in an ever changing environment to keep pace with the competition within our brick and mortar stores.  Everyone was able to bring suggestions to the table and have them heard and we were able to create our own execution plans to implement processes.  Ownership was a big part of the way in which the company was run.  Best part of the job for me was working with such a diverse group of people from coast to coast. Opening stores and helping to develop store teams to deliver the best result possible was such a satisfying part of the job."
good,"It's a good job but, they need to be a bit more patient and better at training. They also didn't like to help out very much like there job is more important, in otherwords. They sucked at training but was overall a good job."
good,"the culture of this company is great and everyone i worked with was amazing.  It has an incredibly strong culture for a company that is growing as quickly as it is. Collaboration cross-team is critical, encouraged, and motivating when driving new projects and helping others complete theirs. The overall work/life balance is wonderful."
good,"Starter med å få oversikt over oppgavene i løpet av dagen."
good,"Prior to Chapter 11, TRU was an excellent place to work and  advance your career. They offer excellent benefits including salary.  Team was always willing to go the extra mile to meet goals."
good,"On a typical day in my position I fulfilled management tasks of opening and closing the building, as well as overseeing a staff of 7 to 10 individuals. Throughout the day I completed various administrative duties as well, replenishing the store, checking emails for any new directions, and greeting customers. I also provided strong customer service and resolved customer issues."
good,"Everyone was really friendly, they helped you if needed, I was on the overnight shift and they allowed music the entire shift. Ive never had experience in packing and shipping, I cought on easily and I realized how swift and correctly I did the task."
good,"The experience working for Toys R Us has been wonderful. Customers and staff are friendly and understanding. The most enjoyable part of the job would have to be the people I work with. They're so nice and full of life and humor. The hardest part of the job would have to be the spotty, unpredictable hours. Some times you wouldn't know what you were working the next week until a few days before and some times you would know your schedule for the next couple of weeks. It's even worse during the holidays and especially now since they're going out of business."
good,"Job was great, team made the company."
good,It was a great job to work for. Playing with kids and seeing the smiles on their faces. Setting up baby registries for the new mother's was always great.
good,"Although my time here was short, I had a good time working here. They gave a 15 minute break for every 4 hours, and a 30 min lunch break for 6+ hour shifts. The hardest part would have to be working with unhappy customers. All the co-workers were awesome kids at heart and were a blast to work with. As with any retail job, it was repetitive and tedious, but the vibe of the store helped."
good,"If the Company had not gone into receivership I would not be looking for another job, I would have stayed until my retirement."
good,Spent over 11 years at TRU and had a great time. The hours over Christmas are long but rewarding. Progression is really good. During my time here I learnt how to manage people and that helped me come out of my shell. Its just a shame they are no longer trading
good,Fun place to work.  Can be stressful especially around holidays.  Awesome opportunities to bring joy to kids of all ages.  Fun events.  Can be long days and highly competitive
good,company is liquidating; while employed it was a great place to work.  The Operations team was stellar! Helpful and Knowledgeable. Retail is a tough environment and you need to be able to move and change course quickly.
good,"Such a fun place to work. Management is great. As with any retail job, there are many employees so hours aren't easily full time. I really enjoyed my time here."
good,"Great team in the store. Customers can be a handful and pull a team member in many directions at one time. That's retail for you. Good Day and Bad Days, you get what you are willing to put in. Learned a lot in my time there."
good,"A typical day at Toys R Us would be busy and quick on the feet, you have to ensure that the stocks on shelf are visible for customers and is tidy and neat. I learnt to grow my previous skills and experience in a bigger retail industry, The management was excellent there. the Culture in the workplace were diverse. Working as team was fun as it should be."
good,"I have a proven track record of Professional growth in ""Toys R us""."
good,"In the beginning of my employment at Toys R Us, it was an exciting, fun work environment.  As the years went on, it became less fun and very stressful.  I've learned a lot of things working at Toys R Us, dealing with customers, Microsoft(Excel, Word and Access), processing journal entries.  The hardest part of my job was the outsourcing of my department.  I had to trained offshore(India) to do the work.  The most enjoyable part of my experience at Toys was, I met a lot of nice people."
good,"Working at Toys R Us allowed me to learn a lot about myself and I became more outspoken, customer service driven, analytical, and a great merchandiser. This position has taught me how to hold employees accountable for their actions and to have those certain conversations when need too. I become great at developing talent by observing employees and learning what they excel in and what they can improve on. Also, I learned that expressing and having engagement and passion is what it takes to get your team to succeed and getting everyone on the same page. I was granted the opportunity to work in Human Resources and expand my knowledge to grow as a leader. It allowed me to understand the aspect of it and how it works. Overall, Toys R Us is a great experience and I became a better leader."
good,"huge satisfaction from working with a very talented bunch of people from the team members in store, field and within store support functions, with a great culture"
good,"it wasn't that bad working there , i had alot of good times regardless. they were pretty wasteful though so much spent on graphics  then only too have to much, so we would just tose it out"
good,I had a lot of fun and made some good friends here. My favorite part of the job was working the demo events on Saturdays where we would show off one of the toys. It's a shame to see it close.
good,People are wonderful.  Upper management communicates well.  Always donating money and striving to do things for kids in need.   Changing retail climate have made it challenging for company.
good,The Store Operations team has always been a desired area to work for in ToysRus. The Store Operations leadership is outstanding and encourages their team members to continue to grow their careers.
good,I learned a lot in that company including how to use different programs which were detrimental in my position of pricing and signing. Whether it was price changes or setting ads I always enjoyed my job. Sometimes the job could be a bit technical and we all wore multiple hats as we assisted in multiple departments. The management was always around to assist us and the customers. The employees didn't just help customers but each other as well with their tasks.
good,Worked at Toys “R” Us for 13 and I am so sad to see the company go. Learned a lot and worked with great people.  The company has a great mision and core values.  #savetoysrus
good,I love kids so it was easy for me to work for this company. I easily transitioned into my job at Babies R Us and was able to help out even more with all the expectant mothers.
good,"I worked primarily in a Babies R Us store. It is very relaxed, much lower stress level than the toy store."
good,Working for the company for over 20 years it is sad to say goodbye.  Toys has been a great place to work for many years. Management was great along with senior managment.
good,I’m really happy they do invents on Saturday . Kids go and have some fun . They have different types of games.  When you work at Toys Rus if you are a Sale Floor doesn’t matter the time if they need backup for the front you have to go . You have to make sure your  aisle are clean and perfect. Sometimes you we don’t leave on time . We have to make sure everything it’s nice for the next day .
good,"-great place to build your management skills.  You work with a diverse group of individuals and lots of different customers."
good,A typical day will be filled with many roles throughout the day. Before you open it is filled with working back of house programs such as inventory management and stocking. Then you will go to selling and customer service once store opens. Closing will be zone recovery and prep for the next day
good,"Shifts started around 11pm-12am and work was a team process usually stocking whats important for the first few hours then restocking miscellaneous items and occasionally moving things around in the back of the house until 7-8am. The people were nice, it wasn't strenuous."
good,"Working at Toys R Us is always a joy because of the people I work with. They are always so helpful with each other, and make sure no one falls behind."
good,"I've worked for this company for years and have been through a lot of different managers. Working here was good but because of constant management change, there was no consistency."
good,it was ok. he staff was nice. the policies were lax.the work hours were decent. zoning was scary in the motion sensored toy aisle. im not sure what else to say.
good,The atmosphere at Christmas with the excited kids making list for Santa makes for an enjoyable day and makes the pressure of the busy period more enjoyable.
good,"Unless it was the Holidays the store wasn't too crazy, it was a very nice relaxing environment, and it was easy to walk around and do my job while assisting customers."
good,"I would punch into work and check to see which cash register I was assigned to. If I wasn't assigned to a register, then I would be out helping customers on the floor. "
good,Fun work place great customers!  Guarantees lots of knowledge of the toys ! The only drawback is all employees are all part time except management which gives you 4 to 15 hours a week!
good,Great environment while working in a small express location. Location recently closed and had to be transferred to a big box location 45 minutes away from home.
good,Toys R Us have a better teamwork system that I have worked for because before we started to work we always have a team meeting to get all the information before we work.
good,On a typical day i would stock shelves and restock toys that were not brought and out back. The most enjoyable part would be the customers because they were friendly and made the day go by faster. The hardest part would be trying to find a specific toy that we only have 5 of and the back room is a mess. Working here i learned how to have patience and deal with different people with different backgrounds.
good,"This was my first job ever, even though it wasn't the most excited I got a good understanding of what it meant to be a person finally holding down a job. Learned a lot of morals and work ethic from working here. Very fast paced place and a good starter job for young kids."
good,"A very fun and social place to work at besides the fact that its very stressful during holiday season. Fun environment. kids are always nice, only bad thing is dealing with rude parents."
good,Good to help make ends meet. They do work with you on parts of the job and make you feel like your more then your getting paid. Helping people is always fun their and always seeing people find what they are looking for is one of the greatest feelings working their.
good,"I enjoy working there and was advancing my career with the help of my manager. If the store wasn't slated to close, I would not be leaving. I have grown tremendously as person in my 11 years there."
good,A typical day would be making sure the sales floor was safe and no hazards were present. Throughout the day make area checks of the store. The management was ok but could've been better. The hardest part of the job was when someone got way with stealing. The most enjoyable part was catching someone stealing and recovering the merchandise.
good,I was hired as a seasonal employee but was kept on longer due to performance. During certain times of the year it is very busy and hectic otherwise it is very relaxed and not overwhelmingly busy
good,"Fun, fast paced, plenty of hours during Christmas season.  Hours after Christmas are few unless you are management.  Play on the job. Discounts and chances to advance if you work hard"
good,"Management was good, and pay was good. Everyone is very kind, if you had family problems, they find a way to work with it. Overnight has many hours, very comfortable."
good,"This place of business is a great place to work because it is incredibly easy to work here. The average day is you have to put items that were taken off the shelves by customers and put them back where they belong, then after that you need to make sure that the shelves are organized, next you ask customers that you see if you can help them with anything and if they do you do your best to help them, but if they do not you just wish them a good day and move on."
good,Good but very busy at times. Enjoy meeting new people and serving them their needs. Love that I am on schedule but I can also make out my own schedule.
good,I learned how toward a cashier and walk around the store to provide customer service and review the location of products. There was always about 1-2 managers working to always provide help with overrides on the cashiers. Though the seasonal hiring was full and every new worker only worked 2-3 days a week. I will miss my coworkers and helping put smiles on children faces once they find their toy.
good,"I like working here and have met some good people, the only thing i really can complain about is when we're understaffed and the blame of the store not looking up to standards goes on us."
good,"Everyone was nice and very professional. They made me feel comfortable and I wasn't afraid to be myself. Seasonal to full time is based on your scores in signing people up for the credit cards, warranties, added batteries, etc."
good,The job is fun but you have to make it funny pun you to enjoy wnojy hat you’re doin go and move fast when the truck needs to be unloaded it’s not a hard job but you cant be slow
good,"Depending on the time of day / year, Toys R Us can sometimes be challenging. Naturally Christmas is always incredibly busy. The management are mostly helpful and knowledgeable with the work. Helping customers and especially the children is always rewarding."
good,"in the beginning this is a nerve-racking and tough place to work. it is a fast paced and not much room for error. training in the beginning was also slightly lacking but after a few shifts, you will hit your stride and it becomes a happier place to work in. the staff are very accommodating and fun as well as co-operative."
good,"I have enjoyed working for Toys R Us. I started as a part time sales associate, and have worked my way to manager to a Toys R Us Outlet. Unfortunately, the company as a whole is always understaffed, they do not give enough hours out to the employees that they do have, and until you are a salaried manager, the compensation leaves something to be desired for the amount of work to be done."
good,I worked at the Baytown TX location and the management made working there so much fun! The inconsistent hours during offseason made the job perfect for a high school or college student
good,With my time at Babies R Us I can honestly say it was my favorite job thus far. I enjoyed the people that I worked with and also management was full of great people.
good,list in stores sometimes do order selecting ship to Docs unload and load truck scan items I will grab items from pallets or certain areas to place them in order
good,"A typical day at work would start off with a Stand Up meeting. Create FedEx labels, load trailers, pick and pack items, and help other departments that need help. Its a good place to gain experience as a first job."
good,"A typical day at work would consist of laughter, and loads of work. Loads of new learning experience. New job opportunities. I learned how  to properly use a RF Scanner. They will also train you and give you your certification on a forklift. The management is awesome, the manager is cool and she will be patience with you. The workplace culture is a cool culture to want to be a part of. The hardest part of the job is when the RF Scanner freezes up on you. The most enjoyable part is when you go to the MODS."
good,"This is a great place to work.  Unfortunately, past years of mismanagement have put current management in a situation of tough choices.  A lot needs to be fixed, particularly online, to keep up with other retailers and to survive the recent bankruptcy filing.  I hope they do, I am a Toys ""R"" Us kid always!!"
good,Typical day involved running around on double-lifts to scan in items for transport and then carry them to the loading area to stack and wrap.  After which we had a truck that these wrapped pallets would be placed in and then we would fill in the crevices with smaller items.  Most everything weighted above 20 pounds and some pieces got up to 100+. You would be measured on your speed and accuracy each day which was nice at times to see where you are but gets annoying when you are slowed down by other employees in the lane or product being in the wrong location.
good,"Toysrus is a fun place to work during the festive season, however I'm looking for something more permanent, I mainly work on customer service desk, I enjoy my time there, the staff are a great group of people."
good,"You have to be good with people and service oriented. The company is extremely focused on metrics; credit card sign ups, protection plans, loyalty cards."
good,The supervisors were all very nice and helpful. Everyone was open to listen to questions and listen to concerns. Most of the employees were also nice and courteous. Hours were reasonable and expectations were clear. Reasonable break/lunch times. Organization was good.
good,Take a retail associate experience and replace the merchandise with toys. Typical year-round retail that includes Black Friday. Management is hands-on and wants you to succeed.
good,I worked there for the Holiday Season. The work load was high in demand. Very fast pace working. Lifting was one of the most challenging parts of my job.
good,In the 1 year I have been working in toys r us I would say its a nice place to work as your first job. The toys r us I worked in was some days busy and other days very slow but i was always ready for what was to come.
good,"great good management really look after you and makes sure your okay with how everything works, loving working with the customers always have a laugh with customers."
good,"Working here was easy. Got up early to get things done. Once I was done I had to help stock the store or ring customers up. Management was okay, The manager I had at the time was great. Then he left and the new one just didn't like me"
good,All my coworker was positive and like to get the job done. How to keep well organized store with my team. Management was dedicate to making sure are team got the job done. Everybody pretty much got alone. The job was real simple. When helping parent pick out gifts for their kid/kids.
good,"Always on the go! TRU is a nonstop working environment.  During the holiday season it's crazy fun/stressful.  One minute you might be unloading a truck, the next minute an upset guest is trying to kill you because we are out of Furbys."
good,"aprendizaje sobre control y recepcion de mercancia y colocacion en almacen."
good,"Most days are fairly easy and stress free, but depending on how busy the store is and the time of year it can get pretty tough. managers and coworkers are generally fun to work with, but there is very limited room for advancement, and hours are very low outside of the holiday season."
good,"Provide training to team members on a one on one basis. Holding team members accountable and contributing to their growth with the company.  Coach team members on their performance and complete team member evaluations.   Cultivate a role model for best-selling practices.  Emphasis on guest service and actively engaging with each customer at all times. Promoting a highly engaging selling culture.  Maintaining and executing in stocks for the sales floor. Ensuring truck processing is being executed 100% at all times and ensuring proper merchandising standards of excellence. Monthly store supply ordering.

good,Not sure as to why you make this a requirement to fill out. My review would be a lot better if it was an option to fill out this form instead. Providing you guys some good feedback.
good,"I have always liked working in customer service environments, as I like being around people and helping people with what I can. The hours were flexible enough that I did not have to neglect my being a parent to my children."
good,"I nyiko gift masing as I was and employer at toys ""r"" us I used to go to work every working days as I was committed to my work it was a good place to meet with new people while busy helping them with what they need ,and our manager treated us very well ,we were 1 big family ,I really enjoyed working there"
good,"Began working for Toys R Us before the Christmas rush.  Restocking shelves and directing customers to the areas in the store to locate their items.  Had fun with the whole crew.  We were always on the move so time went fast.  The Management always provided information on the latest toys and games and upcoming events.  "
good,"fast pace work environment"
good,"It was a great job, the only a few bad things was the hours i had to work. But the pay was ok. Often my hours was cut do to the holiday season. But besides that it was a great learning experience."
good,I absolutely loved my time at Toys R us. Everyone there from the janitors to the management were good people. I honestly feel like that was the perfect job for me because the overall vibe you got from there made you want to excel in your customer service
good,"Extremely busy work environment with something always needing to be done be it stocking, inventory, making sales, or running the cash register. Hours are good, and the pay is semi-fair. Management can stress you out a bit, but only because they have other managers on them as well. Do your job, make your sales, and it can be a rewarding environment. Work well and get recognized with a promotion."
good,Comfortable and cooperative place to work. Work day is varied from business support to managing development teams. Cooperative environment between business and IT teams
good,Fun job not too stressful. Work during the holiday season still wasn't to fast pace nothing ever got out of hand. Management was okay most co-workers were friendly and helpful
good,awesome people to be around and work with never had any hard times with anyone there very helpful if you needed any help and couldnt do it on your own managers would b glad to
good,This was a seasonal  job it was a ok place to work. They promise you a job but then let you go after the season is over. Yet Overall the flow was good and steady the hours were not.
good,"Es una empresa que te enseña a trabajar en equipo, y hay muy buen ambiente de trabajo."
good,Best part of job was producing store promotions.  Children loved seeing all their favorite characters at events.  Well organized company to work for.  If pay scale was higher I would have stayed much longer.
good,"Retail. customer service job, lots of lifting, much turnover. "
good,"Toys R Us was the first retail store that I worked with and I instantly enjoyed the work when first introduced.  A typical day at work consisted of unloading trucks, processing received inventory, and assisting customers.  The management was very professional and balanced, definitely the best I have experienced in my years of working in the retail industry.  The most enjoyable part of the job was helping customers find specific items that they were having trouble locating.  The hardest part of the job was not working full time and not making enough money."
good,"I was a overnight stocker, so I worked 10:00PM up until the next day. There wasn't loud, anxious kids walking around, being loud and silly. I would say, Toys R Us was one of the best jobs I ever had."
good,I liked working as a seasonal stock member at Toys R Us . I went in at 10 pm and got off at 7am it was a fair job i would say .It was a manager there that i really didnt get along with but for the most part it was okay .
good,"Working at customer service, providing guest with information regarding products. Processing returns and sales, offering and successfully signing u customers for credit cards, loyalties and protection plans."
good,"I really enjoyed working here. A lot of cross-training, and room for advancement. I was supervisor for 2 different departments. Most customers were fun to help."
good,"I went from a cashier to a baby consultant! it was a great experience in my life, doing something new and learning things that improved  my customer service skills."
good,"Considering this is such a large company, it is managed well. I was able to excel in the areas I was trained, which was sales, customer service, and human resource. There are not very many advancement opportunities so I decided to go back to school."
good,"You will stay busy and always have something to do. Stores are never over staffed so you will learn how to work in all depts. Most stores have experienced staff but not a lot of opportunity for advancement,"
good,"Especially during Holidays of any sort, we usually had a table with activities for kids who come in that day. Along with when we got new toys in, we would set up demonstrations, especially with the electronic products."
good,I really don't have much to say about this place. It was a toy store so the environment was real upbeat. The customers were okay for the most part and I never had to many run-ins with the manager's so that's always a plus.
good,"Working for Toys r us was an adventure, who knew people would be so crazy over toys. I like how they have management walking the floor to help out with the questions we would have. A typical day working there is selling toys, finding toys and tracking peoples orders. The hardest part was when the customer would call in and want a specific toy that was sold out, then we would have to offer  them a similar toy."
good,"Good to work with others good team work"
good,Toys R US gives the word hard work a great excuse to work their. its means are attentive and not so demanding as long as you get the job done in the timely manner. being a stock person you work at getting the job done and making sure its customers  can find their selections easy and give no hassel.s

good,"first i would come in and clock in get straight to work, but when i first got there i was a little confused about what i was suposed to be doing, so i had to hunt down a manager because no one officially told me my job."
good,"The work here was not too stress full, but like any employment, there were times when we had to meet deadlines. All fellow employees were very nice and helpful. There were occasional late nights due to the on-call schedule but not too bad at all."
good,This is a very nice company to work for starting in work force or a second job. They give a lot of hours out during the Christmas season. The job is slow from January 20th thru September. Its a great place to advance. opportunities
good,I loved working at Toys R Us. I would be still be working there if I hadn't moved homes. Highly recommend Toys R Us. They increased their pay to $9.00 an hour and the management team is great.
good,"I've learned so much from working in different companies and organizations. being a hard worker make you strive for better and upgrade, there were really nothing hard about the jobs I work too, we basically enjoy and help with customers and made them feel more welcome."

good,"Super Fun team to work with. also great for parents,  kids get sick or family issues happen, the managers are understanding that life happens."

good,"- The managers are very skilled"
good,Overnight work is tough work but here it was far less of a chore than I've experienced in other companies.  I look forward to working with them again in the future.
good,"It was always fun seeing kids come in to find the perfect birthday present after receiving a gift card, or money for the birthdays. Greet customers, apply refunds, and assist customers in finding the correct items."
good,Hardest part of the job for me was just dealing with my social anxiety and anxiety. Not being able to talk much. Usually come in and print out orders and look for the items printed. Pick out the toys and print out the mail tickets and package them. Sometimes help on the follow with stocking or making a new shelf.
good,The managers there are very nice and understanding! It was a great environment and I had a lot of fun working there. Only thing that wasn't fun was just standing there.
good,A typical day is not to stressful and always have people to help support you. Work isn't difficult as long as you put in your effort everything
good,"Fun at the start of the work day, a lot of work at end if u don't maintain your section through the shift. This job taught me how to deal with children and frustrated parents.  Management at this company is world class, they make sure you learn and take the time to teach once you're willing to learn. Hardest part is maintaining sections because kids plus toys equals disaster.  Great job u learn about all the latest toys and management takes care of you."
good,Working here was pretty fun and had lots of over time which was great. Had a pretty good work team we did a lot of things as a team and got stuff done faster then we thought.
good,I work here as a seasonal employee. While working here I've been able to meet nice workers who care about their jobs and the success of the company. The managers always make sure you have something to do and that it is always done correctly. Overall this company is great to work for.
good,Great first job taught me alot growing up in the work force and always has fun events. Cross training is amazing you seem to learn alot of different posistions.
good,Toys R Us was a great experience. From management to workers. There was always a promotion going on. Great customer service. Neat and tidy to the best of everyone's ability.
good,"I was only there for a seasonal position, but in that time I managed to develop some sales skills and social skills, I was also quite young at this time, the employees and managers were kind, polite, hardworking"
good,"My time at Toys R Us,Times Square, NY was a very happy time. I worked with an amazing team of associates, and a talented group of managers. Great job."
good,It is a fun and family oriented environment. The system is a little slow which can make work harder sometimes. Overall is a good starter job.
good,It was a fun and fast paced place to work. All the employees got all and worked well together. The most enjoyable part was helping the customers find exactly what they were looking for.
good,"The environment was great but the management was so good. "
good,Very accommodating to University schedules. A terrific place to learn the the essentials to customer service and helping with every customers individual needs.
good,las jornadas laborales estaban muy bien distribuidas. Se te proporcionaba todo el material y la instrucción necesaria. Lo único malo es que solo tienen trabajos temporales debido a la naturaleza de la empresa por todo lo demás me parecio un sitio ideal para trabajar.
good,"Fun place to work, sometimes I managed to meet some interesting customers who I sort of befriended because we shared common interests. I usually worked in the electronics area, and out of season I had the area to myself, and that how I got to meet these customers. In season there were at most two people in the electronics area. In season the work flow could pick up quickly. Pay was alright, but I never went in working for pay, mostly work environment. The coworkers I had helped make the job more entertaining."
good,"Meet a lot of nice people "
good,"This is a place where you have tons of parents and kids come in and search for the ""must have"" toys of the moment from infants to adults, the joy in obtaining the items they looked for were great. Anywhere from pictures with the giraffe, to constant events, this is fun place to work. always something new going on."
good,"The pay was nice, job was easy, but I hated the fact that my shifts were from 12am to 8am and had to sleep during the day. It messed up my sleep schedule and personal life."
good,go in get ready for the delivers to arrive unpack them into the warehouse then send them out to other store i learn that toy r us warehouse are not just for one store it is the whole toy r us chain hardest part is to keep busy between delivers we could go hours where we dont get and delivery
good,I worked at Toys R Us for two holiday seasons. I enjoyed it for the time I was there. I might go back for a third season. They was very understanding of my school schedule and worked with me. The hardest part of the job was seeing people steal and nothing happening to them criminally. Working here I learned how to use a cash register.
good,"It was going to be a long night, so make sure you have something that you know that will keep you awake. The work was long but worth it and really fun. Hardest part was trying to stay awake. Most enjoyable part was seeing all the new toys come in, it made you feel like a kid again."
good,A typical day at work would be me handling lay away task and really just dealing with customers because they tend to have many questions.
good,"A typical included running up and downstairs, carrying items for customers. Also helping customers to their cars, if items are to heavy or if their unable to."
good,This was a temporary position. Just for the holidays So I didn't stay there very long. I didn't like how the store would get trashed by customers and was one of my jobs to clean. This wasn't one of my best positions.
good,Unpack boxes and examine shipment prior to restocking shelves and display cases throughout the store and Using spatial knowledge of sales floor to return merchandise to its proper location; often climbing a 12-foot ladder to replace upper level shelves.
good,"The workers are nice and easy going however, some of the managers really don't know what they're doing. They need to get better management. They don't really update their signs."
good,Babies R us is a fantastic company to work for! If you are looking for a place that is professional but has a wonderful employee morale and a fun work environment then this is the place for you!
good,"I have progressed from processing assistant to Transport Planner"
good,the work environment is very much comfortable and plenty of excitement for the customers and the kids. The team is very strong and dedicated to their work and skills which makes the store a success.
good,"Working here for a short period it was a great work environment. The management was poor, but it was a happy atmosphere and every one was polite and nice."
good,"In retail, everyone works hard, and everyone works with everyone else. There is a great sense of camaraderie and of a job well done, especially after the end of a particularly busy day. My only real issue with this company is that the pay for hourly full-time positions is very low. For the amount of work I do and the expertise I bring to the table, I do not receive ample compensation."
good,Working for ToysRus is a rewarding career and this work place has allowed me to discover my passion and desire to work with children . I get to experience the joy and happiness of interacting with children everyday and maintain the personal relationships with the parents and families.
good,"I enjoyed this job until certain managers were all play no work, other than that the company itself is an ok place to start your first job."
good,"Great friendly, very professional Service. It was a Christmas time Seasonal job ,we were constantly busy. great managmentleads to a great results."
good,"Enjoyed working there, hours were great for me (10p-7a), not very hectic, but did require muscle. When first started there were only maybe 6 people so it was  hard to finish the trucks before the store opened but as the Christmas season drew closer they brought on more people and the job became easier.  although, as the season drew closer to the end (DEC) back and feet begin to feel all those boxes, but all in all this was a great job."
good,"Providing correct customer service to all guests with any questions, ordering on-line items not in stores, micro managing front end staff."
good,It's a job where you can let your inner child shine. Read the small print of every ad and coupon. Management was great and my co-workers were fun too. The hardest part about the job was the hours but the best part was having the opportunity to gain so much knowledge of the products.
good,A good entry level job hard to get fulltime hours there the best time to go there is during the seasonal period you will really like it during that time just try to remember where things are in the store
good,"Fun place to work with a lot of great people. I had helpful and supportive managers who helped develop me. Wonderful work life balance, I was in collage at the time and Toys R Us was very accommodating to my class schedule. The most enjoyable part of my job was the wonderful people I got to work with on a daily basis."
good,"I had fun with my job, the work environment is enjoyable its like you don't feel getting older because of the type customer, its fun selling things for the kids!"
good,"My typical work day can start early in the morning before the store even opens. I will either take care of price and sign changes or do cash office. Once we open, my position is a registry consult, where I help new parents pick out the perfect items for their newest family member. Working with excited parents and grandparents always make my day. I love being able to help them find exactly what they are looking for and helping them pick out what fits their needs best. "
good,"Clock in and get ready to have fun. Straighten out the shelves and working down overstock. When you get an alert on your handheld, you accept it and follow the instructions to complete it. Usually getting a bike or something of the sort from the back for a customer, or filling an online order. The work can keep you really busy sometimes but you are never left without something to do."
good,"It is a fun place to work in, you are surrounded by toys! You can even try out new products. You get to make kids happy and help parents on deciding what to get for their kids as they may not know the in toys etc."
good,"Very slow typical work days , dealt with a lot of packages that werents to heavy but it was good hard labor . Most days the hardest things were putting the packages together and knowing how to stack the boxes . It was fairly easy to stock the sales floor."
good,"Sales Floor Associate :"
good,"A typical day would consist of responding to emails and phone calls from vendors and internal associates, setting up new agreements with vendors, analyzing and resolving disputes."
good,I worked the cash register for the most part of my typical work day but when it was slow I would organize the store and restock the returns we received and I also answered the phones. I learned how to work a cash register and how to work with others to complete tasks such as straightening up the store. My co-workers were all very friendly and we all shared similar interests in things. The managers were all nice and helped out whenever there were issues. The hardest part of the job was probably dealing with a customer who had to many issues that I couldn't solve. The most enjoyable part was being able to work with the others and complete our tasks and to help customers find what they needed.
good,"I was a cashier when needed but i was usually a overnight pricer."
good,"Do several things, including inventory, mark downs, cashiering, and cleaning.  The job has changed a lot from when I was there, from what I hear, with no more birthday parties.  It was my first job, so I learned a great deal.  How to deal with people, irate and happy, how to operate scanners and registers, and basic customer service skills.  The management I worked with was a really good set of people, as well as my co-workers.  The most enjoyable part of the job was helping make kids happy and seeing the smiles on their face when they were able to find or do what they're wanting."
good,"Overall a really slooooow company in this economy.. sad too, when i was a kid Toys R us was always busy and bustling. Now its like a Morgue in there.. Mostly Zone up the shelves fo the whole shift... really sucked unless you worked Overnite on 3rd shift. then the time flew by"
good,keeping my section clean & helping different customers everyday. the managers was thoughtful & helpful. The hardest part was trying to keep your sections clean and trying to help the customers at the same time.
good,"Toys R Us is a nice place to work, Management needs a little work.  Requires a lot of lifting and moving heavy pieces.  Caring heavy pieces up and down ladders is a little trying."
good,"It was something different for me but it was great job. Everyday was pretty good, when it came to hoildays, it would get very hectic do to the over crowding so I would have to be on my p's and q's. Managment was awesome, co worker were great everyone got along. The job was never hard. I enjoyed the kids expresssion do to all the toys and games."
good,"At Toys R' Us, I learned a lot about customer service. Being the main customer service rep, it taught me how to focus on making others happier. I loved satisfying a customer when they were dying to find something for their child. Being a customer service representative, it also taught me to learn to have more patience. When you are working in retail, you definitely see many different people, and you need to know how to compose yourself when dealing with anything. A typical day included taking in returns, exchanges, and ringing people out with regular sales, along with answering phone calls, and multitasking. Everyday, we had a specific goal to reach in signing people up for rewards cards and earning a specific percentage. This taught me to push towards a goal even if it was just some number. When you reach that goal, it makes you so proud of yourself and you want to continue doing a great job. Also, being the main customer service rep, once I learned everything I needed to know, I began training new employees, and that taught me order. When teaching people what you know, you need some kind of order and organization. Lastly, I loved when children came to the store and had the biggest smiles on their faces just by interacting with them and making them feel important along with their parents."
good,"I love this job. It is a fun place to work but it is minimum wage and don't expect to advance (or at least not quickly)."
good,"I was normally asked to come on the days where there was a trunk to be unloaded or items to be stocked. During my team working for TOYS R US i had learned how to unload trunks and neatly stock items on shelves. The management was always nice and everything got done the way it was supposed to despite minor setback here and there.                                                                                                        I had many co-workers during my time at work, some of them where very work workers and good people to be around and others where lazy and didn't get the job done correctly must the time. The most difficult part of the job is being short staffed and have to fill in my absent co-worker. The part i most enjoyed is being able to learn new experiences and meet new people."
good,"I've been with the company for a little less than 2 years. I've worked full-time and part-time positions and overall, I prefer the part-time. It isn't too difficult for promotion as long as you continue to show interest in the company and remain a good employee. I made the mistake of stepping down, but in the long run it ended up working out for the best. They always manage to find hours for me if I ask for more which is amazing for a retail environment. They constantly give opportunities to improve and are very concerned with the individual's needs and wants. It's a pretty drama free environment and I enjoy every minute of working there. It's why I've hung on for so long. It keeps me going with its constant changing."
good,"the company is great to work for, the regional staff was amazing. only complaint was compensation and trying to stay busy in the job."
good,"Its an easygoing job and enjoyable for someone who enjoys being around children. I worked several different positions such as cashier, stock , and sales floor associate. Unfortunately when i was working there i received inconsistent hours i would work about 30 hours one week and the next week barely work at all."
good,great place to work I answer peoples questions about what ever they need. The people there are very friendly and answer any of your questions you may have. All managers or supervisors are very helpful when ever anybody has any questions weather there personal or job related. Hardest part of the job is nothing its all pretty straight forward. The most enjoyable part is helping people find what they need and answering there questions to my fullest extent of the subject.
good,it was always a different experience from day to day so I found it to be an excellent and exciting place to work. Plus I loved working with the families and seeing the smiles on the faces of the little ones.
good,"My work day consisted of me going to work sites to help the contractors in the jobs that were scheduled for the day.  Jobs consisted o loading trucks with bricks, woood work, lawn materials etc.  I assisted the Manager or Supervisor on any and all jobs that were required.  Laying brick, painting, lawn work."
good,"Flexible scheduling available for part-time team members. Relaxed atmosphere for the most part in store. Benefits for full-time team members has deteriorated over the years, but ACA is more to blame than Toys R Us for that. All the store managers and the district manager I've worked with over the years have been exceptional. I've never been worried about my job security and I've advanced from a part-time team member to management in just a few years. Great culture in store, all team members I've worked with have bought in and truly enjoy helping the guest with what they need. Overall great place to work!"
good,My seasonal position was during the Christmas holiday. A typical day was always fast paced and busy from open to close.  I learned to have patience with customers and great time management when it came to long lines and estimating how much time should be spent ringing up a customer's items.  Management was okay.  You could tell who was serious about their job.  My co-workers were very diverse.  There were always new people working there.  Friendly environment at all times.  The hardest part of the job was getting customers to apply for the stores credit card.  Most enjoyable part of the job was seeing the kids leaving the store happy and interacting with customers.
good,A typical day at Toys R Us is very hectic upon starting work. I learned A lot about retail business and the benefits. The management team was very understanding and was their when you needed them.The hardest part of the job is the lack of communication between management. Lastly the most enjoyable part is the customers and knowing you can change and put a smile on someones face.
good,Typical day at work consist of giving excellent customer service as well as making the shopping experience easy and fair. Through working at Toy R Us I've learned to work with people and kids of all ages. I also learned how to relate to customers and developed a high level of communication. My managers and co-workers were amazing and energetic people who made a great team for the company. The hardest part of the job would be finding the right  item for the customer with very minimal description. What I loved most about working at Toys R Us is have a great sense  of accomplishment at the end of every day. There was never a task too big or complicated for myself or the team.
good,"I answered the main phone, checkouts, layaways, online orders, straightened the shelves, intercom announcements, and greeted every guest at the front desk."
good,I unload trucks and stock merchandise throughout the day. I get along well with my co-workers and management. Hardest part of the job is trying to put product on the shelf with a store full of customers. Most enjoyable part is helping a customer find what they need.
good,"Shipping Supervisor"
good,"Standard target driven sales with additional upselling, good place to work staff are amazing very professional and accommodating, however no job security. (seasonal job only unless opening available)."
good,"Helping employees, learned the in's and out's of customer service. I enjoyed helping anyone out who needed it."
good,"Once I arrive after I punched in I go straight to the receiving area start workng on the truck, if there is no truck to unload then I have to start reshoping. I most thing I learned about working hee is its easier than you think I learned how to use a scaner to fing items that are stored away and it tells you where tey are located. The managers there were well respectful, they helped with figuring out solutions if I wasnt able to or they would help locate a item. The people I worked with were great they knew about team work. The best part of this job was that you get rewarded for the good tasks you complete, also you can receive bonuses."
good,I loved working here even though the hours took its toll on my body. I learned that although the saying is the customer is always right that is not always the truth. Management and me got along fairly well. My co-workers were fun to work with & talk to. Hardest part of the job was that since it was during the Christmas holiday season it got packed and my nerves were shot usually by the end of the day. Most enjoyable part of the job is that i got to work at the place every kid including myself would love to work at.
good,"There were no hard parts about the job, you basically did the same thing everyday. I learned about restocking, and merchandise, the managers adn co-workers were very helpful and friendly. The most enjoyable part was the working with the employees and learning about all the new toys"
good,"Greeted customers and determined their needs and wants"
good,"A typical day at work would be just walking in and seeing a clipboard with your duties on it, whether it just be on the floor or be a cashier. I learned a lot though because it was my very first job. The management was pretty top notch as it could be seeing as though it was the season. My co-workers were all so easy to relate with and they always had your back if you couldn't figure out a problem. I felt the hardest part of the job was that I couldn't please every customer with what they wanted because we were out of stock. The most enjoyable part of the job is when I was able to get the item the customer wanted and basically being a guardian angel for them."
good,Toys R Us is a great company to work for and gain extensive customer service experience. It is a fast pace work environment that allows little time for adjustment to new policies. Metrics set by corporate must be met on a daily basis but you must always remember to put the customer first. Working in a supervisory customer service position can be frustrating at times but the employees and co-workers are there to empathize and make sure a smile is returned to your face at all times. The hardest part of the job would have to be dealing with customer complaints face to face. There is no room for error because most of the time they want a solution immediately. The most enjoyable part of the job is the customer interaction as well but when they are happy. I love to know they I have provided a customer with something they really need and see a satisfactory smile of their face.
good,I learned the true meaning of team work while employed for this company. I had an excellent manager who trained me properly and provided me with the right skills to use in any work place. I most enjoyed the dedication that was displayed by my co-workers and manager.
good,"A great place to be your inner-child. Customers are usually kind except when a specific toy isn't in stock anymore. Managers aren't over your back all the time, very cool and laid back. Co-Workers are very friendly and co-operative. The fun part is the ability to interact with the toys while assisting the customers."
good,"Always new things to learn every single day. New guests to meet, the management is always showing you new ways to do things, new plans to implement."
good,"Well , the job was a great place to work because every employee was different in a unique way. We all had a different personality, so it was cool being around everyone. A regular day at the job was busy , hardly ever slow, Hardest part of the job was when i first got there and i had to remember where certain items belong threw out the whole entire building."
good,"A typical day for me so far has been kind of hectic, as it seems that I am called upon to do multiple things for multiple people all at once. Though it is not hard or truly overwhelming, it is quite inconvenient. I often start one thing, get called away to do something else, and while I'm doing that I am called to do something else, then assisting a customer, etc. and by the time I get back to the original task, it is three hours later."
good,"Store manager and Customer Service, would be attentive to the need of the customers and the ability to manage time well. Was in charge of Unloading truck, responsible for making sure that the store order was delivered and put away in a timely manner. Help customer with the needs of finding items in store and cashing out customers. Managing employees cash flow and break time, along with doing paperwork, and scheduling employees."
good,"Being employed at Babies R Us is a joyful experience. I love working with mothers and gift givers to help make the lives of the children better by receiving items that they need. My managers are very kind, understanding, and treat everyone equally. Co-workers are very easy-going and easy to get along with. The hardest part of my job is handling situations that arise from corporate issues."
good,"A typical shift lasts between 6- 9 hours, and working on shop floor mainly involves pulling stock from the store room and working onto the shop floor to make the shop look as full and good as it can. It also involves being highly customer facing as customers often need assistance to find items and assist them to which items would be best for them to buy. During busy periods, shop floor assistants often get called to work as cashiers to get the queues down as quick as possible and keep customers happy and satisfied. I have learnt valuable customer facing qualities, such as communication, confidence and how to deal with a variety of people and situations. In order to work efficiently it is essential that all co-workers got along well and i found the team work exceptional as everybody is always willing to help one anther out when needed. The management was highly organised and ensured each day ran as smoothly as possible to make each day productive. The hardest part of the job was figuring out how to deal with customers who were not happy with the merchandise purchased and were not happy with the the options that we could offer to help, however this occurs in all customer facing jobs and i have learnt to deal with it professionally. The most enjoyable part of the job was receiving compliments for from satisfied customers with your service."
good,Fun fast paced environment. Great company and great employees.
good,My day consists of working the truck and stocking the shelves. I like my co workers and get along well with all of them. The hardest part of my job is learning not to take everything on all by myself. I like to learn new things and work pretty much everywhere in the store.
good,"Pretty busy during season."
good,Even though I was new I was encouraged to take on a lot of responsibilities. It seemed as though I was learning something new everyday. The managers were personable and encouraging. The same applies to all of my former co-workers. The hardest part of the job was being short-staffed frequently and having to work additional hours. But it wasn't that bad because it really was enjoyable working there.
good,Assisting customers with their needs and making sure its a good product
good,"When I came back to Toys R Us in 2009, I had no clue what replenishment was about. Two managers teach me what replenishment was about and I learn quickly on how to scan items in and out of a bay. The next thing I learn was how to work on a truck, spotting the boxes in the right aisles and packing out the boxes. My co-workers were very helpful to me, especially knowing that it was my first time doing replenishment."
good,I had to greet the customers and help assist them with finding the products that they desired. I also assisted the Human Resource Manager with duties she had assigned for me to.
good,"The majority of my shifts were spent on till duties and multimedia. Although sometimes difficult, the shifts were made enjoyable by the working staff. For any additional shifts during the week, however, I was given very little notice and most of the time I was unable to attend the shifts offered."
good,"fun place to work...playing with toys sharing your new product with the customers. management will confuse you, one manager tells you to do one thing then another tells you to do something else. some of the employees are great to work with but others do not need to be in the retail business"
good,Management was excellent. It was very clear what needed to be done. It was a very productive and family oriented.  Very fun atmosphere with little drama.  Pay wasn't great but there were opportunities for raises and promotions.
good,A quality place to work.  The management team was at times unorganized but had some very strong managers to pull the team together.  The co-workers and relationships between workers was a huge perk of this job.  The diverse group of workers made it a fun environment to work in.
good,"Its a decent place to work, pay/benefits should be better. Co-workers and management are cooperative and easy to get alone with."
good,"You get to ""handle"" toys all day! The only things that were dislike were the same 20 songs that were played all day."
good,This was one of the greatest experiences i have had working. I learned how to handle problems behind the cash register on my own.
good,"It's a really fun job and there is room for advancement, but varying schedules make it hard to be a parent."
good,"Toys R Us was one of the non-biology jobs I've ever had. Between the incredible staff, and the fun work environment, I would definitely recommend this place to people looking to get their feet wet in the sales business."
good,"Best company I've ever worked for.  Has a strong commitment to provide a great experience for the guests in the stores.  Works to develop the people who work for TRU and nice total benefits package"
good,During my working hours my posts of responsability consisted of helping customers find the products they was looking for as well as providing additional information before they bought the products.
good,Greet guests as they come into the store. Help finding things for the guests if they need assistance. Help new parents register for items they are wanting for their new baby. Answer calls coming in for Babies R Us. Occasionally relieve a co-worker for their breaks at the guest service desk. My co-workers and I work as a team to restock shelves when we are slow. I have become good friends with a lot of the people that I work with. The hardest part of the job is not having a salary that reflects the things that I do. The best part of the job is I get to work with expectiing parents that are sharing their experience with me and being able to help them with the things they don't know.
good,"In general, it's a very fun job, especially as a seasonal gig. The other employees and supervisiors I worked with were wonderful and helpful. "
good,greeting and helping take care of customers was fun. Working on times square you get a bunch of different people to meet different languages and it also fun trying to figure out what they are say so i can assist them with what they need
good,I love this job to be able to see all the kids happy with there toys and see the moms happy buying the new born baby ... I love helping people out ..
good,"Working at Toys R Us was fun every day. Other employees were friendly, though a lot of them were slackers. It didn't effect my work day even though I had more work to do at the end of the day. The managers were extremely understanding and got the job done when possible. There were times where customers had to wait for a very long amount of time before they could talk with them. There were a lot of angry customers during the holidays, but I know how to handle tempers very well and got the customers to leave with a smile on their faces."
good,"I loved my time at Toys R Us, the people were friendly and polite, the working conditions were superb and not a bad thing could be said about the company it's self. The only drawback I had to working here, was the lack of hours offered to me and the payment I was on."
good,my position at toys r us allowed me to jump right into helping guest make informed and practical decisions on what sorts of toys they would need depending on the personality and hobbies of the child they were buying for.I learned alot of things during my employment there but most important would be how to secure customer loyalty through accomplishing daily matrix goals .the managers were diverse in there management styles but the head guy was a calm and wise leader. my co workers were also very diverse but seemed to become a big family while at work although a lack of hours after the holiday shopping season was a issue for all us. nonthing about the job was really hard r safing on busy day was a problem and recovering the store when this ocured. but all in all the job was very enjoyable especially during the holidays wen u meet the new employees and sell all the new cool toys.
good,Working for Toys R Us for 5 years it did give me experience behind the store.A opportunity to learn accounting money operations and sales dead lines.Also work with young students and help them with there goals with in the company.
good,"On a typical day, I would get there around 10pm and I would help unloading the truck. It was a very upbeat job. No time for messing around. I always stayed after to make sure the store was ready to open at 8am. I loved my job."
good,customer service is the number one priority in this job. great support team. The most enjoyable part of the job was helping customers find what they needed and seeing them smile
good,Your challenge is always during the holiday time and making budgets.  Your truck processing is the only thing that can make you a great store manager versus a poor performer.  Time management and also personal skills are highly required.
good,I enjoyed working here I learn how to be very patient with the customers during the holiday season I got along great with my co workers andmanagement
good,"Typical day at work involves: "
good,"It's a great learning experience for a first time sales member, especially during the holidays. I learned the inside of the business how things work and how to communicate with customers. The managers are very open and outgoing but can be grumpy when stressed. My co-workers are great, well some. Some co-workers would take longer breaks than they were suppose to. Leaving me with a heavy load of customers and work that had to be done. hardest part of my job was being everywhere at the same time. I had to run back and forth to fill orders and help customers. Most enjoyable part was making the customer happy and leaving the store with a smile, especially the kids"
good,"Working in a Toy Store immediately sounds like a recipe for fun. One is surrounded by happy children , wealthy parents and co workers that genuinely know the ins and outs of a Lego temple and play station. This in my experience is true, daily routine of birthday parties and holiday demos. The balancing part of this gaiety comes in the preparation and preservation of these operations. One employed by this company must remain friendly with consumers and knowledgeable of most products. "
good,"My main duties were to register moms and families in our store database for the store services. the job wasn't very difficult, it was pretty routine. What I most enjoyed was working with the pregnant moms helping them get ready for their baby."
good,"as price auditor my day started with making sure all signs and prices were correctly labeled. every Thursday I would get a list of price changes usually 700 items then I would have to locate all the items on the floor and in storage and put the correct prices on them. I also was in charge of holding clearance sales. taking care of price matches and pulling recalled items off the floor and returning to vendor. I assisted in stocking shelves with merchandise. keeping track of inventory count backup cashier and at xmas was key holder where I kept the registers up and running. with supplies, money drops, breaks for the cashiers voids, and price matches. etc. once dressed as Jeffery for make a wish foundation was fun."
good,"A day at Toys'R'Us would require me helping customers and making sure they find what they are looking for, tidying up loose toys, serving customers etc.. The most enjoyable part was getting the children involved with the latest toys out."
good,Enjoyed learning retail more in depth.  Team leaders and members were great to work with.
good,"While working at Toys 'R' Us, I found it incredibly enjoyable to be able to work in such a family friendly workplace. I was able to help families of every kind find what they needed and see smiles on faces that I helped put there in a way."
good,"Toys R Us has long been an eye catcher for any child who has walked through its doors. Children are greeted by such a huge array of merchandise and displays. My experiences were just as wonderful as advertised. "
good,"• Responsible for store management"
good,"The hectic environment during the holidays really gives employees a chance to test themselves at work.  This same environment made it difficult for management to find time to focus on employees.  Co-workers were a big plus to my job in Toys R Us, any question or concern I had they were always the ones with answers.  Hardest part of the job was having to deal with about four or more customers at the same time.  Making time to fulfill each of their needs was irritating both to them and also to me.  The easiest and most enjoyable part of the job was to work the cash register.  Everything was straight forward and flowed at a fast rate."
good,"Toys ""R"" US was a great store to work at, everyone is down to earth and its all happiness around the kids and toys. I was seasonal and i'd like to work there again if given the opportunity."
good,"Even though I had to do a few things that weren't in my job description (which I had no problem in doing), it was a nice work environment."
good,"great place to start in the work force"
good,Most days of work happened to be slow for my taste.  I found my self working extra loads of merchandise to pass time .  Management was very reasonable.  They were able and willing to work with my needs.  The coworkers were friendly and always able to help out. The hardest part of the job was finding enough to do after loads were completed. I would just help assist customers needs and give info for deciding purchases.  I enjoyed working really early in morning unloading loads from trucks. At this time the work team had a specific time and quota to complete before opening store hours.  I also enjoyed keeping track of  inventory using electronic handheld hardware equipment.
good,Voor de korte periode dat ik er gewerkt heb was het fantastisch
good,"i had a fun time working at toys r us, i learned a lot about how to deal and to talk with customers. how to think fast and how to multiple things at once."
good,"I love a job where I can be on a non stop mode, cause  it makes time fly for me. I love to see a customer leave with satisfaction and a smile on their face. I tend to make the best out of a bad situation, so I approach any type of situation with a positive mentality...plus being around a great team of co-workers makes a job that much amazing. I have always been open with all my supervisors in letting them know that I ask questions and that I am open to constructive criticism....There is always room to learn ,and for improvement. I honestly can say that I'm yet to experience a bad day at work...I'm just too much of a funny guy."
good,A typical day at work consisted of unloading merchandise from the company truck and stocking the products throughout the store.
good,"My everyday at work would be to check out people, and if someone needed help I would assist them, answer phones, straighten shelves, stock and so much more."
good,"I liked working for toys.  For me it was fun and always challenging.  The annual review process left little room for monetary gain and getting promoted to the salaried level seemed like it was never going to happen despite various successes on the job.  The coworkers were great, toy stores attract a special kind of person.  I learned a great deal about managing others through my various experiences in multiple departments.  And though I didn't get to the level I wanted I don't regret my time with the company or the opportunities it allowed me."
good,I was a closer most of the time so my typical day was 4-10 pm. My co workers were big kids. I really like working with them and playing with the kids made it exciting because they would get so bright eyed when they came in.
good,"A typical day involved re-stocking shelves, knowing the product placement throughout the store to better assist customers in finding the items they were looking for. Management took the time to answer all my questions to help me better learn and understand my job. The hardest part of the job was it being a seasonal position. The most enjoyable part of the job was delivering great customer service. "
good,They have a great training program to train employees so they are able to share product knowledge with their customers.  Great place to work for students. 
good,Every weekend i would work i received a sales target which i met and exceeded many times. It was my first job so i learnt alot in the way of customer service and team environment. The management were great and easy to get along with. They helped if i needed any help and trained me to be better at what i was doing. The hardest part of the job was the phsyical side of things i wasnt used to being on my feet for that long and lifting boxes so much. I enjoyed serving customers and helping them with products they wanted and keeping them happy. The sales team were also great to work with and easy to get along with.
good,"Advanced quickly, but needed to move to raise a family in a better area."
good,"Helping out with the customers and having them enjoy the toys. Letting the kids try out the toys. The co-workers were friendly and playful with each other. The hardest part of the job was Taking down merchandises and bring them back out, finding out that nobody called for it or the customer just left. The fun part of it was the competition."
good,"I would stack the shelves, so they did not look empty, if there was no more stock to put out; I would bring the boxes/products to the front. I would also have to deal with customers if they could not find anything in store. When working for toys R us I learnt that letting the customer try a product, persuades them to buy the product. The hardest part of the job was when I would need to work in an area I was not familiar with."
good,"I learnt to work as i team aand on my own, to help customers find items,pay for items."
good,"A typical day at work is like any ordinary day, but you work with a team of employees who give it their all. I've learned a lot over the few years I've been there, such as customer service, greeting and assisting, etc. My management looks out for all of us, regardless of what situation arises. My co-workers are always there to listen out and be on alert for help. The hardest part of my job is grabbing shopping carts. Whether rain or shine, it's a duty of mine to grab all the shopping carts and push them back into the store."
good,"A good place to work, the team work is really important,I feel happy to see people find the products when I assist them."
good,"A typical day of work would start off with a couple of hours of sales -promoting store rewards cards, answering the phones and assisting customers on shop floor. Sometimes i would assist on the collection point and in the warehouse. In quieter periods I would restock the shelves and maintain the displays. Management are always friendly and let you know what they expect, co workers always smiling and willing to lend a hand"
good,Helping the parents and the kids find age suitable toys that may or may not be a learning to and stimulate the mind.
good,Large retail company with tons of opportunity. Great field management. Must be able to handle a large stafff.
good,"I had a seasonal job, around holiday time so the store was really busy. There was no typical day because every day was different. I got a long well with everyone. The hardest part of the job was balancing work with my school work in my senior year of high school since I came home late in the nights. This job helped to put a little money in my pocket so I was grateful for that."
good,people wouldnt show up for their shifts and if you were reliable you will usually get a call on your day off asking you to work. Management was supper nice! Customers were kinda mean with the different coupons we give out.
good,I did seasonal work during christmas/thanksgiving holidays. It put you in the spirit of the holidays.
good,• Developed and implemented marketing plans to achieve sales goals.
good,"Working with Toys R Us was a very fast paced job. Within one month of being hired I was promoted to the Front End Department Manager. It was a very rewarding workplace. The managment team was very helpful in training and making sure I was ready to take on my new job. The hours were very irregular, and included overnights, which made the job a little more difficult. But in general working for the Allen store was an enjoyable time."
good,"Starting off by checking my register for correct amount of money. Started ringing customers purchases up. I learned great people skills, and furthered my skills on a cash register. Management were a group of very nice, upbeat people. Co-workers all got along great, creating a great work environment. The hardest part of the job was the morning after Thanksgiving when all the holiday sales started. The most enjoyable part of my job was when we got through one of the hard times. Also working at a toy store was great."
good,Great co-workers. I handled incoming merchandise deliveries. Stocked shelves as needed. Management was super!

good,Toys R Us is a great company to work for. They have new changes day in and day out to affect a great sales experiencd.
good,"Most days following the christmas holiday are typically slow. The hours are cut drastically so the pay is not so great especially if you need to have a set amount of money at your fingertips. The hardest part of the job is not being consumed by boredom. The job is very simple, the co-workers are very enjoyable and so is management."
good,Delivering toys to their locations with a forklift. It was challenging everyday to make goals and it was great to be succesful everday.

good,When I worked at Toys R Us it was enjoyable. I would assist customer and others with what was needed. I worked here for a short time to get into retail. The managers made this a fun place to work. They took our ideas and let us use them to better the shopping for all. The people I worked with had fun and worked well with each other. There was not a hard part to the job. We all had fun and enjoyed working there. The best thing was getting to try out a new toy that came out on the market. We all tested the toys so we could explain everything about it.
good,Love working for this company. It's the best job in the world. We sale toys to kids and moms. The company has a lot of good programs in place and the customer service focus is one of the best in the business.
good,A typical day in customer service is returns and exchanges. It gets extremely busy at christmas time. I learned a great deal about nearly every toy you can think of. The managers there were very friendly and helpful and co workers a great deal of fun. The hardest part of this job for me was when I couldn't answer custmor questions right away.

The management was nice, but there must've been some sort of office politics or favoritism going on because of the fact I didn't get promoted for as hard as I worked and as dependable and flexible my schedule was.  They wouldn't bump me up to full-time, so I left."

good,Fast paced environment. Heavy workload at times. Increase in hours during season. Ability to move up quickly. Can be frustrating at times when tasks are not communicated effectively.
good,Toys R Us was great company to work for. Just like all companies they had their issue and was striving to address and fix them. However the issue the company had was sales. Toys R.

good,"Seeing the faces of the kids who stepped into a Toys R Us for the 1st time was well worth it. Bringing a level of happiness into their lives were some of the perks of the job, however dealing with people who purposely take advantage of the policy and cheat the system are one of many downfall. Just because you are a consumer doesn't give you the right to treat another human being like they are below you. In the retail biz, the patience of an employee must have a high tolerance, dealing with rudeness and the mindset that the ""customer is always right"" policy really pushes your threshold."
good,I love kids and the job atmosphere was like family everyone looked out for each other and help each other out...... My boss a great leader and she got me where I'm at today driven to success
good,"The atmosphere was fast pace and the work culture was friendly. I received great joy in doing my job daily, my management team would show appreciation and that was motivation."

good,"Everyday at Toys R Us was different some day would be packed some days they weren't. It had to be one of the friendliest and fun jobs I ever had, everyone was so helpful and friendly. the managers were understanding when I couldn't work one day. My co-workers were amazing, they taught me a lot about the job and we became very close till the last day there.

good,this was one of the best Job I had there was lots of opportunities and I always felt appreciated and valued as an employee. Pay was great and it helped me see how a good business should treat employees...
good,a bit overwhelming during busy hours. learned cashier duties as well as returns. how to deal with all sorts of costumers. Great first job but didnt have many ops to advance.
good,"Come in on the floor help customers ,assist customers , stocking items on the floor that need to be put back in the right order. Meet new customers is the most enjoyable part about interacting with new people."
good,"Always felt there was a happy balance of autonomy to own your own projects with the support of management within the team if you needed it.  "
good,"for a part time job,  what they ask of you is silly,  but policy might have changed.  the people and co workers are nice, but to get to work where all people can shop and have fun was worth it."

Toys R Us was a fun place."
good,I truly enjoyed working at Toys R Us. The people and customers were the best and would not trade them in for the world. I have inquired many life skills that I will carry on in life.

good,Great place to work but the end shift having to make sure the store is clean and everything was lined up perfect or we couldn't leave until it was finish.
good,Lift heavy machinery equipment in a fast pace environment with no air conditioning. The hardest thing was working with no air conditioning while doing a 18 hour shift.
good,"Toys R Us was a fun place to work, but the pay was horrible compared to competitors. I've had some good and bad managers working there for 11 years. They did prefer to promote from within at least."
good,penso que foi uma boa empresa de trabalho. acolhe bem os empregados.
good,Toys R Us was a good company to work for and wish I was still working for the company that I work for for 30 years. i never new how hard it was to find a job until it was me looking for a job.
good,"I was with Babies R Us for over 22 years and would still be there if they were not going out of business. The team was great. Loved working there."
good,"Working at Toys R Us is a fun experience, it is a fun environment because you get to deal with toys and electronics. The hardest part of the job is the recovery of the store and the reshop. I do sales floor duties such as taking specific items to customers, stocking, organizing the floor, putting items back in their location, receiving and manifest of trucks and price coordinating. I also do cashier, customer service which is dealing with returns, phone calls, complaints and any inquiry. I was also a seasonal supervisor and I was in charge of all the sales associates duties. The management relationship with the employees was like a family relationship everyone will help each other, teach each other, if any one had a problem there was always help."
good,"make sure cashiers went to lunch on time and service desk. process audits and closings on registers. process returns or exchanges for customers, answer phones,"
good,My work days at toys r us were fun. I had the opportunity to spend time with children and help parents find a special toy. All the team members were always respectful and professional. My day consisted of answering customer questions and keeping the sales floor organized. Also of being a cashier.
good,"my typical day was based on performing my tasks quickly and efficiently although never forgetting that the customers needs would always come first, sometimes consulting with other members of staff to achieve the best possible result for the customer. The most enjoyable part of the job was dealing with customers and feeling that i had made a difference to their day. It was generally a fun workplace ."
good,A typical day for me was audit signage and print any that were missing. Then I did SFS and worked a truck and help the guest on the floor. There was always something to do.
good,"Very fast pace job. Had a great work schedule. I ran sorter for 10 of the almost 14 years i was there. I got jams, did product control producing an average of four thousand cartons an hour. I research lost cartons."
good,"You are always busy there, there is always something to do. I like the fact that the time goes by quickly because you are constantly busy. The environment wasn't bad and management was pretty nice."
good,"Great place to work, amazing team and was able to learn many key customer service skills. The job included great management and great staff. I was able to showcase my visual skills with window displays."
good,Toys R US was a type of work environment where you interact with kids and families 24/7 regardless if you are stocking the aisles or cashier. Communication skills is a must.
good,"People were ok. was pretty much a typical retail job. worked not just cashier but other positions too such as re shopping, customer service, ect. Not too bad for a first job."
good,"Loved working for TRU. To bad they are going out of business. We would have a start up meeting letting us know how many cartons we were going to process for that day, who was working in which zone then start up the sorter.."
good,"As part of being a sales assistant at Toys R Us i was trained in customer refunds and using the tills. "
good,"I've worked for toys r us for many years and am very sorry it's shutting down!"
good,Toys is now closing all stores. When I left they were going private and selling/closing a number of stores. The last years of my tenure were stressful as competitors were taking massive chunks of market share.
good,"Although my time with Toys R Us is coming to an end for reasons beyond my control, it was usually a fun company to work for. My management was fantastic and very flexible with hours, 10% discount and paid time off for all employees. The store was stressful during the holiday season but the hours and pay made it worth it in the end. Outside of season it is quieter, but you still have to be productive during the shift. Opening shifts usually consisted of unloading the truck and stocking while closing required cleaning the store and keeping it organized. Overall, I enjoyed my time with TRU and wish best of luck to all other employees."
good,"On average, my days of working at Toys R Us was pretty calm. I got along with other employees and we've worked out our motivational skills well with each other. The only time where the store was busy and full was around the holidays. During the holiday season is where the security is more intense and the pace is much quicker than average. Overall is was a great experience."
good,"With this company I learn how to work in a big box environment, learning how to work with big box financials, HR, scheduling, holidays work flow. Also work flow with big chain."
good,I started there as a seasonal cashier and worked my way up to a management position.  I have met and worked with many great people. It’s a fun place to work.
good,"It was my first job when i was 17. The job is retail, not much to it. I really loved my position as a manager cause it allowed me to really stretch my leading skills at such a young age."
good,toys r us was a great company to work at and was very understanding. I learned how to manage my time better. How to work the service center and answer business calls and look up merchandise.
good,It Was Good Job But There Wasn't Enough Hours Cause Its Wasn't The Holiday's So I Didn't Make A Bunch Of Hours But Great Place To Work I Work As A Stockers . Wasn't Really Working There Long Because I Had Found A Better Paying Job
good,"Very nice associates to work with. The work environment was very nice, fast paced never a dull moment. Management was very nice to work for, very flexible with good attitudes."
good,All stores are closing since it went into bankruptcy it was slow now it is fast paced.  I have worked there over 15 years since I enjoy the kids and adults atmosphere
good,"Toys ""R"" Us was an amazing place to work at. It was an amazingly diverse group of people to work with and the customers were always something else. It was usually pretty slow during the week but come the weekends it would always be bustling. The events held for the children were always very fun and interactive and the majority of the parents would be satisfied. The best part of the job was always making the kids happy, just to know you made their day by finding a simple dollar bin item or that one thing that was thought to never be found again, it would always put a smile on my face. Management was always very relaxed but competitive and easy to talk to."
good,"Was a great place to work for many years. Since the LBO, increased challenges to meet debt service obligations limited what we could achieve when what was needed to thwart additional competitive forces could not be fully funded."
good,"Good place to work, all the staff there are hard working and easy to approach and talk to. Managers allow freedom to work alone and think on your feet."
good,It was a great place to work except it went out of business.  Fellow associates were great to work with but far to much senior leadership over the years.  This a huge part why they failed
good,good environment
good,This is a good place to put a small amount of money in your pocket while putting yourself through but it is not a place I felt could be made into a career.
good,"I worked during the holiday season both times I worked here, and for my first job it wasn't half bad. The assignments I'd get were easy once I was familiar with them, and almost all of my coworkers were awesome to help out or hang out with during breaks or lunch."
good,"I enjoyed my time at Toys R Us, it was a good post graduation job. The hours were fine, the work was easy. It is about what you would expect from retail."
good,Guests purchasing items. I learned so much about Babies and what they need. The hardest part of the job is having issues with online orders. The most enjoyable part of the job is meeting and helping new people.
good,I was able to grow with Toys R Us for 17 years.  The company was very good to work for even though it could be stressful at times.  I'm sad to see it go.
good,"Productive - closure of entire business"
good,I loved working at toys r us. Unfortunately I had a driving accident anf had to take to much time off. They were very good with takimg the time to train people. Alsonwere very helpful if anyone had any questions.
good,"Loved working here. It had opportunity to move up as I started as a seasonal team member and moved to Department Supervisor and then Assistant Manager. "
good,"ToysRUs was a great place to work and where I spent a large portion of my career growing.  I have been with the company for 17 years and have moved around in many different positions within the organization.  It is a company that recognized talent, offered many opportunities to advance and was a flexible work environment."
good,"A day at Toys R Us consist of working out freight cleaning the store, working on projects assigned by the store manager or assistant store manager. Doing cycle count of inventory and reporting any miss counts or errors or in other words loss prevention. Engaging our guest and providing great guest service including product knowledge. Building and installing store displays and seeing to there functionality. I've learned how to merchandise as well as how to manage time, help our guest and meeting there needs, solve problems, becoming a more effective leader in giving clear directions as well as providing the necessary training our people need to become successful, arranging and hosting public events in our store. The hardest part is selling credit card promotion. The most enjoyable part of the job is helping parents make their kids happy and putting smiles on the kids face."
good,Overall i liked my coworkers and working at the store. But i felt underpaid and my manager wasnt always the best. They would mess up my availabilty or inconsiderate of my hours.
good,"I enjoyed my time at Toys R Us, starting in the morning to set everything up for the open of business was not difficult, and after open helping customers was rewarding and even fun. The managers were quick to respond to any issues, my coworkers knowledgeable about our store and in contact with one another. "
good,Toys R Us was a great place to work.  Collaborative team; very strategic.  Unfortunately the chain is liquidating stores as a result of debt.  The Apparel Division had growth and was profitable.  It is unfortunate.
good,A great company that has done a tremendous amount of great things. A company dedicated to the well-being of all children. A culture that instilled a collaborative nature in all of its associates to be the best that we could possibly be.
good,"Working at Toys R Us has been an uplifting experience, both professionally and personally. Granted there has been small strife between staff and management, but all in all its an amazing company to work for. I'm sad to see it go."
good,So sad to hear that TRU will no longer exist.  I worked for them for almost three years and heard rumors back in the mid 2000's.  Customers knew that the prices were a little higher on average.
good,Work for babies r us and toy ‘r’ us 17yr have been a pleasure sorry to see them closed .. I have worked in three different locations though out the years.. and help out at many different stores locations...
good,"Great company. Been there 12 years but with the company's possible liquidation, I am forced to look elsewhere for work. Otherwise, good work environment. Fast pace. Good teamwork"
good,Great place to work. We are allowed to grow in our position and expand our knowledge of the company objective. TRU is a great brand and has a great work life balance
good,"injoyed working there, company party, sixflags , "
good,Toys R Us is a great place to work. I enjoyed working in HR and working with the Team members.  The management staff was amazing always there for the Team members.
good,During downtime the managers will allow customer service reps to have floor/stock time. They will call them back up via walkie talkie when customers arrive.
good,I have greatly enjoyed my time at Toys R Us. The management team is friendly and hard working and so is the staff. The insentives are great if you hit Credit card and squaretrade goals.
good,The management was great. Workplace culture is very friendly and close knit. It was a positive environment to work in. The hardest part of the job was trying to keep myself busy with work and balancing it out so I would have stuff to do when the business was slow. The most enjoyable part of the job was the stand up meetings and the company parties.
good,I worked with GREAT people. GREAT managers. Very flexible schedule. Only reason I'll be leaving is because of a career advancement. Sad the company is closing so many stores.
good,The people I work with everyday are the best.  We work as a team and have fun at the same time.  Direct management are great to work for and are passionate about their work and their teams.
good,"flexible hours "
good,It was a stress and a fast-paced environment.  There is not a set schedule in which I could plan for an appointment.  The management is alright except it is very demanding.
good,"Working at a company that is all about kids. Never do they force anything on you, they always work around anything going on, and they are good with accomplishing things"
good,"A typical night at toys R us would be to clock in and meet with the managers so it would be clear on  what the job consist of that day , after ive understood my task then i would get started ..i think over night shift was fun and fast paced which made the time go faster also i enjoyed working with the overnight crew because everynody was so friendly"
good,It is fun to work in an environment that is creative and uplifting. I work around children who get to play with toys as well as parents who buy toys to help their children develop adequately.
good,a new company brought TRU and they made changes immediately. They brought in their own people and changed policies. Some were laid off with NO packages.
good,"A great learning experience.  After taking several years off to raise a family, I wanted to get back in the work force.  Toys R Us provided such an opportunity and I will always be grateful."
good,It was a good experience to learn how to relate to people and perform any task I would be asked to do. Fun place you can't go wrong being around toys all day
good,Toys R Us is usually a fun place to work. I wish some of our holidays had reduced hours or that we were closed but understand we need to be competitive with other retail establishments in our area. After working there for 16 years its more like a home away from home and several co-workers are like family now.
good,Like working here . The discount could be a lot better . The rate of pay should be the same between Babies R Us and Toys R Us. The company tries to maintain a good work and family balance .
good,Toys R Us was my very first job but I enjoyed working their because I was really able to connect with people in a children environment as well as providing good customer service.
good,"Arrive early stretch, take boxes off conveyer and place boxes on the designated pallets, then take them to the floor drop they for the freight people, repeat 5-10 an hour."
good,"I am currently working with the Toys R US Corporation but the Store that I manage is closing."
good,"the ""big box"" retailer of specialty retailers.  Anything that can be categorized as a toy will be in this store.  Usually a normal relaxed pace of sales until the week of Thanksgiving when it goes fast paced thru Christmas with shipping, merchandising and sales."
good,"As an overnight stocker, each night is pretty straightforward, show up, receive first tasks for the evening, then head back and get started. The work environment is friendly, but quick paced, no slacking. It was a pleasure to work there, and make no mistake, it is tiring! A solid experience overall, and I plan to go back again in the future if possible."
good,"Nice place to work, sometimes worked really hard during the holidays, but not atypical for retail.  Expentancy to run the store and make it in during bad weather is a bit unreasonable.  Overall good company, great pay!"
good,"Good company to work for , they respect you . They are nice to you . Management cares and they try to guide you in the right direction . I love this company ."
good,I was seasonal and it go really busy at times but I enjoyed working there. My coworkers were nice and so were the managers. Its a lot of work and there are some high standards but it's not impossible.
good,Great company to work for.  Nice people.  Enjoyed talking with the customers.  Great benefits.  Flexible schedules.  Opportunities for growth.  Location was near where I lived.
good,i made alot of friends while working at toys r us and had a blast interacting with people.the managment was good and the other co-workers were friendly.
good,Working at Toys R Us was a great learning experience. Once the season began I quickly learned to multitask. There was always something to do or someone to help.
good,"A normal day was to pick up the toys, clean up the mess the customers did everyday. I've learned how to use the register and how to greet the customers with good customer service."
good,"it was a good job. I learned a lot in the shipping and receiving area. the hours were great because it was a warehouse, not so much at the actual toys r us store. would definitely recommend their company for a job."
good,"> a typical day would consist of receiving a truck, unloading it, and working it to the sales floor before opening"
good,fun place to work over night shifts had alot of fun met alot of people really dont have much to say about this job other then it was fun to work at i was only there six months
good,It is a very fun environment. It is very team corporation heavy meaning in order for a shift to go smooth you will need to help someone or you yourself will need help. Management is very efficient when it comes to scheduling. The guests are the priority but the tea isn't thrown under the bus either.
good,I use to like working at toy r us but once seasonal came it was not good we had to put all the toys back at night and isn't leave until 3 or 4 am and the people that will leave a mess we would have to clean up they mess well they go home
good,I worked here seasonal it was great cool coworkers managers where great. It got fast t some points but was also slow at some points. I didnt like the pay as much thats why i left.
good,Good place to work while going to school. Seasonal get real extreme but fun at times. Great way to keep up with the new toys of the year and a perfect way to be ahead of Christmas gifts.
good,estupenda estar entre juguetes y los niños muy divertida
good,I learned how to pick dotcom orders and how it was processed. I was trained the order picker on the job and got certified for Toys 'R' Us. I received a raise after peak season and continued to work 8 months after.
good,"Working at ToysRUs was my favorite job , I liked stocking shelves and unloading the truck . The manager was very energized . I Did Very Well At My Job And The Shift Manager Loves The Way I work"
good,"Stock, that was mostly all I was doing all night sometimes i would go to the back and unload the trucks but I was mostly stocking the whole night....."
good,Toys R Us showed me a lot about customer service and being a sales associate. I got to interact with many people and new things. It was a cool place and I met some pretty great people.
good,"Unload trucks of inventory to be placed into temporary zones,staging zones, and floor stock"
good,Productive and a typical day and it kept you on your toes cause you were always doing something even in downtime unless you were on your break or lunch then you really didn't have much to do
good,The manager and staff was awesome to work for. My work schedule worked with my time for me to attend school. If given the opportunity I will would love to return
good,typical day at work would be turning up on shifts working the busy productive lines with our team and team leader on site also. I also done different jobs around the factory like picking and packing
good,"Working at Toys R' Us is very relaxed and smooth."
good,"for the most part good for a seasonal job, they work with your school schedule and very caring when things come up or happen. They have very good management very fast paced especially during the holidays"
good,Stocking for the Christmas season unloading trucks facing the shelves and building/re-organizing displays. Truck size and number depended on how close to the holidays the week was
good,"Provide satisfactory shopping experience to every customer."
good,I enjoyed working there. I have never worked retail and it was a good experience. I enjoyed working with the people on my shift. I would do it again for seasonal work.
good,I worked the Warehouse Customer Pickup for Large Items and transferred to working large ticket items on the floor as well as cashiering for Toys R Us for 5 years.
good,Helped Over Night crew when needed. Stocked Shelves when needed. Did re-stock when needed helped closing. Worked register and promoted the rewards card and credit card.
good,"I enjoyed working at toys r us in Fresno ca. The only thing that I could say is that You never really knew how long you were actually gonna work when you went in. Almost everytime I went to work, they would always ask me to stay longer. I never had a problem staying longer, but what I did have a problem with was they would never write it down so you just have to wait and hope that your check comes out looking right."
good,"Working at toys r us was so much fun , and everyone is so friendly and hepful. Working seasonal was a little stressful, and I worked late hours but the coworkers make up for it."
good,I enjoyed working here for the most part. When I didn't enjoy it it was mainly my fault and me just having a bad day outside of work.Everyone is kind and got along well.
good,Great place to work. Met many new individuals. Challenging and rewarding at times. Able to learn new things. Good place for a part time opportunity while in school.
good,Fun place to work a positive environment lots of caring staff along with decent hours and a very flexible work schedule which is very friendly to students and people with second jobs
good,"Toysrus is a typical retail environment that focuses on the customer experience first. Merchandising comes second to helping the guests in our store, and we try our best to make it a positive experience for everyone."
good,It's a great place to work for extra money or to just jeep business .I would go back just for my coworkers .I liked working there cause it was close to home
good,I got to meet different people. i learn to work with multiple people that have a positive attitude . my hardest part was stocking and memorizing codes
good,Working at toys r us i realized that the team ends up getting very close with each other everyone is nice and respectful and working here brings out your inner kid so you often enjoy yourself.
good,a manejar la caja registradora a tratar con los clientes
good,"Greeting customers and taking care of their needs. Cashier, signed kids up on their birthdays for coupons. Marketed for credit cards, responsible for maintain your own cash till."
good,"As i was working there, the managers where great and never had any issues with anyone. I loved helping customers and having them leave the store happy makes my dad."
good,"I have two supervisory positions (Human Resources and Front End) but I’m not one of the highest paying. Although during peak season I do have seasonal help, it not realistic for those two positions to be the same person."
good,Great Environment to Interact with others  and assist the needs of customers.Providing them with the best tools to get their day started  and keep their kids happy. Toy R' Us
good,We have everything ready to go to unload the incoming trucks. How to do back stock. Management on pace. Mix with all types of people. Working with out your team. I enjoy working as a team.
good,I had a customer service/cashier job here as my first job out of high school. Was stressful at winter time as usual for most retail job. Management at the time was not very personable and didn't really know how to handle personal issues.
good,I love working here. It gives me great experience with working with other team members. Friendly environment with a lot of respect from my peers. Never any bad vibes.
good,You would get at least 1 or 2 troubled customers. There are customers that are extremely nice and a joy to work with. They have many questions and if I do not know the answer I am more than happy to inform them that another associate are able to help them.
good,It was a fun place even new a few of the employees from old school friends. So they are a school friendly association for kids that are still in school looking for work. I honestly wish that it was more temporary instead of just a seasonal. Culture was laid back but knew what job was intended. Work was always finished at the end of the day due to hard work and good people. There wasn't anything else hard about the job it was a good place to be comfortable and what I did wasn't hard at all. Enjoyed the people very friendly and willing to help.
good,Work environment was okay.  Change of management was quite often and rules changed constantly.  Most managers did not follow company standard operating procedures.  So you had to constantly adapt to the new managers.
good,"This was a fun work environment and experience. I worked 36 hours per week as a seasonal stocker and loader and if I had the opportunity to work at toys r us again, I would."
good,"Assembled bikes non-stop at Christmas was a fun job , built bikes all day the managers were fair, one of the team leads had a bad attitude, but I didn't  let that bother me"
good,"The training was some of the best that I ever had, and the pay was really great. But when it got busy it got craze employees were always stealing and getting caught.During peak season theft management was the main problem but we handled it well."
good,"My overall experience at Toys R Us was pretty good. Management was pretty sold and the pay was decent. my only concern was the lack of training for new employees, for example when first using the cash register, they did only explained the process for only 3 minutes. as a result i struggled in the particular job duty. other than that the job was a well ran,comfortable, and a decent paying job"
good,"I mean who doesnt have a good time watching kids having fun, its a fun place where you get to play your own happa place role, just having fun is an everyday thing here."
good,"As a temporary hire, I was assigned a project with a two-month completion window, which with the help of a new hire and another temp I completed in around ten days. Our project manager, who is very dedicated to her work and the company, was excited with our pace and the ease with which we learned how to complete tasks. For the next month or so I dabbled in customer service work, such as emailing customers to follow-up on complaints or compliments, and processed credit returns. Unfortunately, my contract ended after two months with management citing a lack of work, but overall it was a great first post-collegiate work experience."
good,"My team members were like family. The only reason I left the job was because that store location closed. It can get a little crazy around Christmas, but that's when they hire more people to help out. It can be really fun, and heart warming to help parents get the perfect gift for their kids for Christmas."
good,"I worked in the babies apparel department which was very slow paced. My job was to keep the clothes neatly folded and watch out for shoplifters. I was not allowed to go to different departments, even if I was assisting customers. When the store got really busy, which it did especially during the holidays, I work walk around the store helping customers find what they needed. And stacking shelves was the worst because it seemed it was impossible to keep everything in tact at once, toys were constantly getting knocked down and placed in the wrong section. The wasn't all that great, I was paid more working at McDonalds. I was laid off due to Toys R Us going bankrupt. Overall I had a great experience"
good,"The job was stressful due the fast paced environment, Tasks needed to be done quickly before the work day was over and done with efficienc. Apart from this the managers and employees were treated well."
good,"Great place to work, its a fast paced environment, but there aren't that many hours great place to work at for the season if your looking to make extra money"
good,The hardest part of the job and unloading the truck. Th easiest part of the job is placing the items on the shelves. You have to get certain things did in a matter of time.
good,The environment was very fun and happy. It was always nice to come in and see all the smiling faces of the little kids who were there to get new toys!
good,I worked the overnight stocker position and it was a very laid back and relaxed environment to work in. We mainly unloaded trucks and stocked the shelves.
good,"Co- workers don't seem to be very driven and it is hard to advance if you are going to school, promotion wise. The store I work at is pretty relaxed and slow paced but I wish I had higher volumes of work."
good,I worked at babies r us for 5 years is was a great place to work and everyone was very nice and I in joyed  going to work everyday not sure how it is now when I was there a long time ago.
good,"I really like working at Toys R' Us. The co-workers were very helpful and polite.  The only thing that I didn't like was driving back and forth from Winnsboro, LA to Monroe, LA, which was a strain on my finances and my vehicle."
good,I am not going to lie i had fun working here met new people and worked with new people and they were amazing. The managers were amazing and always worked with my schedule. Even working at the bigger store when it came closer to the Xmas time it was fun working late hours. I had fun working there. Miss the job and environment the only thing i didnt like was the pay it couldve been better for the things we had to do. it was crazy around the holidays and having to do restock and fix the whole store for hours we couldve gotten a better pay.
good,"Fast-paced and sometimes stressful, but really fun.  Team members and management encourage each other constantly, and there is a lot of friendly competition.  The hardest part of the job is getting people to sign up for credit cards."
good,"Got a seasonal position here and it was a great experience.  The management was well established, and loose about things like listening to music and what we wore since it was night and we didn't see the public.  We mostly adjusted the aisles and made sure the toys would fit according to a guide, and what was left over.  Unloading from the truck was also common, taking down older price tags and making sure the updated prices are correctly marked, and placed.  At the end of the shift we counted the tags of boxes that we opened and placed out just to measure performance."
good,It was so long ago that I don't really remember anything about working there. I can say it was fun. The people were great. This was my first job I ever got on my own.
good,"Training can seem to be lacking, as we get so many seasonal associates at one time they start to out number the regulars.  This is a job in which you are relied on to show up and work.  People think the job is ""fun"" and don't take it seriously which only makes more work for others.  It is a fast paced environment in which teamwork is a must!  Store manager tries to work around schedules/family but it is retail so you are expected to work weekends/holidays."
good,"Toys r us was a steady job, working there was a lot fun. Very positive vibes and more to come. It was a good environment also, they treat one another in very good manners."
good,I love my job its an easy job and fun I have learned so much working with the toys r us company. The customer are very nice sometimes can become difficult but I find the perfect answer to resolve their problem
good,I got this job for the holiday season. I handled freight and stocked the store before it opened. We would need to unload the truck then organize where it all was going to in the store then unload and stock the shelves. It was hard hours and a temporary job until I moved.
good,"I worked back of house so I had many jobs to preform.  Unloading trucks, scanning products in and out, working on bikes, getting carts.  Working in BOH, you would be an extra hand if it was needed."
good,"I loved working at Toys R Us. I think that they created a positive and fun workplace by making leader boards for cashiers working hard. For example they recognized their employees with the quickest check out speed, most credit card sign ups, rewards cards, etc. Everyone worked well together to get the job done effectively."
good,I wouldn't have left but it was a bad time of year for allergies and I was sick and called off too many days during my probationary period so they had to let me go. No hard feelings though!!!
good,"If you have a good memory this is a good place to work, I could never remember where everything was. Really fast past, black Friday is stressful along with customers"
good,"Working at Toys R Us, it was a high pace environment. Having a good team helped manage and control inventory stock accuracy. The environment was well to be in."
good,"A varied day depending in customer needs and deliveries."
good,"You work the cash register and assist with returns , lay -aways , or new purchases. Sometimes you will have to help new mothers set up baby showers . At the end of the day you will put up appearl."
good,"Toys R us is a very comfortable working place, with reliable and respectable managers that will help you through out your work experience with them. I learned how to stock shelves and help with items on sale."
good,"On some days, the store have good and bad days such as from moving fast and getting stuff done and the next having suspicious events occurring. Belongings have got stolen and no one stop the robber. There was no security and if there was, the security wasn't allowed to grab, touch, or tackle them."
good,love work at toys r us. I have nothing bad to say. Great work environment. Flexible hours as i remember I was only seasonal so I was only there 3 months.
good,"Been here for about a year and a half and I do enjoy the atmosphere and my team that I work with.  I like my role and do enjoy seeing the end results of my work come to fruition in the retail environment.  The issue is that toys are a specialty item and luxury you could say and that's what makes it difficult in this on-line era of shopping to stay relevant in today's retail world.  We have brought in some new executive level people to help ""right-the-ship"".  With performance of the stores down, the year end incentives haven't been there for us employees.  But we do see some spending in areas that many employees don't feel help sales.  If leadership can turn it around, I could see my self here for many years.  But if it doesn't happen soon, I don't want to be around for the ""restructuring""."
good,"I work part time for toys r us"
good,The people there were great including managers. Had a lot of fun working there and made a lot of life long friends but also got a lot of work acomplished in short periods of time
good,"The primary task that I tended to have was help with the maintenance and appearance of the various areas that I worked in. I helped with the stock levels, customers, builds (power wheels, bikes), register coverage, and other tasks that came up. There would be a morning/overnight crew that would be the primary force behind stock levels, but some things would need to be filled outside of that. Being friendly, helpful, and accommodating will help a lot in being a good employee to customers and management. Things come up and flexibility is key. The surrounding toys help to ease the stress of the job."
good,Keeping everything neat and clean makes a big difference when a lot of customers are in the store. Keeping things organized helps a lot because you know where things are or where they should be.
good,Always wanted too actually work at toys r us and finally got too but loved every minute of it. The management was awesome and work environment  was great. Nice friendly faces everyday
good,Great co-workers positive energy. Not enough hours. Great for students or retirees. Hours pick up for the Christmas season. Great discount for employees.woking at toys r us was fun and pretty exciting from what you can expect from a toy store. it was clean and orderly and always professional. I learned about presentation and tourist attraction
good,"Ovenight work, long hours and not enough brakes. Manangers are nice and easy to get along with. i would stock fast so i would stand aroud alot with nothinh to do"
good,"it was fast pace, it was an enjoyable and great experience. a typical work day is usually running around behind customers help them get good gifts for there children. restock shelves"
good,"Solid job once you get the hang of it. Nothing beats finding that very highly sought after toy that a child has been wanting all week. Metrics are a pain in the butt, besides that it ain't half bad."
good,this was my first real job. unfortuantly it was a seasonal job. it was hard just because it was christmas time. i love seeing how happy little kids are.
good,"Worked with great people at TRU. Had three direct hire HVAC techs, an electrician and two handymen that worked to service the stores in southern California, Las Vegas and Arizona. As long as people have kids toys are going to be in demand."
good,"Fun place to work"
good,Es un gran citio donde trabajar las personas son amables y corteses. Siempre estan dispuestos a ayudar a los demas y al igual trabajan en equipo perfectamente.
good,In some areas you have to raise  or harneseed if you are afraid off height  don't accept  certain position nor operate the machines they are always braking down and it can be hot and cold
good,Put toys back where they belonged.  Cleaned work space.  Operated cash register when needed.  Helped customers find products that they were looking for
good,Great place to work and grow as a team memeber. Wanting more opportunities to get to know more ways to help others to grow and become a great team. Some departments need more opportunities for there team members to grow and helped the not just in the job but outside to.
good,"I worked at Toys R Us during my winter break home from college. The hours were long because the store stayed open until midnight of course because it was the Christmas season. The pay was ok, although it didn't cover for the amount of hours you put in."
good,working at toys r us helped my customer service skills a lot . working with kids selling toys was fun . stocking shelfs and bringing people online orders was the most important thing to do for this job
good,Working here was amazing ! I love kids so being around them and being able to help them get what they want really excited me. Seeing their faces at the register after their parent purchased the item they wanted was so cute.
good,Typical day- I come to work review metrics from previous day. I come up with a game plan and I delegate to the crew what I want done. I then task myself with a project until the store opens. Before the store opens I conduct a team huddle to communicate what is going on with the store and a company.
good,great company to work for. Learned a lot within the last 9 years I have been employed with the company. I was able to grow and become a team leader. Most of my duties include stock and cashier. Typical day at the job consist of display set up and being of help to my team when in need.
good,I went to work and stocked merchandise from back of store to sales floor. Learned about stocking highlight items properly on gondolas and race track area. Caring management. Team effort mentality when doing job.
good,it had it slows days but it was very fun my boss was a nice and understanding guy and i respect him greatly it  was a fun time and my coworkers where respectful and helpful
good,"The company as a whole is pleasant and organized. Christmas Season is hectic, just as expected. The only downfall that I perceive is it is a bit old fashioned.The younger generation is hip and happening and we should evolve to include this."
good,"This was a great job and learning experience for me but unfortunately  i did not get hired on , Yes it was a temporary job through an agency i would have loved to stay but there was no room for hire on ."
good,I enjoyed working here. I always had hours and my job duties kept me constantly busy. I enjoyed always having something to do even when it was very slow.
good,"During my time spent with TRU, I spent plenty of time in multiple departments. Everything from R-Zone, ""Big Ticket"", Service Area, & the Sales-Floor. I've always believed that the more you know, the more of an asset you are to the company. Over my years at TRU, I witnessed a great deal of change in management. I saw the company start to stop their promoting from within methods, in favor of promoting/hiring for management from outside the company. This would eventually be the main reason why I decided to leave the company. As far as the environment, I must say that it was very enjoyable for much of my time there. The hardest part for me was having the knowledge and experience, and continually being overlooked for opportunity to grow in the company. The best part for me was the fact that, it had an employee discount and pretty good benefits at that time."
good,"I was able to learn all the different areas in the store. Management options were available to me after a year of employment. I worked in the furniture department most of the time, this consisted of taking orders for customers, cleaning, rearranging, and being knowledgeable about all the products in that department."
good,"As a seasonal cashier, I did not work very long at Toys R Us, but from my experience, it's a decent job with plenty of opportunity to meet good people and to have fun. Even if you aren't crazy about kids, this is a good cashier job that isn't too different from most."
good,I enjoyed doing cleaning and wanted to work there again. They were under new management and I was unable to get another interview. My last job there was seasonal and thought I would be hired back. No one contacted me.
good,you can learn a lot about costumer service and professionalism accountability and responsibility at this place of employment. it is an awesome first job for young adults
good,Fun place to work almost everyone got along. We were so productive time would go by quick. Good pay always could be better. Nice amount of hours given and works around schedule
good,This was my perfect job that I thought I was going to retire from but they got a new GM that was all about saving money so the first thing he did was get rid of the transportation department and subhauled everything out. I was always staying busy and learning new things.
good,The directors and store managers were fantastic in what they did and made it very easy to succeed at the tasks that were asked from me. They made it feel as we had a second family and everyone wanted to put in a 100% effort
good,"I worked during Christmas break, so I knew it was gonna be fast. The amount of patience you need to have during the Christmas is extremely important. It can get extremely chaotic."
good,Es una empresa donde el ambiente es muy bueno y se preocupan por sus trabajadores
good,"Great management and honest employees. Working is made fun and engaging with customers is great. The winter season is the hardest part of the job, but with the outstanding communication between employees it has been manageable.."
good,"A typical day at Toys R' Us is usually a simple one. Go in a few hours before the store opens up and make sure that the store is properly filled with merchandise and appropriately presentable for the customers."
good,"The ToysRUs/BabiesRUs is a specialty retail company that stands apart from other big box stores, such as Target and Walmart. The company is currently focusing on creating memorable guest moments with in-store events, weekly specials and offering a customer Rewards program. Some opportunities within the company include outdated hardware/software and trying to offer products/prices similar to competitor stores. However, the company does price matching, offers a growing online order service and competitive pricing."
good,"an awesome experience to be apart of the company, I learned a lot about family products and also how to become a better salesman while providing knowledge on every product being sold"
good,"Managers are encouraging along with team members, the hardest time is around the holidays when the store gets packed. The team always get along and we write thank you posts in the break room"
good,"As a cashier, the job was to handle the money and interact with the customers, including helping them find what they needed. After closing, all the departments were organized for the next day."
good,"Its a fun job not hard at all ,relaxed place to work,most enjoyable part is interacting with the guest, from clocking in to clocking out its an easy going starting job."
good,"Great customers and great to see those smiling faces of the kids that came in an found their favorite toys. Can be a little hectic during Christmas time....especially when you run out of that ""hot toy"""
good,I worked as a cashier and i also worked behind the customer service desk. i enjoyed my coworkers and also my mangers and being able to play with the toys when it cam time to clean up
good,i typically go in and open all registers and test EAS stands. then i count down all the tills and do large cash deposits everyday. after i finish all the paperwork for the cash office i then head out to the sales floor. i greet and help every customer who has questions about products or needs any help around the store
good,Good store. A lot of hours. Good enviorment. easy to pick up. clean store. only bad thing working there is that I was there for seasonal. Overall fun place to work at.
good,Very informative company. They enhance my leadership skills and also my experience as a retailer. trainers are very good they are very proffessionals.
good,What is a topic day at work is the question that people sometimes get asked but you could only image the type of things a day at work is like. When working to start to build skills and work ethics. You start to learn how to interact with people and running into all types of different people in a day. Sometimes you have a lot of struggles in work but you build your skills off of your struggles.

good,"Reposición de los juguetes, en plena campaña de Navidad."
good,I love working around children so it was always a great day dealing and helping the children looking for a toy. They were very good to work for . They treated you with respect etc
good,I loved working here.  Though at times like any place you have to push to get things heard and done but for the most part if you could see it and prove how it would be good most times it was put in place.  Managers were great and fun to work with and worked right along side of you.
good,I was able to learn a lot of things when working here. I was able to learn different departments as well as move up in the company. you are able to get answers to your questions right away.
good,"I had a blast working with Toys'R'Us, they were able to work with my school schedule and such. I was able to work at the hours I wanted. Overall it was a great experience. I wouldn't mind working again for the season."
good,"This job can be intense, but it makes you strive for more.  It pushes you to be better than you were the day before.  There are so many resources available to you and for you in order to develop yourself and to help you along whatever journey you choose to take.  Management is always available to help you along the way as well.  The hardest part of the job is learning the processes - it is a different ballgame in regards to retail, but it is an incredible experience.  The most enjoyable part of the job is making people's days, from children of all ages to moms and dads and grandparents.  It really is a fun place to work, but it is only as fun as you make it!"
good,Thanksgiving week and December were extremely busy. Always had something to do. Never felt bored or overwhelmed. Went about a week without having anyone train me so I had to figure things out myself. Best part is seeing the smile on a customers face when they get exactly what they came for when they didn't expect to get it. worst part would have to be the upset customers that didn't get an item they where looking for.
good,I've worked here for almost a year and i've built relationships with coworkers and managers. its fun working in a toy store. you can never be bored in there because ou can play with the toys around you as long as ther is no guest in need of help
good,this company was more than 150 store around Africa and it is a big company and get more challenges at stores. the store was more customer they need more toys for childrens
good,fun place to work. management was amazing. the hardest part of my job was getting to understand the product selection and training. the job culture was amazing.

good,Absolutely an exciting place to work. Being able to work at different positions and help customers was really rewarding. Seeing children with enjoyment on their faces when walking in really made the job worth it.

good,"Learned on how to count and stock shelfs, great management willing to help out with any issue. Hardest part of the job was doing the reshop. Best part I enjoyed was working in the stockroom braking down boxes."
good,I was a cashier at Babies r us and its a retail job but waaay better than the big companies like Target where they don't care about you at all. My boss was very nice and understood I was going to school too.
good,I love the benefits of working for toys r us. The place is filled with a lot of different toys & clothes from the kids. It's not only a toy store. The workers are wonderful & make sure you had a nice visit. They make sure they can help the best they could.
good,Good managers and fun times working with customers. Warehouse is organized and easy to work and get to know the ropes. Great management and higher ups
good,"Toys R Us takes very good care of there employees, is very true to their word and are always hands on when it comes to training and providing employees with product knowledge."
good,Was alright. I found out here that 3rd shift really wasn't for me. It was nice though with nice people who worked with you and helped complete the job on time.
good,This was my most rewarding retail job during and after high school. Customers were typically patient and easy to work for. It's a nice feeling that you're helping someone create a home for their expected child. It's a very special moment when you see the parents' faces glow with excitement and you know you got to be a part of that.
good,"Mis funciones eran empaquetado en la campaña de navidad y asesoramiento de los comerciantes."
good,very busy at christmas but satisfying at the same time. didnt see management kept on your toes but great as you dnt get time to clock watch.staying awake for me as i worked nights.
good,"Serving customers"
good,"Working with this company helped me get the experience I needed. It was my first job ever, started at babies r us the got transferred to the toys r us in the Camarillo outlets."
good,the job its self if fun working with kids . the ASM is very helpful and will go out of her way to make sure you have what you need. could do better on the pay.

good,I enjoyed working here and giving the opportunity to gain a new work skill. Wonderful staff members and environment. Awesome place
good,i would if i could go back to toys r us i enjoyed the atmosphere of this place and hope that who ever works hers loves it as much as i did. i got to meet the giraffe
good,"Very calm workplace for all ages. Expecting mothers are all around, and store layout is very simple and easy to navigate. Knowledgeable staff to assist with items/baby gears."
good,The work day was typically the same thing every single day. It wasn't to hard just boring if you like different looks everyday.
good,"A great place to work, friendly associates and management team."
good,"the hardest part of the job was nothing"
good,"Accommodating management, flexible work schedule, and a great clientele made working here a pleasure. it would have better had i not been a seasonal employee"
good,It was only seasonal but it was a very fun energetic place to be a part of. I really enjoyed that they positioned you all around the store vs. sticking you in one designated position.
good,fun and efficient during the holidays management was flexible and gave the option to stay at the end of the day. hardest part was time management and Black Friday
good,The job is OK puting up with the season that's the hard part I like it because I talked to alot of people good with sale item in the store in meeting new people helping them with what they looking for there's alot about this job I can say about that makes it fun good work environment.......
good,"This was my first job ever. I was super excited when I got an interview for my first job, and a little nervous. The interview was so fast it's like it never even happened. My experience at Toy's R Us was really great. I worked only seasonal during the winter. It was very busy but that is what I love. My cowokers were nice and the managers very helpful and fun to be around. I would definitely work here again. They are great people."
good,The job was alright. I was unloading the truck and then we would place each item in a bin and then we would stock them.The job was only seasonal so it was almost 4 months.
good,This employment was seasonal so during meetings the manager would tell us where we would go and that would be the end of talking everyone was quite and none really talked the manager stayed in her office and didnt associate with people.
good,With the acceptation of not enough of the hand held devices and the printers that go with them I really enjoyed working at Toys' R' Us. The overnight management was really nice and great to work for. The work atmosphere was very friendly and enjoyable.
good,I worked in the DotCom Department we would replenish the shelves of the department. For the most part the department was organized but there were times where everything would be out of order. I enjoyed working there.
good,I always enjoyed watching the children playing in the sections with the toys out. Using their imaginations to the fullest whenever I turned around. the hardest part about that job was saying goodbye to them everyday.
good,"a typical day at work was walking into a store filled with both people and no end of work, something i like since i like to keep busy. the hardest part of the job is simply you're on your feet nonstop for hours and hours on end and you definitely feel it at the end of your shift, this is balanced out by the feeling you get when people personally thank you for helping them find the exact item they came in to find and they appear very relieved."
good,"Never had any problems with this company management great workplace clean ,jus a fun job to work hours was great hourly pay was ok could have been better"
good,Company struggling to maintain place in market place.  Constantly trying to come up with new ideas to get people in the store. Currently working with the idea of making the brick and mortar stores a place for hands on play with new toys and pushing more internet sales.
good,"Very fast paced but if you are seasonal, you will be gone before the 31st of December. Will schedule based upon application you will come in on whatever time you put on there and leave at the time you put in there"
good,"Start my shift at 10pm and help customers with any questions or request that they have.The management is a good role model on how a company should run, where there is a job that pays you to do the work that is required. The co-workers were nice and efficient to show me how to properly do my job and instruct me. The hardest part was probably the huge packages that had to be put away, but once it was done the rest was easy. The most enjoyable part was most likely that it was over-night so the nights were quiet, work made the time pass easily."
good,"Very busy during christmas season, can be stressful, coworkers are lots of fun, Customers can be rather difficult to deal with at times."
good,"Can help you balance work and personal"
good,Its fun and enjoyable if you like working hands on with people and their children.Very busy during the Holidays. The store is huge and a lot to handle sometimes. Its good to be a fast learner and have good memory so it would be easier to help the guest out if they ask for a certain item. Also must have a lot of patience towards people.
good,Organized in job duties on a daily basis duties are assigned to individuals to do separately and monitoring of the assignments to assure that job task is completed
good,Help out with online orders and stocking on the floor and help customers. Come in at 5am get out 12- 6 pm on late december for Christmas
good,Also a little difficult to remember. It was for obvious reasons a fun place to work but also had its serious side. It was also a way of getting in touch with your inner child
good,I like working here. You will be very busy during the holidays.Everyone is very friendly and nice and helpful. Management tries to help you out if you need it and are very understanding.
good,fun and productive place to work at. work almost everyday but the job security is good. you meet alot of new people and learn new social skills and how to interact with people.
good,"providing good customer service, making customers satisfied to make them come back, doing product signage's, monthly execution, doing reports, gift wrapping, receiving deliveries."

good,"Toys r us was a good but short experience for me , I wish i didn't have to quit but I had a baby and needed to finish school . They are very understanding and caring co workers there."

good,"it was a great experience"
good,"Get to meet cool coworkers, learn different techniques, have a chance to grow in the company. Black Friday and Christmas are pack completely."
good,"Stocking selves as a team, and making sure the store is ready to the public for business. Making sure price changes are done right and on time."
good,Different toy companies very helpful and decision-making hiring process easy very fun place to work customers love shopping at this particular company
good,This was a great company to work for.  The executive leadership appreciated every employee and offered them opportunities to achieve upward mobility within their careers.
good,"I have nothing bad to say about this establishment.  If the opportunity presented itself, I would gladly return to this place of business and seek to get my job back."
good,"Typical day is busy"
good,"• It slow pace but when the holidays come around put your work horse shoes on. "
good,"When I started working at Babies R Us I was just trying to find a job anywhere. Unfortunately, I was 20 years old at the time and was kind of uncomfortable with the products and services. Overall the company was very kind, I just wasn't ready for that kind of job at the time."
good,"I traveled throughout the country and remodeled and built new stores. I learned about time management, training 50+ employees and getting the most production out of each one. The most enjoyable part of the job was getting to see different parts of the country."
good,"Every day as soon as I clocked in I started counting the money from the day before, pull the tapes from each register and reconciled each register.  If any thing was off or miss I'd have to look and find.  Do write ups on each cashier (good or bad).  Then I would train any new cashiers or relieve the girls at the refund desk (breaks & lunches) and cashiers as long as I didn't have any new hires for orientation."
good,I very much enjoyed working for this company. Even more so during the holidays. The management was strong I would work here again .
good,You get to interact with children and get the toy of their dreams. I have learned to get more productivity from less payroll. Pay is on the lower end of retail spectrum
good,"Cashier"
good,"A lot of positive attitudes, they are all kind and a lot of hard workers. I did the cashier and it was not bad at all even if it was pretty difficult at first but then I got used to jt"
good,"A normal day at Toys R Us was decent. No confusing, fair communication, great team work and effort. Goals met daily. "
good,"I really enjoyed working at Toys 'R' Us. It was a learning experience, that I'm grateful of experiencing. It was definitely hectic at times, but very organized."
good,"I love my job for multiple reasons. One reason I love my job is because I get to interact with the mothers and the child(ren). Secondly, I love watching satisfied customers. Watching the customers leave with a smile one their face makes me happy. Thirdly, I get to watch the new mothers throughout her whole pregnancy. When the child is born I get to meet a precious face. At times I come across rude customers but being around so many kids it can't possibly ruin my day. The management there is great. Dream work makes the team work. I love the staff there. You can never go wrong with working in a baby or toy store."
good,"A typical day at work for me, would be at the service desk, taking care of customers who most likely have complaints.  So I've learned how to use my critical thinking skills and problem solving skills to good use.  Management was very professional, and always did a good job of recognizing their employees for any good deed they did.  My coworkers were all very friendly and fun to work with, making working well with others no problem for me.  The hardest part of my job was working around the holidays.  Certain toys would be in high demand and we cannot accommodate every single customer that walks into our store , which would make it very sad on our part, but still having to find a way to keep the customer satisfied was also hard.   The most enjoyable part of my job was being able to provide excellent customer service to our guests and also bringing a positive vibe to the work environment."
good,"I enjoyed being a salesmen and working as a cashier, however, i did not like that the management, which  was not organized. The schedules that were given to us were very confusing. however i love helping people so the customers drove me to work every day including my coworkers."
good,"Overall the job was nice and was a fun and helpful environment for all, was just a genuinely good place to work as a whole, Management were good people, for the most part all were helpful and respectful. Co workers just about the same as management. The hardest part of the job was maintaining balance in my work load because i did a little of everything in the store."
good,"customers are number one "
good,I really enjoyed working at Toys R Us it was fun and I got to meet a lot of new faces and greet customers with a smile everyday.
good,"Itsa a cool job largeamount of work."

good,very fun to work at if you love playing with toys. very fast paced and you are always busy especially on the weekends. you meet great people and customers with stories about their old favorite toys
good,While working at Toys R Us I learned a lot of things. The co-workers were very nice a always willing to lend a helping hand when needed. The managers were really nice too.
good,the manager is wonderful. kids and parents playing with toys the joy on the kids faces is priceless when they see a new toy that they just have to have.
good,"I enjoyed working for Toys R Us. The hours were flexible, there were positive people to work around and people would always willing to help you if you needed it. Being able to help customer could be a challenge at times but was rewarding.  It was definitely a rewarding experience and was worth learning."
good,"I have worked in just about every department and I would not mind working as a cashier there, or customer service. The management is quite nice and respectful, plus you learn how the company works and interact with the lovely little children (before they make a mess that is with the toys)."
good,"i loved working at toys r us , the environment and staff are great , i was usually on all floors  moving merchandise and helping customers"
good,"had fun conversing with children and their guardian, provided awesome level of customer service and unmatched dependability and my customers gave me a rave revew"
good,Displaying all of the new toys and or games to the children. Other times I attend the cashier wok area. I learned how to be more organize and a team worker. I loved mo co-workers and managers.
good,"If you've never worked retail, it is very hard work. But you learn to push through and give your best with a smile on your face."
good,"I would get there before the store would open because my job was to count the safe and take care of the registers for the day. When I was done with that I would stock shelves until the store opened, then I would go to customer service and work there. It was a very open community and the people were very close to each other. I had to learn a lot in very little time so remembering everything was a lot but I enjoyed the challenge. Once I understood how to do everything, the job became more enjoyable."

The most enjoyable part of the job was interacting with the customers and seeing the kids happy when there parents bought them a toy."
good,"My experience working at this Toys R Us has been, for the most part, very rewarding. Each and every Supervisor comes into the store with a bright personality and a ""can-do"" attitude that gives the rest of us the will power to take on any challenge that may come with the day. They ensure that every employee is trained in anything that he/she feels comfortable doing, and they will go out of their way is there is anything that a person is struggling on. It's a wonderful group of people to work with"
good,Enjoyed working for toys r us for two seasonals. Place was packed but made the time go by fast. Great place to work seasonal.
good,"I loved working here. It was relaxing and very knowledgeable. I learned more about babies. Working the floor, organizing things was a typical thing for me."
good,Great place if you want to be around customers all day. Got a lot of joy with helping the children with toys and bikes and the video games.
good,"•	Fast paced work environment"
good,As a Sales Clerk you are responsible to assist the customer and proper display of your items. Receive and double check the delivery items.
good,"On a typical day, i would help customers with any questions they had regarding a product. i would help them find the best product that suited their needs as well as explain the functions of the product they were interested in. both my co-workers and management were friendly and made the work place a lot of fun. the hardest part of the job was helping difficult customers when we didn't have a product in stock. however, the best part was seeing the smile on a customer's face when they were able to find exactly what they were looking for."
good,"Good environment good people, awesome management. The most enjoyable part of the day was just seeing all the people. The hardest part of the job is having to say good-bye. It is a fun job but it also a serious job in that you have to take care of business and can't have just all fun."
good,enjoyed working for the company a great place to grow plenty of challenges especially working during the holiday season co workers where a great help when i first started working the management worked with me
good,"Great place love working here no issues found while working here."
good,Daily routine starts off  with a shift meeting and morning  stretch's and the numbers we are expected to do for the day. Also any training and meetings that have to be attended by their  mmbers.
good,i enjoyed my time working for this company although it was brief i gained much experienced leading a young staff . most of our staff were minors and this being their first job most of them were really eager to excel and learn .
good,"Un día típico, llegando puntual 6:00 am. , llegó camión todos en zona de embarque descargando cajas respectivamente niñas. niños, uoi, babys, pared de juegos, preescolar, peluches y llevando a donde corresponda , cuando terminamos de descargar el camión ya en nuestra zona de trabajo poner el producto donde corresponde, yo era sección niñas empiezo con Nenuco, reponer los artículos en su lugar e implantar los nuevos hasta que la sección este llena y ordenada después me iba a Nancy , Barbie, Monster high y lo mismo que Nenuco. lo que aprendí en el orden como se pone los artículos era en forma lineal, teníamos apoyo de la dirección en la forma de como cambiar genero por otro por cambios de precios o semana negra, con los colegas trato cordial y agradable, la parte mas difícil era, que con la rapidez que teníamos que hacer el trabajo al poner en linea los productos teníamos que pensar como hacer para que entre de izquierda a derecha los productos bien sin sobrar espacios y saber definir tamaños que coincidan de principio a fin y lo que mas me gusto es que es una experiencia que se debe valorar  por que llega a cansar en el sentido de estar moviéndote a cada rato y sin para es decir es un sin parar."
good,"It took a little longer for me to get going than it should have, ans as a first job it was all to be expected, but as a first job it was an excellent experience. I had a plethora of duties to keep me busy from the beginning of the shift often to long after my shift had ended. After the first few hours of unloading the truck and moving all of the merchandise to the sales floor we, as a team, spent the majority of our nights finding what could and could not be fit onto the shelves and where--it was like solving a new jigsaw puzzle every night--and at the end of the night everything that could not be fit on the shelves was then sent back to the storeroom and dealt with in a nearly identical fashion as the sales floor merchandise: stocked away like pieces to another puzzle, with the additional step of scanning it all into a computerized inventory. All-in-all it was a fun job and I'm saddened to see it go so soon with the season and hope to find another or even return to it soon."
good,Managers are ok and associates are friendly and are always there to help. They are flexible with hours and work around your schedule.
good,"My day started at 10 pm and for the most part end at 8 am the work was not easy, unloading trucks and merchandising the floor, also making sure that the team had everything they need to do their jobs. On the night shift there was no management to oversee our jobs. I was in charge of a crew of 30 team members. The best part of the night was in the morning being able to tell the crew that we did a great job. When you can walk out the door with a smile on your face knowing that every one worked very hard and we all did it as a team and got the job done 100 per cent  is a great day."
good,Toys r us is a great place many great people it great helping kid find what they want and seeing them so happy during holiday season it gets rough when people are mad you dont have the toy they are looking for but shifts fly by based on there is always something to do

good,"A typical work day involved Customer service, cash handling, restocking."
good,Being in high school this was one of my very first jobs. It taught me a lot about the retail world. I learn alot about working with the public and balancing life with work and school.
good,"Having only worked for the winter season, I feel that the job was perfectly fine. The management was alright and the employees were a joy to work with."

good,I enjoyed my time at Babies R Us. I was promoted a few times within the company at a very quick pace. My co-workers are like my family. There is no typical day in our store. Each day is a new day.
good,"I enjoyed my time at Toys ""R"" Us allot. It's how I was able to continue down the retail work field. I couldn't have learned what I know now without Toys ""R"" Us."
good,toys r us was a relaxing stress free place to work at with fun co-workers. best part were during the holidays when the parents or grandparents try to find the best present for their children or grandkids
good,"I been working retail since I was 16 so it pretty much all the same; Check-out, greet the customers, keep area clear and keep merchandise replenish. At Toys R Us I  learned how to deal with more kids then adults and all the different type toys alone with baby products. The hardest part about working here was dealing with thousands of customers yelling for help and checking out long line during the holidays but I got the hang of it and willing to do it all over again. Lol. The most enjoyable part about the job is see and working around toys. It put you in a happy place and remind you of your child-hood."
good,"Fun atmosphere, great people to work for, love my job, had to relocate and there was no job openings. Would definitely work for them again."

good,"I enjoyed being responsible for all activities related to merchandise safekeeping. I was able to work with great staff and also our local law enforcement. Although, this line of work can be a bit challenging I was happy to come to work every day."
good,I loved working for TOYS great work environment and great management. The hours were a little low but overall and good time.
good,"This place has truly thought me to really just organize my life and it out life into perspective.  It truly has changed my life for the better, also showed me what I was capable of."
good,I learned more on how to lead my team to make sure projects got done on time. Management were people i really wanted to work for and was sad to leave. they really helped me to move forward in the company.
good,"A typical day at work involved welcoming guests, working at customer service and organizing the store. The most enjoyable part of the job was interacting with the kids whose parents came to shop at the store. The hardest part of the job to me was when there was nothing to do at all but just stand there and wait for customers"
good,"Everyday was a different adventure here! I worked for a manager that believed in me and built a staff, that unlike any other employer, became a family. I was allowed to move in-between different departments that required vastly different product knowledge, so I was never bored!"
good,"A typical day at work is fun and enjoyable, very fast pasted and busy day. Helping customer to the best of my ability.Working at Babies R Us i learned that the customer is always right."
good,A day at work is always a rush because there is always a lot of customers. I learned how to do fast transactions. The managers are helpful when they are needed and the co-workers are helpful to. The hardest part of the job is dealing with customers who don't understand English and the most enjoyable part of the job is being around a positive environment.
good,"I enjoyed everything about this job except for the long hours about holidays but I loved the pay. The experience working here taught me team work and the ability to work under a time frame. Helping customers find the items that they are looking for was the highlight of working on the floor. I started out working the inventory when it came in, but with determination I made it up to customer service."
good,"I was in the backroom working stock."
good,Toys R Us is very cool to work for you see and meet many people. I worked around Christmas and Black Friday do there was many sales you could get and very busy. I also worked the cash register so you have to deal with many people. The mangers always thought about your feelings first but always made sure the consumer got what they wanted. I would love to work for them again.
good,"Have to restock the shelf with product specially items on sale. Make sure your department is clean, tidy and things are put back in order. Always make eye contact and a smile. Make sure the customer leave your store  with a desire to come back in the future."
good,"Good place to work, can be stressful around the holidays but for the most part a fair company to work for. A normal day can include helping guests that come into the store, or working out freight from a truck. I have become much better at customer service with my experiences working here and the management is fair and will work with you with hours."
good,Job was always laid out ready to go and so where the employees. Everyday I learned something new and everyday I came to work and left work happy.
good,First job I ever had. The people were nice but it was a minimum wage job and you do a lot of standing. Christmas is awful and mothers are crazy.
good,Great customer service experience. Job experience allows you the opportunity to test your customer service skills and your patience.  Remembering Service with a smile and customer comes first were my number one thought each day.
good,"summary says it all, it was always fun and something new going on. everyday there was new cool event happening, or celebrities coming to the store to shop. would have loved to stay longer,"
good,"the management was really good . great work place,liked working there.the most enjoyable part of the job is working for the website"
good,"I worked in the backroom and I unloaded trucks and, pulled orders for people. I loved working in the backroom and being allowed to do my job."
good,"Working at Toys was fun. I love children have a son of my own. Love building things up and serving customers, a basic day required constant maintenance of the store because kids pick things up and place them in wrong isles. Filling personal orders to get ready for pick up, carrying cribs, bed sets, and Toy cars out for customers. However the worst part would be close because yeah the store closes at 9 but we still have to make it presentable for the next day, so usually we would stay a hr and a half past close. That never really bothered me though."
good,I have had the pleasure of working for Toys R Us for 24 years and would recommend it to anyone. It is a great company that will be around forever. The people who work here are like family.
good,"From the moment I clock in at Toys R Us, the work begins. I usually grab a walkie talkie, grab my productivity sheet, and turn on the light at my assigned register. Whenever a customer approaches, I will greet them with a smile and ask about their experience so far. Next, I go through my required questions: Would you like to join our rewards program or sign up for a credit card? Are any of these items on a wish list or registry? Could I interest you in a buyer protection plan or some batteries? After the customer pays, I finish bagging, hand them their receipt, and send them off with a smile or a wave. In between customers, I will clean up my cubicle and straighten some nearby aisles. The managers will walk around a few times a day to check on what the team members have been up to. Sometimes I will be at the customer service desk where we handle returns, questions, and complaints. If I am working a closing shift then I will spend about an hour or two cleaning up the store by putting items back into their places. One thing I love about Toys R Us is my co-workers because they are very friendly and helpful. The hardest part of the job is dealing with customers who get angry about prices, coupons that do not work, and those who are in a rush. However, the most enjoyable part is seeing a happy customer."
good,I enjoyed my time at Toys R Us. The staff was very nice and the employees and customers were very nice also. I always enjoyed coming to work and the work days!
good,"It was my first job, so I will always remember that, and by being apart of their team, I have learned a lot about what retail employees  have to deal with on a daily basis. For me, the best part about working at ToysRUs are the kids. There are funny ones, loud ones, mean ones, annoying ones ... they all act differently. That is what entertained me when I was there. As for my worst part of the job, is to have to deal with angry parents that cannot find the toy that they want. Sometimes it is just hard to calm them down. Yet again, I was working during the season."
good,I enjoyed giving a great customer experience. Worked some pretty consistent hours and they start you off higher than minimum wage. Everybody is assigned to a section which kept the store running smoothly. I suggest this work experience to anyone.
good,"I love working for Babies R Us, i wish the pay was higher but its retail so the pay is what you would expect for a minimum wage job.  the people i work with are great and they are like family. I have been with the company for a number of years i have seen people come and go, but i have also noticed that a lot of people stay for the long haul.  and also many times when people leave they often come back down the road."
good,We clocked in at 10:00 throw the truck divide truck into proper departments take it out to the sales floor once that was done we worl begin to stock the shelves till an hour before we got off and put left over product up in the proper place in the stock room

good,"Dealing with customers, learning good quality customer service skills."
good,"I loved working here! Wish it wasn't seasonal. Had a fun time fixing aisles and rearranging them, working with kids, and learning different areas. Kids weren't the obnoxious ones-- it was the parents! So incredibly rude. Co-workers and management was awesome and friendly. Would recommend for a first job!"
good,"This was kind of fun for what it was worth. This over night job was better than most. the would feed us and play games afterwards. The managers were wonderful, always there to help."
good,Always enjoyed going into work and management was caring. Only thing I didn't care for was when the big bosses came in and told us we will being closing doors in 2 weeks and we wont have a job

good,It was fun to work there. I loved seeing the children's happy faces when they got a toy they wanted. Customers can get unruly especially during the holiday seasons.
good,Our store management is the best. A great display of team work. Very positive attitude. While their I moved further away and Manager worked with to bring me in earlier . to avoid the traffic rush. That helped me to decide to stay their and  drive the distance.
good,"I really loved working here. I loved the atmosphere. Being able to help parents and kids alike to find that ""right"" toy/game for them was just the best feeling. Too bad my position was only a Seasonal one"
good,"Generally its a pretty easy job. unload trucks, make sure the shelves are well stocked and occasionally work with customers. not really much to it and in general its smooth sailing with the exception of Christmas season. the only unfortunate part is the pay isn't quite the best. good for a part time job for someone that needs a starter job such as someone out of high school or early into college."

good,"organización, compañerismo, limpieza, dinamismo, actividad"
good,Solid company to work for. I have learned a lot and continue to be challenged. Management is transparent and keeps employees informed. Casual dress is a plus. Large corporation with lots of politics and rules. That can be good and bad depends on what you make of it. Very family friendly company.
good,liked working for this company wish they wouldn't have went out of business.
good,"My typical day would be finding my zone, asking customers if they need help finding an item, help them find the item, keep my area as neat as possible while helping the customers and also remember when to take breaks and/or lunch."
good,"We would unload merchandise from trucks and separate it according to the sections in the store. I learned how to communicate effectively with others in spite of our differences. The management team was awesome. They were their to help in all areas whether it was a question about a task or about the schedule. They were very flexible and easy to talk to. The hardest part of the job was completing all tasks by a certain time, I am a very organized person and like to take on more tasks then I may be able to handle, but who doesn't love hard work and overtime! I enjoyed working at a toy store with a great team overall which made it an even more fun environment to be in!"
good,"A typical day consist of either stocking, helping customers on the floor, or even working the cash register. I learned that the customer is always right. I also learned how to work a store gun how to get larraways for customers. All my co-workers were very helpful and patient with me. The hardest part of my job was if a customer came to my store and needed help ordering something online. The best part of my job was my work environment. I'm surrounded by toys all day reminding me of my childhood."

good,"Great family atmosphere propagated by employees dedication to children and products to enhance their lives."

good,well toys R Us is a really good place to work the pay me 12 dollar a hour and i was a turret driver the thing is that i could stay there because it was a season job. so they give me lay off. in my review is a great area to work a lot of friendly people there that help you understand the job.
good,"Mi puesto era estar en caja, aunque alguna vez también ayudaba en tienda a buscar a los cliente algún juguete que no encontraban y mostrárselo"

good,"A typical day at this job I would be busy, everyday I would start on a whatever task needed to be done that day. I learned about retail and what there is to it. A specific task i learned how to do is categorize the merchandise. The manager was very nice and was willing to teach me any skills I needed. The co-workers over all were extremely friendly and welcoming. The most energy draining part of the job was unloading the truck with new merchandise. Over all I would say I enjoyed going into work everyday."
good,"I absolutely loved this job, and would had gladly accepted full time had it ever been offered, but not a single seasonal employee was hired at the end of our service."

The hardest part of the was the different areas of stocking. The most enjoyable part was helping the people pick out the right merchandise to get.
good,"Simple work with an emphasis on customer service. Work times vary by week and team member availability which makes it easier for students to work here. Advancement is possible, though the pay raises are apparently not very worth the extra work load. The management team in-store is fantastic, helpful, and fair. The corporate offices do what they believe they have to do in order to stay competitive which can make for tedious and copious work for the basic employees. The best part about this job is being able to assist all the new parents-to-be pick out the items on their registries. It is a very positive experience that creates many lasting relationships."

good,"i like the fact that you ge not only to engage parents, but this is where a child can be a child and not get into any trouble. So i love the fact that we get to see kids play and also play along with them."
good,I enjoy the job. I meet a lot of people. It has slowed down since the holidays.
good,"Work as always busy. If we had no customers, we were either cleaned or restocked. Every employee was as helpful as they could possibly be with the customers."
good,Fun place to work especially during the Xmas season.  Very busy but overall great co-workers and management team.
good,Great place to work. Employees are nice. very welcoming environment. The customer's are kinda rude other than that it's great
good,"I always used to look forward to a shift here, I learnt a lot of things from the people that worked there and the management were very friendly and knew how to handle problems. All my co-workers were very welcoming and we are all still in touch. The hardest part about my job was travelling, but I always managed to get there on time. I don't have a most enjoyable part because I enjoyed it all the same, it was a very enjoyable place to work."
good,"I had fun working there on the average day I worked in the Electronics section helping customers make decisions on devices. I learned how to work cash  registers, worked  on opening and closing shifts. At the end of our shifts if closing we would straighten and clean the store before leaving. I enjoyed working with fellow coworkers near my age, and helping children and their parents find the toys or games they were searching  for."
good,I started as a seasonal hire in late October and although they didn't have time to officially train me before the holiday rush the managers and supervisors continuously checked up with me to make sure everything was going well and if I needed help with anything.
good,I loved my position. I was given a task list by my store manager. I would complete my tasks and help other employees if they needed it.
good,First off your working in a toy store.  Everyone who works there is very friendly.  Before you know it your day is over and it doesn't feel like just worked 8 hours.
good,This place is always busy especially around the holiday season! But the people I worked here with always made sure it was a fun time. We would make sure to get our work done but we would enjoy it. My managers were easy to get along with. The hardest part of the job would have to be when we had to stay very late to make sure the store was straightened to perfection after customers had done their holiday shopping.
good,"Typical day at work, the worker stock shelf or .straightening out products on the shelfs.Customer Service,worker would help customer to find the products and explain the facts about the product. Cashier, worker close sale by being a cashier."
good,Great place to work. Even being an adult the store and members still brings the kiddy side out of you.
good,Great place to work. The people are great and the job is great.
good,This was a little side job for me to earn a little extra money. The job itself was easy. The pay wasn't that great but it did help out. The people were awesome.
good,"A typical day at this job was u clocked in and got straight to work. you would make sure u had all your things to get your day started. vest , walkie talkie and etc. What I learned at this job was how to get an age order out and packed out at a fast pace. I feel I had fair management. I had wonderful co workers for sure I loved them all. The hardest part of the job to me was me training a new member when I barely knew what to do myself , but I got it done. the most enjoyable was seeing my co-workers"
good,"Customer service, Cash handling, recruiting, weekly scheduling, store budgets, sale projects, weekly conferences, employee training per department"
good,When coming into work you know what the standards and goals are for the day. You also clearly know what you are to be doing. Management guides you with projects and helps with improving your job performance when or if needed. Its fun but can be a slow during our slow seasons. You work in a toy store where parents and grandparents alike might need your help with an idea for a toy.
good,Each day is different and challenging. The co-workers are very supportive.
good,I learn a lot about team work and leadership. A typical day at work is to help any customer that come in and make sure there experience is there best one and letting them leave happy. The co-workers are friendly and very helpful. hardest part of the job is just the holiday since we are very busy. everyday is enjoyable.
good,"Works good for a second job, flexible hours and you get discount"

good,"A typical day at work were to manage sales, supervised employees.I learned how to develop excellent customer service skills. My co-workers were a joy to work with. I can not really say there was a hard part of the job. The most enjoyable part was the interaction with the children."
good,This place was nice to work for they let you make your own schedule if you go to school. Very busy during the holidays great time to pick up hours.
good,"A typical day at work consists of checking guests out, cleaning and straightening the store, stocking register lanes and pepsi cooler, taking phone calls, helping guest scan items for wish and baby registries, answering phone calls, and taking returns.  The hardest part of my job is having to work the day after Thanksgiving it is a very exhausting and stressful day.  I love being able to see the smiles on kids faces."
good,"I loved working here. I had a set schedule that would sometimes move around but that was okay. My training for the position was very thorough, and I learned a lot from it. The job entitled me to use my brain and not get orders wrong. Management was very easy going and friendly but stern when needed. The team all worked efficiently together."
good,"never a dull moment, enjoyed being able to put smiles on children and parents faces by the littlest things such as ordering a product that was not in store"
good,The only problem i had was trying to advance. Friends of management always seemed to get to choice. Other than that it was nice. Good overtime during peak season. Nice people. I only left going to find better advancement opportunities. I would work there again.
good,"A typical Toys R Us day involved a lot of guest interaction, especially during the holiday season. When there weren't any guests in the store to be helped, there was housekeeping to be done to keep the store presentable and easy to shop."
good,funnest place to work and great people to work with. i would go back
good,"La formación que recibí de Toys ""r"" us y lo que aprendí de mí esfuerzo me sirvieron para enfrentarme a la vida laboral con suma seguridad."

good,"I opened the store when it came to Chico.  I started as a Department Head supervising 10 employees."
good,Staying on task without a direct supervisor is a job for a driven go getter.  Faced paced environment that is always changing.
good,It was a test run in a new position before you commit to a higher position.  I learned all new tasks during this time.
good,The most enjoyable part of this job was interacting with all of the children.
good,"On my morning shifts the opener is always on time and very friendly. Me and my associates unload the truck and sometimes the truck is full and sometimes its not. The days are great and for a first job its not a bad job. I have learned how to work with what you have and to working in very small spaces. Also, how to work as a team and when things are tough don't give up. my managers always loved that i was submitted and for that they always treated me with respect as i treated them. As I worked there I have seen plenty of co-workers come and go. The co-workers that are there are committed and work hard. the worst part about the job is that the back room is small and you don't always have room. The best part about the is that you always can count on it being a positive atmosphere."
good,I loved seeing how excited children were to get their toys they wanted.
good,"A day at Toys R Us was repetitive at times but, on occasion, would get the chance to help the mechanics preform maintenance on the tractors and trailer."

good,Interact with children and adults.  Fun environment; limited hours during off season.
good,"Pretty easy, could be slow and boring at times but during holiday very busy and active."
good,"I was a sales floor associate, able to work at register or on the floor in all departments including electronics and video games. Keeping an always current and insightful list of products to suggest to guests. Working BOH (Back of House) was also enjoyable, being in charge of stocking and assisting pick-up orders. But the best aspect of my Toys-R-Us experience was being promoted to Customer Service and Front End Supervisor. The ability to handle guest inquiries and complaints, answering the phone and managing the opening, closing and balancing of registers to ensure everything was in good running order. "
good,"Worked the off hours. The other employees were fun, helpful, and while during the frustrating moments the productivity didn't decrease. "
good,I enjoyed working with people and helping customers. My co-workers were awesome.
good,"I was a cashier, worked in the front end,stocking, helped wherever i was needed. Most enjoyable thing about the job was when I was able to help a parent with a toy they were finding and knowing exactly what they needed. "
good,"Working for this company is one of the best jobs iv held ever since working for this company 2010-2011 everything was perfect good people great atmosphere and flexible schedule i wish i could land a job again with this company. I learned how to function in a team and sell products the management was VERY supportive and encouraging the best thing i enjoyed about this job was looking at all the toys "
good,Nice staff just do our assigned job.  Work at your on paste alone or in a team
good,"Your typical work day changes as quickly and product changes in the world.  This is a fast-paced work environment with knowledgeable staff, developmental programs, and plenty of room for advancement."
good,productive and cool workplace it was very easy to be happy to go to work I liked working overnight the people where nice and I was able to work hard and get rewarded for it 
good,"I enjoyed my time, I feel as I would have been hired for a part time position, it's just the area and Toys R Us doesn't receive much business until November. Management were understanding that I was going to be late once because of the distance from school to the store. "
good,A typical work day was a eight hour shift that would consist of helping customers find what they need or help advise the customer on what they should buy. Also every once in a while would have to answer a phone call and do the same with helping a customer find what they mean. The co-workers where all extremely nice people willing to help each other as much as they could. 
good,"Great place to work, sometimes fun. There are a variety of things to learn and do so you never get bored."
good,"Management was nice to me, and actually respected me. I was expecting at least one of the bosses to work me, which comes with developing a team member, but I didn't see any discipline. I guess I did well."
good,I LOVED WORKING THERE. i love being around the kids and did a great at picking out gifts for kids i didnt know
good,"Making a customer happy during the holidays isn't the easiest thing you can do, but I sure did!! This lady was looking and looking and looking for a toy, finally she asked me for some help (I was a cashier, she saw me walking back to my register from break) and I found her the toy she had been looking for!!! She told my manager that I deserve a raise."
good,"Late night job is great"

good,"It's a nice place to work good if its your first job it(a good way to get experience) has a lot of good values and job security,"
good,"I worked here as a second job. Great place, management was very good too."
good,"Worked at front desk, dealt with customers and hotel bookings, also took care of bill payments"
good,"A typical day at work consisted of my manager instructing me on what to do and how to go about it in the best way. I would either stock shelves, put stock away, price and tag items, take phone call inquiries or work at the registers. I would learn something new everyday. Different skills and how to do a certain job in different ways. Management was nice and friendly, easy to talk to about anything job related. Co-workers are all bright and friendly people who are willing to lend a hand when needed. The hardest part of the job would have been only getting one four hour shift a week because too many people have been employed. So its hard when you need money to pay off a lot of things and have heaps of time to work but you're not getting harly any shifts. The most enjoyable part of the job would be working with co-workers instead of by yourself. The job gets done quicker and you enjoy what you do because your working together with your buddies."
good,I just worked here as seasonal cashier. If you want to move with compant I suggest you do really good on your job.
good,"If you can work Xmas at TRU you can work anywhere. Great company to work for. They give benefits like sick pay and vacation to PT associates. Stress filled for about three months out of the year, but I've never regretted it."
good,I loved working with the children that would come in the store. They were always so excited and it just put a smile on my face every time.
good,This was a great place to work around Christmas time. The energy in the store put forth by my coworkers and managers kept me motivated as well as helping the many people that came in to shop. The hardest part of the job of course is near Christmas time when a ton of people are doing last minute shopping. Restocking inventory while helping people out was a bit tough but did not bother me at all.
good,"I'm a very positive person and my works also very positive. The people I work with are very nice and they make me laugh a lot. It will be sad to leave them behind, but I need to look out for myself."
good,"Typical day in retail..I manage 25 associates in their various job titles and capacities. Priorities shift daily depending on company goals and or needs of the business. I find each day challenging, exciting and rewarding to see the smiles on mom' face when I find just what they are looking for. The job can sometimes be frustrating and of course the holidays are interesting! I have learned over the years that everyone can excel at something and my goal as a manager is to use that talent to achieve the goals of the company. During my years in management I have managed a team as small as 8 associates up to 120 associates and one theme is constant-at the end of the day the work has to get done, I never ask anyone to do something that I am not willing to do."
good,enjoyed the holiday season schedules were efficient management fair and prompt with resolving concerns very good with handling personal matters .
good,"Great Job, Unloading trucks everyday with merchandise too bad it was only seasonal though wish they would have kept me long term"
good,I enjoy working with people it really brightens my day to help others.The great thing about working for toys R Us? Babies R Us is getting to be around all the smiling faces.Even if you are having a bad day they make you smile.
good,Management was good as long as you did your job.
good,I really enjoyed working around the customers and kids. My employees were easy to get along with and very outgoing. The management team were always understanding and outgoing for the people working for them. I would say the hardest part of the job was the week before christmas when everyone was last minute shopping and picking up layaways
good,"Go help customers , Cashier, Stock, I learned alot, Menagement was great, My co-workers were great, hardest park was leaving, most enjoyable was the people."
good,I have worked for Toys R US for three years. During that time I have learned and relearned skill of cashiers and customer service. I enjoy working with all sorts of customers from children and mothers- to- be
good,"Starting at 6am after being issued a work area I would go locate palets label merchandise and throw it on to a line to be relocated in the warehouse, throwing up to 300 boxes every two hours. This job taught me that theres a job for every team and that every job is as important as every body elses. I actually had different co-workers every day and the only friend was my boss. The hardest part of my job there was meeting the the daily goals when we lacked personnel. Overral I really enjoyed having a fast past work area in which we haven't had to worry about making mistakes, it was just handling boxes."
good,I would have my own section of toys to keep filled.I would have to go to the wear house and pick the toys if i needed them.help customers face to face whit what ever they wonted.I loved working in retail and being face to face whit the customers.
good,Learned to manage customers.
good,"seeing kids all day, ringing people out but very friendly place with great management"
good,"A typical day at work especially during the holiday months was extremely busy, we would have sapphires which are little guns that tell you how much a product is and where you find the toys if were out in the back. I would constantly be running up and down the the store helping customers, filing out FGO's which are fill guess orders, that means they ordered the product online and we have to get it ready so when they come in to the store its ready for them. I had to go outside to our conex boxes which had power wheels, play kitchens pretty much anything that is big that cant be stored in the back of the warehouse. My co workers made it fun and easy because we would joke but still get the job done and it helped with not having to do everything at once. The best part of the job would have to be seeing the customers leaving happy with the products they wanted. I learned how to be patient with customers and how to make conversations good by simply asking how they are doing."
good,Fun environment with good management in place. Advancement opportunities are limited at times.
good,"count register,made sure back room was stocked worked drive thru"
good,It is a good enviornment. The employees can indentify and help with customer needs.
good,I had alot of fun and learning how to work in the workforce. I had a great supervisor and boss.
good,"It's busy during the holidays, and reshop can be brutal, but it's a great place for new workers to gain experience. The supervisors and managers will tell you what you need to know, just remember to ask questions!"
good,great seasonal job
good,"well first we would straighten all mechandise, and place mechandise where they belong if they are out of place. i learned that the value of customer service is everything, and you have to knoe alot about your store and its merchandise when being a sales associate. My co-workers were all people i would work with all over again. The hardest part of my job was really just waking up in the morning, i loved everything else about the job."
good,i enjoyed the interaction with the children and the fast pace
good,"unloaded truck, scanned everything in, helped customers, cashier"
good,OK job did seasonal work. Work as cashier/ sales associate. assist customers and run cash register.

good,Toy's R Us is a very fun place to work but still can be stressful at times.i dont have any thing bad to say about it
good,"I enjoyed working for toy's r us, I loved helping kids picked out a game that they would enjoy."
good,I liked working there for the short period of time that I was working there.
good,Good staff and management. A few nights the managers came in and worked with us doing the same jobs. It must have just been part of the program because we had regular staff. It's always encouraging when managers will work alongside you without looking for pats on the back. My work was even recognized and I was given a raise and offered a permanent position which now I wish I could have accepted.
good,I love being around a commited saff and smiling kids. i wouldnt mind work there again.
good,"Although my employment was only temporary, working at Toys R Us was a wonderful experience. I wish they would have had a position open after the holiday season."
good,I was a cashier floor salesman stocked merchandise and helped open up 2 seasonal store in New york. I really loved the enviroment my coworkers were freindly help eachother out even the managers and always had constant improvement.
good,"The job was easy. Interacting with the customer was very enjoyable. It did not affect my school work, if anything it made me more responsible."

good,Seasonal position I had while in school where I stacked inventory and
good,"An typical day for me at work can run smooth depending,everyone was always happy around which is great"
good,I learnt alot working for toys r us its a great place to work. The hardest part of the job is customer pickup as it gets really busy. The most enjoyable moment is having a laugh and getting your jobs done
good,A typical day at work was ringing up toys and other merchandise on the register and bagging up items and zoning. I learned how to find remember merchandise throughout the store. Management was good. My coworkers were friendly and fun to work with. The hardest part of the job was telling the customer we didn't have an item they were looking for when we ran out of stock. The most enjoyable part of the job was seeing all the toys people would buy and communicating with the customers.
good,"Great customers, management and coworkers. Process transactions all day. No problems really."
good,"Really enjoyed working here. Great team, amazing management, all around terrific place to work."
good,I worked in the storeroom unloading trucks and restocking the sales floor.
good,Only reason I left is because the department was outsourced. Would still be there if it wasn't for that...

good,Company which I gained customer service experience. Maintained department to immaculate conditions. Learned products through out department as well as other departments. Staff and management were very delightful to work with
good,"A great place to work if you like working with toys and games. Gets hectic when a new toy that sweeps the nation comes out like furbies when they came out or like tickle me elmo, and around holidays. So u get to be a kid at all times and work in an a adult environment."
good,They taught me the ways of retail and provided good training to get through retail customers and problems. Such as black friday and holiday seasons.
good,"A brilliant work environment, the staff are very friendly and easy to get along with. Managers were understanding with my university work."
good,challenge and different every day. Adapt and learn in a fast change environment. Having fun with the kids its one of my joys at work.
good,Toys R us was a good work expierence.A typical day at workfor me would be unloading merchandise from the trucks and replenish the sales floor.Managment was great at supervising and letting all workers know thier task that needed to be done.All co-workers were hard workers and fun to work with.The hardest part of the job would have to be inventory small individual item.The most enjoyable part of the day would be unloading the truck just because it makes time go by faster and an easy process to do.
good,"You would help customers, clean messes, and collect carts it was an easy and relaxing job."
good,"I enjoyed the atmosphere, and the employees were nice. I enjoyed workingt with the public. The manegers were extremly polite."
good,"The work is fun specially that all of the co-worker is nice people they'll teach you if you don't know anything you're doing, they're really friendly even the manager and the supervisor are cool. The hardest part of the job is I worked graveyard like 12am to 6am or 9pm to 5am so the hardest part for me is keeping myself awake especially when the music at the store is boring. I am a hard working person I can easily do my job, I am a fast learner I can adapt my ability to the next task easily and I really like working in a dynamic corporate environment focus on career and development of the company."
good,Great place to work and great people surround you. Everyday buisness is done but being ready for your half pint customers is what is really needed.
good,Very understanding when it comes to school. The staff is friendly and the workplace is great.
good,Although I only worked there for the season I absolutely loved going to work and actually looked forward to going. I loved seeing the kids faces as they recieved gifts that they've wanted and helping customers to find what their kids wanted for Christmas. There were rough days but not many and that made this job the best I've ever had.
good,"A work place where there is always more to do and learn to better your customer service. The guest always comes first and you must do your best to see if you can find the item they are looking for, order the item or find another store that has it."
good,working here was a fun experience. I learned a lot and gained alot.
good,I really enjoyed myself working at toysRus for a seasonal part time job it is helpful you could learn more than what you thought about working in a toy store
good,This company focuses on customer service and reaching higher goals that lead to success.
good,I find Toy's R Us to be a great place to work. A customer friendly company that places a lot detail on making sure that there customers find everything that they are looking for.
good,Only worked there for 3 months. I got to meet people and greeted customers.
good,I enjoyed working here. Good values and store operations. They also have a friendly work enviornment.
good,It is a good environment to work in. Employees are paid weekly instead of bi-weekly. Provides plenty of opportunity for bonus wages and overtime .
good,"I thoroughly enjoyed my time working at Babies/Toys R Us. I was a very turbulent time in my life and I needed a job that would be relatively simple and easy on me. Though things did not work out as expected, the job still helped me keep a bit of stability in my life. The managers were respectful, helpful, and always there for me as well. But keep in mind that this is a great part-time deal. Nothing more."
good,Toys R Us was a wonderful company for seasonal and part time work. It offered flexible hours and a wonderful staff of managers. The environment was always upbeat and fun.
good,"tres bonne entreprise,avec un vrai esprit d'equipe on se sent comme a la maison"
good,"It was a great place to work. The management was terrific when it was stable (we had gone through a lot of different managers in 3 years). The last manager I had was the best. They encourage growth so when you get older, you can upgrade to different positions."
good,"Good place if like to work with children. Weekend events that are theme related such as star wars, legos events, and super hero events and lastly nerf testing events. Very friendly environment, customers made it a joyful environment."

good,Learned how to get things done in a fast manner. The culture was amazing it was a great united work place. Management was very helpful and considerate amongst staff and customers.
good,Store 8851 was like family it sad it had to end. The bankruptcy put a lot of good people out of work. To compare it to any other job is pointless nothing will ever be like my Toys family and job.
good,"A day working at Toys R US was like just a regular day at home. Meeting new customers and managing everything around me. The hardest part about toys r us is when customers leave Toys everywhere, but for us to put things back in its place is our job. The most enjoyable part of the job is being with new friends and seeing new faces coming into the store."
good,The job was literally so easy just clean and show people where toys were at and on the weekends you get to play with the toys with people.  Super close crew haven't worked there in years and still talk to a lot of them. What sucks is the store closes at whatever time but the amount of go backs that accumulate don't let you leave for another few hours. Awesome management for the most part they were super cool and bought pizza all the time. A lot of people steal from the store so you gotta deal with dealing with that cause security can only do reports.
good,"I would Make sure inventory was nice and clean for when customers arrived also, throughtout the work day i would help with customer questions and purchases."
good,"I initially worked for Toys R Us as a stocker, but I eventually changed over to maintenance while still doing some stocking. The typical work day for me was go outside to gather carts from the parking lot, check the bathrooms every half hour or so, sometimes do stocking and resale, and emptying trash cans while replacing the bags. My coworkers were all very nice (it helped that I knew some of them from school) and I could trust them to help me if I needed it. The hardest part was speaking to customers, which wasn't as difficult as I thought it would be. The most enjoyable part was getting the carts from the parking lot."
good,My co-workers and managers at the store were absolutely amazing. The people at corporate were selfish and paid out high bonuses after the bankruptcy and screwed all the little guys that had been working for them for years.
good,"Great work environment, salary was questionable but benefits were good, some of the management staff were kind of hard on some of my co-workers and myself at times."
good,"Many dedicated associates. Great work environment and complex."
good,Wonderful place to work.  I've learned so much in my retail career at Toys R' Us.  Truly enjoyed the customers.  I was always very excited and enthused to go to work everyday and see what the day woulld bring !
good,"when you go to work you feel like you're at home "
good,I really enjoyed working in a fast paced environment my coworkers where both insightful and hardworking the management kept a clean easy system to learn truly and enjoyable working environment
good,I loved working for Toys R Us. I was heartbroken to see it close. It was more fun than my career job. I made a lot of good friends there. I will never forget it.
good,Working Here was an Awesome experience for my first Job. The managers and other employees really helped me get to know the work place better. Everyone was always doing their part in the job. Most of the time Everything ran smoothly
good,"Productive, I learned how to drive mhe. Fun place to work, I had 45 minutes lunch and 15 minutes break. We had a play room.  Good management team overall."
good,"working here was a wonderful experience and so sad for it to have closed down. Had an amazing store leader, although there was a lot of pressure to sign people up for credit cards"
good,Gone out of business store is  no longer open company filed bankruptcy company is closed Store closed April 2018 all around the United States only stores still open are outside the country
good,"My most enjoyable tome of the day is when i saw the children in there getting toys or bikes . Also when the holidays came around , how the happy kids would in and pick the toys or just watching the children ride the bikes around the store"
good,I was in charge of training my team how to cross merchandise products and how to become a Customer Service Guru. I also would do the AD set in my department. The environment was alot of fun
good,out of business but a good place to be out of business but had long lunches out of business but very nice staff out of business but very kind manager out of business but a blast to work at
good,I had zero work experience when I started so I was thrilled to find out that training was going to be done. I picked up on things after a week and loved everything after. It was an amazing job. Sad to see them leave.
good,"Working at toys R us was a good experience for my first job. I learned how to stock, interact with customers, and good time management skill. The most enjoyable part of the job was the activities involving children. The hardest part of the job involved the closing nights, involving shutting down cash registers a certain way and making sure the floors are clean. Management was enjoyable."
good,"A typical day will have you start off on register and ring up a couple of people. Then from there you were either put onto the floor or continued ringing. My coworkers were all really nice. ToysRUs does expect yo to push credit cards and square trades, but it is not actually that hard. Good first job."
good,Toys R Us was a comfortable place to work for me because of the children and as an 18 year old I enjoyed being able to show kids many toys. I also liked my coworkers. They were always there to help when I needed it.
good,"Productive and fun place, room for advancement and great place to learn. Good pay, decent benefits. local Upper management tried its best. Had a lot of good people working there."
good,Establishing a Selling and Service culture to meet all our customers needs.  I demonstrate total commitment to outstanding customer service daily by exhibiting creativity and flexibility in solving customer's problems.  Exceeding customer's expectations by providing timely feedback and follow-up which would bring joy to children and adults of all ages.  My store was ranked consistently in the top quartile for customer service throughout my career.
good,"Great place to work the people were easy to work for,  and it was a no drama environment. Sorry it went down, will miss it and my coworkers,the H.R. manager, Norma, The dock Manager Josh, and the Store manager, Alex, and Tiffany, Cindy and Tammy."
good,Its was a good work environment. The managers was fun to work with but also meant business. I had a lot a fun helping the kids and parents who came there. Unloading the trucks were easy.
good,"While the work may be average at times its the people you get to work with that make it one of the best places ive ever worked, very sad its closing down"
good,Since day one i knew i was gonna like this job but only cause the people there i connected with all of them and got a good discount only thing that sucked was the work cause your in a tight space unloading boxes of toys off a semi
good,My experience working at Toys R Us was pretty interesting. I found it interesting because I never worked in a huge toy store before even yet a retail store. It was a relaxed job on some days usually the store was busy on weekends when kids were not in school. I personally liked the job I was just seasonal so I stopped working there.
good,It’s very fast paced some days but other than that it’s fun and you befriend a lot of nice people and guest as well. Whenever I was available I would ask the manager before my shift was over if I could stay longer. It was always ok to so I got a decent amount of hours a week.
good,Good job place to work cant complain at all they showed me alot and taught me things I never knew also taught me how to respond to a angry customer the right way
good,Worked a lot of different positions in the ten years I worked for the company. Management was good but the best thing about the job was helping people find  the items the needed.
good,"The leadership team stressed, teamwork, integrity, and customer satisfaction.    "
good,"Great place to work, productive managment and scheduling. Always something new to learn and/or remember. Respectful coworkers, with good team building skills."
good,Loved the people and management was  very fair the most enjoyable part about my job was being able to see shipment move to locations where they needed to be sent.
good,"Overall a fun place to work. Really easy-going, worked well around my personal life. The organisation of my day-to-day tasks was a bit rough though, as well as, on quiet days, there wasn't much else to do apart from sit behind the till."
good,"It was a great and fun place to work.  We had plenty of autonomy.  Plenty of fun times.  Great recruitment, however, leadership failed to adapt the company to changing times."
good,"Toysrus is a great place to work. Most positions are fast faced. Management will work with you on your schedule and any problems that may come up. The environment can be very fun if you make it that way, right attitude fun place to work."
good,"Pleasurable work environment, enjoyed helping customers obtain what they needed. Enjoyed coworker support for daily duties. "
good,"I would probably still be working their if the company had not filed for bankruptcy.  The hardest part of the job was dealing with news of company financial problems and assuring customers about what might happen.  The best part of the job was working with customers and helping them with their needs, as well as doing the store special promotions such as birthday parties, etc."
good,"Each day was busy as the mgrs. had to set POG's, audit Out of Stock scans, work freight, ring on registers, zone aisles, monitor sends done twice a day."
good,"Having daily assigned task work great we always had work to be done, the store could be very hectic and busy sometimes but we were never bored because the task we were given would change according to demands at the time."
good,My co-workers were more like a family because we were running the express store. The pace was mildly slow but we all enjoyed customers and gave a lot of satisfaction.
good,"Working within Toys R Us has almost been like being within a family, making friends from work colleagues through to senior managers. Sadly the fun and companionship is at an end with the demise of this great team of people and of the organisation in the UK. I've made friends with many of my colleagues and I hope to retain those friendships for many years to come."
good,"Great place to work, not your normal retail employers. Higher Management cares about employees = less stress. Customer oriented, with being goal driven. Hardest part is hiring in the area. Best part is making a child smile along with helping my team understand why we do things the way we do."
good,"I truly enjoyed working for Toys R Us.   Had the company not gone bankrupt, I would still be working there until I retire.I could not be any more proud of my team and district on how we have taken the devastating news of the company. Collectively, we treat each other as  family.  "
good,Good job and worked great around my schedule as a student. I kept the same job for 4 years and never dreaded going to work. Managers are sensible people.
good,"Toys R Us was a wonderful place to work i'm sorry to see that its closing down. The workplace is very relaxed either ringing up on the cash register, walking the floor helping people, and customer service."
good,"Toys R Us was a great place to work with strong brand equity, good benefits, and a strong commitment to diversity and inclusion, it is very sad that the Company is in liquidation."
good,I really enjoy working here. The team is collaborative and seriously fun to work with.  I feel that the leadership here is solid and generally look out for the better interests of their Team Members
good,I have enjoyed my tenure at Toy R Us. I've worked on many types of projects and have learned a lot about the retail business. The most important thing I have learned is how to see the big picture and to think in a clear and measured way. The company was very diverse and encouraged work/life balance. The best thing about the job was the coworkers.
good,The job itself was could be very stressful at times as you could be left to yourself in busy periods. However if anything that gave you the experience for the future. The people I worked with were more of friends than colleagues which made work easier but also more enjoyable.
good,You work alot. They find ways to keep you busy and you learn how to do everything in the store from being a cashier to stocking items. You have to be a quick learner depending on whos training you.
good,Great job to move up in the company.  I started as a part time team member and worked my way up to management.  I would recommend to others as well.  I'm just not sure the direction the company is going in.
good,A fun place to work where everyone works together as a team.  The culture is to show the customer a great and fun time while educating them on the different products that we offer. The hardest part of the job is not being able to spend enough time with each customer. It is a busy store and there is always someone waiting in line to be helped. I have learned that we can always improve and be a better employee than the day before.  The most enjoyable part are the people I work with and the customers I get to help.
good,"I have very much enjoyed my time with the R Us company. The work environment was always a welcoming one. I have seen 2 management shifts in my time with the company and have had no major issues with either management team. I have thoroughly enjoyed my supervisor roles as well as my being work. So much so that while I hope my supervisor roles i take every chance I get to help out with thwarting calls below my current paygrade. I have yet, to my knowledge, had any employee that I supervise or train have any issues with my methods of handling any situations that may arise. My main worry now is that our customers have taken the false news of our local stores closing as truth and it has severely hurt our bottom line. I fear that it is possible that this customer fear will end up driving us to have to close and I do not wish to be unemployed as I need to support my family."
good,"They are all about making people happy while making money off of you. Don't get me wrong; they would love to sell you everything they possibly could. I love their price matching. If you need a job you can work here, pay is not high yet they'll hire just about everybody for how ever long they need them."
good,"A typical day at Toys R Us is very the same. Being a supervisor, my duties changed based on how I needed to perform that day as well as the performance of my team."
good,Working during the nonseasonal time was slow but it was also fun with the coworkers and the hours that were given were fair. The managers at this location were very friendly and nice
good,Its a quick pacing environment where you can grow as a co worker and human being. Get to learn the in and outs of the facility. The work is easy and isnt that stressful. I enjoyed both my times working there because they showed me alot on stocking and helping me open up more as a person.
good,"I enjoyed working at Babies R Us. The staff was friendly, and the work wasn't very challenging but it was still rewarding. I would work there again given the opportunity."
good,"I enjoyed interacting with customers.  The management appreciated my hard work, and my colleagues were extremely helpful and gracious.  It was an enjoyable  collaborative effort."
good,"Nice set out, easy to find everything. Awesome staff and management, understanding and flexible."
good,"If you like toys, then step into the door! I was there for a seasonal position and they kept me on board! The people really try to help out as much as they can, but don't miss a single task! You will get a lot of ""WTH!"" It's was a great place to work."
good,"My day starts with the manager on duty telling me what they want me to focus on that particular day, which varies based on the time of year and day of the week. Job duties included pulling merchandise from the back and putting it out on shelves, finding products in the store for customers, creating and picking orders, selling loyalty and credit cards, and helping customers make purchasing decisions. I have learned to use computers and hand-held scanners to make my job easier. Overall, the employees and customers are very friendly, and I have learned most of what I know by asking questions or by trial and error."
good,"Very flexible hours that fit well with anybody's schedule. Consistent 20 hours even during off season, which was nice. Collaborative atmosphere with kind people willing to help out."
good,great place to work. staff is very friendly and diverse. younger crowd but great environment to be around. Lots of product knowledge and room for growth  for entry level associates.
good,It's a good job and thay pay good and it good no problem with that  job I love the job and I got a long what a lot of  my co worker and I love working with thim
good,"I cleaned the sales floor, helped customers, helped check people out, and helped my co-workers. It was a very enjoyable job because of the people and the environment."
good,"A typical day at work was always enjoyable but got boring quickly. The assistant managers and co workers were terrific. The only thing I didn't like about working at Toys R Us was the rude manager. He would always talk very nasty about other employees behind their back and when they quit. Also, he would act like he did everything for the store yet did nothing. He had his assistant managers do most of his work for him."
good,"Empresa que me proporcionou entrar no mercado de trabalho enquanto estudante universitário."
good,I really enjoyed working at Toys R us the customers were very friendly some upset during Christmas holiday due to not finding everything that they wanted in the store.
good,I really enjoyed working here. It made me feel like a little kid again. The employees were all super nice and hardworking. Management was very nice and worked with you and your schedule. The customers are always going to be the mad part about any job but I hated when customers would come in with coupons.
good,"I think having Toys R Us as a first official job with a nametag was pretty great! The work experience was really great, everyone was friendly and really nice to all of the new employees. I really enjoyed working in an environment like that."
good,Flexibilidad laboral.buen ambiente laboral.gusta atender clientes
good,I want to be a kid again when I come into work. It is nice to see a kid light up when you help them find that specially desired toy they have been looking for.
good,"The work was fast paced, but it was still fun. I was there for a seasonal position, so it's a shame I wasn't able to stay. Everyday, I had the same job to do, but it always felt like something new. I really enjoyed my time working there and I wouldn't mind going back."
good,Flexible work schedule. Great overall management support with focus on growth and development. Employee friendly corporate location; great place to work.
good,I loved working at Toysrus coworkers very friendly respectful all about work . They make it fun & comfortable ! I would work there again with no problem .
good,This was my first job and they made it so easy that I wanted to continue working after my seasonal position was over. There was small complication with work scheduling but overall really good.
good,"Management is not the best at Torrance location some were okay and friendly other were not great seasonal job or entry level. Best thing about this job just about every week there was something for employees to have.i.e pizza, ice cream"
good,worked for toy r us meanly for seasonal. Nevertheless toy r us was a hyper active place to work for. All the worker were in their own league and had their own pace of finishing the tasks. All the manager were helpful and great instructor for the those time i was there.
good,I felt like Toy-R-Us was a good work environment but was full of people who knew how to avoid doing work which made it hard on everyone at time. Other than that i enjoyed working there.
good,"I worked at Toys R Us as a Christmas Temp."
good,"When I worked at Toys R us, I did have a good time. The managers were very nice and helpful. My associates wanted to get work done. Overall a great place to work."
good,"I loved working at Toys R Us, the only issue I had was with one of the supervisors, she was a miserable sow and the main reason I quit.But I loved working there despite her, but she ruined the whole thing. Everyone else who works there is amazing."
good,A typical day working a toys r us is very simple and fun. its a very clean customer are very nice. the pay was okay. I feel like they could have had better management because the managers was never on the same page. The hardest part about working for toys r us was going on break we were always busy so there were some days that I worked 8 hours without a break. The most enjoyable part was with the different people
good,Overall a nice place to work. Workplace culture was very conducive to people from different backgrounds. A very good place to gain exposure in dealing with international markets that have a different culture.
good,I enjoyed my short time there. I was able to help a lot of new parents find products for their growing families and help families make good choices regarding entertainment for their children.
good,"Management is very involved with all of the jobs this job requires. Hands-on training, fair hours for all employees. Our work environment was desirable and very motivating."
good,The Toy R Us I work for has terrific management and provide and relaxed workplace for anyone to work. It has tought me how to manage my time during the day and showed me how to manage a certain amount of work by a deadline. I enjoy working there so much that the hardest part of the job is showing up to work. My favorite part of work is the co-workers I have met and environment I work in.
good,"The average day at work consisted mostly of walking around and recovery. Management gives you room to work to your full potential, as for as difficulty goes there wasn't any task that was more complicated than the next."
good,"Have good days at work, learned a lot about different toys. Hardest part was telling the customers we didn't have the product in. My most enjoyable part is the kids."
good,"Im Toys""R""us arbeitete ich über Weihnachten, wo es besonders stressig war. Da ich einen kleinen Bruder habe, kannte ich mich sehr gut aus in Spielzeugläden. Das Team war sehr freundlich und alle haben sich gut verstanden, wenn man Hilfe brauchte, wurde einem alles sehr genau erklärt. Schwer war es allerdings, sich im Lager zurecht zu finden, da es etwas unordentlich war."
good,"Everyday in there is different, it's never the same. I've learned that every customer is different and learned a lot more respect towards others. The hardest part was everyone throwing everything on my shoulders, but that's can be overlooked since i love working with my coworkers."
good,always smile and serve customers  needs. also things positive  in work . make customer happy with our products  it can be increase  company sales . be alert  with  promotion such as school holidays & redeem voucher.  top up the goods when their look empty space . staff can learn how their keep invoice & training new cashier .
good,I really like working at Toys 'R' Us Babies 'R' Us its a very cool environment to work in lots of things to do especially if you're a big toy/ video game enthusiast. I find myself sometimes getting lost in the excitement of seeing toys and games that I remember when I was a child. If you're looking for somewhere to get your foot in the door and learn some new things while working at a nice pace this is the job for you.
good,The management was better than when I first worked there but its a nice work environment. I worked around decent people and they are pretty flexible with school
good,"Very Fun and enjoyable job. Great for people who love kids or are a kid at heart! If u love people and are focused, the job is easy."
good,Working there was a great opportunity. Anisha Daniels believed in me enough to give me an chance. The reason I stopped working there was for personal issues but if I was allowed to work there again I would
good,"The hardest part of the job was the training, they only teach you how to work the registers but do not tell you what to do when you're on the floor. The co-workers will usually help you along your way if you need help. A typical day is usually just walking around the store helping customers and putting toys where they belong, or being on the register."
good,"A typical day for me was organizing ticket items, putting away back stock and pulling ticket items to the front for costumers. Management was outstanding at teaching me everything I needed to know to correctly do my job. My co-workers were vary helpful when I needed assistance with my assigned duty. The hardest part of the job would be the late hours. In the end I enjoyed the safe and productive work environment."
good,Te enseñan rápido a realizar tus funciones y la gente muy amable
good,it was alright the staff are friendly and so is the lady who hired me a few years back. it was great working with them and the people wouldnt really bother you
good,"There was a lot of work to accomplish in a day and a lot of different people to work with/handle, but it was a good experience. Coworkers come and go very often, Christmas season is chaos but builds character, customers can be very rude, but some can also be the most patient and appreciative."
good,Great place to work with a fun amount of task to work on that constantly changed each day. Management was good but often scattered due to the size of the store.
good,"This is a daycare, that has wonderful, loving teachers. The schedule is great, the owner was nice, and the parents are awesome. A typical day with kids is always different. Things generally not the same day by day but so rewarding and much fun. Its amazing getting to teach them and watch them learn and grow and be able to share it with their parents. Hardest part of the day is getting them to go to sleep for nap time but still a rewarding job. Only thing i can say bad is that 20 two year olds in one class can be hectic sometimes."
good,"my typical day at work was very relaxed, I was never stressed over anything. I learned how to communicate better with others. Management was great they were always there for you even when they were busy, co-workers as well were very friendly. The hardest part of the job was when there was something that a customer wanted and we didn't have it, sometimes it was difficult to deal with that because they would get angry. The most enjoyable part of the job was seeing the kids with a smile in on their face even the parents."
good,"Typical day was come into work start stocking the shelves and making sure there was merchandise on there. The management at my store wasn't very pleasant and made a lot of people feel uncomfortable .. extremely micromanaging. The best part of the day, was finally taking off your shoes and being able to step out the doors and go home to a nice comfortable bed."
good,"Arrive at work early mornings and prepair building for opening. Make sure building is in approval with customers liking in how clean and organized. I learned that hard work and dedication makes sure customers return and enjoy their buying experience. Management has some bumps but in general they do well. The main Manger has an up beet and happy attitude which makes it enjoyable to work. Co-workers are friendly and extremly helpful in being able to do your job with ease. The hardest part of the job is being able to complete the list of desired task in the small amount of time you are given, but the managment team understands and only want you to do the best you can with the time provided. The most enjoyable part of the job is being able to do your job in peace and with pride. Managment provide snacks and goodies when store does a good job, which makes it nice."
good,Since i was already familiar with most of the merchandise in the area i was assigned i felt comfortable automatically. I learned to be confident and to talk to customers in a respectable way to help their needs. My co-workers were very friendly that would let me work in peace but we can always have conversations when we were on break or leaving. Hardest part of the job was probably keeping up with the fast hectic pace during the holiday season. The most enjoyable part was almost everyday i would help people out on everything they needed and just hearing a compliment from them to me always made me feel better about the way i worked
good,"A typical day involved helping customers find products, ringing up sales, and restocking as well as recovering the store to a good looking state for the next opening day. The employees and managers are all very good people and this is a great work environment especially as a starter job."
good,I enjoyed working at Toys R Us. It was very enjoyable. Everybody was hardwork and friendly. My coworkers made it easy to go to work everyday
good,"I have learned a lot while working at Babies R Us. My co-workers and managers are wonderful, fun people to work with. I've learned how to help customers find what they want, in store and online. I've learned more about the products that Babies R Us carries. The hardest part of the job is dealing with some of the customers at times. But the most enjoyable part of the job is helping other people."
good,"It was an awesome and amazing experience. They welcome you with open arms, and everyone feels like family. The season was extremely busy the store was packed everyday of the season, but everyone comes together and works as a team and gets the job done. The special events they host are incredible and informing. The selection of toys beat any other store."
good,"i learn to do tag prices on work also doing signage,, the management is good, my co workers are all friendly,, the hardest part of job is when there are so many costumer to assist, but we overcome that part ,,the most enjoyable is when you have a lot of friends on this work."
good,Work day consisted of helping customers and restocking and sometimes putting new products or even demonstrations. Thout the experience i learned what it meant to work in retail even survived black friday. Management was fair and upfront i never felt missed or left in the dark. all my co worker were helpful and friendly and never shied to help other or to receive help themselves. The worst time of work is when there is no customer to help and nothing to do making the time drag on forever. Helping people was by far the best part of the job.
good,"Unload freight, scanning in product, flexible, friendly environment, organizing product in stockroom or sales floor, and learning new things everyday."
good,"Seasonal Position Reallocating Orders during the 2014 holiday season. "
good,"Though kinda hard to get promotions, and your schedule is not promised to stay the same it is very fun to be able to work around toys all day."
good,"Buen compañerismo y una gran opción de aprendizaje."
good,"Toys R Us was a fun work environment. You always have something to do. The management is very good. My co workers were great and very nice. A typical day I would be ringing up sales,store recovery, and answering the phone."
good,"Fun and enjoyable workplace. Helping  Families find their child hood toy/game to reminisce in and create  new memories. Work hard, show your dedication to the company, you will not go unnoticed."
good,Its A good job to work at Very good co wokers good hours not a hard job at all graveyard shifts are very cool it good to get all the work done at night
good,"A typical day at work involves me working as a cashier on a till, meeting new customers and handling cash. Through doing this, I have improved on my communication skills as I sometimes build a rapport with the customer. "
good,"First job and never had any bad experiences with the company.  Of course you'll deal bad customers sometimes, but co workers help out anytime."
good,I had a very laid back work environment when working nights for this company. The work was always very consistent and enjoyable thanks to my supervisor. I learned how to really manage my time in order to get large pallets on shelves and how to have time to bin over stock. My manager was wonderful and was always there to help if I or a co worker was unsure of unable to place an item. The hardest part of my job was working ten to seven am. Working overnights is a hard sleep schedule to get used to. The most enjoyable part of my job was the consistency  of my job.
good,Loved working for Toys R Us. Enjoyed working with my other co-workers and assisting costumers. It was friendly environment.
good,I loved Toys R Us the only reason i left was because it wasnt busy and there were no hours! They are very nice and caring! Most definitely my favorite place!
good,"Typical day at work included stocking shelves"
good,It was a great experience to work there. I enjoyed working there with my fellow employees. The most enjoyable moment of working there was greeting and working with my fellow employees and getting to know the customers as I interacted with them. A typical day at work was working from the time you start to the time your shift was open instead of when you had your breaks.
good,Everyone there is super friendly and they will help you whenever you need help. the only real negative is you don't get many hours after the christmas season is up.
good,"Toys R Us is a great place to work, the team there is fun and friendly. It's more like a second family who you like spending time with"
good,I love the company & what it stands for. I love the teamwork that everyone has. Toys R Us is a clean & neat place & they always have a wide variety of toys
good,"Working for Babies R Us on Niagara Blvd was an enjoyable experience. I learned what is involved in working the floor in a retail setting, being able to help customers and how much work it really is to be a retail associate."
good,"The job was great for seasonal. Good hours, good pay and the management was great. Also worked with some pretty cool people!"
good,"My typical day would start out my greeting my co workers and creating a good moral for the day. I would then go up to the front desk and check to see what has not or has been done already to prep for opening. I would clean and organize up front including but not limited to the cash registers and lanes, shelves, front desk, and the entrances. I would then take care of the guests needs by either doing returns, helping he or she find their item, ringing them up, or simply helping and granting their every wish. I've learned a lot from working at Toys R Us. I know what customer service is and how it should be conducted. I love to work with people and to make people happy. My management was understanding yet stern. They were funny and great people , but they did not confuse their personal and business life. My co workers became friends. They were great, genuine people that would do anything to help someone. The hardest part of my job would be keeping up with all the sales and promotions especially during the holiday season. Everything would change when the wind blew. The most enjoyable part of the job was simply putting smiles on our guests and customers face because that let me know that I did what I needed to do."
good,"A typical day consist of retrieving carts, being a cashier, answering incoming calls, and stocking the store. I learned a lot about customer service and how to handle yourself a retail store. Management was nice and easygoing also very understanding about my personal life. Co workers were always welling to give a helping hand and assist when necessary. The hardest part of the job was holiday season. The most enjoyable part of the job was seeing customers leave with a smile on there face."
good,I love how they worked with my schedule and understood when emergency were present.
good,"Toys'R'Us is a great place to work. My first day in Toys'R'Us was really intense since my first day was on black Friday. I didn't even know how to use the cash register but I had to learn in less than 10 minutes. However, it was a great experience and a great skilled I learned."
good,"Overall, this is  a good company for a person that is looking for a job they will enjoy. However, there are many times in that hours are simply not available for emplyees and as such makes it impossible for many to receive the option of full time employment."
good,Great seasonal job for Christmas time. I was a cashier and floor worker. I received more customer service knowledge and learned new products.
good,I worked at Toys R us over the 2013 holiday season. I thoroughly enjoyed being able to interact with the parents and children. Management and training was great overall.
good,"The attitude of the people I got to work with was amazing, the new and expecting moms were simply a joy to be around. Management and coworkers were very enthusiastic, and maintained a professional status. There weren't very many hard parts of the job, except on tax free weekend, and ordering furniture on line for guests. The most enjoyable part was creating registries with expecting moms."
good,The biggest day of the year for retailers is black Friday which I worked. It was a pretty interesting experience and I would do it again. The most enjoyable part of this job is knowing you have a time limit to unload the trucks and get the merchandise out to the floor it motivates you on every level.
good,"Besides standing behind a register for hours, working at the Toys R' Us in Albuquerque, NM was an enjoyable experience. My managers were everywhere with it being season when I was hired, however they explained everything in great detail and helped a great deal. The most difficult part about the job were, like I said, standing for hours and having to help costumers find intricate toys, especially if the toy wasn't in my area."
good,"ypically an average day at work is very busy with many customers that always seem to be satisfied. I have learned how to take orders, handle money, and to keep a cleaner work area. The managers are beyond expectations and always go by the books. Co-workers are always working together as a team to get the job done as quickly as possible"
good,"It's been awhile since I work at Toys 'R' Us, though when I did, it was fun and the people were great."
good,"Usual day at Babies R Us includes monitoring merchandise and making sure the product gets out to the floor. Dusting and cleaning baby furniture so it will presentable to customers. Making sure the car seats and strollers are clean, and operating perfectly for customers to look at and test out."
good,"This was a very enjoyable job with plenty of work to keep you busy. The only downside was working 60+ hours week in and week out making low wages, but the overtime was great."
good,Enjoyed every aspect of the job.  Great hours and job security.
good,"As a ASM, you need to have a good plan at least one week ahead, try to analyze daily reports to discover the opportunities and provide the solutions. Maintain positive relationship with your associates and keep powering them up, you always have a best team ever. Trying to get 94% of guest satisfaction is not an easy task. Loves toys and you will enjoy the job."
good,"Interact heavily with guests on sales floor and operate cash register"
good,"I enjoyed working with the group of people that worked their. The only problem I had was the supervisor was very unorganized at times and very last minute. I enjoyed ,meeting the different moms to be and the children."
good,I worked there and everyone was very friendly.  I loved my manager and the people I worked with.  Customers were great as well.
good,"Here you basically help and wait for customers to decide on something they want to buy and then help them pay for it. I learned it isn't as easy or fun as it looks from the outside. Being a worker is different from shopping there. The managers are all over the place, keeping all the customers as happy as they can while co-workers are all asking managers for help. The hardest part was trying to start converstations with customers who just want to leave the store already. The most enjoyable part was seeing the happiness of the kids who just got a toy or of the adult excited to give a gift to a child."
good,I had a good time here in addition to the work I did. My only regret is that it was seasonal.
good,"Great management and a fun place to work."
good,Great Management team and great co-workers. This is a great company that has has great values.
good,"Everyday was different. Each person stayed diligent and busy.Management was kind and maintained a friendly professional demeanor.the hardest part of the job was working the night shift,while the most enjoyable part of the job was working the night shift."
good,"I only worked as a seasonal employee but Toys R Us is the best company I've worked for."
good,"I really enjoyed having my first job at Toys R Us. I started out as a seasonal employee and had a great time. They say it was a hectic time of year, but it was what I was used to, so I couldn't compare. A typical work day varied. There were times when the store would pick up and there would be lines in every lane, and then there were times where there was barely anyone in the store at all. Either way, I always found something to do. I had learned how to work a cash register, which is something that I hadn't had experience with before. The management and co-workers at Toys R Us were all very kind and helpful to newbies. Right away, I had felt like I was part of the team. When it was time to leave the job, I didn't want to because I felt like I was leaving a family. The hardest part of the job I think was reshop. I only had to do it a few times, but those times it took awhile to find out where the items went. The most enjoyable parts of the job was working with such a great team and helping customers."
good,"The average day working at Toys R Us was pretty nice. Though I only had a seasonal position, I got a good amount of experience from the job."
good,"A typical day working at Toys R Us involved assisting customers in locating items, ringing up items for customers at my cash register, researching items in stock for customers, and restocking items that had been misplaced. "
good,"Overall, from customers to co-workers and managers, everyone was very kind and professional. I never had a feeling that anyone was trying to make trouble around me or behind my back."
good,"* Loading and unloading deliveries"
good,enjoyed the fast pasted environment a the staffing was also awesome.
good,"i always stayed busy between cashiering,merchandising and helping customers find what they looking for,answering phones.i had good co-workers as team members."
good,"typical day at work start with preparing and setting up the paper, "
good,"I usually only work mornings, so I can do the deposit and reports. Then when I am finished with all of that I go onto the sales floor to help my fellow team members satisfy guests. Management is pretty good. They encourage us to up sell and get metrics in a fun way. Overall, you can't go wrong at toys r us. Who doesn't want to be in a store filled with toys."
good,"A day at Toys R Us is challenging and fun at the same time. The stores are over crowded most of the time during the holidays. I learned a lot about what most costumers look for and want and I also learned to have more patients. My co-workers were excellent whenever help was needed it was available. I did not experience any difficult moments working there, I enjoyed every minute of it. I met new people and learned more about the environment."
good,"Not much too say honestly. For such a large store, everything is organized properly, the break room has good meals along with good entertainment, and the security staff are well trained."
good,"ToysRUs was a great place to work, we got to interact with the kids, playing with all the toys. we celebrated birthdays with the kids. I learned how to make money with the kids by showing them the toys and the parents would buy. Co-workers were great, easy to work with. The management was great all the way to the top. Its not very often you have a vice president sitting in the floor playing trains with the kids."
good,"Work days start with a staff meeting, product knowledge and the previous days sales are discussed.  Employees receive their daily assignments and sales goal sheets.  Management made regular rounds to check on how everyone is doing. there were hourly checks to see how the store was doing compared to its sales projection for the day. "
good,"learn about various products, get to figure out how they work, faults etc, work with an excellent team of people, the most enjoyable part of the job is playing with the toys, and helping out customers"
good,"I will start off by saying it was an enjoyable experience. A typical day would arrive 15 minutes before my shift and then in the morning we would have a group meeting and go over how well we have been doing, things we can improve and big events that were coming up. I learned a lot like how to be a cashier, build bikes, and great ways to communicate with customers. I would have to say management was on top of everything. They were fantastic. My co-workers were very friendly and made going to work a blast. The hardest part of my job was building power wheels but after a while I got used to it and it was a breeze. The most enjoyable part was pretty much everything. I had a great time working fir this company."
good,"Management is very flexible with school schedule for the most part. Co-workers are mostly college students besides management. Hardest part of the job is waking up at 4 am to receive the freight truck. Most enjoyable is during the holidays when you get a lot of hours! I learned that in every job versatility is a great attribute. A typical day includes assisting customers, handling transactions, and cleaning work area."
good,"I had a great experience working at Toys R Us. I loved my co-workers and a lot of my managers. Although I spent all day on my feet, interacting with and helping guests is one of the most rewarding parts of my job. This job helped me to open up and become a lot more sociable. I also enjoyed keeping my area clean and helping out wherever I could. I worked seasonal so of course it was very busy with Christmas approaching. However, everyone came together and helped out as a team. It made all of the tough situations worth it in the end. I love a challenge and love working as a team."
good,Enjoyed getting up to go to work everyday to help kids. The place definitely brings back memories when you were a kid not to mention your co workers are very friendly.
good,Worked everyday with a scanner to ensure that certain parcels were scanned in and out of bays. Helped other coworkers with the restocking of shelves and the daily clean up of the store. Co-workers were always so friendly and nice. They were always there to help assist you if you didn't know something. Hardest part of the job is learning where all the different bays are. The most enjoyable part of the job is the customers and great work environment.
good,You learn something new every day. Every day is different but very enjoyable. I enjoy working with my co-workers and never wake up not wanting to go to work. The management is great and everyone is a team player.
good,"Come in and clock in, in uniform, talk to supervisor about where I need to be and get to work. The whole day is a learning experience, especially if you don't know certain products when informing a customer for what they might want. Management is always on top of being where they need to be and willing to help out. Co-Workers are always somewhere nearby to lend a hand if you don't quite know what the customer might need. The Hardest part of the job is just getting the quotas, but its all in the pitch. The most enjoyable part of the job is just being able to sell toys, and you can demo some of them too."
good,the works are not happy no more their has been alot of chance going on the boss are wont us to do more with then ever with little works thier
good,"This job was the best job I've ever had. The people that I worked with are still my friends and the work environment was always friendly and fun. I loved interacting with the guests to help them find what they needed and if I couldn't, my co-workers were always there to help me. The management and employees felt like family to me. :-)"
good,A typical day involves me clocking in and attending a daily meeting where I receive my daily assignments. For the majority of the day I was responsible for loading and unloading trucks. I sometimes filled in as a forklift driver when needed. The work enviornment was very neat and well kept. The management were nice and they kept everything going in a timely fashion. The most enjoyable part was going to work everyday and working with great people.
good,Rules made clear
good,A typical day at work required clocking in and going to the front to see where you would be for the day. I learned how to work a cashier. The mangers were fine and cool they always give encouraging words. The holidays were hard due to the fact we were always busy and the store was a mess.
good,Stocking shelves mostly and crushing boxes. Most of the people that work there were nice. I didnt get full training because they were not going to keep me.
good,it was an alright environment to work in. I would work cash register. the management was great. and it was a good job.
good,"working one year experience is hard work but so much fun you feel your part of a family rather than working with people. I learned so much in one year, they made us do so much dealing with customers to management and shelf replenishing. the hardest part was probably trying to keep the shop as safe as possible as you can imagine a lot of young children playing and running around. my best part of the job I would say is when you advice an customer what toy to buy for the child and the next day she comes back and complement you makes you feel so good that your doing your job."
good,"Toys R Us was a great experience. It was my first real stock job. Learned how to stock items in different sections, unloaded the truck with new items every thursday night and my co-workers were very pleasant to be around and work with."
good,"I interacted with many different types of people and tended to give out information about the inventory of the store if needed. At first, my experience with the cashier register was not quite pleasant, but as time progressed, I quickly adapted to it and learned to operate that specific part of my job with out frustration. I enjoyed my self at the time i spent working there. Many people new me by the end of the month and I met new people. I've been laid off ever since January 1st 2011. My seasonal position had been over. However, It was time that i left there and not because it was a bad environnment because it wasn't. It wasbecause I felt as if i was being over worked for a low amount of money. As of now, I am searching for a job position where i can start off with at-least $12 to $13 an hour and what better position than an office environment or a desk top where I can answer calls, be of an assistance of someone in need of information and provide service to them."
good,If you know your toys then this is the place its very demanding. I cant really say much about management but they expect alot from you.
good,Fun i mean your in a toy store. But not to hard of a job. Managers were pretty cool down to earth people as well as co workers.
good,"Overall, my time at TRU was fantastic. I enjoyed my work as a cashier and getting batteries, warranties, rewards, donations, and credit. I met a lot of lifelong friends and some amazing customers, and enjoyed seeing my regulars come in for diapers and formula and the latest Lego pack. I literally loved every single person I worked with, which I cannot say for any other job that I've held, and compensation was fair. I do regret that we were not rewarded or given commission for credit sales. Also, one of the managers loved to micro-manage and could be a nightmare if you weren't on his good side - which is not how it should be! However, I did love working in a TRU/BRU store and in general, I enjoyed my time there."
good,Fun workplace. Good customer service. Good management. Employees are very helpful and do their jobs
good,"A typical day at work is coming in you greet them, making sure the customer is satisfy with what they are purchasing in the store and most importantly be friendly. I learned a lot with the different products we have in store for when a customer comes in and needs help, i will know it. I also learned that being friendly and nice will always make a customer feel comfortable and wanting to come back and shop. Management at Babies R Us is real good. There is always a time for play but they always make sure everything gets done in store and greeting the customer and being friendly is the most important one. The most enjoyable part of the job to me is actually seeing the customer have a smile on their face after helping them with something. It makes me feel good that i could put a smile on there face and have them walk out the store wanting to come back."
good,"At first, I was in deep thought after I was offered a job, that was unbeknowst to me, seasonal. I learned about how much it worth to keep material inside the shop and make sure everyone has their job done. I really have a great social atmosphere with the manager and the co-workers. They were all very well mannered. There were no physical or mental problems at my job. I enjoyed working in the night in order to keep everything in order for the busy day for those who shop."
good,"It can be a great place to work. Especially if you are working with your friends. Which most the stores I've been in, everyone gets to be good friends."
good,I really enjoyed working here.. It was a great work experince.
good,Some of the training wasn't material wasn't consistent with the how the company was being ran. But overall the company and the experience was good
good,"This is a good company to work for, friendly management and coworkers. Overall great work environment, unfortunate to not work with them anymore."
good,"I enjoyed working here. Flexible hours, manager cared about me and my sick husband so she worked with me on my hours. I worked around the Christmas holidays and loved interacting with the kids, parents and grandparents."
good,"Very easy , fast service the crew members was very polite & helpful made sure I knew every step of working because being a head cashier wasn’t the only things we could do as a team of toys r us . Sometimes we'll clean & carry objects & organize them as well ."
good,"We did alot as a team on the sales floor. We did shipment and handling, placing products on the floors, scaning the bar code to check into inventory and etc."
good,I enjoyed working at Toy's R' Us! It's a great first job for people and teaches a lot about the sales associate position. I would recommend any future employee to enjoy and learn from the experience.
good,"This Job entailed using many traits and duties whilst working with a team of dedicated staff. Through working I interacted with customers; helping them to make decisions based upon items such as, games and baby toys and other accessories. Additionally, this gave me the skills and knowledge about certain products; giving me access to helping people from all walks of life.  "
good,Was working night crew especially during holidays super fun crew and amazing management. Sometimes head manager brought us doughnuts. They're no longer open though. Was sad to go.
good,There was a lot of fun working around children.my job was to make sure the selves were clean and organize.i injoy the store and the manager.i hope to found a job with same type of people.
good,"Co-workers and managers were close and like a family"
good,"I enjoyed the job, I got to meet so many interesting people and had so much enjoyment with helping out the customers. I love working in such an interesting and fun workplace."
good,The work ethic of the place is phenomenal and everyone who I worked with had a great time during my time at the work place even though I never had time to work as a Cashier as I was put in the back with all the older employees and worked on and around the floor.
good,"One of the most fun and laid-back jobs I've ever had. Overnight shift was from 10 pm to 6 am, with 2 15-min paid breaks and a 30min lunch break. Managers occasionally offered overtime. Managers also occasionally presented incentives for us employees when the truck we were required to unload was bigger than normal (Incentives included going home early, gift cards, and once a $100 Christmas bonus).  Seasonal stockers were required to work Black Friday, Thanksgiving, Christmas Eve, and Christmas Day. Time and a half pay on holidays."
good,"Great working environment, had great leadership in management, it was also a great first job experience. The interview was interesting very and creative."
good,It' was a great experience! The cowokers and managers was like a big family and we all worked to offer the best customer service.
good,"Was a great place to work,the staff was wonderful and with all the training very informative.We worked hard to merchandise and make the store easy to shop"
good,"i started working when the store was about to close its doors for good. it was a fast past environment since all the store closing sales were going off. some days it'll be slow, then the pace would kick up but overall it was a nice place to work in with understanding managers and coworkers. although theirs ALWAYS that one manager that likes to kick you in the butt."
good,This would have to be my second favorite job with a good supervisor close to home and to the beach and who doesn't like working with toys a good working environment.
good,"Good for carrer advancement. Pleasant work environment. On the job training. Just a shame that company gad to go out of business. But on the plus side, they paid for me to get forklift certified."
good,Excellent group of people awesome scheduling and good management I will miss that company so much.....................................................
good,"Everyone was very nice and welcoming and the customers most of the time were very respectful and understanding, My peers were very nice and helpful when things got difficult and everything was a good experience."
good,"i enjoyed the culture and people i worked with."
good,"There’s not much to say about this company anymore since it’s went out a business, While I did work there for many years it was a good company but the pay wasn’t that great and you didn’t get your holidays off because that’s when you were the most busiest."
good,"Means doing everything there is to do in the whole store From Stocking Shelves to Counting of the drawers, Off Loading a truck, to Building a bike, checking inventory for a product for a costumer to explaining how a Console Work's"
good,This place was a great experience to work at. Friendly faces and a great work flow ethic made this a great place to work and make good relationships with coworkers. nothing but good vibes and it didn't feel like work to me.
good,I loved working there although it was for a a short amount of time my coworkers there were super cool and laid back. The vibes were super cool there as well.
good,I checked out customers and also helped them find what they were looking for on the floor. THe end of the night we had to put all the merchandise back on the shelves with iot being a to7y story we ending up playing with some of the toys after we were closed.
good,"ToysRus was a great place to work, with great management and flexibility. It was a fun environment but a lot of work to do. There was almost never a boring day with merchandising, and taking care of the stock from trucks."
good,"It's not slow nor fast-paced but it's in between. You can go around the store to organize the toys or help out a customer. Your crew members are easy to get along with, maybe even develope a friendship."
good,The managers and co-workers are always fun to talk to. They understand and are very sympathetic. You work with toys so that's always awesome. Everyone is kind of like a family when I worked there.
good,"As long as you come in with a positive attitude and are willing to do what's asked, you'll find that working for this company is great! "
good,"I have worked with some of the greatest people I have ever known over my nearly 13 years with Toys R Us and Babies R Us. I love nothing more than seeing that child's eyes light up when I put the toy of their dreams in their hands! Almost all of the time it was fast paced and while we struggled to get everything done and put the store back together again there was a team effort that made all the minor hardships worth the while. The hardest part of the job was not having what everyone wanted even being the biggest toy store there is! The workplace culture was always ""take good care of the customer"" and strive to be the best that there is. We made ends meet, made the best out of every situation and we learned the true meaning of team work."
good,"was able to advance after several years, fun, fast paced work setting.  Long hours during the holiday season, lots of overtime so the money was good especially during that time of year."
good,"any given day you of course had diffrent task and limited amout of time. co-workers were friendly and tried to work as a team to get things done. there were times when some customers were not as friendly and we always tried to help , but with a short staff at times ,things would spiral down the wrong way. as department supervisor my abilityy to keep the team functioning would be very helpful as my knowledge of product in our store was usegul."
good,"As manager on duty my typical day consists of making sure my team members are aware of their tasks for the day, answering manager calls from team members and customers, making sure my cashiers have enough change in their registers at all times, recovering the store as the day goes along and making sure my departments shelves are full and clean. Keeping track that my Back of House team is catching all alerts. Hardest part is dealing with disgruntled customers. Most enjoyable seeing the children have that Toys R Us experience. Not to mention working with some pretty amazing people. They are like family."
good,"Really enjoyed working in this kind of environment that makes customer service feel more personal. With my role there, I learned how to help others prepare for a big part of their lives. The company really thrives and enforces the team policy so it's never a solo experience as every unique team member is responsible for one another in some way. Being a registry consultant at Babies R Us provided me with useful tips and methods to guide people through stressful and exciting parts of their lives, and that itself made the job worthwhile. I appreciate that."
good,"Working at Toys R Us was a fun experience. There were daily tasks that had to be completed everyday or monday-friday that all full-timers were cross trained on. Full timers were also expected to help cover part timer tasks such as cashiering/covering the service desk and working the customer order pick up gun."
good,The passion the Team Members have for this company is extraordinary! I have had the opportunity to work in many markets around the globe. The culture in all markets is that of teamwork and collaboration.
good,"Day-to-day work is fast paced but will be able to learn a lot in the retail business, management is approachable and has a great working environment. Most enjoyable part of the job is you get to know a lot about the products and you learn a lot about customer service."
good,a day at toy r us starts in the backroom with the freight. we unload the boxes on the conveyer belt onto the pallets. then we distribute merchandise throughout the store. than take a break start stocking again. by time you finish its time to go home
good,Great place for growth great if you love fast paced working environments stay up todate  on the latest toys and accessories great benefits and management works with you
good,Seasonal hours differ from regular hours and promotions cause for alot of stress if there's isnt enough people to work. They will train you until you know exactly what youre doing ita not too hard of a job
good,"I've been with the Toys R Us/Babies R Us company for almost two years and I've had nothing but positive experiences. I was hired on as a cashier, but I was trained in many other areas of the store's functions as I became more familiar with retail. I've created many strong friendships with both my coworkers and the customers, and the memories I've made will always be some that I cherish most."
good,"As soon as you walk in you are given your tasks for the day."
good,typical day at work is very quick paced and demands knowledge on toys  and their location. I learned how to memorize toys location and when we had toys available. I also improved in my customer service while dealing with toy layaway and cashiering. The hardest part of the job is knowing how to deal with upset customers and knowing how to answer questions that you did not necessarily know the best you could. I did enjoy the environment and coworkers.
good,"I honestly believed it could have been better. The paid was good and I was trained well, but it was very unorganized I often didn't know when I was working."
good,I love children and babies. I totally enjoyed seeing and helping new Mom's to Be. Guiding them on making smart choices for their Nursery and daily wardrobe. It is always exciting.
good,"Very simple and easy going and fun work invierment ."
good,Typical days are not bad and consist of cleaning the store as well as cashiering for customers. Management is always willing to listen to any issues and teach you the skills needed to succeed. The hardest part of the job is the holiday season but with well organized leadership things go smoothly. The best part is seeing how excited children get over the toys they are buying!
good,Very busy work environment. A lot to do. easy to move up. Great for retail experience. Great opportunity within the company. They prefer to promote internally.
good,"A typical day at work would be stock room shelves, remerchandising, loading and unloading a truck. the manager was always there when we needed some thing. The work place culture was enjoyable and my coworkers were every team orientated."
good,Toys R Us is an amazing company to work for because the company actually cares about the employees and the happiness of them. Pay is fair based on how well you work and how much you work.
good,fun place to be and to get in touch with your inner child. You get too interact with parents and kids talk about toys but still get pay your taxes. When it come to Christmas? You should already know its crazy place to be. Its not a store its a toy box and all the toys are on the ground. but still fun
good,"The work at Toya R Us company was great experience since the staff, managers and salary there was satisfying. One could not expect more from a Warehouse Operative position."
good,"A typical day at Toys would be greeting the staff, depending if we had a truck I would help unload the truck and push it out to the floor."
good,Work as a team and move as a whole. Management takes the time to know staff and communicate to let them know they're appreciated and cared for. I learned great organization and made good friends.
good,"I loved my role at Toys R Us. At a DM level, the judgment related to placing blame rather than working to solve problems, was a significant issue. The company would rather continue to cycle through teams rather than support the store appropriately."
good,"Helped maintain a clean & healthy store as a Overnight Stock Team Member. Cleaned & helped with receiving."
good,"It was a good experience working here"
good,Toys r us in beaumont texas was a great first work experience for me but sometimes it was unorganized and the initial training was inadiquate for the job it was more of a learn as you go thing but other than that con the experience was very good and the enviorment was quite fun
good,"The company was a great company to work for, Minus the holiday season. The are a lot of seasonal work and customers. the workplace culture was very in enjoyable."
good,"Es una micro empresa, que se dedica a las fiestas infantiles, el ambiente laboral es muy agradable"
good,"It was a very organized work place to be, easy to understand schedule and they always made accommodations for me. I would go back if i needed to. Breaks are always given at a reasonable time."
good,"I did not spend that much time at Toys R Us, but the time i did spend there was not wasted. I liked all the people I got to work with and everyone got along great. The managers were fun and enjoyed to help anybody. The job was similar to any other retail position. You stock shelves, help customers, work the register, etc. I would refer people to work at this Toys R Us, it is a good place and you get to wear a Santa hat during December."
good,"Usually, the days in R-Zone tend to be slow. But around the holidays, traffic around there sped up and it was almost difficult to keep under control but it was still fun nonetheless! Each shift I would do my best to check off every duty on the daily list that was given while helping guests with anything they might need assistance with. I learned how to quickly make use of the walkie-talkies and cash register, while also learning the responsibility of being a key holder to the glass cases with the more valuable products behind them and trying to keep a neat and organized back room. I'd say the hardest part of the job there was when during the more fast-paced period during holiday season, sometimes I was left to myself to help a handful of guests and felt the pressure of having to help so many people at once! That rarely occurred though, because every time I was in a pinch there would be someone on our team to come and help; it was nice to be part of a group where everyone works to help out each other when they need it. I'd say the most enjoyable part of the job was seeing the look of gratitude and happiness on the guest's face after I had done my job well to help them find exactly what they were looking for. Toys R Us has definitely been one of my favorite places to work."
good,It's was a great experience for my first job ever. It was a good environment for kids and all the employees there. But many people were rude but yet the employees had to have a smile on their face.
good,"My typical day at work was normally short and busy or sometimes it was not busy and it was really slow. "
good,Working for Toys R US was amazing. I advanced very fast from a seasonal employee to supervisor in less than a year. I had an amazing time working for this company. No regrets!
good,"Although they didn't tell me i was working as a christmas temp until i accepted the job as a 'part time worker' I did find the overall work place lovley and enjoyable. It was long hours but they went quickly. The only downside was if you finished at 10 (when shop closes) you may be made to stay longer if some things were not put back, even if it wasn't your department."
good,"Fast paced with nice guests and chances to move up in the company.  Entry level positions are available and seasonal positions aren't that bad, given that it's a toy store."
good,"Fun place to work for, you don't get overworked unless is Christmas season.  A lot of metrics to keep track of if you're in management.  But a very fun place to work for if you're a regular associate.."
good,It's a good place to work . The management it's really professional and I feel good working with this company . They treat you with respect . Onece a week you have free food and in the break room you can play Xbox or pool
good,"Management are friendly and welcoming. The overall workplace is a great place to work, the positives definitely outweighs the negatives. A great place for people who already have customer experience aswell as new people who don't."
good,I was the registry supervisor and it was fun! I love helping new parents create their dream registrys. I had never worked in retail before so it was a bit of a learning oppertunity but well worth it! I hope to go back and work there some day!
good,Hard work. Long hours but oppurtunity comes with the hardwork. Good chances of progression. Working with toys r us is demanding but also rewarding in the long run.
good,"Each day's work load is normally the same.., i worked overnight shift. Management is good and coworkers are all like family. Not the highest paying job but there is room to grow."
good,"At work it was fun especially with being the fact you were literally in a toy store. Working the registers there was quick and easy and working there seasonally I had to be quick and easy going, but because the managers were there it made it even more easier. They only hard part of the day was seeing someone not get what they wanted because we didn't have it in stock, but when you see a big smile on a child's face ment the world"
good,Working here is great and I would definitely recommend applying to work here. Friendly co-workers and decently polite customers with good hours & pay.
good,"Very nice people. They think of all their workers, and they know how to take care of workers. Got some good workplace experience. unloaded trucks and working back stock is hard work but you will always be busy."
good,I have always liked this job. The people are the best part and its like working with a family. The Management could be better though. Sometimes its hard to get the days off that you need but other than that its a great place to work.
good,"The life of a electronic sales associate is to assist customers and get the product they want out of the glass area. I learned that some customers do try to make their own sales. Everyone was fast paced and did their jobs correctly. The Co-Workers were pretty friendly I got to know some of them at least. Hardest part of the job would be the customers, putting a smile and making sure they have assistance is key to any retail job. I enjoyed walking around and helping customers out with their questions and answering any of them to the best of my ability and knowledge."
good,"Overall a good job to have, fun coworkers, flexible schedules and good benefits when full time. Fairly good introduction into the retail world."
good,"Fun work experience, it was fun helping kids and seeing how much fun they had with the different toys. "
good,"I was charge of Customer service and returns. But I was learning  and performing other tasks like: knowledge of inventory techniques, operating with cash register, Greeting customers who enter the shop, to be involved in stock control and management, assisting shoppers to find the goods and products they are looking for."
good,"Very upbeat team members and managers. Learned a lot more about sales and product distribution. Management was very profession, owner would come and supervise everyone some days. Co-workers were very nice and helpful."
good,Great pay/hours during the holidays. friendly environment. great management. everyone was easy to work with. flexible work hours.

good,"The day were always busy, in good way. It felt productive and time went by fast. Management was really cool. The hardest part of the job was when seasonal rolled around. Even then you had co-workers to help you out."
good,"Great company just need to communicate more with their employees to make suer everyone is on the same page. Greta benefits and culture as well, need more great managers to run business."
good,typical day at work  was just greeting customers and helping them find their items. I learned what it meant to work for a big company and now important the goals are. The coworkers were extremely fun and some were very boring but that is in every job. The management team were always on top of things that had to get done. It was really fun working for a big toy store and seeing all the toys. Especially seeing how happy the children were to get a toy.
good,love the job like the skills im learning and have learned. Management is there and good for the most part.most co workers are great to work with theres just that one that seems to do no wrong. its not a hard job at all. i love being able work with the customers

I wanted to work with children."
good,everything is amazing especially watching the smiles that comes on the children's faces
good,I worked at Babie R Us and loved working there. I love being able to inform and help the guest that came into the store. Management was good. What made the job difficult was the minimal hours given to management / supervisors to get task done. Other than that the enviornment was wonderful I loved being able to help the customers.
good,"I've enjoyed working there every day I was in. Fun and friendly staff. Great environment. If you show the team your commitment to making the store a better place you certainly get recognized for your efforts. "
good,"I work mainly in the Babies Department but I do work on the general floor and night fill as well. The main job is to attend to our customers and make sure our re-shop and recovery is done by the day (making sure everything looks neat and that products aren't left on the floor or at registers). I always ask every customer if they need help with anything from finding products and giving information to creating and printing baby registries for expecting mothers. "
good,Overall I loved working here. Its was a seasonal position with potential to be hired. The only bad thing I can say is that they promised to hire me on but then they couldn't because they didn't have enough money to hire more employees but they did keep me up until they just had nothing else for me to do and I was promoted to a lead. If I had a chance to work here again and had a guarantee  to be hired I would definitely go back.
good,A typical day at work was come in and get to business. I learned that a job itself is a benefit no matter what. My co-workers were very professional hard working people.The hardest part of my job was staying focused on the work and not the time I had to do it.The most enjoyable part of my job was listening to my co-workers rave about the toys.
good,i loved the people i worked with it was a great work environment yes i would work at this job again
good,I worked in the Toys r us Back Of House crew and overnight team i cant lie it was fun but after a while some ppl becames anusholes but over all its a great job
good,I loved working with expectant parents on items needed for the new family member.
good,"a fun place to work. the management was a little pushy, constantly rushing you. i liked the pay and that we worked overnight"
good,"Being in the management team is stressful, but the clients make it a fun place to work.  Great group of associates."
good,The most enjoyable part about the job was helping customers find things for their kids and if we didn't have the item on the floor we could go to the back and pull the item for them. Also to put smiles on the kids face so they can have a good Christmas.
good,"Toys R Us is a fun environment to work in. I loved seeing how happy the children were while i was cashing them out, just excited about life, about being a kid. That was Toys r us core values, where a kid can be a kid!"
good,A fun environment to work in learned a lot from this job great customer support fast pace work like it should be. co worker was very helpful and very understanding
good,I really enjoyed my job and my customers! The benefits were not that bad either.
good,I like working there from the time I started to the time I had left. I met good people and made friends with very easily.
good,"The staff was probably the best thing about this job. Very friendly, warm loving environment. I most importantly enjoyed seeing all the happy children entering and leaving the store."
good,"Great people, Good location. The managers are good people and really help you with training etc. and the co-workers were a good help too."
good,"Working in a toy store can u really say its dull, not by far. We always had a blast and management had great senses of humor. My fellow co- workers some were more on the slower side of things where i just wanted to get things done and they didn't see it my way. the organization in the building needed some serious help and nothing was ever where it was supposed to be. I would say it was enjoyable to me because i got to fix everything that was a mess and make it so much better."
good,"All I can really remember was that everyday that I worked I had a great and fun time. Yes some days were stressful, but the management was extremely friendly and caring. They always went out of their way to make sure their associates were doing alright and were having fun."
good,"It was a great seasonal position. I made great money for the holidays working for Toys 'R Us. The managers were extremely friendly and helpful. The only problem being that the customers WILL suck the holiday joy right from you! You truly don't know people until you do holiday shopping with them! Impatient, snippy, cheap, always seek bargains, they got into fights, and every year, someone tries to make off with a cart full of toys! But if you are a person who doesn't transfer drama to the next customer, you'll be just fine."
good,It was a wonderful work environment. Helping people choose toys and products for their loved ones
good,Great place to work and I enjoyed my time there during my college career.

good,"Meeting new people, constant lifting, solving customers issues, and displaying the latest electronics"
good,"At work, I mainly had to assist customers, run cash register and keep shelves stock. Some day you might do one job more than the other but it was nice. I learned how to deal with all kind of people at this job, I think this is the job that actually made me realize how much of a people's person I was. I enjoyed this job, the pay wasn't all that but the job was fun. The hardest part of the job was just dealing with rude people and trying to please them while they are aggrevated with them."
good,This was a job I loved the most due to the atmosphere I was in and it was a smaller volume retail store than most.Felt like a close knit family.
good,"I like my job, the co-workers are amazing and also the management."
good,"If you enjoy helping people who are joyously expecting a son/daughter (or grandaughter/grandson...you get the point), and have customer service skills, you will fit right in and have opportunities for advancement."
good,"Everyday is different as customers are always looking for products that suits their needs. During peak periods, the store can get very busy which requires myself to be on my toes at all times, ensuring that customers receive the best possible service. The management of the company are great at helping staff to settle and give valuable insight into the store's situation in terms of sales made for the week and give daily briefing on targets to achieve for the day and best deals to look out for to ensure customers are aware of them and that they take full advantage of purchasing products at bargain prices. Co-workers are very helpful when needed and are very great in working in teams. Co-workers are always there when needed and vice-versa which helps the team to perform effectively as a whole. The hardest part of the job is maintaining the tidiness of the store as it gets very busy and items always are placed in wrong places. The most enjoyable part of the job is working with colleagues as well as getting great satisfaction knowing that customers are always served very well."
good,"Provide Customer Service, Receive and disburse money, Operate a cash register, Answer customers' questions, Greet customers, Maintain clean and orderly checkout area, Resolve customer complaints, Provide Customer Service, Answer customer questions and Maintain clean and orderly checkout area."
good,Working at Babies 'R' Us taught me how to deal with more difficult customers effectively.
good,Fun and relatively safe work environment with great upper management. My co-workers are great and make coming to work enjoyable.
good,"Management was really nice and very helpful. Was not well organized because it was the first time opening up a toys r us express, but the store manager did her best to make it work. The employees were hard working and very friendly. I enjoyed working there and wish they would open it up for the holidays ever year."
good,A typical day at work consist of dealing with customers on a regular management was excellent very nice most enjoyable part of the job was interacting with customers and their kids
good,Typical days range from very slow to busy in a matter of minutes. Very fast paced enviroment where having product knowledge and patients is a must. Everyone is always friendly and eager to help. The most trying part of the job is definately helping the trying customers which is where patients is a must but on the same side figuring out a solution and having them leave happy is the best part of the day...well that and announcing the children's birthday over the intercom and watching their face light up.
good,"A typical day at work would go along pretty steady. You help out customers, ask them what they need and help them find what they are looking for, and at the end of the day, you clean up the work areas you were assigned to help keep the workplace clean."
good,A great place to work. Very fun around the holidays and everyone was always in a great mood.
good,fast paced and good management. liked the stacked bike assemblies and teamwork everyday
good,I worked as a seasonal sales associate for Toys R' Us. The management was very good to its employees and fellow employees respected one another. A typical work day would be restocking the shelves with merchandise. I would usually get questions from customers about a certain product or ask me where said product was.
good,Loved my crew and managers wish we we're still open. Customers we're also part of the family just like the co workers. Fast paced during black friday and Christmas had thieves but managers backed us up
good,"I loved working at toys r us making new friends and helping others around the store and just making everyone happy all the time, and the staff there we’re all completely lovely, caring and understanding."
good,I enjoyed working at Toys R Us for many years. The crew and management made the job a fun environment. The pay wasnt enough which is why it was a part time job.
good,"Working at Toys R Us was a fun workplace as it was the best place for children to buy their favourite toys. Working at this workplace involved a lot of night fill where we mainly focused on the different merchandise and sales. Night fill included filling stock from the over stock, labelling and recovering. This job involved satisfying customers with their needs on the sales floor and via phone. Online orders (SFS) was a task which was interesting as it was different. Although this task was difficult in the Christmas period as there were many orders to pack with a set time. Stocktake was also taken place every January which was challenging as it was our duty to keep on top of all the stock being counted and scanned."
good,"I enjoyed working for Toys R Us. Always a different adventure every day.The hiring of new employees always a chalange. The placement of our building was good, lots of return customers"
good,A typical day at work would be being on cashier and serve customers. I have learned how to handle harsh customers and how to stock suitably and work long hours. The management was good. The hardest part of the job was managing customers as there were customers who weren't very happy with what they had purchased. The enjoyable part of the job was stocking as it was a fun part for me.
good,I would recommend people to work at toys r us because it was no drama and far. The pay was good even though I.S. was bi weekly if toys r us never shut down I would’ve loved to keep working
good,"My day consist of scanning items recorded them in the system which wasn't really that hard, the hardest part about the job was its very physical and pretty much you have to stay motivated through the day. Nothing is wrong with socializing with pears to help the day go but just do your job. The part I loved about the was we treated each other as family and we saw anything wrong we would try to correct the problem before anyone see's differently."
good,depending on the day it could be very long and tough but usually most of the time you will have a blast with your co-workers & managers. the pay rate was exceptional for someone needing a place to work at.
good,This was a good place to work if you wanted hours good starting out job. There was a lot of unnecessary drama unkind people . Would not go back to this job
good,"toy's r us was this amazing place that I loved, I'm truly sad they closed down. Will always be in my heart. management was good until we got a new manager."
good,"It was Retail, good days and bad. The best thing was seeing the smiles on the little shoppers face and the New Moms. It was a Family work environment."
good,I’ve only been a seasonal employee but it’s one of my most favorite places to work. The managers are very nice and so are the rest of the employees. If the company wasn’t closing I’d work there for another year or two.
good,it was a seasonal position but the time I was there it was fun. the staff was welcoming. Everyone had a daily task so time would fly by. Since I worked holiday season it was always busy. The best part was working at a fast rate.
good,I really enjoyed my time at toys r us. It's a very developmental place to work. I've learned a lot in the time I've spent with this company.  I will be sad to leave.
good,I had a great time in my 8 years at Toys R Us and worked with some excellent managers and a great core group of employees that made running the store very easy. Sad to see the company going out of business.
good,"While working with Toys R Us helping stores, employees is a great experience. I like my job.  I enjoy the work, but the company is closing all stores."
good,"While working with toys r us you felt like you were part of a community. Helping parents find what they need for their child was a great feeling, putting smiles-on both the parents and children’s faces was a rewarding experience.  The company really would try and go beyond the needs to assist and help not only guests but employees as well."
good,I would help costumers who looked lost or confused. I learned how to use the cash register. I had three managers 2 out of 3 of the managers had good CS
good,i loved working here for the time that i did. not that much work they could give you but overall loved it here. you get more work while working seasonal.
good,"I was the Infant Care supervisor at Babies R Us in mentor. A typical day at work would be coming in and doing planograms or resets while occasional handling guest issues, ringing people out, manning the registry desk, and making registry phone calls. In this environment I learned, how to work under pressure and at a quick pace and how to manage a department. Management was amazing there all managers and supervisors were extremely caring and very good at their jobs. The hardest part of the job, I'd have to say would be dealing with guest issues. The most enjoyable part would be all of it for me but especially the employees. Everyone gets along and we are like our own little family there."
good,"I loved working there. The pay was good and the people were great. Towards the end of my working there, they started not putting the schedule up on time so it started to become difficult to work there and I had to quit."
good,"I always say you need to work retail so you gain a respect for the worker. I'm glade I choose Toys R Us for that. Yes it was annoying to keep asking guest/customers if they wanted to sign up but that was my job, but that's my job. I do have to say though the managers at my location were amazing. I could go to them for anything even personal things. I was and still am in a true family with them all."
good,This is a fun place to work but can be very fast paced especially during the holiday season.  They do have fairly descent befinits for their employees both full time and part time.  It can be a very rewarding and fun place to work.
good,"Toys R Us is a great company to work for. They have a great management staff, great HR staff, overall great working inviroment. They have good benefits plus excellent pay. Great company to work for."
good,"Ambiente de trabajo estupendo, compañeros con ganas de crecer y aprender."
good,"Very fun place too work , especially if you like children. You get too see them come in with their parents and get a new toy and see the smiles and laughed on their faces. 😍"
good,This place is a fun environment to work. Everyone there is like one big family. I have learned a lot about the analytical part of the company. They treat their employee's very good and do special outing for them as well.
good,I loved working here. typical day of work would be checking out customers and straightening up the front end of the store again learned cash register. I believe the most enjoyable part of this job was interacting with the customers
good,I only worked seasonal but it was extremely hectic around Christmas. Everyone was nice and helped each other out. the enjoyable part was being able to be SURROUNDED by toys.
good,"Being my first job i felt invited to work. The Toys R Us I worked for last season had a great work environment, their was no one above us, manager spoke to us like real people and not jut workers, they would also give us pats on the back for meeting our quota for the day/week. Although it was for the busies time of the year I feel like Toys R Us is more alive during those times. Had some memorable and unmemorable days working there, and a great first job it was."
good,"The environment is always relaxed and I never had management become aggressive or demanding. They may have been a bit too complacent and lenient, however, it makes for an easy work environment and you can easily get requested time off."
good,Extremely fast paced and fun atmosphere. Requires a lot of organization to stay ahead of the curve. Strong culture of teamwork.  Management was extremely tenured.
good,"At Toys R Us every second counted especially during the seasonal time, but overall the job was pretty cool. Everyone was friendly and always joking around but we always got the job done. The hardest thing was probably the heavy lifting , everything else it just took time to get used to."
good,"The workplace was always clean or being cleaned, fun and supportive coworkers, huge team efforts from everyone and the department supervisors were always helpful and maintained awareness about each individuals success."
good,"Lovely place to work very friendly people, lot too do keeps you very busy.  Security is very good, makes your day go quick, very busy workplace, lovely place to work."
good,A typical day at toys r us would be to empty the delivery truck rack it to the correct places and clean and control the warehouse when not in warehouse to collect people purchases through the ticket machine and to refill the shelves and keep the store tidy
good,I had a freat time working here . Learned alot of new things working here that would benifit me in my future . Thank you all to the store management for giving me an opporrunity to work for you.
good,when you have over 80 thousand items to put away it feels good to now that you willl be a great help for the next day when someone can fulfill there order
good,This was a great job surrounded by people in which were very helpful and caring. The management was very understanding with other schedules that had to be worked around and it was a great summer job. The hardest part of the job was getting adjust to the flow of things but once I was adjusted it was really easy and enjoyable.
good,"If you love toys and kids then this is the place for you. a fun fast paced environment. Great schedule and easy sales."
good,"I really enjoyed working for TRU, I would recommend it to anyone who loves children and making them smile. The people I worked with and supervisors always stayed professional and very focused. Sales were usually exceeding."
good,"Working at a Babies R Us store you must enjoy customer service, managing product flow and building relationships with team members and customers. I learned all there is to know about the baby business and truly worked with people I enjoyed being around! "
good,"Everyday was a fun and learning experience. I learned the importance of teamwork and new procedures in the workplace. The supervisors were caring and did a great job of delegating tasks. My co-workers were respectable and created a worry free environment. The hardest part of my job was remembering that I was at work and while it was important to relate to the children and be familiar with the toys, I still had to be a serious worker. The most enjoyable part of the job was bringing a smile to children's and parent's faces when I found the exact object they were looking for."
good,"This was my favorite job and I honestly would love to go back. I'm a kid at heart and that's a great thing to have to work here. Knowledge of the product and interest in the product are very helpful for parents and other shoppers for children who may not know what they are looking for. A lot of times people will ask ""what would a 5 year old like"" and you need to know the answer. Christmas season can get hectic but it's great. Sometimes you get to demo some of the toys even! I have so many memories of adorable kids coming in and saying the cutest and craziest things. My thing was management. My management wasn't the best. This person did not seem to really care about the employees and didn't pull their end of the work. Higher up people know about this and haven't done anything about it."
good,"enjoyed toys r us and the employees . Customers always left satisfied without complaints."
good,"I helped customers with searching for products, and answer any questions that might have concern with the product that they are searching for."
good,"I worked the register and took care of customers. "
good,"•	Receive payment"
good,"Making a child happy because they got their toy and the smile on the parents face because I've helped them is the best feeling at work. The hardest part is when we don't have the item, causing the parents to wait until we have our next shipment or send them to another store. Being a leader is a responsible job that I'm able to be. My co-workers help a slow day at work go by quickly, they're so fun and full of surprises."
good,"My supervisor and manager at the time were a bit rough and wanted me to come in on a day I wasn't scheduled, ended up leaving because I had to prioritize school."
good,"A typical day consist of me assisting on the floor or the register. Helping with restock, management is great and coworkers are awesome. I learn something new almost everyday sometimes from the customers too."
good,"This company will train you to work in a fast pace environment.  There are the stressful moments, but the rewarding ones outweigh them."
good,"A typical day at work included, facing items, stocking shelves, assisting customers,  loading and unloading trucks. I learned how to scan items into the warehouse. Then from the warehouse to the shelf of the store. This job provided me with a good customer service and sales skills."
good,"the hardiest part of the job was making the sales target  ,the most enjoyable part of the job was when we met the sales target, christmas staff was hard to train but as i was the only one runing the store i had to move them around the sections to find out what they was good at i learned how to handle deficult customers and merchandising returns and much more."
good,Kids make the job so much fun. I really enjoyed everyday working there
good,"Loved all the seasonal workers, Loved starting and ending the day with a smile"
good,"Co-workers are the best, most are friendly. Managers are a great help willing to step in when needed. The most enjoyable part about the job in my opinion, is seeing the kids and interacting with them. I don't want to call it the hardest part, but the least enjoyable thing to do was closing the store. Having to put back all the toys, straighten shelves, and cleaning up."
good,"Typical day at work consist of loading and unloading trucks stocking merchandise in the store and cleaning up my area. I learned how to loading the trucks and stock merchandise an put in it rt scanner .Management was great they helped us whenever we needed help with a certain merchandise. My co-workers were helping and nice we helped each other out to get the job done. The hardest part of the job was that lifting heavy merchandise in the back of the store and the most enjoyable part of about the job was work alot of hours, the  working environment, and the pay"
good,Arranged merchandise and sales promotion displays and issued sales promotion materials to customers.
good,A typical day at work is I would check in and they would place me in a specific area to fix the shelves or to go backs. If I had questions they were very happy to answer them. The managers were very well organized because they knew where everyone was and what their jobs were. I guess the hardest part of the job was to put the product back on the shelves because it was hard to find the aisles where the product needed to be. The enjoyable part of the job was helping people who needed assiatance. 
good,"A typical day at work included reapplying price labels and assisting customers with questions and concerns about products, services and sales/specials. It was a small store so I learned a lot about product placement, how to manage multiple customers at once and ensuring swift quality service. Management was great they helped me to understand many of the things I didn't get. my co-workers were great we all got along great and helped each other out during the ruff times. the hardest part of my job at first was setting the store up since we had to set everything up ourselves. the most enjoyable part was helping people find what they were looking for at a good price."
good,i loved working at toys r us. i enjoyed coming to work everyday with a smile on my face and working as hard as i could. the people were nice and the work was sustainable throughout the nights and days of work.
good,"A tyoical day of work at Toys R Us was always good, new people everyday and also learning never stopped. Handling money and checks for customers to be able to take home a toy for theyre loved one was always a great feeling and i was very pleased. My crew team was awesome, they were very smart and friendly.The hardest part of my job was not being able to satisfy the guest wether because the product was damaged, or we were out of stock. we tried our best in pleasing them as much as we could."
good,Great learning experience as far as retail and customer service goes.
good,The typical day is hetic and alot of customers but i did learn that customers can be upset but will come to understand what we have to through working there.
good,"The day usually starts off slow and picks up around noon. The busiest parts of the day are between 1am and 7pm. The staff is really friendly and the managers are nice and know what they're doing. If you're closing, you'll usually end up staying an extra hour or two to put back merchandise and clean up the isles and shelves."
good,Love woorking in Toys R us specially in the holiday season love the rush
good,"It was one and only have ever enjoyed working with them. From my first day till the last day spending in that company is awesome; their managers, supervisors and the co-workers worked as a team. Their division of labour brought good achievement to the company. I can never forget working in that place."
good,"Good and fun company to work for. Give everyone a chance, all you have to do is your job. Advancement possible. Could always call corp. With questions. Corp. Would always get back to you on issues."
good,"Everyone there was super nice and understanding. The management was great and there was lots of times for extra hours. I loved working with my co-workers, as while as customers."
good,"not much to say about Toys 'R' Us."
good,"The job was good to me, it only was a seasonal job and I could come back this season but I’ve moved to Lansing, Mi. Plus I still have the job at  Shedrice AFC Home once once a month. But, the job paid well and the supervisors were really nice and they listened if something was wrong and when you talked about your health. I was on my feet the whole time but by me having diabetes he’d let me sit fir a while then continue my work."
good,I really enjoyed working along side my colleagues and providing excellent customer service within the time I was with them. I am still upset on being made redundant but at the same time blessed to have had spent the time I did with them.
good,Workimg at toysrus for me was very fun especially with me being a huge geek for most of the product sold it made it that much more enjoyable. Managment really respected work ethic and the more hard work you put in the more appreciated you felt.
good,"I would have recommended it. Professional, not rude. They are very helpful. They pay good if you ask me. The staff is very good workers ( my coworkers)."
good,Working here was an amazing experience and never a dull moment everything was fun the hardest part about the job was assembling the toys but other than that once you got the flow off things it was easy. the workplace was very fun to work in and my colleges in my team were very supportive everyone got on.
good,"A typical day at work, I was either on register meeting my quota goals for the day, packing out boxes and stocking the merchandise on the floor, or at customer service making returns and exchanges while answering the phone. The job was enjoyable and I had fun interacting with the customers every time I worked."
good,The typical day for a Toys R Us employee is productive but fun. There is always something to do and new product to discover. The hardest and most enjoyable part of the job is the holiday season. During that time you work long hours but you get tons of rewarding smiles from customers
good,I loved the people and I loved my job. I will miss our store greatly. I would still recommend any store that is staying open as an enjoyable place to work.
good,As my first job i believe it helped me grow and meet many people who i still remember to this day. They provided me with consistent work and confidence to continue to provide help towards each day.

The most enjoyable part of the job was that all workers got along including management and it just gave the job that nice warm feeling. The hardest part was doing 3 days back to back of unloading trucks. Some trucks were big, some were little and everything was a fast-paced and needed to be done at a certain time. Management was great or at least our manager Michelle was great. She was very understanding and was always their for us and she always made sure we had fun and that we were doing our job right and getting it done."
good,Toy's R Us was a great seasonal position at the time for me. It was a very simple job but exciting and new every night. Management was always very kind and considerate and the co-workers were friendly and enthusiastic.
good,"Productive workplace, I loved shipping and receiving,, working with others., like to meet nice people"
good,"Really a fun to work during SEASON holidays only..They overload you with hours..once season ends, you really only work a day or two a week. Unless you have been there for years, you're offered more hours. The environment is wonderful, co-workers are friendly and very helpful when you need it. Customers will be customers."
good,"I would clock in then go to the customer service area to get my tasks for the day. If we were really busy I would stay in the customer service dept. for awhile and help cash out customers, answer the phone, set-up and check out lay-a-way orders, help customers find what they needed throughout the store. Otherwise I would stock, clean and straighten the store. The co-workers we really nice and helpful especially my first day on the job. There were no hard parts of the job and I enjoyed every aspect of the job oppotunity."
good,Willing to hire a 63 year old man was greatly appreciated. Workers are a team and are willing to help one another. Those in supervisory positions want their workers to succeed in their appointed tasks. The well being and safety of team members within the work place is a priority. Team members are given opportunities to post work well done of other team members. TRU is greatly concerned about their image with the public and is determined to promote good customer relations.
good,"while working at toys'R'us, i got the chance to interact with customers and co-workers while having a great time doing my work. I love kids and toys so this was right up my alley."
good,"Was cool , always had seasonal help so that was good, was always super busy, kids love this place I hear it’s coming back. Well hopefully it does it was sad to see them leave"
good,"A typical work day at toys r us is pretty always predictable. Front facing the merchandise, organizing all the sale logos and being present at register when customers  arrive. I have learned to become familiar with the entire store by doing those such things above.The hardest part id say about  the store is standing for long hours, But the most enjoyable part is when the store slowed down there was time to learn new things about the store, like organizing the percentages on all the merchandise or a little bit of time to goof with co-workers, only at the right time."
good,"Its was very quiet since I was the only bicycle assembler there, but I didn't complain I love working on bikes and every single bike I built, I never saw them again which tells me I did a good job with them."
good,"a fun environment, seeing kids light up when they enter the store gives you memories of being a kid and being taken to toys r us and never having anything other than an enjoyable experience!"
good,"I got along with management and team members.good environment to work at. I liked team members Times we were short handed but still got  everything done,we worked together and helped when needed"
good,Toys r us was a good company. Its sad to see them go. Alot of people loved working their. If i canni was most definitely reapply with the company. To bad its no longer up and running.
good,They offered a lot of benefits. Worked with schedules if you went to school. The trained you in deferent departments of you wanted to learn something nerd
good,I had a great manger and great shift leaders I loved it over all. Everyone got along we had great customer service I loved working with people. I met new people everyday I loved it
good,"A typical day at work would be, I come in put out U-olts to the floor and take out the toys and put them onto shelves. Some days we would have to unload trucks as well. I learned to be punctual and ask question when confused. The workplace culuture was a easy going atmosphere, everyone helping each other out to get work done. Hardest part was unloading trucks."
good,"You couldn't be shy to work at a place like this, Defiantly have to be a  sociable person to work at a toy store and you just have to make sure you don't stressout because of the busy days and because of the sales, And just be positive and be ready for any task the manager wanted you to do"
good,"I love the atmosphere that Toys R Us has. I have seeing regular customer. Learn how to count money for tills, work programs on computers and how to look up items that Toys R Us carries."
good,"I loved working here, it was a fun and enjoyable workplace, and my colleagues were always so lovely and helpful. I always had a smile on my face when walking into work."
good,working in this company is a challenge with time at a fast pate environment is not made for people who are not morning ready you have to ready for challenges
good,Working at this company is fun a great place to work the workers here are good to work with and the manages are always on there game.the hardest part of the job is all of the crying Baby's.The enjoyable part of the job is new things i have learn.
good,Greet and assist customers with overall help within store. Maintain clean and organized work area. Maintained stocked shelves wherever deignated.
good,Labeling boxes and throw them on the line and you have to make the line time
good,"Toys R Us is a great place to work. Manager out of Poughkeepsie, NY made everyday an adventure and fun atmosphere to work in. Sales, customer service, cash office, stock, asset protection, training"
good,A typical day at work can start at any time I am schedule to work.  I have learned that working as a team makes the job easier to handle and you can accomplish more. The management of the company sometimes is not the best and we have to be flexible and be able to change plans in a minute notice.  My co-workers are a lot of young people that work mostly part time because they are students and it becomes really hard to do the job.  My co-workers can be fun some times and make life easier.  The hardest part of the job is dealing with the different schedules that change many times from day to day. The most enjoyable part of the job is when the customers get out of the store happy with our service and is fun to see them especially when is Christmas time.
good,"I wnjoyed being able to come to work and put a smile on children's faces."
good,"This is an excellent employer, we work under pressure for the Christmas season but they are flexible with the employees. They have a Human Resource Department that know the rights of the employees and respect them."
good,"Good place to work for, only worked weekends. Loved the coworkers at the time."
good,daily retail duties
good,checking out customers i learned how to provide the best customer service even if they didnt find what they wanted in our store. my coworkers were very nice and helpfull . The hardest part of the job was when the kids came in for a specific item and we didnt have it their sad faces broke my heart. The most enjoyable part of the job was setting up the shevels becasue you got to see all the different types of toys and games.
good,Working at babies r us was fun to help costumers that need help with all baby products.
good,I worked part-time.
good,I don't know much about toys r us. I worked seasonal for the Christmas holiday and it was extremely busy and fast paced. I think toys r us is a good job to start off with when stepping out into the work field
good,I enjoy a much faster work place. I thought with it being a toy store at Christmas time that they would be pretty steady all week long. There was only 2-3 day's a week that it would be busy. Just not my type of job.
good,A typical day at work you go in to see where they placed you.  Depending on what department you are is how your day will go.  You really don't learn anything new.  Management depending on who is there is how the mood will be.  Co-workers are ok.  Hardest part of the job is dealing with the co-workers not customers.  Most enjoyable part of the job is the customers.
good,The overnight position is a very temporary position only available during the Christmas holiday.  Management tries very hard not go over 40 hours.  Once Christmas is over the position is over.  If offered to stay it would be 8-15 hours per work week.
good,Terrible management and culture . Management pushes you into doing things your not comfortable with and amhave the physical inability to do at there stores
good,I was in charge of all returns and layaways. I would help customers with online orders. Answer calls and any questions. Great customer. Making sure store is clean and neat.
good,I learned about inventory. the job was pretty easy and I liked how it was busy but also not busy and there was always something to do.
good,"Toys R Us was a fun place to work during the oncoming holidays. It was fun to re-live your childhood unpacking toys, friendly co workers, and management rolled up their sleeves and worked right along side you."
good,"it was a fun place to work , pay was not good , and they didnt give you any hours foreal"
good,"I handled cash/credit cards, very fast pace, alot of people to greet, over all it was a great experience."
good,"was a great environment, but the people in this place didn't really communicate well enough"
good,"Overnight was a lot more relaxed. You get to work on your own fast paced. Less people around so, less distractions. The faster you keep working the faster time is."
good,"I'm a seasonal worker. I love working here every year.. I look forward to it. There is always something to do and having lots to do helps move time through the night. You're working with toys, how could it not be fun?"
good,"Great company, CEO has a wonderful focus. Store managers have a difficult time understanding that the employees are people with families. Constant stress due to the change in retail sales cultures."
good,At toys r us there isn't anyone to motivate you. It isn't a happy work place due to a new manager. There aren't really any incentives to reach any targets set.
good,"Second Shift Team Leader, Head Trainer, Safety Captain and Aerial  Production Coordinator"
good,I started off as team member moved up to a manager quickly but had to go have surgery and they took my position and gave it away broke my heart so when I came back from surgery I was team member and it was very hard to get my position back so I tried somrthing different
good,Great place to work. People are friendly and the staff are wonderful. The hours are the issues. If they had more hours to offer employees it would be the place to stay as long as possible.
good,Works well with those that like seasonal customer service work
good,"it was just xmas staff and it was ok"
good,A typical day at work was to greet and assist customers. I answered any concerns or questions for customers. I also was the cashier.
good,A typical day would begin with working at a register helping customers with their purchases. I also worked at the baby registry desk helping mothers create a list of the things they need for their babies. My co-workers were easy to get along with because we were all around the same age and had a ton in common.
good,"Working in a Toy Store is always exciting. Especially one of the top selling Toy Stores. Toys R Us takes great pride in their store and strides in making sure the customer is pleased with their shopping experience. It can get quite hectic during the Christmas Holiday. It always amazes me to see how fast certain toys fly off the shelves. The people that work there are always helpful and if you can't find what you're looking for they will make sure to get it for you whether they take the time to find it in the ""back"" or call other stores to see who has it in stock. I enjoyed working at Toys R Us"
good,"I loved working for toys r us, I use to love working over time the mangers and people was friendly they had respect for everyone in the store and they respected your choices."
good,working there was cool but we should have got paid more. some managers was cool but not all. the best part about them closing was that we got an extra check for staying through the worst.
good,Once all orders were filled we were able to go home. Perfect second job that allowed me to make extra money for the holidays. I didn't have to work all night and it was a seasonal job.
good,Mostly like other warehouse jobs. This company offers a lot of incentives. They keep employees informed of the success of the company world wide and the directions that they are  moving in.
good,"It was a great stepping stone. I learnt a lot about customer service & how business runs. The supervisor & manager were never really there, but the supervisor at the time was & she was the sweetest person ever! The best thing about working here were the people you worked with- no gossip- no back stabbing to get up in the business, just good ol fashion laid back people."
good,"A typical day at work was basically and all around helper from cashiering to customer service, sales floor associate. I learned how to be a great team player that when you work together the work day goes by a lot faster. The management there was kind of confrontational it was more like being told what to do instead of being asked to do something. The hardest part of the job was keeping up with the holiday rush, keeping the store clean while trying to help locate items for customers. This was also the most enjoyable because the day went by fast."
good,working in the video game sections was the best. the hardest part of the job here was having to stand at a register for hours and then when the store closes we have to put back everything that was out of place.
good,At Toys R Us you definitely get to know the job and product. On the weekends there is always activities for kids.
good,I worked here for a brief moment in time.  And in that time it was great.  A joy to support such an iconic company known for putting smiles on Children's faces.
good,"Toys r us was a family environment. Reasonable pay, flexible scheduling.It was a great company to work for. The management were easy to talk to if you had a problem. The employees treated you well."
good,"- kind"
good,Employees all got along and there was never a problem with getting any help when needed or when it came to helping one complete a task. Managers were unsympathetic to certain situations when it came to family emergencies and time needed off for those emergencies.
good,I had a different experience working for Toys r us I learned a lot about sales and about credit cards and how to  get them to apply for a credit cards .
good,I worked for the company for a couple months during a holiday season and I would not recommend working with this company.  Needless to say that they are going out of buisness so they are not looking to hire anyways.
good,"He's dead, jim."
good,It's an okay place to work for a short term but not long term. The people I worked with were pretty friendly. Management can be better. The hours are pretty flexable. I worked part time there until the store shut down.
good,Understaffed and overworked. Learn how to do many thing like run service desk. The hardest part is dealing with customers. The most enjoyable part was the other employees.
good,en resumen buen equipo se trabaja bien te dan un horario flexible
good,"Innovatory management team members work days start as soon as you clock in. Pulling order for in store pick up, pulling the item replenishment reports, taking ticket items out to the customer, and the list goes on. "
good,"A typical day at work included, stocking shelves, assisting customers, cashiering, issuing refunds and keeping the store clean at all times. "
good,A typical day for me is grabbing freight from the upstairs holding area or from a delivery truck to be put out on the sales floor.
good,"I was only working here seasonal so eventually I got laid off. Working here I got to be a cashier or on the sales floor restocking toys back to their shelf. It was a fun experience. Also I got to help much in need costumers, especially on black Friday since they really needed to get their shooping out of the way. definitely a good way to start you job experience."
good,"This part of my career at the ""R"" us family was at Babies R Us. The best time I had. We all worked great together. And we all still stay in touch. The best part working here was to help all those Mom's and Dad's to be get what they needed to start a family. Using my own personal advice and knowledge of company polices."
good,"stocking unloading truck "
good,This company only keeps people in management around all year. Everyone else is hired seasonal around Christmas and Ford on Christmas eve. I was lucky to get 20 hours every 2 weeks.
good,Seasonal job overall good needed more money to take care of my family so I have to better myself so I moved on to better opportunity company went out of business
good,"Great environment, happy with sales, great customer service, horrible management, lack of pay. hours were flexable,  reliable, good security, friendliness, worked comfortable, at self-paced. easy work, good shifts, you learn a lot as you go.  loved it there besides management.  Still wish it was around. :("
good,I really have no comment for this job it was a seasonal opportunity I worked Christmas time and it was pretty busy around that time of the year the staff was ok
good,"It was a good job, the people were super cool, the job itself was pretty easy. We were to unload the stock trucks, stock the shelves and clean the store."
good,The job was okay. The only thing about the toys I was working at was that they didn't care about your life outside of work or the the fact that you have a child.
good,"A typical day at work at Toys R us, was sometimes busy, Lots of children coming and going, helping customers find what they were looking for, cleaning up, reorganizing, watching the excitement on the kids faces once they get their new toy of choice"
good,it was a fun place to work at. the people i worked with will be life long friends and the customers weren't that bad either. most days we were jam packed and busy but as the company started to crash its slowed down. the company as a whole was trash they did not care for its employees. only the top brass were compensated for anything while the teem members who worked in the stores were left out in the cold.
good,"Fast paced, typically at the register or recovering the boys and girls isles."
good,The hours was not all that great you get what you can the people are some time friendly the boss showed they really don't care you try hard but won't get anywhere
good,"Working at TRU as a seasonal employee was a great way to get more work experience to help aid in my search for other jobs. For the most part, management is pretty decent, but the work day was tedious and there was not much help offered unless you had an in with team leaders or managers."
good,"wonderful staff with fast paced fun environment."
good,"A pesar de la carga de trabajo que tenía, estuve muy agusto, porque yo me organizaba el trabajo y tenía muy buen horario."
good,"Toys R Us is a nice place to work after hours. You get a lot of work done, learn new skills, and get to know the employees better. Quiet and fun. Toys"
good,Loved working at the place due to the fact that I love kids it just wasn't enough money to live off of nor did they provide me the hours that I needed.
good,"Con mis compañeros ha sido un trato excelente, muy contenta de tener compañeros/as estupendos. "
good,"Contacto con clientes satisfactorio"
good,I worked here last year for the holiday season and i loved it the pay was horrible but it was so much fun and i would love to gp back this season
good,"I loved this place. I started off temporary to possible hire. Now i worked my tail off, just to lose the open full-time permanent position, to a kid who barely worked and called off all the time. They chose him over me because his Grandfather was Regional manager. My manager was great the people i worked with were great."
good,"Day at work only two different shifts."
good,"Around the holidays at this store can get pretty ugly at times its a bunch of non sense , but i often tryed to find another store that had whatever item they were looking for."
good,Over all it was a fun place to work at and I love keeping busy at all times
good,Cool place to work although the management at the time when I worked there were crooks. They stole a lot of merchandise out of the store and pointed fingers at the employees. Other than that the dynamic was great and everyone worked as a team to get the job done.
good,"Toys'R'Us is a great company. You learn new and different things. You meet new people everyday and the work space is very open, helpful and friendly to other."
good,"I loved working for TRU they helped me grow and develop my Hr Skills, I wish they would have stayed open. They treated management well on most aspects."
good,I loved working at toys r us honestly wished they never closed was an amazing place to work still my favorite job was at toys r us. The staff was nice everyone there made the place a very good place to be at
good,"Management is very leanient and friendly. You get discounts on everything. Was a playful and fun environment. The store is labeled and after working a week or two, you’ll have it memorized where everything is"
good,Wish we hadn't liquidated. Probably my favorite place to work. The kids always made it a great place to be. Co-workers always had fun and friendly competition to make meeting metrics a fun and exciting thing
good,"Working directly alongside the retail manager, I was responsible for my own sub team and undertook the everyday running of my own department improving its profit by 25% in under 12 months"
good,The company doesn't exist anymore due to bankruptcy. There is nothing to tell at this time. I enjoyed what little time i was there but had to make better moves for the sake of my kids.
good,"I had a temporary job so it wasn’t great, I had a very inconsistent schedule, no perks such as a discount or anything like that. It’s sad they went under but I kind of get it"
good,"This was my first real job, and boy do I miss it sometimes.  This was back during the PlayStation/N64 days.  Some great friendships formed here as I worked through college.  I started as a seasonal cashier, then got hired back on as a cashier/floor associate.  Then was promoted to Department Head.  Then Supervisor.  I could have seen myself going up much higher."
good,"Company Liquidated, so review is not relevant.  Overall I enjoyed my 16 years and felt like we had lots of talent in the corporation.  Learned a lot of both success and failure."
good,"Although the day is fairly fast paced, there is still plenty of time to get everything done that's required of you. It's fun to work with children who are happy to play with all of the toys. The management at my store was fantastic, but it was obvious that corporate was disconnected from the day-to-day life at their stores and that is likely what was the last straw for the dying company."
good,"Pleasent when entering the building. A friendly welcome is guaranteed through out the store. Assistance is always available at TRU. "
good,"A day at work at Toys ""R"" Us consisted of running the cash register, stocking items, organizing items. It was only seasonal so I was not there for long but the time that I was I had a great experience and would definitely go back for a manager position, if offered!"
good,Paid pretty well for a retail store/toy store. Though they barely schedule you unless you're a hard worker if you aren't they just barely schedule you.
good,"worked at cashier until i went on the floor and did inventory and put backs, help find customers certain items that they are looking for.suggested toy r us credit cards."
good,good place to work but i personally found there are too many managers. trained well on tills etc and got on with most staff. really busy around christmas.
good,I enjoyed working at toys r us. It was fun to see all the new toys and games being put out for the holiday season. My assignment was the game wall so I restocked it as needed.
good,It was a good enviroment to work in..jus not enough hours .i loved working with the public an the children it was a great experience for me.
good,unfortunately there is not to much to say it was a great environment and i worked over night in the warehouse. i was layed off because it was just a seasonal job they said.
good,"great place to work, with management giving you a opportunity to get involve with the customer. Not challenging but a great job to have during college."
good,"it was always busy"
good,Overall a good place to work but just wish I could have been kept after the Christmas season. Supervisor could have been a little more aggressive.
good,It was always nice being around everyone that worked with me but the location didnt have many people coming in so it was always nothing to do
good,This job was really laid back and I loved it. I never went to work dreading to go. I was always exited to go. The customers were very nice and friendly. We got to play with the toys while selling it and that was one thing I loved.
good,"A typical day at work, is always on your feet, and always trying your best to please the customer. Co-workers are super friendly and the management is very good with helping their employees"
good,I do not remember much about the job. I could say the manger was very nice with giving extra hours. it was an seasonal job while I attend high school.
good,"Ive worked at Toys R Us for almost 5 years. Gotten to know a lot of nice customers by meeting their needs. Customers recognize me outside of work as well even as we speak. Which is an awesome feeling. They love how respectful and kind I am to them. That means to me, I gave them am awesome impression and they will remember me for a long time. Its a fun atmosphere to work at a toy store. Ive learned a lot but management would not advance me because you had to be in their click to advance. Which is not right. I want them to advance me for my skills and how hard I work to move up. Not just because Im friendly with them or joke around with them.  I wanted to advance and learn more and have more responsibility. I was also the top team member to sign up customers for the Rewards Card and selling Buyers Protection Plans every single day. When I first started at Toys R Us, the manager at the time saw something in me as a hard worker and gave me the opportunity to run a Toys R Us Express store after working their for 6 months. My co-worker and I ran the Express store to the Top #1 Express store in the district. We always came out on top. I loved running the Express store but sadly after the Christmas holiday season was over we had to close down the store and go back to where I started. At the time of going back to the store, there was no positions to advance a higher position. So they had me at Customer Service meeting and greeting and dealing with customers with returns or any problems that they came across to try to satisfy the guests needs. All I wanted was a more challenging position"
good,"A typical day at work was pretty stressful especially around the holidays and black Friday. Work was very fast pace and no room for down time, which was okay with me. I learned many new skills including how to ship out orders and how to run the customer service desk. Management was great! I spent a lot of time at work so the people I worked with became like family to me. The hardest part of the job was not what I had to do day to day. The thing I found hardest was working the biggest ""toy"" holiday of the year. It got very stressful and overwhelming. Honestly, the most enjoyable part of my job was the people I worked with and the customers I handled on a daily basis."
good,I loved my job. Making sure that everyone was satisfied with everything they bought. It was never a boring day at work. I loved everyone I worked with.
good,fun place to work. good managers and great guests. lots of good co workers
good,"great job, just don't pay enough. its better for kids and students"
good,"A typical night at work involves a meeting when everyone arrives. A break down on our tasks for that night. Every breaks into groups and start the specific task they were given by our supervisor. our co-works were VERY helpful any questions I had they were answered. I learned a lot with working at Toys R Us, for example how to handle time with working at a fast pace environment we had to watch our time and the clock. Our supervisor he was ok he wasn't the best but he was ok. My co-workers were the best co-workers iv ever had.The hardest part of the job was back inventory. They had so much back in inventory and it was very unorganized and complicated. The most enjoyable part of the job is the fact that everyone got along with everyone which made our job 100 times easier."
good,* Greeted guest when they entered the building. Also had to be knowledgeable with the Merchandise to help assist in customer sales.
good,"Some days could be good and others could be bad, but that customer service enivornment for you."
good,"Customer service, cashier, stocking merchandise, answering phones, helping to unload the truck"
good,Toys r us was a nice job at times. The staff had there moody days but would never show the customer you learn a lot at this job. It’s easy and a reliable job
good,Due to unfortunate circumstances the company was shut down due to financial reasons I really enjoyed working there only if they could come back and give the jobs back
good,Made about 10.25 working there and loved the pay the company was great boss very respectful never had no problems with night time crew the whole time I was there never had a problem with any pay or nothing
good,learned about how much toys really comes in everyday and how much they have to pack out the toys and make boxes from scratch and taking them out the truck it wasnt an easy task but u will get the job done helps by keeping u moving around
good,It went out of business 2018 so it no longer needs any help. It was good while it lasted but all good things must come to a end.. I really don’t think there’s anything more to say about the job
good,"It was a great place to work , I learn a lot from my store manager. And you of never left if it didn’t close . I hope this review helps . That’s all I can say about the place"
good,"They just closed down and left the city and there was no place for me to go after that, they never fired me I seen a future with toys r us they just didn't have a good marketing skill"
good,"Really enjoyed the job great hours and great people. Toys R us provided a safe productive and fun environment, Unfortunately its closed down due to bankruptcy."
good,It’s a really fun place to work because I love kids. It’s very interactive and has a lot to offer when working with the kids and figuring out what they like and what they want.
good,Great place to work the people we're great and the experience obtained was very great. I try to apply everything i learned there and apply it wherever else I may go.
good,cashier stocker take phone calls. had to clean the bathroom and had to stock everything up and close up the store.. i really loved working at this store because i love shopping there and there are every nice people..
good,"This was a great job to work at the usual routine for me is I clock in,report to my section, do my inventory,"
good,"Awesome place to work, I was only there for seasonal position every year until they finally shut down completely. Then I wasn’t able to go back . If they ever do, go for it it’s fun, you meet new people, and the team you work for is great !"
good,"Easygoing managers and employees, made the day go by faster. It was a good place to work sad to see it go. Everyday I was learning something new in the workplace."
good,"Most enjoyable part of the job was the family atmosphere, and the opportunity to bring happiness into children's lives. Watching the excitement of children during the holidays and having them remember me during the time I worked at the store and to come looking for me."
good,Aucun une expérience a votre une bonne ambiance avec le personnel
good,I liked wrking at toys r us it was so relaxing an I liked wrking with the team I was on I loved that I was able to help other ppl an see a smile on there face
good,It was a very relaxing job always encountered with nice customers. Always maintained a professional attitude and got along with my com workers. It was a side seasonal job before the company closed.
good,"Toys ""R"" Us was a very fun job to be at. The experience was amazing! I loved the place and the fun i got to have there! The kids were so cute and it was good to see their excitement."
good,I wasnt there for long but i enjoyed the experience. A typical day of work was organizing product and bringing product down to the customer. I was there as a seasonal worker
good,It was a seasonal job ! Very fast pace for a very busy store during season . I loved it tho great people to work with loved my bosses ! Was so sad to see it go out of business!
good,The staff were lovely and kind but driven and determined to achieve. there was constant encouragement and praise for achievement. The hardest part of this job was dealing with the enormous crowds of customers around holiday seasons.
good,"great place to work fun work environment friendly coworkers, great managers everything was great, always had a great day working there, enjoyed my time working for this company"
good,stocked and made a team effort to get the job done cleaned and swept entire store threw all boxes away when finished at the end of our shift locked and shut down the store.

The hardest part of the job was finding solutions to make every customer happy no matter what. By far the most enjoyable part of the job was helping my customers and seeing them walk out of the store with a smile on their face and their purchases in hand.

good,"My experience with ToysRUs was a good one. I started out in their Totowa KidsRUs stores and worked my way up to a management position in their corporate office. In my last position as a senior planning and allocations business analyst a typical day involved reviewing the status of the new stores that we were opening. I was responsible for making sure the stores opened with the ideal inventory to support the sales plans/forecasts in order to guarantee that each guest had and enjoyable and productive visit to our store and most importantly to ensure this guest came back many times after that initial visit! I had the pleasure of working with some great managers as well as co-workers. The most challenging part of this job was getting representation of as many items as possible into the stores for grand opening. The toy business is a 4th quarter business and coming out of the Christmas season, the inventory was not always available in the distribution center that serviced the new store. I did whatever it took to get the store into the ideal inventory position by doing DC and store transfers as well as partnering with the buying and planning staff to make advantageous purchases. The most rewarding part of the job was the results I achieved as a result of all that I did to get the correct inventory levels to the store for grand opening.

good,"It was a fun place to work , it could get really busy but it was never too bad . I really enjoyed my experience there but I couldn’t stay long because I was a student and when it came time to close trying to put toys back was terrible especially when most of the toys weren’t even in the store anymore trying to put away sometimes over 1000 toys can be very tough but not every store is like that just the one I worked at ."
good,They were an okay place to work but management wasn’t the best. They were extremely helpful in addressing concerns or questions that needed to be answered.
good,"Good managers"
good,Toys R Us was a very good first job. You can gain experience in customer service and also gain experience in working with a cash register. If they were still open i would recommend for first time job seekers to apply.

good,"It was good during the holidays, but it was super slow. The hours sucked. It was a 20 minute distance from where I lived, so to just work 4 hours a day wasn't enough for me."
good,Company is out of business. It was a good place to work with good people.I grew with the company and moved up the ladder while I was employed with them.
good,I wish they were still open as I miss my job very much. I did not like the pay sucked but I did love my job and the people I worked with. It was a fun family like company to work for.
good,We unloaded Truck and started on our areas and made them look presentable. The hardest part of the job was Putting as much product on the shelves as you could.
good,Asking guess when arriving to store if they need any assistance and showing directly were there items is was a fun environment.

good,My job was fun got to interact with not just the parents but the kids. I always asked them what their favorite toy is? and ask them about school. I've learned that no matter how bad your day might be you will always end up with a smile at the end of the day. The hardest part was dealing with rude customers no matter if you tried to get them to smile and to stop yelling and getting upset they still would get mad at you. The management was pretty laid back and fun to be around and always know how to make the employees feel like family. The most enjoyable part was I've mad friends with every single person while working there and we have all formed like this family bond .
good,Standing for 7 hours was never fun but watching as the kids lit up at their holiday gifts was worth the pain became really social in this job learned a lot I got lucky with this job

Everyone had their own tasks and pulled their own weight, but we always made sure everyone was helped when needed because our store was a team. I never walked into work upset because being there around everyone would lift my spirits. Helping children find their toys would amaze me each time, the excitement you could read on their faces when they learned more about a toy they had already loved, all their questions and etc. amazing atmosphere. Toys R Us will forever be missed."
good,It was great while it lasted but they went out business for what reason I don’t know but I liked the place I love working in doing to work in working hard

good,"I really enjoyed my time with the company.  The managers treat associates with respect.  It is truly a team atmosphere,  The only drawback was the pay was not in line with the title."
good,"Management made you feel like they were part of your family. Coworkers all got along with each other. Our work got done and we all worked together . We had morning meetings before opening of the store and we were kept up on company business and the plans for the day. We worked a lot of overtime during the 3 months before Christmas which is my most enjoyable time of the year to work there. They have a fund to help out any employee who may come on bad times and need some type of help, and you don't need to pay it back. I loved working there and I was very sad when I found out they were closing all stores."
good,"the job was very easy and fun will be applying again this year."
good,"Nice supervicers and, Managers on grave yard shift for the seasonal jobs. Friendly employs always there to assit you..also you learn Superior customer service skills"

good,"I only worked at Toys R Us for the season, it was really busy and time would go by really fast. I always had something to do, wether it was helping a customer or orginizing the toys back where they go. I rarely had any complaints about the customers but the few that went for a return was just because the kid wanted something else."
good,"I enjoyed job !!! "
good,"I was mainly the cashier, this was a seasonal job so I worked during holidays when it was very busy. Other then being a cashier all I had to do was organize shelves. I learned that I really enjoy being around people and seeing little kids all the time, my co- workers were all really nice which made the workplace that much more enjoyable and everyone worked really hard. the hardest part of the job is entering in the coupons, sometimes you had to find them in the system so it took me about a week to figure it out. The most enjoyable part of the job is being around kids they make me happy"
good,"el ambiente de trabajo es muy bueno,la comunicacion con jefes,encargados y compañeros es muy fluida y constante.he aprendido muchisimas cosas en diferentes secciones.lo mas duro es la campaña de navidad,tenemos poco tiempo para dejar la tienda lista para la apertura y antes de eso hay que descargar el trailer de mercancia,subir a tienda todo lo k nos llegue nuevo y colocar todo lo demas en su sitio en el almacen.Lo que mas me gusta es TODO,el buen rollo,el compañerismo......etc."

Management works together and communicates with each other to accomplish success as well as with co-workers, they are all friendly and very helpful with each other.

good,"Being given the opportunity to experience something new was a great learning experience since i hadn't worked in retail yet or a toy store. Going to work was always enjoyable since my co-workers were friendly, nice, helpful and easy going despite their authority statues. Since i was working seasonal, the hardest part of my job was probably having to be at work at 5 in the morning waiting for a customer to finally come in so i would have something to do because i would have free time after stocking and pricing."

good,A typical day would include collecting carts maintaining shelves and working as a cashier. With your main goal being to have customers sign up for the rewards card.
good,Although its a fun place to work it seemed that management would overbook employees and would end up sending people home alot. You would show up for a 8 hour shift and would end up being sent home 4 hours in or sooner. On top of that there was some days where we would have no work to do so we would just be standing around talking for almost half or over half our shift. Overall for me personally it was just a very unorganized and boring job to have.
good,Great starter job if toys r us didn’t go bankrupt I’d work there again was not a bad idea to work there but as I said it was a starter job so it’s nothing permanent
good,great company I love the flexible hours they had made it easy with my life at the moment. very responsible learned a lot with the help of the team very friendly
good,"Es un equipo perfecto realice allí mis prácticas y volvería a hacerlo, se descubren muchas cosas que no sabías de los juguetes."
good,I feel my work I did was not compensated monetary. And were not given adequate breaks that you deserve . and on your annual review you should only revive a raise of .25.
good,I enjoyed working here very much. the management was reasonable. assisted all coworkers if needed help in task or further explanation. didn't feel over worked or treated unfair
good,"J’ai travaillé pendant plus de 10 ans au sein de Toys’r’us à St Brice-sous-Foret.  Ça été une de mes plus belles expériences. La direction, les collègues sont géniaux. Le salaire n’est pas très élevé mais il faut aimé son travail pour vouloir rester. "

good,I really enjoyed working as a cashier meeting people fun new toys. Loved my co workers always  willing to help pay was reasonable could make my own schedule
good,"busy day at work , but wasn’t necessarily stressful . you could still accomplish things while having fun . the hardest part was maybe keeping your section as neat as possible and helping customers when they aren’t satisfied ."
good,This was a great job.  I learned a ton and developed a lot of customer service skills.  The store managers changed a lot.  Most were self centered and in competent.  The assistant manager was awesome.

good,I operated the cash register and bagged purchases.  There was heavy customer contact.  I enjoyed returning items to the sales floor as I was able to see our products.
good,This job was my life away from my family my coworkers were my other family. I loved this job with every part of my being. I just wished the company felt the same about us

good,I loved working here. Everyone was great and finding toys and putting a smile on their faces felt good. The managers were always understanding and they always ensured everyone felt like they were a part of a family.
good,i had great co workers that made the job a delight. i learned alot about system and inventory. loading and unloading deliveries was a breeze. i would work there again if benefits were better
good,"I only worked seasonal so i cant really give an appropriate review. But, it was an extremely relaxing job for anyone whom like a slow pace and night shift."
good,I have only been working here for a couple of months but I enjoy it.  My coworkers are helpful and friendly.  I like interacting with the customers.  The managers here are great to work for.
good,I'm really sad that ToysR Us is closing and still holding out hope that a buyer will pull through! We have an awesome team of people to work with and we are just a big work family! I will greatly miss working there and all my family!
good,Great people and culture.  Loved the team members and management.   Very supportive head quarters team.  Massive debt proved to be the obstacle to continued success and catalyst for bankruptcy.
good,I really enjoyed working at Toys R Us.  It was a fun and friendly environment working with toys.  Learned a lot about the business that will help in my future. Started as a seasonal employee in stores and made my way into the corporate office. I enjoyed working on Store Operations team as we worked directly with the stores and many other departments.  I met and worked with a lot of great people cross functionally on a daily basis in order to drive positive results. I am sad to see the company going out of business as I had hoped to further my career there.
good,"U get along with all your workers, u learn more than what u are taught, if you r good at your job you move up so u can make more money, is talking to other workers and laughing"
good,Management can be rude often and has been rude on many occasions. Other than this issue. All coworkers were pleasant and the hours were very flexible.
good,"Okay for the pay. Management was thorough.  Always had meeting when first arrived at work, so knew what to expect and what to do.  Always received mandatory breaks."
good,Stocking toys and helping guest buy fun for themselfs or friends. Able to choose where to stock items liked to put twenty dollar items at parent level and must have toy at childs eye level for sales bump.
good,Working Toys “R”Us is a blast. In the short time that I’ve been there I was already asked to be promoted to team leader. It’s unfortunate that the company has filed for bankruptcy because I believe I had a great future there.
good,I worked during Christmas time so it was very fast paced. I always received my required breaks even though we were very busy. The managers were also very helpful and made sure you had everything you needed for the day.
good,"It was an ok place to work for definitely not somewhere I'd work for my entire life, but it was a nice job for someone in school. Management could use some work though."
good,I loved it there.. we made sure everyone felt like a priority. I was the “go to” employee here I knew where everything you could think of was! Assisting children and parents was priceless I enjoyed the smiles every time!!
good,"The company is closing, so not much can be said that will matter in a few weeks. Had a great experience working there, learned a lot of new facets about working in a store with 108 employees and the holidays at a toy store. Good work environment, exceptional pay and benefits, the company really took good care of its employees."
good,Great Company too bad they never survived.  This was one of the best companies to work for and It's sad that it didn't make it due to the circumstances that happened.

good,"I work in five stores for Toys R Us, I moved to Midland for a year, the rest of my time with Toy R Us was in DFW area. I started as a assistant manager and promoted to store manger."
good,It was cool working at Toys R Us. I worked at the location in Citrus Park plaza. Nice people and everyone worked as a team. There were some tough Tims but nothing that the team couldn't get through together.
good,Usually I was placed at making boxes and organizing them. I learned to work with a team. Management was helpful. Co workers were great. The was not a hard part about this job. It is fairly easy. The most enjoyable part about this job was learning new things almost everyday.

good,"Love helping guest I go over and beyond my call to assist customers managers co-workers etc"
good,Toys 'R' Us is a good first job. It can be very quick busy during the holiday season but always a fun atmosphere to be in. After all who wouldn't want to be surrounded by fun toys all day.
good,Peccato che non esista più avevo iniziato come commessa ma presto responsabile di reparto
good,Fun place to work atound Christmas time you get 40+ hours but after Christmas you get about 20 hours a week but overall it’s a great job I would’ve stayed if there were more hours available or a full time position
good,I worked with many walks of life here. The job was stocking and restocking toys and furniture. It was amazing to see how a big box store operates and works with the public.
good,I specifically worked during the Christmas Season so it was always very busy. It was nice talking to the customers and hearing how happy they were going to be once they brought the toys home to their families. The most tiresome part of the day was handling the really long lines.
good,A typical work day at toys r us was very relaxing. I learned better costumer service work there. Management was okay until I met The store manager. The hardest part of my job was getting on my store managers good side.
good,"Although I was only there for the holiday season I highly enjoyed working for Toy's R' Us. I felt the work environment was extremely friendly and energetic, we had many procedures in place to ensure the safety of our employees, our customers, and the company so we were always clear on what the correct line of action was in almost any situation. I loved management they were a dream to work with and they were always accommodating to your time and scheduling. The HR liaison was extremely hands on and helpful. She handled literally everything from hiring all of the seasonal help, to conducting the group interviews (groups of 4 to 6 people), sifting through all the applications and then hiring the full time staff for the few positions that were available. The hardest part of the job for me was having to sell the credit cards and probably keeping what was on sale straight. The best part of the job was being able to make a little kids day by showing them exactly what they wanted or helping a parent pick out exactly what their kid wanted and showing them all the cool little parts that go with it and just knowing that your going to make that kids holiday because you were there and knowledgeable enough to be able to get the perfect thing. Also seeing the kids faces when we walked Jeffery through the store. I definitely learned a lot about how to conduct myself in a customer service setting while dealing with company issues, and also how to deal with customer related issues in an professional manner. My typical day at work usually consisted of working at the register for a few hours and"
good,"I applied to toys r us in the past two weeks indeed and on indeed, so I don't know how it is to work there, but I have shopped there in two thousand 4"
good,Stocking and working with clothes also on cashier meeting new people learning more kids toys and  baby wear being on time making sure department is clean
good,"Working for Toys R' us whether it was stocking or in the back grabbing placed orders or unloading a truck you were always busy. although organization was missing, the store could handle its self with management. my time working for toys r us taught me that to get something done you got to do it yourself. the hardest part of the job was keeping the workplace clean, but my most enjoyable time working here was the one night pulling a 13 hour shift. it was well worth it."
good,"easy great fun place to work at great supervisors and co workers self explanatory job. Lots of things you have to work on but very worth it. Easy money, seasonal jobs are great for the holidays they allow overtime during this time"
good,"This was a great company to work for. I was only a seasonal employee."
good,Its a very good place to work out you learn new things day by day  the staff are very nice respectful always hand going helps you with what ever you do not know
good,"The entire environment is open, always cleaned and reorganized during and after shifts, items are very sought after on both babies and toys/tech sections but management could be better as far as sales and productivity while as far as verbal harassment goes."
good,Toys R Us is not normally busy until the holidays which were most enjoyable. When the make a wish foundation came in with the children I would always ask to volunteer to assist the children in picking out their toys.  The lack of hours was the hardest part of the job.
good,"Start day by clocking in on time. Go straight to shipping and get fully charged RF scanner, Get pick tags for the day. Get a fully charged electric pallet jack. Go to assigned isle and get to work"
good,"my typical day at work was good i learned to do merchandizing, stock inventory, and customer service. The co-workers were very friendly with me i got anlong with everybody. the Manager was also a very nice person."
good,Nice atmosphere and cool managers. Customers with kids might be a hassle but very cool job. Best for a teenager tho. Seasonal at best
good,"The management of the company was great they have everything as its supposed to be breaks, lunch and time cards really organized. My co workers were super nice people overall they had a great environment to work."
good,"Toys R Us has an amazing family vibe, however the managing team really needs some work especially, the R US Credit Card is a big waste of time and money for the company all together. The managing team constantly pressures the whole team about these R US Credit Cards and they give the employees VERBAL WARNINGS when they shouldn't be pressuring their team in the first place. Not every Guest wants a CREDIT CARD because they won't get approved, they don't have time, they already have one, or they DON'T WANT ONE IF THE FIRST PLACE! I understand that the managing team is being pressured, but they shouldn't put their issues or problems on their employees, also the employees deserve some CREDIT too. After all, these hard working dedicated workers have given up literally their lives to this company and in return they should give back too. Instead of working on Thanksgiving, Easter Day, Memorial Day, July 4th, and other very important holidays they deserve not to work those days and be with their families. Is that fair to them what you do to these workers while you get to spend time with your family? They are at work making money for you while you get to have FUN! That's not fair also, I bet you never had to experiences rude guest or terrible complaints or bend back and forth for the guest or even sacrifice their birthdays to work while their family misses them. So, the next time your home with your FAMILY AND FRIENDS think about the employees who had to GIVE UP THEIR HOLIDAYS JUST SO YOU CAN HAVE EVERYTHING YOU WANT! GIVE BACK THE EMPLOYEES HOLIDAYS, NOW!!!!! Also, please just drop those"
good,"Toys r us was a retail store. nothing special, you work with toys instead of clothes. No big deal, just kids throw stuff everywhere."
good,"Daily duties included:"
good,customers were great there as well as some employees and management. the most enjoyable part was seeing people happy and changing someone's mood for being in a bad mood to leaving happy and glad they came in.
good,"Good company to work for benefits were fair, but long work hours. Management would hire from outside and was very little room for advancement."
good,It was a seasonal job and I wasn't looking for anything other than that. Would recommend for a part time job during the holidays.
good,"I enjoyed working for the toys r us company and learn how to work and manage myself in a high traffic environment, also met great people as i grew within the company."
good,Running register and returning items back to their shelves when customers decide they don't want them.  Straighten shelves.
good,I helped customers and made sure the store was kept neatly and organized. I worked quickly and productively. It was a very fun place to work.
good,great place to work as a seasonal employee. you work with a lot of nice people that make the day go by quick.along with learning a lot about the product in the store and helping the customers find items. loved it.

good,"My work place is a good communicative and supportive always."
good,"Great team players with amazing management."
good,"buen ambiente laboral, muy cerca de casa y una experiencia muy postiva"
good,Getting to be a grown up kid and getting paid to do it was the best job ever.  I really cant think of anything bad to say about it other than it shut down just shortly after I hired on.
good,"Some days were more busy than others. Managers were always flexiable and willing and ready to help. Always something to be done, customers and issues were handeled in an organized fashion."
good,Toys R us the only thing that made it great were the people.  We were a big family.  Work and advancement was a different story.
good,"Very big and will known company, can grow as employee. Management has nice environment with employee. Lab setups. over 1000 stores."
good,"Out of all of my previous working experiences, this one was the most beneficial and pleasant one I've had. a typical day at work  consisted of cashier duties such as processing the sale of toys and assisting customers in locating the right products."
good,"Everyone I worked with was fun yet professional. We knew how to have a good time but get the job done at the same time. My manager was amazing. Everyone was very understanding and worked with you for whatever reason. Perfect example of how a company should be ran. "
good,"Even though I was only a seasonal employee at Toys R Us they made sure to teach me as much as they could so I would have those skills to take to other employers. I transferred to Babies R Us after the holiday season and have been working there ever since. I transferred within the company to Chesapeake, VA for seven months then transferred back to Fort Wayne, IN."
good,Lots of fun on a daily basis. Most enjoyable part of the job was being able to play and get paid.  The least enjoyable part of the job was that the position was only seasonal for a temporary Toys R Us Express Store.
good,at his job we worked as a team and that is something i admire. here we got our schedules 1 week in advance so you knew when you were working and that's how you based your schedule on also i worked more than 2 days here.
good,"I loved working at Toys R Us because it was a fast paced, fun job. I got to get some real work experience and work with all around amazing people on a regular basis.I would come in and help straighten the shelves as well ask check people out at the cash register. I learned what it is like working in retail as well as customer service. My managers were always very friendly and i could ask them for anything and they would be there to help. I loved my co-workers because they included me in everything. The hardest part of the job was knowing that I was only a seasonal employee."
good,A typical day was like any other day. I spent most of my day on the register and the rest of my time was re-stocking shelves. I learned great customer service working here and the management was always there when there was a problem and i needed help. My coworkers were great people who always made my day interesting. The hardest part was searching for items that weren't out on the floor and having to find it ourselves in the backroom because our stock workers were no help. The best part was always during sales and holidays such as black Friday because i always enjoy the rush of people and staying busy.
good,A typical day at work would be coming into work and helping out customers who were on the floor. Moreover my job was to reshop and make sure the area I worked in was neat and tidy. The most enjoyable part of the job was working with toys and helping out customers. To see them find what they were looking for made that job so special; moreover delivering great customer service.
good,"i worked there in christmas , was very hectic but fun met alot of new people and was welcomed got to choose our own schedule."
good,"It was a great place to work. Lots of great people. Just a few bad apples in the management team that made doing my job very hard. I had the ability to sell products I love and enjoy, talk to customers and help them find exactly what they wanted and more. I made a lot of great friends working here. The atmosphere was nice and friendly."
good,"I love toys and children so this job was so much fun as a first job. While helping consumers, I did got to demonstrate haw new products work.(Which meant I got to play with them.) The hardest part of this job was trying to keep the children from riding the bikes through the store. That was not allowed, but other than that, this was a great starting job."
good,"Ambiente de trabajo cordial"
good,I only did seasonal work for ToysRus but the crew was always helpful  in assisting new comers like myself. Great management team!
good,"Responsibilities included greeting guests, helping guests find items, checking guests out at the register, price checks, re-shop, straightening the sales floor, customer service, etc."

good,"While working at Babies/Toys R' Us I was given the opportunity to gain other skill sets and to advance my knowledge with customer service procedures, baby products, and checking inventory with their weekly training programs. My co-workers were all amiable, as well as my supervisors and although my work schedule was a bit unorthodox, I never felt like I was treated unfairly and I was able to advance my training, as promised."
good,Had great time working here its just the pay was not that great.
good,"I loved my co-workers and my customers. I learned conflict management, customer skills."
good,"•	Replenished shelves and bins with merchandise by hand/pulling•	Physically removed goods from a truck, put empty pallets, security cages, and transfers back on the truck. "
good,"A normal day at work would be filled with either plenty of work, or enough of it to keep you busy and focused. About twice a week, we would receive a delivery truck filled with products. It was our job to sort out the products by isle, load them on U-Boats and place them within the section of the store which they belong. The rest of the night would consist of delivering them to the correct isle, breaking off into teams, and shelving, pricing, and stocking each isle. I learned that you need to be physically able to preform at these type of jobs, and that hard work pays off. Management was good, they really showed their appreciation for hard workers. Co-workers were somewhat good, in any work place you can sort the hard workers from the workers who ease by enough to stay on payroll. The hardest part of the job, was picking up slack of those who didn't keep up with the volume of work to be done. The most enjoyable part, would be the fun that can be had when two workers can talk and also produce an outstanding amount of hard work."
good,"Comes into work, everyone clocks in together, talk, joke, but get to business. "

good,"Assisted  customers with finding toys, always had the latest and greatest toys ever. Made customer feel happy."
good,"I worked here during the holiday seasons on the over night shift as a stock clerk. Some job duties included unloading merchandise from trucks, scanning in merchandise, placing merchandise on shelves, and cleaning up the store before it opened in the morning. Management was very friendly and easy to talk to. I got along with my co workers pretty good which helped the nights go by quicker."
good,"For me a typical day was to get there about ten minutes early greet a few people, put my things away then clock in. I learned how to scan items in and out of inventory and how to work at a very fast and productive pace. Toys R Us Management was very nice and well organized, they ran there store properly. Everyone I worked with was easy to get along with and all around great people, I never had problems with anybody. the hardest part of my job was making sure there were no flaws with my productivity while working with a high quality of customers.

I learned how to pack boxes to fix everything inside without have complications closing it. My co-workers were calm and collected, and ranged in different ages. The hardest part about this job was waking up for the early shifts, but the pay was the highest I've ever had working."
good,I liked working at Babies R us i just did not like the schedule some days early some days late. but over all the management staff was great and it was a fun fast paste environment
good,"A typical day is bringing a great mindset to work , giving your best to each and every customers , I've learned how to manage during a busy day , management was excellent with the learning process as-well were the co-workers , the hardest part was understanding when you was going to work , the best part was learning the store so when a customer ask you for something specific you know exactly where it is."

good,Investors tanked this company unfortunately but I absolutely loved working there and all the people I've met over the years. I hope it is brought back to the great brand it has always been. I would love to go back.
good,J’ai eu une bonne expérience dans cette entreprise. Je t’étais que saisonnier mais c’est passer très vite et les gens sont accueillant.
good,I love my job but it was difficult at times working at midnight exhausting and tiring it was go go home at 100am love my job but new managers never wanted me learn new jobs there to do different tasks miss helping customers interaction first manager was excellent work with funny outgoing caring respectful miss him calling me mr Anderson matrix was his favorite movie
good,"Nice place to work, in my opinion only down side was that the hours were done weekly, so you have no time to plan ahead your weeks, schedules were not set like other jobs."
good,"I grew so much as a person and cannot wait to go back again in the summer. It was one of my first jobs and honestly such an important experience for me to have. I started as this quiet, anxious, clumsy teenager and left for university as a confident, resourceful, and more patient young adult! Despite some occasional laziness, the management are great, like supportive parental figures or fun older siblings. The employees are some of the sweetest, most caring people I've ever met; I truly felt safe and appreciated in and out of work with these people. Learning here is really easy, and people are really patient with you when you're starting out. Yes, some days are rough (weekends especially), but employees work really hard as a team to get it all done. Breaks are emphasized as important, and are especially loved after a busy rush on a Saturday :) Seriously, I looked forward to going to work every day, Toys R Us and Babies R Us was and will always be a place for me to come and forget about all my other problems. I actually cried handing in my resignation letter when leaving for school this fall. Every job has positives and negatives, but here the positives most definitely outweigh the cons."
good,It was a great company to work for you just have to make sure you keep your work and life balance equal or you will be lose your mind. If my store was still around I wouldn't have ever left.
good,"Had a good management team and good team of employees. Stayed on process and teaching, coaching and mentoring was daily. Great customers to have shopping and everyone was treated like family."
good,"The people I worked with were awesome. It is a fun place to work. It was a very relaxed environment. Everyone got along and was willing to help, anyway they could."
good,"My typical day at work is on the main register greeting every guest that comes in. Smiling and having conversations with customers was one of the highlights of my job. My manager prepped us to greet and be friendly and overall it made the workplace light. The hardest thing about this job was the need for speed. When running the central register I would also be expected to answer phones, keep shelves tidy and etc. Being a team member meant putting all your efforts into whatever tasks set for you that day so on some days I may be just straightening shelves the entire shift. Often times I was expected to make sales on the floor and help customers."
good,"It is a super fun place to work you get to work around toys and it is stress free. Working dyeing Holliday’s is the best part, of course it’s the busy time of the year but I liked it."
good,I really liked working there and meeting new people. There people that I worked for are really nice. Especially my bosses. I also enjoyed looking at all the new toys that they had out for Christmas that you.
good,"I loved working for this company.  It was very sad to see it close."
good,"Especially fun around all holidays. Great place to work,friendly ppl, workers are young at heart, caring, management cares about employees. Great for high school students as well and seasonal workers."
good,To place a smile on each heart without knowing each customer by day is one of the most grand feelings this company can do. Also teaching you character
good,I was worked here for the holiday season and absolutely loved it. The management team was the best that I have ever encountered. They genuinely cared about their staff and recognized the work you did.
good,"I loved working the floor at Toys-r-us, but hated cashiering. They want you to push the credit card, even on other employees. Outside of that, it was a really fun job."
good,Would love to work at a place like this. Fast paced good people. I did cashier and I also stocked the shelves and did restock on occasion. I love working with a lot of people.
good,"It was very easy to work there and the people were very nice. The interview was very stress free and a quick and easy process. As well as training it, after one day of training they had you out by yourself and if you ever needed help, there was always someone near by to assist you."
good,I loved working at Toys R Us. The managers were really chill and weren't too strict. The work was pretty easy and help was usually always available. My fellow co-workers were real good people and I liked most of them. I would definitely work there again if given the chance.
good,"A complete walk of store condition with store manager to summarize what was and needs to be done in a certain time frame. Went to office to review the daily, weekly, front end metrics, warehouse logistics, cash handling ( confirm deposit and discrepancies ). Emails posted, time punches, truck deliveries and manifest. Being in a side by side ( attached ) Babies R Us I was unfamiliar with infant through toddler yet learned it quickly to capitalize on continuous increased sales. The workplace culture was very diversified allowing team members to provide excellent customer service. There was a slight resistance from employees who were with Toys R Us for a length of time with new expectations to be re-trained in processing these goals. Management had constant communication and strong support amongst ourselves."
good,Place is a great environment for retail.  Big store with many items made day go by quickly.  Enjoyed interacting with customers who were mainly shopping for their children.
good,i had a great time with them they were very friendly and they also cared about their staff everyone i worked with was great and helpful. i loved this job because i love to see the children's faces when they found what they were looking for
good,Really sad they went out of business. It was such a fun place to work.  Everyday was a new adventure and an opportunity to see tons of cute babies and help new moms find what they need.
good,"A fun and friendly workplace, only seasonal but I enjoyed the time I spent with the company. If offered I would have stayed on. Kinda sad that they are no longer open"
good,"Entering as part of a program gave me at first high expectations to myself, being my first job at a business and all. However I quickly grew more confident of everything thanks to really good co-workers that aid me and push me to do my best."
good,"Toys R Us is a pretty decent job to work at. It's fun and busy all the time. A typical day there is ringing or helping a customer with something. Making sure they leave the store satisfied. I learned how handles cash and returns, I also learned how to setup a customer for layaway's and pickups. The management their was very hands on and family oriented. The hardest part of the job was leaving and starting a another journey somewhere else. The most enjoyable part of the job was making the customers happy and store closing."
good,"The focus of the company was to ensure great customer experience."
good,Working at Toys R Us was enjoyable. There was an energizing atmosphere which made it a pleasure to be there. I enjoyed assisting customers with their purchases.
good,Very fun workplace. The manager was usually always involved with his/her employee's. Coworkers were always hard working and fun to work with. Overall Toys R Us was a great work experience.
good,"Toys ""R"" Us was a very fun place to work, very laid back and even paced except season but management always made sure your needs were met to keep you moving right along. You were fed often and drinks were always available."
good,"Overall I had a blast at Toys R Us. The work was over bearing at times, but it was a great learning experience. The co-workers I worked with were amazing and I had a great time. Its a shame Toys R Us went out of business, but most times, the best work, comes from the hardest path."
good,It was wonderful until it closed. I loved my managers they helped with everything in the store. I knew everything that I needed to do and I learned from register to Back of house
good,A good environment some days busy especially holidays you meet different people the kids were the most enjoyment I loved my job and the people I worked with daily
good,It was good from time to time and it was a good place to work. The management was god from time to time. The most enjoyable part was meeting new people and making friends.
good,The culture and relationships that the employees have with one another was something I had yet to experience until then. Everybody greeted each other everyday. Occasionally discussed life and interesting things happening outside of work on break. But most importantly tried to make the best out of any situation.
good,A typical day at work involved me putting stock out and helping guests. Once I became floor supervisor I was in charge of the electronics department. I learned how to lead and how to manage my time wisely.The workplace was very relaxed between coworkers. The hardest part of the job was the customers.
good,I loved my job...it was great to have good co workers and managers . We always worked as a team...and always hav each other back as a team.i couldn’t have asked for a better team
good,"I loved working at Toys-R-Us. I would definitely say it was my favorite job. My other employees and my managers alike treated me like I was family. The hardest part of the job had to be the credit card sales but in my first quarter of being employed there, I was in the top 5 for credit card sales."
