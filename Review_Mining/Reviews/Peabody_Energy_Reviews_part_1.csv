rating,review
bad,Not competitive with salary and benefits with other mines and industry.. this last drop in the coal industry has been tougher than any in the past. Conditions are difficult and are very difficult to manage with a less experienced workforce.
bad,"Long hours, inexperienced manager, barely tolerated by rest of the IT staff, severe competence issues with rest of IT staff, poor training, depressing offices, bad location downtown, bringer of stress into family life, entitled employees...typing this out saddens me to no end. Stay away."
bad,"This company is circling the drain along with the rest of the coal industry. It's evident in how they treat their employees. Management does almost nothing to recognize the hard work of the employees and we're all just numbers to them. Warm bodies, easily replaced. Turnover this year has been insane! Some 300+ people hired and only about 60 of them remained. They can't keep anyone here and as a result, they are forcing overtime in an effort to meet their production bonuses. If you value work life balance and time with your loved ones, don't bother."
bad,This job requires long hours with minimal notice.  The working schedule is not family friendly so if you have a family I would think twice.  The pay is good but that is about it.
bad,Mine is near town of Grant's pop 6000 so everybody working there is related or knows somebody who knows somebody if you catch my drift. Your related you move up quick your not you stay a driver for years. Awful job trucks are old and break down constantly. Peabody screws employees on overtime pay as well
bad,They fail to tell you there is MANDATORY OVERTIME on your 7 off. You get write ups for everything even if it is way beyond your control. They put you on step without  notifying you. They cant figure out why the employee turnover rate is so high because they are more interested in micromanaging people then mining coal. Neighboring mines have to turn away  applications and Peabody cant get people to apply.
bad,Trust No one in this company. Only way for advancement is to be in with the HR department (gross). There is no such thing as loyalty or commitment to the employees.
bad,Working with co-workers replacing troughing idler and teaching them how to put them back on. I enjoyed working with the train crew and loading the train.
bad,I was working there but I‚Äôm not any more but I‚Äôm enjoying life but the money was great and most of the workers to if not all of them but I do miss my crew
bad,They don‚Äôt hire on temps very often start at another mine if u can boys I got 4 months up in there the only one hired was female because the law says you have to there was a lot of good men temping down there till they got experience I seen expletives not by choice there and those were the bosses favorites so you know I didn‚Äôt snitch for my career sake                    Don‚Äôt put your family in this situation you could be outa work. I gave two weeks to hr so the top boss couldn‚Äôt tell me to leave right away but he did three days later messed up my family‚Äôs income...and told me I didn‚Äôt live where I do whatever be safe boys god bless the coal miner.    ‚õèüëçüèº
bad,Everybody out there is related friends family old coworkers everybody‚Äôs P&h  HR is a joke up there You‚Äôll spend most of your time driving around and work trucks waiting on them to make a decision on how to do a job
bad,poor Management and Work environment. They don't compensate for travels. They Keep Dropping their insurance and Benefits Package to lower quality. Are enforcing Mandatory overtime.
bad,Never going back as their turnover rate is insane and morale is at an all time low with forced overtime to try and meet the demands of upper management.  People with 15-25 years of loyalty to the company are walking away to other jobs and management just keeps pushing.
bad,"I don't know about other  operations but the two I worked for are almost identical. Very low employee moral, management uses scare tactics to manage employees."
bad,Great workforce. Corporate America atmosphere. Had to deal with the politics of coal. Faced layoffs everytime the politicians changed views. Never felt job was secure.
bad,I enjoyed the variety of my job responsibilities and was able to work with intelligent people who have worked there for 20+ years. The hardest yet most enjoyable part of my job was learning database work and dealing with MSHA.
good,Decent place to work.  But has got less competive in the coal market.  Working 6 days a week with worse insurance every year and the future of the coal mine looks weak.  I just want a good job with insurance so I can raise my family and live a decent life without worry of lay-off and my benefits being lowered
good,good paying job but long hours & weekends not much job advancement opportunity not a very secure industry with all the closures of coal powered power plants
good,Long 12.5 hour shifts. Training was very good. Management was always the problem no thanks for the effort put in and the moral is very low due to this.
good,"Morning meetings,Review work list,Make sure permiss is caught up,Work with vendors on longwall move rebuilds,Work with vendors on temp labor,Go in the mine to check on operations"
good,The only reason for change is due to the swing shift rotation which does not allow me to see my family and allows for more safety concerns with the employees rotating day and night shifts.
good,"Not a bad place to work, but the supervisor I worked for would not take me off a piece of equipment that I didn't want to run when there were other co-workers that wanted to do the job I was doing.  I also could not relocate and driving 2 hrs one way every day was costly"
good,"Straight up this company helped me get back on my feet and get me to where I am today, for that I am thankful but I won't say its all roses and good times. My coworkers for the most part are good people, but once mid tier (and higher) management is involved, things start to go downhill. Management could use a lot of work on how to be more effective leaders; personal feelings and politics towards someone keep that person from ever advancing even if they would be the best fit for a position. Not a bad company to work for, just the management makes it difficult some days."
good,"The company had several sales of the year and have special nights of sales with additional discounts for workers."
good,"Been a good place to work, co-workers are all pretty good an knowledgeable. Management could promote more from the inside then outsourcing."
good,"I always reported to the CEO and was always a Member of the Executive  Management Committee.  I joined the company at age 57 and was 71 when I left as part of corporate succession planning. At that age I may have set the record for the oldest Member of the Executive Management Committee in the history of a company over 100 years old. Within two years after I left, Peabody went into bankruptcy and my equity was zeroed out."
good,"Get your work done fast and safe to keep production moving, keep things moving safely, management could be reconditioned to find new and easy ways to do jobs"
good,"I enjoyed my job and the guys I worked with. "
good,Enjoyed it while it lasted. Shut down for whatever reason they choose to claim. A lot of good workers underground but the guys in the offices uptop like to play cut throat.
good,Peabody coal mine was a good place to work for compensation and health insurance but the hours were a little heavy on night shift could not see my family very much at all
good,"Peabody Energy was a former leader in coal production, providing new technologies to assist in production and new coal consumption. My role as a   Business Analyst afforded me the opportunity to learn the nuances of the coal industry."
good,The culture was corporate but relaxed and friendly.  I learned a lot as I had never worked for a coal company before.  The management staff was available and represented the values well.
good,Good paying job for the area.  Good benefit packages.  Provides good equipment operating experience for new operators.  Decent equipment.  Very good emphasis on Safety.
good,company filed bankruptcy due to environmental concerns and strict regulations that weigh on the coal industry. people were very friendly and professional.
good,Peabody Energy has been a great place to work and wonderful place to learn new talents and skill sets. I believe these new skill sets will help improve my five years experience in the oil field to make me a great asset to your company.
good,Nothing to say about this company. People are Great but there are others who will do anything to hurt you (sorry to say). Glad to be out of there
good,A good place to work every day was a challenge with something new to learn . The days are long and hard but by the end of the day the job was done and done right. At peabody we work as a team
good,"Working underground did a lot of shoveling along belt lines , setting timbers and building cribs. The most enjoyable part of the job was working with the deferent people"
good,"Typical day starts at 4:30 AM with two pots of coffee made and looking at equipment positions from the previous day. Determining the amount moved and looking ahead to address the morning shift change."
good,To many upper management positions and a major lack of communication between them but all and all the quality and comradery of the hourly employees more then make up for it
good,"Good company operating well in difficult circumstances. Very smart people to work with, and a first class environment."
good,"They closed our mine unexpectedly, and put most of us in the free cheese line."
good,money is the bottom line as always in the corp world. Employees are not the number one priority.
good,"Dealing with challenges in the global coal market.  Recently emerged from bankruptcy.  Making the best of challenging market conditions, declining sales and pricing constraints."
good,"Work was always challenging with the shear size of the mine and the broad nature of the environmental issues that would arise daily. Enjoyed learning the Native American culture and past traditions that Peabody tried to assist with. "
good,"There were many days of complete chaos where mine planning didn't exist and adlibbing was the norm."
good,"Unfortunately, Peabody is caught in a currently troubled industry and is suffering for it.  There continues to be good compensation for employees which is important for keeping the loyal workforce."
good,"i have a good work life balance in peabody energy"
good,"Coal companies have struggled over the past few years in order to stay in the black and maintain a profit.  Because of the climate in the political spectrum, coal does not appeal to some groups.  However, clean coal has been a major source of fuel and as a raw material in metallurgical needs for building steel.  It is also a very stable, low cost source of fuel which the electrical companies turn in to electricity.  That being said, coal companies are struggling and Peabody is no exception.  As a place to work I would highly recommend looking elsewhere as the future of coal may dampen expectations of a successful career."
good,overall it was a good place to work.good fellow employees and a family atmosphere.if coal wouldn't of lost it value and need from government restrictions i would probably still be working there today.
good,"Peabody is a wonderful company to work for. The benefits outstanding the pay and time off the best I've had. At NARM the employye/vendor count the same as a medium sized town and the fact of being a ""number"" and not looked upon as an individual had it's draw backs.  Career advancement outstanding and witnessed move up the corporate ladder."
good,"Great pay and benefits.  Not a good job for people who like to think.  If you like to drink coffee and do mindless work, this will be a great job!"
good,"I worked a 12 hour shift, five to six days a week. I got 2 vacations a year with the ability to earn extra paid days off. We didn't have sick days. The bosses in the pit were great to work with.  The job was hard and stressful, but at the end of the day I provided for my family."
good,Great benefits and close to home. They have great 401K and good pay.  I enjoyed having bosses that worked along side of me and trained me well. They taught me how to communicate with some difficult people and work on my computer skills.
good,Peabody is currently downsizing due to financial constraints.  The company will need to continue with a change in strategy to continue to be a major force in the market.
good,"As a production operator it was my requirement to meet a min of 10000 BCM a day, which on most days was achievable depending on trucks, single bench, double bench."
good,"A typical work day is pretty fast paced and non stop.  I've learned a lot from my time with the company and became one of there best in Maintenance do to my hard work and the training they provided throughout the 14 years as a employee for Peabody Energy.  You become pretty close to your co-workers and everybody was always willing to help another if needed to which was great.  Honestly every part of my day is hard.  Always troubleshooting problems, fixing machines, dealing with electrical issues.  The most enjoyable part of my day was taking a shower after my shift was over because i knew i was going home to spend time with my family.  The reason i'm going to leave is because of the wear and tear on my body.  It's just time to move on."
good,"work day included fueling equipment and making repairs and completing preventative maintenance to mining support equipment ."
good,Benefits and pay are among the best in area.  The management on the other hand probably worst in class.  Since the closing of a mine to the north this mine has been taken over with the same philosophy as the mine that closed.  These boses are production driven with safety second and compliance a distant third.  Cart in front of horse backwards thinking.  Worry about msha after a citaion has been written or is on property.
good,I enjoyed the  people I worked with I love the environment being outside. Working different shifts what's hard but it's worth it to get 7 days off per work cycle.
good,Time off is great. The pay could be better seeing that we work rotating shifts and holidays. Could have a better training on jobs. The performance reviews could be updated also.
good,"It was a good job. Learned a lot about operating different types of heavy equipment, made a lot of money. Started off with plenty of overtime opportunity."
good,Rotating schedule is hard on family life.  Work was ok.  Management good use some work.  Pay and benefits are good. Compensation for tools was good.  They offered training which was good.
good,"Operating various underground mining equipment."
good,"Work hard as a team, communication was good. The management treaded the men will. Co-workers some work hard and some did not. Hardest part of the job was to keep some of the men motived. The enjoyable part of the job was out mining the other crews and get paid at a decent wage for the hard work. And safety is a top priority."
good,"A typical day I was busy opening and closing problem tickets, monitoring, and ensuring tape rotation."
good,Good place to work depending upon which department you are in.  They are really trying to boost morale since emerging from bankruptcy.  Health benefits are very poor and have to pay out a lot for deductibles no matter which health care plan you choose.
good,"good job. good people to work with. 12 hour shifts, and rotating shifts. work outside in all kinds of weather. extreme heat and extreme cold. able to learn new things."
good,Hard working dedicated people made the job interesting.  Job involved a substantial amount of travel.  Peabody provides a lot of training and development opportunities.
good,Great company with good benefits but hasn't adapted to changing commodity prices and therefore not positioned well to other energy sources becoming more competitive.
good,Took a physical exam at a local clinic. Requires lifting walking on a treadmill for two miles. Stacking item's on an overhead shelf. A chest exray  blood pressure test.
good,"Company as a whole is hard to understand at times , the not wanting to hurt people‚Äôs feelings when there not doin there job is a little bit ridiculous but overall a good place to work."
good,Worked with some great people.  Felt like a family.  The industry was just going through a tough time.  Would recommend and would go back if they had current job desired available.
good,"Very hard work with lots of hours. you can make a lot of money if you wish. All of the overtime you want. A good company to work for if you are young, single and willing to work nights and weekends."
good,"At the start of shift we had a safety meeting and then begin our shift. I learned multiple skills while working at Peabody Energy, such as maintenance and equipment operations. The management at Peabody Energy varied from day to day. The workplace at Peabody Energy was productive and busy but could also be somewhat relaxed and fun to work in. The hardest part of working at Peabody Energy was not the job itself but the shift which was thirds. The most enjoyable part of working at Peabody Energy was being able to call myself  hard working Coal Miner."
good,I worked here for over ten years including the time I was contracted by a temp agency. The mines were forced to lay off people last year and I was one of the ones they laid off.
good,"-Oversee the operations of the preparation plant: loading trains, basic plant maintenance, operating the control room which oversees the computer systems for train processing and the actual control of plant systems"
good,"Pay is good, benefits are good, Schedule is hard, long hours at work but equal time off, overtime is usually available. Opportunity to operate the biggest earth moving machines in the world."
good,I worked for Peabody Energy for 7 years. Peabody if a great place to work for just need more job security. The pay at Peabody is well worth the hard work and dedication.
good,Has been a great company to work for. Drive to North antelope Rochelle mine is long and company doesn't pay drive time. Though the job is stable and most people on minesite are friendly and easy to work with.
good,Very good pay and plenty of vacation days insurance is not the best 401K match is decent yearly bonus is pretty good no sick days very safety oriented company
good,"12 hour shifts with 28 day rotating schedule with 4 other crews.  Tech advancement opportunity every year with pay raise.  Quarterly safety and production bonus, 200 hours time off every year.  Paid working holidays double time or option for triple time using 12 hours of PTO.  Upper management has some lacking, favoritism and personal preference for who becomes boss,  HR disciplines more than helps/protects.   Long hours and commute is generally an hour,  but buses are available.  Working with coworkers is generally a blast if you have the right supervisor"
good,ok company to work for..the only reason I left was because I wanted to be closer to home for work was missing out on way to much at home..so choose a job with more at home time.
good,Pay is good...insurance could be better...people are ok... close to home...decent job for an area without a whole lot of choices for making good money
good,I worked for Peabody for 30 years. I started out as a temporary and then was hired for full time. It gave me a great career and gave me a lot of knowledge in running heavy equipment and how to manage people.
good,I've enjoyed working for Peabody Energy just looking to relocate. It has been a fair company to work for trying to do the best it can through its troubled time.
good,"You will work a lot of Saturdays, 6 day weeks, in order to be productive.They have a big focus on safety. All the main rules come down from an educated corporate level instead of actual coal miners."
good,They let me grow and learn as much as i was willing.Put safety above all.
good,Peabody Energy is a huge coal company that provides excellent opportunities and experience.
good,"Everyone looked out for one another. Was like an extended family. Fair pay, sick and personal days. 80 hrs vacation and extra days for not missing Some bosses where great others not so much. Just like anyplace."
good,Work as an Intern there and they extended me another 3 months. Very friendly people that care about you and your career advancement. Would definitely come back if asked to stay.
good,"$100,000 a year at 60 hours a week. Cadillac insurance for a reasonable price. Get to learn all the trades if you‚Äôre a driven person and want to do so. Or if you want to just sit on your butt all day and operate, that pays around $90,000 per year. 240 pto hours a year starting off... max out at 320"
good,"A typical day at work is getting to work on time, doing my job and going home safely.  I have learned many levels of safety. To operate many kinds of equipment and be a team player. Therefore, this allows me to compentantly and safely with co workers. The hardest part of the job is the politics in the workplace. The best part or the job is getting my jobs done safely and in a timely manner and taking pride in what I have accomplished."
good,The employees would treat each other like family.  They had different equipment that u can learn. The bosses would talk to the employees if they can. Most employees would hang out and talk to get to know the other.
good,Peabody Energy is a good company to work for.  There are great opportunity for you to advance within the company.  They are located in downtown St Louis MO. near  Cardinal stadium.
good,"People around me were inspiring is well."
good,This company was good to work for.  Management was very nepotistic and didn't hide the fact that they used favortism towards certain employees on a daily basis.
good,We had excellent teamwork. We worked closely together operating heavy equipment in close proximity to each other. The most difficult part of the job was the night shifts.
good,Enjoyed working for Peabody but was a casualty of negative industry headwinds that required significant staff reductions.
good,"Typical office environment."
good,"Wonderful place to work,competitive,great pay,wonderful stability,decent insurance management is less than desirable! Just received WARN notice so the mine I work at will be closing soon, but it‚Äôs been a good run.Would have liked to retire here."
good,Peabody does an excellent job of prioritizing safety and that is important to me. I have worked with Peabody prior to being hired by Peabody through a contractor and the experience was good.
good,"Worked at Peabody Energy with great people. Workplace culture was awesome and always interesting. The most enjoyable part of working with Peabody was the people. I've gotten to know so many great individuals while working there. Hardest part of the job was the work hours, since the setting was a large scale mining operation it was set out in a remote location so traveling took time from any direction you coming from."
good,"this job will work you at your pace, it will make you think and if you enjoy change this is perfect.  I thoroughly enjoyed my time there and the great pay."
good,Peabody Energy is not a good place to work for. They do not treat their employees like people. Some men have worked for the company 20+ years just to be left out to dry when their time was up or new management.
good,"Great pay and benefits , but they are earned. Long hours and night shift. Good work environment, Good management. Fast-based environment. Always on the go. Had to work outside in all types of weather."
good,"Overall good place to work. Good benefits, competitive compensation and opportunity for advancement. Friendly work environment and good location downtown STL."
good,"Good working, if you like the outdoors. Work on all kinds of electrical equipment and computer systems. Good management and bosses and working schedule."
good,It is a shift work type job so if you don't like working nights stay away. On a average day I was able to just do my job and relax. Sometimes things would brake down and they would need fixed as soon as possible. You hade to pay attention and watch your surroundings so that you could catch the problem before it got out of hand.
good,"Big mine like running big equipment and the pay it s a great place to work I  like that safety is number one on there list, the only thing is you only get one wkend off a month I'm just ready for a little more down time to spend with my family."
good,"Long days but rewarding to get through the daily workload"
good,I have worked with Peabody Energy for more than 10 years. Working with exceptional minds on a diversity of projects was an invaluable experience. Good work life balance and excellent work environment and company culture
good,"Peabody offered a voluntary separation package this year for those who where eligible and I fell into that category.  I found Peabody a great place to work and I had a very good supervisor with good benefits.  I have learned a great deal about the coal industry during my employment with Peabody.  I am ready to start the next chapter in my life and hopefully, that will be with your organization."
good,I really enjoyed the people I worked with but its hard to be in the coal industry right now so moral was low.
good,"Preventative maintenance mechanic"
good,"Typical day issue and stock parts shipping and receiving, load and unloading semi trucks with fork lift, purchasing and expiditing orders."
good,Underground coal mining is a fast paced environment with high expectations for productivity as well as the safety of fellow employees working side by side to ensure the company earns profit and you make a  paycheck and return safely to your family at home.
good,"Inspected equipment during lineup.  Maintained equipment and make repairs when needed.  Good work environment, got along good with co-workers and supervisors."
good,"Nice company, nice people. Just the pace of working is relatively slow"
good,"I had a good superviser and we work good together as one. "
good,I liked my boss and my coworkers. It was easy to divide my time between the field and the office. Very good pay.
good,"Good place to work, however the 12+ hour shifts on top of a hour plus drive each way was exhausting."
good,"Good work environment. Paid every two weeks. Good health benefits, life insurance, and retirement. Enjoy working for this company and would definitely recommend working here."
good,I was an apprentice electrician here for one summer for an internship .I really liked the people and the work was fun as well. I learned a lot from working out here and the overtime was always a special bonus.
good,I liked the time off. Great bonus opportunity . Could use better management. Fast paced and always busy. Be ready to walk a lot of stairs and get  really dirty and wet
good,I have really enjoyed working for this company. One of the best companies I have worked for in a very long time. I have had some of the best and hard working co workers along with very attentive bosses.
good,Working at Peabody energy was a very good experience and I would recommend it to anyone interested in the field of coal mining. A very good company with a good history.
good,Has been a good place to work but unfortunately it is ending 31st October 2017 - have been rewarded for my hard work and dedication to my roles and flexibility has been good
good,Peabody energy was a good place to work for. They made sure employees where well trained in there job and followed all safety policies and laws. Always had overtime if you wanted it

good,"Peabody Energy is a great place to work."

My assignment was to launch, develop and implement a maintenance training program designed to make our technicians more efficient at troubleshooting and repairing our mining equipment, to increase equipment availability and lower maintenance cost, while at the same time reducing lost time accidents and equipment damage. "
good,"Peabody Energy has been an exceptional employer.  My work experience over a 27 year career in civil/construction engineer has provided me with a ""hands on"" education which I will be able to carry forward into my next career."

The hardest part of my job is making sure all employees are working safely and staying in compliance in a hazardous environment. The best part of my job is being part of something great and sending miners home daily to there families safe.
good,Peabody was and enjoyable place to work at.  Management was generally supportive and helpful. The most enjoyable part of my job was that it was challenging and fresh.  The nature of the position provided the challenge and opportunities to learn and explore new areas to benefit the company's operation.
good,"When I would arrive at work at the Peabody Energy, I thought that it was very easy. Also, it was tiring toward the end of the, but I still loved every bit of it. Something that I learned about working for Peabody was the operating equipment and the maintenance. The management was very understanding about certain things. The workplace culture was fun and interactive. Finally, the most enjoyable part of the job was driving the equipment."
good,Great place to work. just left for family reasons. Did not have any problems with the mine or its staffing. give it a shot if you are interested in it.
good,Peabody always provided training opportunities for both the equipment and/or to improve job skills.  I enjoyed working with others teaching them how to work safely and effectively while doing their job.  Hardest part of the job was being able to eat lunch within a reasonable time while working a 12 hour shift.

good,Peabody was an excellent company to work for. The people that work there are a cut above and that was evident everyday. I would highly recommend Peabody to anyone

good,The job was a great job with great benefits. I learned all of my heavy equipment operating there. Lots of room for job advancement. Hardest part of the job would be the work schedule.
good,"Its a very productive mine operation, bout 1200 employees,"

good,Awesome place to work. Was close to my house. Was a great place to succeed in trying other equipment and i also learned many thing there. Great opportunity to move up
good,You did your job and supervisors left you alone. Pay was great. $32 per hour. On sundays we were paid double time so I made $520 in 8 hours. The staff were mostly all good to work with. They trained you on equipment.

good,"i loved working for Peabody Energy and would do almost anything to get a start back in the mines with them great company and great culture"

Different patterns were envolve also mangement encouraged safety first and production followed.my coworkers worked hard daily to get the job done there were 13 on the crew.Elements were the hardest part of the job rain,snow and the wind.Enjoyable part was finishing the pit,hiwall or casting the shot."
