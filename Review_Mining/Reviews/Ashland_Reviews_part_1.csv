bad,"Always paid late, the guy is nothing more that a thief for tools. As I've been trying to get mine back of him for awhile now with no success. Oh and he is nothing more than a bully!"
bad,"Workplace culture has changed drastically after the buyout of ISP and Ashland took over.  It is very demoralizing.  "
bad,"1.A Typical day was  awfull"
bad,"have heard of better companies to work for. Ashland has down-sized every year that I worked there, taking jobs from hard working Americans and sending the jobs over seas to India, China, Mexico and others."
bad,"A negative culture on a daily basis."
bad,"Id cdrove a tow buggy around the production lines and dumped trash, cardboard, and oily plastic and would then put them back on the production lines.."
bad,Ik heb veelal vanuit mijn thuis kantoor gewerkt daar mijn directe collega's in de US verblijven.
bad,"Previous management used to be awful, then they hired a new plant manager and also a new operations manager. Things started to look up, until they named a condescending, ruthless, arrogant, self absorbed, swell head Plant Supervisor. Operators are worked to the ground with little to no appreciation from the egomania supervisor. Instead of giving you credit where credit is due, he’ll boost himself up. If you like okay pay, terrible health insurance, constant insults from your Supervisor then this is the place for you!"
bad,Working for this company was stressful because you never know when your job was going to be eliminated.  My manager tried to make it as pleasant as possible.  He was always available to help with concerns.
bad,An awful narcissist became the supervisor and now he makes all the operators hate their job.  He is a miserable person.  It used to be a good place to work...now I hate going in.  He sucks!
bad,"Excelente ambiente de trabajo"
bad,"There is a huge divide between the working team and the management team. If you are lucky enough to be in the management team, then you get to run around, puff out your chest and make other feel small. "
bad,Typical work day at Ashland Inc. involves interfacing with external partners like banks and establishing effective interfaces for data going to and coming from the partners.
bad,Compensation and wages where decent. The rest was more a joke then anything else.
bad,"Good company to start in an entry level management position. Some  automotive experience will help, but is not required. You will send your day working with a crew of 4-6 and be responsible to manage and coach them. Profitability is very important to the company, so providing the customer with the services to keep their automobile performing at top levels."
bad,"Days started early and ended late. Totally loved my job and what I did daily, Enjoyed interaction with my many co-workers. "
bad,"Fabrication de matières plastique, travail difficile, port de charges,"
bad,"If you like doing monotonous work day in and day out in a basement exposed to the elements in P.P.E (personal protection equipment) covered in oil and sweat from other employees for little pay, than this is for you"
bad,"This facility has been around since the second World War. What's interesting is that it probably has the same culture and work mentality of that time. Management is very hardore, heavy handed, work conditions and environment are bad, and because of such high employee turnover, people who are left are MADE to work every off day until they say otherwise. what can i say; a labor camp disguised as a workplace."
bad,There is a great deal of dedicated people who are not given the recognition for there hard work and dedication. There is truly a lack of team training and understanding of working together in cross functional teams to help improve processes.
bad,"•	Going through different documents (HLD, AID) to know and best understand the project/application functionalities and features."
good,"llegas como personal de nuevo ingreso y no se te da induccion a tu puesto como donde encontrar el material de empaque ,que documentos se deven llenar , de donde sacas la herramienta para trabajar,no existen hojas de trabajo o alguna ayuda visual y practicamente terminas haciendo todo como Dios te da a entender"

good,"faced paced outdoor enviroment, strong customer focus, good training to a certain level within the store"
good,"It’s a company with a large international presence so it’s great to work in an environment with individuals from around the world, therefore increases your knowledge culturally.
