rating,review
bad,"Through my tenure with IGT, I interviewed for 21 separate positions at various times, sometimes, receiving second interviews."
bad,"IGT was purchased in 2015 by GTECH.  Since then the company has done nothing but go down hill financially and culturally.  Employees in Reno, NV are treated like just numbers and leadership is awful.  Leadership cannot seem to make a decision about anything and are too worried about trivial stuff.  Materiality is a thing of the past.  Leadership does not hold employees accountable and have allowed ignorance and playing stupid to take over how business is run."
bad,"Company started out great and was a fantastic place to work until about 5 years ago. Now it is a company with low morale, poor culture, poor management not being held accountable, and very little regard for it's employees.  Low wages are supplemented by worthless stock offerings.  Not given tools to complete jobs."
bad,"Used to be an incredible place to work. However, in the last 5 years IGT has become a very oppressive place to be due to constant layoffs and poor management. No job security with a ""do more with less"" mentality. Management is very poor as there is no direction or career paths. IGT is no longer a place that values it's employees. Benefits have decreased and bonuses are no longer given."
bad,"The daily work is easy. Not busy most of the time, but can get hectic with large projects. Most of the time you are working remotely so have little to no contact with a supervisor or manager. "
bad,"I learned a lot during my time with IGT so for that reason I am glad to have worked there. "
bad,"I like most people was very excited to join this company 6 years ago. It took care of it's people as well as it's customers. As the case with a lot of market leaders IGT relaxed in it glory years. The surrounding competitors became more and more innovative. In short IGT lost it's completive edge. When I married into this company after retiring form the US Navy I felt I made a great choice. This was a very stable company that had long term employees. The company treat the people very well, cash sharing, holiday parties etc to show the hard worker they cared. As the world market took a hit upper management decided to reduce forces change CEO and upper management staff. In my option this was the start of some not so well thought out business move to save money. I am a firm believer in getting input form the process owner. At the 50,000 mile view we can't make sound decision to adjust a process the we just don't know. As a market manager I was never once asked my option on how I would improve my market to save overhead cost. If I would have been asked, I would have recommended, a work from home staff. The building in this market was not needed. The cost of maintaining the building is not needed. The Tech sent less than 2% of there time in the building and the admin could have a much better work life balance working from home. Techs are leaving for other jobs due to lack of trust in company and job security."
bad,"IGT was an amazing place to work, once upon a time. Managers were supportive and up-lifting. Employees were treated very well with cash sharing and flexibility. That has all changed. It has become extremely political, so much so that creativity has been stifled. People in management only want their voice to be the loudest and good ideas cannot come from anywhere. You very much have to stay in your lane. Good work is not rewarded, instaed it is seen as a threat by people who are not as talented as you are. Women are not supportive and men are placed into positions of power rather than interviewing."
bad,Management seems to not care about its employees. I have to travel all the time. Instead of replacing employees that have left they have just shifted there jobs to other departments that put a strain on the current employees and has cause massive burnout throughout the company.
bad,Good stepping stone for a career but limited growth and good performance and accomplishments don't translate to increased compensation. Management depends on your department.
bad,"The employees at IGT are what makes this place a family work environment. Unfortunately, over the past few years managements focus has changed from career development and advancement of existing dedicated loyal employees to outside hiring of the majority of open positions creating an environment of limited development and advancement options. The experience that can be gained from working at IGT is phenomenal and there is always a challenge, there is always continual change, which is wonderful. Everyday I learn something new and create and/or strengthen the remarkable work relationships that I have built over the past two decades. I will forever be grateful for the amazing opportunities that I have been given and know this experience will only make me a stronger asset to the next opportunity that I am fortunate to accept."
bad,Innovation and change is needed but entrenched culture from preponderance of long term gaming folks preventing changes to stay competitive for the future.
bad,"There was no time type of time card system. At the end of every week I would write down my hours on a piece of paper and give it to my manager. Learning how a typical day would go was a little difficult due to poor training. It was as if I was expected to know exactly how things worked prior to starting my job there. This was also the case with the employees, most would give vague answers and demonstrations on how to do a particular task. Although, the work environment was difficult to decipher at the beginning, it came with time and my ability to work efficiently followed shortly after."
bad,Assisted between 10 to 15 Customer with System Issues.
bad,"The corporation has grown to be too large.  To influence change is near impossible.  Far too many layers, far too many hands in the pot, no autonomy, and very inefficient."
good,"Typical manufacturer job - it department - expect lots of hours, good training for IT folks -- still an ""old boys"" network which is unfortunate.  Hired last first to go"
good,"tough place to work. no real direction or business plan, no sense of strategic direction, no sense of community.  If you hae the right boss it can be bearable."
good,"Pay was slightly above average, but they want a non-compete in exchange for that.  They made a habit of getting rid of older engineers, leaving the rest of us in a pickle due to the lost ""tribal knowledge"".  I wouldn't work here if I were you except for a little while-- treat it as a ""gig"" and not a ""career"".  Because everything is wrapped up in miles of red tape (and needs a long string of approvals from a long chain of useless micro-managers), getting anything done is practically impossible.  Over time, this tends to kill your soul-- and takes all of the joy of engineering out of the job."
good,"The culture is not employee focused. Although you are not required to work a lot of overtime, your time spent there is very draining. Upper management often sets unrealistic expectations."
good,"The main workers are good at their jobs, but they are always under threat of the next layoff, which has been regular for the last few years.  Much of management, including upper management, are not smart enough to be effective nor understand the technologies that they make important decisions about.  Management does as little as possible to avoid advertising their ineffectiveness while they emit useless verbiage when forced to.  It seems that some of upper management fear being out-done by subordinate managers, and so the ineffective managers have job security.  Hopefully Gtech will recognize this overpaid dead weight and finally rid the company of this major barrier that has been holding them back."
good,Typical day includes meeting with foreign national employees to prepare petitions and applications to obtain work authorization. On-going development of corporate affirmative action plan. Position was as an individual contributor with minimal interaction with co-workers limited to obtaining relevant information to support client-employees. Worked closely with outside counsel and internal executive management. Co-workers were team-based groups assigned to specific areas of HR. Hardest part of the job was remaining neutral in a competitive work environment. Most enjoyable part of the job was making it possible for foreign nationals to have the right to live and work in the U.S.
good,"I will miss the flexible hours and paid time off.  Newer management caused me to feel less appreciated almost instantly.  I gained more responsibilities over time that I was underprepared for.  IGT forced you to sign a non-compete, which was purely leverage for them to make it harder for you to leave the company and easier for them to underpay you.  Office politics were demoralizing.  However, at the end of the day, I am grateful for the opportunities this company gave me."
good,"Depending on the department your in you will experience some politics and bureaucracy when you try to advance. If you have a degree but no experience, or the experience but no degree, you can expect to be steamrolled. There are good perks at IGT but job satisfaction and fair advancement isn’t one of them. If you stick around for 30 years, then you can expect some respect and maybe a promotion. Unless of course they’re desperate to fill in a position and you’re their last resort. ."
good,IGT is professionally challenging environment...lots of opportunities to learn.  The environment is very fast-paced and stressful.  Work/life balance isn't the best especially when working on time sensitive projects.
good,"Flexible with family, benefits expensive, 401k not that great. Upper level management not really present and no communication to employees. Co-workers good to work with"
good,"A leader in the industry had the worst company culture anyone could imagine! From the day I first started working, I knew something was not right!"
good,"IGT is not really IGT anymore. International Game Technology was acquired by GTECH (which was previously acquired by a company in Italy). The 'new' IGT, is but a shell of a formerly great company."
good,Good place to work and immediate management is supportive. Company was recently bought out and as to be expected layoff's have been a big part of the merger.
good,The upcoming Gtech/IGT merger has a lot of employees uncertain about their future roles and the direction of the company.
good,Las Vegas Manufacturing is very different than other areas of IGT. The morale is in the gutter due to poor leadership from the director on down. Managers walk around the production floor and ignore everyone except a couple of favorites. The supervisors are never seen and the PC manager speaks to no one. Very cold vibe and emotionally cold place to work. IGT is a great company but again LVM is very poorly ran.
good,"fast pace, high turnover, constant changing environment, adequate paid holidays, challenging work environment, dysfunctional management, tense atmosphere."
good,There are some good and bad things about IGT.  It has a good work-life balance and the employees are very supportive of each other.  Management can be disconnected though and the exposure and visibility to company objectives have gotten worse over time.  It could be they are still trying to determine those overall objectives.
good,"Sub-dis-assemble gaming slot machines. Keeping up with ""S"" Five standards. Needs work on leadership. Great co-workers to work with. Hardest part of the job memorizing electronic parts and looking for defective cosmetics. The most enjoyable part about the job is the fast pace of the assembly line."
good,IGT is a place where a lot of earning takes place. One has to be attentive to details and has a hard work ethic. The management style in the department I worked in was relaxed and very easy to work for.
good,Smart and intelligent people to work with on a daily basis.  Because of the company's position within the industry employees were often seen as leaders within their peer group.
good,"The company was recently sold to an international company with a different culture and a management structure that is well established.  Given the current transition, it is difficult to determine the current and future culture of the company."
good,"Fun workplace with gym and life work balance.  However, company lags in personal growth opportunities.  The company could do better in promoting dedicated employees."
good,"Provided work and life balance for employee."
good,Because I was laid off I don't feel like I can be objective reviewing IGT.
good,"Good company, fair benefits, getting better.  A lot of companies struggled for a long time, and many had to take away perks, as did IGT.  Starting to get some back, which is nice to see."
good,"The Company has gone down hill in the last several years. It used to be a place that you could brag about and it was a pleasure to work here. Now, everyone walks on ""egg shells"": you are afraid to say anything about the benefits and perks we are losing as you don't want to end up on a bad boy list. Wages have pretty much been frozen for several years, transfers are discouraged, benefits are being downsized, and the overall additude is of gloom and doom, like we are waiting for the axe to fall."
good,The pace of work is fast back to back machines need to be looked at and parts assigned to be taken out in a time frame. I learned how to work on slot machines and what it takes. I also enjoyed looking at how the slot machines look when it is done and ready to hit the casino.
good,Worked at IGT for a little over two years. People and managers are very nice and helpful and allow you to grow. Turn over is very high are there's no clear direction from upper management.
good,"Gaming is going downhill. Layoffs for 9 years straight so far,they cut jobs to reduce head count and costs. Good people and fun to work there, headquarters is on the other side of the world. More of a Lottery company, no longer focused on gaming."
good,"Co-workers are extremely talented individuals, each with their own skill set and areas of expertise. Learned a great deal about the gaming industry. The best part about the job - the team I had the pleasure of working with."
good,"My colleagues and direct management make this a great place to work. I have been at IGT for 10 years, and have seen the work-placing rating slip, especially for us ""old-timers"". Whereas the benefits and salary used to be Excellent, they are merely now Average. All in all, thankful for the job I have and still look forward to work most days."
good,"When I was there it was a fun job, but benefits weren't that great.  Even though I was a salary position, I still had to accrue time off weekly.  Pay was ok, but many times little to no raises at yearly performance review even if you were a good performer."
good,Really enjoyed working at IGT for the most part. Made many friends and together we made the workplace more productive and comfortable. Would go back under new management.
good,"Experienced peers, state-of-the-art tech, stable company, no startup risk.  That's really it in a nutshell.  If you like risk, try a startup.  If you like steady, challenging work, IGT is it."
good,Decent place to work but there are constant changes. The company is trying to reduce cost since it was acquired by another company a couple of years ago.
good,Fun Place to work but less opportunity for long term learning. Excellent PA Systems Director. But job security is very low due to constant changes.
good,This job is quite difficult because its industry is regulated with little to no room for error. A small mistake could cost the company millions because there is no such thing as patches. Often told no mistakes will be allowed with creates a very difficuly and stressful environment and I just don't want to live and work felling this way.
good,Lots of interaction with many types of people. High pressure at times and times of inactivity. Stay professional and remember that this is the entertainment industry.
good,"The workplace environment was pleasant, continued to interact with gaming regulators and the casino operators.  Minimal supervision but not required.  I have a great work ethnic and and have the ability to multi task while continuing to provide quality of work.  Great interpersonal and customer service skills."
good,Changing a lot.  New owners are changing all the people.  It is too bad because they are losing a lot of good people. Loved the co-workers.  Enjoyed learning new things.
good,The management was seriously lacking foresight in the area of product development.
good,Great work environment and they keep you busy -- job security is nill -- hardest part of the job is wondering if you will have it the next day or the day after management makes so many changes
good,"IGT was a blast to work for at the beginning! "
good,"Took job hoping to work until retirement."
good,The job was fun but stressful lots of work graveyards were during inconvienient hours. I didn't hate it but there were problems with how it was structured
good,This company is about what you would expect from a slot machine company.  Very market driven.  The work environment seemed to be decent. I would recommend them.
good,"Lots of changes over the past 6 years. Many employees have been downsized.  Communication isn't always the best, but management says they're working on it."
good,"-Good Job"
good,"Great experience, learned a lot, met some great people, good stepping stone"
good,"The company has been good to me but rewards and advancements are slow coming even with above average contribution."
good,"Upper management is currently working on improving employee engagement and focusing on career development. These things have been lacking forever, but the progress hasn't been impressive. I've been working for the company for almost two years with no discussion of promotions or even cost of living raises."
good,I enjoyed and am Thankful for the experience gained from my employment at IGT. Technical Experience and certifications were gained during my employment with IGT at Tioga Downs Nichols NY location.
good,"best company that i've worked for in the private sector; however, lower echelon management does not seem to be integrated well within the company demeanor."
good,"Install, Maintain, and repair slot and video poker machines in a casino environment nationwide."
good,"Great co-workers, excellent brand name recognition, good benefits and nice work environment. Although international in nature, very US product-focused"
good,"Hired to clear out backlogged tickets. Not much room for growth, otherwise. I learned about easyVista. Got along well with coworkers. Respectful management."
good,"Good place to work and first real full time job, however the company has become very political and bureaucratic making career advancements difficult. Management depends on the group you work in. May involve a significant amount of traveling and offers job opportunities across the world."
good,"I've been with the company for 8 years.  I've worked with 2 other companies that are in the exact same business, and can't say any grass is particularly greener.  "
good,"Use to be an ok place to work, I started out as an assembler and worked my way up to lead technician then to supervisor and it was a great learning experience all the way through"
good,"I really loved working for IGT, excellent and knowledgeable co-workers made going out on jobs a cake walk.  Even if we were in a slow time, just hanging around the office, the personalities of the crew really kept you on your toes. We could have each other laughing the day away and still get our goals done!"
good,"IGT was the second HR job I landed after college.  I was hired for my experience in compensation and benefits but was also involved in a variety of new corporate initiatives. "
good,"Es una muy buena empresa, se preocupan mucho por los intereses del empleado y por su bienestar"
good,"I choose not to elaborate with a written summary, although I enjoyed my time at IGT.  I would definitely consider working at IGT again if circumstances required that I get back into the corporate world."
good,"Great company, though benefits has suffered since the merge with GTECH. IGT is a very good company to work for. Life work balance is excellent I wish I never left."
good,"Typical day includes ensuring SLAs are met, reports are conducted in a timely manner and act as a liaison between departments. There are times where there is a high volume of contacts."
good,"Days at work are great because of the culture of the human resources. This company provides opportunity for growth and development. It's extremely fast paced but once the necessary resources are provided, success is guaranteed."
good,"Overall I would say IGT is a excellent employer, early in your career if you're tech or logistics. I learned so much from networking (routing and switching), infrastructure builds and technical writing."
good,"IGT was a great place to work. It offers some amazing benefits like a gym, cafe, 401K, Health Insurance, and Paid Time Off. The company was bought out by another larger company, and many changes are taking place."
good,"I worked Casino Services Field Support from Las Vegas and travel throughout the United States and Manitoba, Canada performing Casino Openings, Casino Expansion Projects, Player Tracking Installations, and Game removals.  The typical work day in Las Vegas depended on what department that I was assigned to the prior day.  The departments usually were Installs, Special Projects, and QCT.  I learned over the years that team work and respect for customers, are essential to success of vendor technicians.  My co-workers were among the best of the Gaming Industry.  I thought the hardest part of my job was completing all of the various licensing requirements for all of the jurisdictions that I worked.  I thought the most enjoyable part was coming home after being on the road from one month to four months of working away from Las Vegas."
good,"Because it's a relatively mature company, there are lots of efficiencies and optimization opportunities that a driven and passionate individual can focus on to drive change, as well as cost large cost savings opportunities. Great place for system engineers, product managers, software developers, etc. there is nothing hard about working here if this is who you are; if you are in logistics, order management and operations, you better bring your ace game."
good,"This was a great place to work at. I've learned and gained so much experience. It taught me to stay focus, that if I paid attention worked hard I could get the job done."
good,IGT is a great organization to work for. There's plenty of awesome people there and interesting problems to solve regardless of which department you work in.
good,"Everyday I learned something new, like working on a new machine, installing new parts and following new instruction."
good,Great team building company. Plenty of opportunities for growth and also provided a manufacturing degree out of TMCC.  A few managers tend to micro-manage but overall a good company and good benefits
good,A leading gaming company that promotes work/life balance. I was able to travel to multiple regional locations and experience different functional roles.I supported departments that were both domestic and global.
good,"On my arrival to IGT I was welcomed from the whole team with open arms.  Great team to work with!  Everyone helps each other to get the job done and done right.  Lots of driving is involved with this position.  I was part of a team that serviced Indian casino from central California to the northern most part.  I serviced 32 casinos in my jurisdiction, maintained all leased games that belonged to IGT and house games on request.  Some weeks involved staying on the casino's property for more than two days to complete large projects.  The longest I've stayed at a property for a job was about one month in San Diego to setup a brand new casino."
good,Worked in the call center.  Lots of stress and very busy days with long and odd hours.  Very detailed work and you are held accountable.
good,"Building burster was my first area to work with.without too much instruction i did follow the procedure of building burster parts by parts and installing all together not even a week since I am experienced assembler of many kinds of machines like computers,ultrasound machines,centrifuges and others."
good,"I started at IGT as a high school drop out with few skills. I left as a full time college student with 4 years of leadership experience and a new idea of my own potential.  I learned about production and quality control, people management and much more."
good,"I worked as a programmer at IGT, making the user interfaces for slot machines function on desktop and mobile."
good,"Great place to work, somewhat limited career advancement opportunities."
good,"My co-workers are all here for the same purpose, to have fun and ensure the job is done properly. I really enjoy working with my current co-workers."
good,"I am always working on something while here. Interaction with people on a daily basis is a must, and I love every minute of it."
good,The most enjoyable part of the job is when we had parts for any holiday or just because.
good,"As an intern, I had a unique experience changing and exploring new departments (Latin American and Caribbean finance, marketing analytics, US ops) and enjoyed my time there."
good,"Productive and friendly work environment with great co-workers. Regularly planned employee activities. Company promotes learning and training for its employees allowing personal growth and development. At the end of the day, all about the bottom line."
good,"Of all employers I worked for in the last twenty years, IGT was the most fulfilling and emjoyable."
good,"One of the best places I have worked. Management is great and provides learning opportunities. Autonomy to do your job without micromanagement. Clean, quiet work environment."
good,"Was in Silkscreen Department,  used many machines to make new designs and glass ware foe the slot machines.  Used Hot and Cold laminators and then got glass ready for wherehouse storage."
good,"Good Work Life Balance. Policies are Employee Focused."
good,IGT was a wonderful experience which taught me many things needed to succeed within a sales environment. A true fortune 500 company with lots of different training courses and tools to help me succeed in the market.
good,"Really liked working for IGT.  People are very nice and professional."
good,"I enjoyed my years at IGT.  It was a fast paced, motivated, and fun  place to work.  The day was organized from the minute you were on duty.  Also put fires out as they arise. Great compensation and benefits."
good,Very changeling and Inspiring place to work. Where employees were treated with dignity and respect. The Interaction between different departments all working together as a team to achieve the company's goals was a very dynamic experience.
good,"IGT is a fun, fast placed exciting world of casino gaming. New products and games are being created all of the time. The Executive Management team, including the CEO, are great to work with. Everyone's opinion is valued. I loved meeting new people, seeing new technology and seeing the world of casino gaming in real time!"
good,I worked here for nearly 15 years. I would have never left if I was not moving out of state. I miss it still.
good,IGT is a great place to work and provides a good company culture. You won't ever work over 40 hours a week. Everyone is very nice and friendly. They like internal promotion in the Accounting departments
good,They have a very good benefits. Management not that good if they don't like you. I love my kind of work no hard part for me. I am happy though most of my the co-workers not good to work with. I don't care as long as I love what I am doing.
good,"One of the best places to work in Reno, Nevada. The managers are all very professional and so with the supervisors. I believe every employee is being treated fairly. We have excellent company benefits."
good,Great place to work and develop your corporate skills. Had experienced people above me teaching me all the basics that are needed to succeed in the corporate tax field.
good,IGT is a great place to work and management is wonderful! The pay is reasonable and the job and people you work with are very helpful and knowledgeable.
good,Friendly rewarding company to work for. International flavor towards daily activities. Very rewarding work and family environment with staff members.  safe and clean environment.

good,"productive and a fun workplace, free lunch during overtime work on saturday/s but we only have short breaks and cafeteria is too far from our work area, don't have enough time for lunch due to 30 minutes lunch break only."
good,"If we liken Engineering to a mountain mankind is climbing, he is still at the base. Engineering is the practical application of the findings of theoretical Science."
good,"Sometimes you just have to move on. Careers Ebb and Flow. Experiences and challenges wear themselves out. Friends are made, friends are lost, people come and go. And that's life."
good,"I worked here for 17 years, from private to public to stock options. This was a very exciting time in my advancing career to  be part of this business."
good,This is one of the best company I worked for.

Great training and resources for career growth. Management notices your hard work and appreciate your contribution to the department.
good,Great Company to work for. I was fully committed to the Company's culture and vison.  While my employment there was short I enjoyed everyday. I have nothing but good memories working at IGT.
good,"Fantastic place to work.  Just be yourself, and do what you do best.  Everyone you meet has a positive attitude and is more than happy to drop what they are doing and give a hand to anyone who needs it."
good,"Our team was most exciting to work with, everyone worked hard, we accomplished tasks and assignments timely, enjoyed working independently as well, great location!"
good,IGT was one of the best places I had the pleasure of working for.  They were friendly and easy to work for.  They accommodated me when I had to balance my work and family life and gave me a shift that was flexible.  I was given the opportunity to advance in the company 2 x's within a short amount of time.  They even paid for me to take classes to go toward a degree in the field that I was working in.  I also enjoyed 2 bonuses a year that amounted to about 2 1/2 paychecks which was awesome! I would definitely recommend this company to anyone interested in working for a great company that offers opportunities for advancement and stability.
good,"Wonderful team, great flexibility, constant room for learning and growth! I enjoy coming to work every day, and I have yet to meet someone who isn't enthusiastic about their role here."
good,"No two days ever the same, you learned to roll with what the day brings. "

good,The most amazing place I`ve worked so far. Learned so much and the work culture is great. I would definitely return to this company in a while.
good,"IGT Hardware Engineering is world-class.  Gaming machines are complex, dedicated computer systems with many peripherals.  My design participation was with all electronic components including integrated circuits, diodes, transistors, regulators, drivers, passives, LED's, connectors, and harnessing.  Regular design review of PCB assemblies and supply chain of new bill of materials.  Recommend electronic parts to staff members.  Replacement of obsolete components.  Review Risk of component assemblies.  Manage and administer component CAD data."
good,"Go to my office check all e-mails and messages, attend our daily meeting to go over what we are working on.."
good,over 18 years my job changed several times and I enjoyed all the positions I held.  I felt challenged and was very happy with the company.  I would still be there had they not closed there Las Vegas plant.
good,"My typical work day was to monitor current project activities and assist employees and customers in any way to complete their jobs.  As projects were completed, myself and project team members received job satisfaction when you were able to meet a customer's needs and create confidence within them that they could come back anytime with a problem and know they would get a solution for their problem."
good,"Working here was a very rewarding experience."
good,"When i first walked into igt it looked really hard, but honestly after the first day i caught on to everything and the rest of the time i worked there it was easy."
