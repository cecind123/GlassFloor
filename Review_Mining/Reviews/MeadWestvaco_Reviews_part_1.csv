rating,review
bad,"MWV is split into two overall business units: paper and carbon.  The paper side gets paid much more than the carbon side for doing the exact same job because they were two different companies at one point.  My experience is as a contractor with the carbon side in their Covington plant.  At this plant I was verbally harassed, put in near constant unsafe conditions, and worked very hard with below average compensation.  I gave them above average work for below average pay.  To advance within the company you have to either place office politics over doing your job, or bed the right person.  In Covington it is safe to say that MWV owns the town, and because of this they get away with many things they legally shouldn't.  Management, especially in quality of all places, is sub-par and there is no quality to the management in the quality department."
bad,Management believes that production is more important then employees safety. If an employee stops a job or refuses to do a job due to safety concerns he/she will be ran off for interfering with production.pretty much to sum it up if your having a stroke you better make sure you do the job first then if there's time get medical help if not management will end your career with Mwv on the spot
bad,im a current employee i only work here because i havent found a new job. Managements trouble and thay have no respect for there employees MWV is a good company Cabin bluff management is trouble.
bad,"I can describe it in one word "" NO "" there management is sorry the guest service manager doesnt even have a highschool diploma."
bad,“If you won’t do it they’ll just find someone else to” the pay is good but they are drastically reducing benefits plus it’s a unionized work force so someone has to quit die or get fired for you to advance you’ll be over worked over stressed high risk job at a plant with a high injury rate people get hurt a lot so keep that in mind
bad,White hats (management) feel like they know everything and the red and green hats (maintenance and regular workers) know nothing. They preach safety first but yet they want you to travel on ice roads in a city that's not equipped to deal with ice. Their only concern is running numbers and they feel like no one has a life outside of mead... I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS JOB TO ANYONE WHO HAS A QUICK TEMPER BECAUSE MANAGEMENT WILL TREAT YOU LIKE A STRAY DOG
bad,The hardest part of the job was dealing with a company that focuses on the manufacturing area instead of customer service.
bad,"Worst company I ever worked for. Pay scale is really low. The benefits are terrible. 401k match is 1 for 1 up to 3% then .50 for 1 up to 5% so they match 4%. They have a pension, but it's not worth it. The working conditions aren't at all good. It's very hot and unsafe. They have decent areas in the mill, but to get to recovery, lime kiln or powerhouse you must wait on your seniority to get higher to have a chance to catch a bid. Also the jobs in these area are also underpaid. I left for a much better company and the pay difference is crazy. I started at 11.00 per hr and when I left I was making 24.00 luckily due to a lot of people finding better jobs after being laid off. At my current employer I started at 30.00 and will top out at 37 in 2 yrs. it would take 30 years to make that kind of money at the papermill. All in all its a decent start if you must go, but I wouldn't recommend anyone working there if it was at all possible."
bad,"Several employees have been walked out after 20 or 30 years service for minor issues because of their age or the boss doesn't like them. All employees are upset about senior manager talking to them like a dog constantly due to ""little man syndrom"". 12 hour work days 7 days a week unless you are the manager. No sleep, health problems, no appreciation. Awful atmosphere."
bad,"Manufacturer of sprayers and pumps. Working with internal and external customers, I learned what an unhealthy work environment looks like and what management should and should not do.  The hardest part of the job was navigating the web of confusion."
bad,Job was close to home and worked half a year off the other half. I believe it can be managed better. Always stayed fast paced and no room for error. Enjoyed working with other employees because just about everyone worked together and created a safe working enviroment. The hardest thing about the job was not having equipment run properly and was always just bandaided to get by.
bad,"Everything done is done the hardest most uncomfortable way possible. Any open suggestions for improvement or innovation is unwanted, unappreciated. This is a company that practices extracting as much out of workers as possible and when top performance is reached fail to reward or recognize the effort. This causes an obvious high turnover rate, low moral and a core of under achievers."
bad,"MWV's strategy to transform itself into a packaging solutions company has failed. "
bad,A typical day at work: I was given my worksheet and allowed to work unsupervisied untill a priorty task arose. Which was often. I was then instructed to drop what I was doing and complete the emergency testing.
bad,Nothing good to say about company or culture.  Hire to fire in a coupe years.  Always restructuring company
bad,"Sold 140,000 short tons of paper to my clients. Worked hard and maintained and retained many close relationships."
bad,"I was only a temp through an agencies so there was no benefits to have or earn, the job could have been great with the proper amount of time to trained."
bad,good job if your ready to settle down and stay for a while .the company has paid training and hands on training.good steady work and a 40 hour work week . somtimes you can get optional overtime.
bad,"Overall the extruder plant is decent place to learn and get experience in a plant setting. The pay is great, and if you join the union your always guaranteed at least a 2% annual raise. The turnaround is horrible, So advancement is easily attainable. It's a union ladder progression type, so if someone leaves everybody moves up the ladder. Benefits are good, And the company seems to want to take care of they're employees. "
bad,"Not much accountability on equipment operators."
bad,"This copany has been aquired by Acco Brands"
bad,"This is company has very bad culture, a lot of company policies, lay back culture, bad management who never care about the employees, I will never recommend any friend to work there."
bad,Its factory life. Alot of unexpected mandatory overtime with short notice.  Very repetitive..Pays well for the area but cost of health insurance is too high.
bad,"Factory closed in the location I worked due to removing of product line in the Louisa, Va facility."
bad,Management is focused on one thing - themselves. Money is thrown about on anything that makes THEIR lives easier but assists the rank and file in no way whatsoever. Millions wasted on consultants who do nothing but play computer games and talk on the phone all day.
bad,Atypical day is waiting on parts that was not ordered or ordered wrong. I learned a lot on the mechanical aspects of the job. Most of my co workers were great people who had to deal with the same things I did. The hardest part of the job was the lifting of parts. The most enjoyable part of the job was the learning experience
bad,"Great Company to work for with long hours around industrial paper mill setting. The company is some what disorganized in there approach to educate there future engineers, but I fill as new and younger minds invest in the company, more organization will be apparent to fit younger minds entering there old school work force."
good,"le chef d'atelier est exécrable, irrespectueux, incompétent."
good,"The research center is a great environment.  Few workers and plenty of Scientists and Managers.  Little appreciation from management, promotions and raises are few.  Challenges can be fun if allowed to work at a reasonable pace.  Scientists sit at the desk and wait for one technician to pump out work.  There needs to be many technicians to every scientist so they have something to work on.  Scientist need to engage workers that care to allow them to understand the projects so the feedback is useful rather than testing blind.  This allows some synergy.  Bonuses for the higher levels and nothing for the lower levels.  Go ahead John L. keep the money up at the top and forget about those that do the work for you! Pillage the companies and remove the incentive from those making your product too. Shows you can make money on variable quality products if you have the money to own a mill, but forget about those who make it for you. Competition is getting less so the drive to produce better products can be low."
good,Productive and fun place to work that allows for a flex schedule to work around home schedules.  Pay is fair but job security/advancement options can be difficult to maneuver.
good,"I had worked for this company for 13 years. It was a good place to work ,then they let go of people to down size the company . work got shipped else where,"
good,"A typical day was tense, and constantly wondering what would happen. Information was not given in a forthcoming way to alleviate any anxieties that each department might have. Some of the coworkers had become focused doing whatever to maintain their position. The team/family environment was no longer a positive force at this company."
good,"Spent most of my working life here and had a couple of very good mentors in my early years that helped me with everything from accounting to procurement. I came up the hard way and pretty much had to learn from experience and I don't think I'd have it any other way. I was the only Procurement person so most of my days were very busy buying everthing the plant needed from Services, MRO, Raw Materials, etc. Pretty good Management and Co-workers but again there was that small hand full on both sides. Hardest part of the job was really never getting any credit where credit was due. The most enjoyable part of the job was being on several Corp. concensus buy teams representing the Division I worked in."
good,"Ok, to work for. At First. I Loved my Job as there overhead crane opp.  Was supposed to be my career job. Im a hard worker. Was The Best Crane Person they Had . Was Good at my job. Got along with my co-workers. Love working on 3rd Shift."
good,"Was given a couple projects to work on and THEY didn't like my solutions. No timeline, no budget given. Got thrown under the bus by people that worked for me."
good,MWV is a very innovative and customer-focused company with a large packaging portfolio. I truly enjoy my co-workers and have made some good friends.
good,management not so good but working environment and people are great
good,12 plus hours a day
good,"Er wordt hardt gewerkt in dit bedrijf. Snelheid en nauwkeurig zijn is zeer belangrijk."
good,"In many ways run like a financial firm with focus on Wall Street and individual incentives."
good,"No dia a dia de um trabalhador é bom ter uma equipe aplicada e unida, para que possamos aprender a cada dia cada vez mais uns com os outros, acredito que todos possamos nos entender e que todos possam nos oferecer um aprendizado diferenciado. Sendo que uma boa empresa também é coordenada por bons profissionais que saber administrar e falar com seus subordinados, a parte mais difícil de um trabalho é quando você acaba tendo dificuldade em completar uma tarefa, e a parte mais fácil é interagir com as pessoas e se desenvolver ."
good,"Normalmente fazia contagens e controles de estoque de produtos acabados e matérias primas. Aprendi muito sobre como controlar produtos em tambores e em sacos empilhados em pallets. Minha coordenação me dava carta branca para implementar melhorias. A equipe era muito dedicada e capaz para resolver vários tipos de problema. O mais desafiador para mim era fazer as programações de matéria-prima e manter o estoque acurado, mesmo com a equipe de produção retirando alguns materiais sem controle. O mais agradável era terminar o inventário mensal e verificar que o estoque estava acurado no sistema e no físico."
good,"The organization itself was growing in the direction of becoming more automated, which was a good thing, but for me I needed more growth opportunities!  I found that there was not a lot of opportunities to advance my career."
good,"MWV merged with Rock Tenn (based in Atlanta, GA) and became WestRock, so I have no opinion on working here since the company MeasWestvaco no longer exists."
good,"When I was there I was given lots of grief about my activities outside of work and how some misfortune in those was about to cost me my job. Then I kept getting more work put on me, but no additional money."
good,MeadWestvaco taught me valuable skills in my current career. I began with some knowledge of the job requirements but they taught me even more. I enjoyed my time there.
good,"Tedious work at times, good work environment. Usual high paced factory/warehouse environmental hazards."
good,Good Place to work the pay is good and the workers are friendly.I left because we were relocating to a new area or i would still be there.It was 12 hour shifts but i like that so it worked for me
good,"The job was ok, I real wasn't comfortable at this job but the hours was good but what I did like the staff was very friendly and the drive I had to take to get to the job."
good,In finishing department feeder/packer has responsibilities of standing on feet all work day loading product into machine and being able to pack product in shipping boxes as well. Learned about machines & other everyday skills as well. Management ok to deal with. hardest part about the job would def be having to keep up with machine & rest of the assembly team. Can be very fast paced. Most enjoyable part about job is seeing how everything is done. Its really Neat .
good,"Goede werkgever, alleen helaas geen CAO en een OR met weinig inzet. "
good,got to pick the orders that were left for me and take to the proper schools and but the stuff away.the hardest part was lifting some of the food.could be alittle heavy and sometimes the bus wuold not start.
good,Friendly working environment. High Pressure but comfortable working environment. Many perks to working. Staff willing to help teach and train.
good,"Paper, Packaging , Chemicals . Global manufacturer based in Richmond, VA.  Publicly traded and announced merger with Rock Tenn early 2015"
good,MWV has some of the greatest people you will ever work with. Generally speaking people will help you to accomplish your goals and objectives. Pace is a bit slow so execution and implementation of new ideas can take awhile.
good,No room for moving up .  But I enjoyed fast pace .. And the planning aspect of job
good,"A typical day at work consists of trouble shooting computer system problems and fixing them, as well as directing the shipments coming to and leaving the mill. I've learned that hard work and patience are the best qualities to have when dealing with customers, co-workers and management, and that my attitude can have an impact on other employees so I always try to maintain a positive one. I try not to think of my responsibilities as having a 'hardest', 'easiest' or 'most enjoyable' aspect to them. I try to think of it in terms of my job as a whole with everyday duties I need to perform in order to meet customer satisfaction and still make sure myself and my co-workers go home safely at the end of the day."
good,Lean manufacturing facility and pay was modest for the area
good,"Pactiv provides packaging products to the foodservice, supermarket, restaurant, and food packaging markets. These products are designed to protect food during distribution, aid retailers in merchandising food products, and help customers prepare and serve meals in their homes."
good,I would clock in when I first got there they didn't mind if I was early and they paid me for it. I would look at how many trucks that was coming in and out for the day on computer. Then I was start my work by either loading trucks or unloading with a fork lift. I made sure everyone else was caught up their job and assistant if they needed it.
good,Solid team with roots stemming from deep within a paper mill culture.
good,"Le développement des machines se fait dans un contexte de réactivité permanente vis à vis des demandes des clients."
good,Speaking to every one.And  I have learned that people will hurt you any way they can. I some what disagree with the manager on child less stuff that they some times do but ones you say thing that is it you will be on their hit list to be fired. I get along with my co-workers when I see them. Is dealing with management and their views on some of the stuff.
good,You advance quickly. I received 4 promotions in a 3 month span. But not a very stable job. You can work 60 hrs/wk for 2 two weeks then be reduced to 32 hrs/wk. Absolutely can do no wrong during probationary period. They will terminate over the smallest infraction
good,moral was really low and employees complained a lot. the plant is kept very clean and it is Air Conditions which is very nice.  Management was not real open.  I enjoyed many people and took great pride in setting up MIn/Max and barcode for the MRO.
good,I liked working at Meadwestvaco back in 2002-2008.I enjoyed the work and the people that I worked with. Since than I have tried to get back into the company. I would really like to work for the company again when it comes time to hire temps to work for the company.
good,"A typical day in the MeadWestvaco power house is non existent. Everyday is new with it's own set of circumstances. I've learned that  some people will never be satisfied and are generally negative day in and day out. And, that those people do not like or appreciate positive people in their presence. My co-workers (other departmental supervisors) and I on the other hand tried to work together and encourage a positive work environment. This was especially true with the C-shift supervisors at MeadWestvaco Coated Board. The hardest part of my job was trying to please an un-pleasable boss and enduring his constant fowl mouthed rants concerning how stupid everyone in the world/company is (except for himself of course).The most enjoyable part of my job was working with and getting work accomplished with and through my men, the men I supervised."
good,"Pay is good and the benefits are real good, but point system sucked.  Going through merger and got laid off. I liked the people that I worked with and enjoyed the job that I had. Otherwise, that is it."
good,I believe it was very Respected and comfortable to go to work people actually couldn't wait to go to work they would even get to work early talk to each other and get their shift update and when someone needed a break I would buy them a drink out of my own pocket and asked them to take a coffee break take their mind off the machine
good,"This is a great place to get some ""plant experience"" right off the street. Then, move to the East toward Calvert City to the average of a $10.00 hr pay increase."
good,"Travail en équipe 2/8"
good,Was taught a lot about how to use CAD (ProEngineer). Had a great manager. Worked with some really sharp engineers. Was a welcome part of the team. Would recomend.
good,"I worked for many years at AT-A-GLANCE which was purchased by MeadWestvaco.  Throughout my time with both companies I assisted in compiling necessary information for confidential projects, including the MeadWestvaco purchase, and also in multiple roles throughout the company.  I was able to new opportunities several times, and thoroughly enjoyed my work there."
good,Learned in a collaborative environment under the leadership of many people.  Other functions of the company willingly worked with everyone to accomplish goals.
good,A typical day at MeadWestvaco dealt with packing envelopes and inspecting them before sending them to various companies. I learn how the envelopes we're made and how to run the machines. My co-workers helped the job to be more enjoyable. There was nothing hard about this and the most enjoyable part of this job was working with my co-workers and providing a good quality product.
good,"I have heard that a lot has changed at MWV since it relocated to VA. However, when I worked there, I really enjoyed my work, the pace of the work, and the festivities they company provided, like for Halloween. It was both a fun place to work, but we also were serious and got down to work when it mattered."
good,The pay and benefits were excellent.  Can be a fun place to work.  Not very productive because it closed down.  Job security was not very good.
good,I like working for this company. I think they should slow the machine down a little so i can catch all the defects. I just got layoff from this company and never was rehired.
good,"If you or "
good,Good relationship between co-workers. Staff members work as a team
good,"Layoffs were promident, even for long time employees. Management were very involved with employees."
good,really liked the job itself. It was challenging I learned a lot about SAP program.  
good,Prep rolls and chuck up rolls to be ran through line.  When line goes down we have to help thread line back up.  Management is ok but we never know when we have to work. Co- workers are good to work with not a problem at all.  Hardest part of the job is when we run trials it is very fast and hectic.  Most enjoyable part of the job really is everything.
good,good place to work. nice co workers. safe environment. have learned lots about the paperboard industry.
good,"I enjoy the work, but the pay is low and they are slow to promote people. They career ladder is somewhat disorganized."
good,Company is in the midst of re-inventing their business to focus on Packaging.
good,"Work was extremely steady and physically demanding. Employees normally got along well with the management. Being a factory environment, the conditions were not always the best.....hot in summer and cold in winter. I learned a lots about the printing industry. There are many occupational hazards in this line of work."
good,Arrived at work and talked to other departments to see if my schedule needs to be changed.  I usually plan out the jobs for 13 mechanics.  I have meeting last with other departments to plan out the schedule every 3 days.  I am called throughout the day to handle issues that are not planned.
good,Bom ambiente de trabalho bons encarregados e colegas de trabalho.
good,"inspect parts, check machines pack parts label them clean areas, refill product . lifting heavy boxes the best part was doing your best"
good,"Some times work 12hr shifts"
good,"Start our days with a brief safety meeting, then head out onto the work floor. Learned how to operate forklifts and some industrial machinery. Some management seemed hard to talk to about work related issues. Really enjoyed the rotating shift work schedule."
good,"ACCO Brands, formerly Mead West Vaco is a convenient job for me at this time in my life. I've learned a ton about printing and learned to handle people and critical situations with balance and reason. Thanks to Mead West Vaco and ACCO Brands I will be able to take the job skills I have learned and apply them in my next career step."
good,Offre de bonnes conditions de travail et beaucoup d'autonomie
good,"Very hard work and very hot, but as long as you did your job everything was good. Some people would tend to not do their job as well as they could or finish what they started."
good,"Meadwestvaco was a box production company. It was a well rounded work place to work. With really nice people, who are really helpful. We made beer, soda pop boxes, my job was to take the boxes and put them in the feeder. The feed would then send it down the machine to which then taped or glue the boxes according to the type of box. If the machine would get jam I would have to turn the whole machine off and take the boxes that caused the jam, out then test it to see if the machine was operating properly to start back up. "
good,Worked from 7:30-4:30 to deliver and process mail for the employees at Dominion Va Power. Got to meet and know a lot of wonderful people.
good,Everyday I pulled and stacked lumber boards of all different sizes
good,"Document Control Department and Engineering Department, Summer 2012, 2011 & 2010"
good,"Ambiente e pessoas agradaveis. Area de atuacao muito gratificante, A direcao da empresa do Brasil esta muito focada em resultados."
good,"Production was always key, next to quality. I have got my cpr training, running fast continuous lines of product, keeping up with demand, working with Automated Guided Vehicles in a Assembly area and lots about Quality Assuarance. Management slacked quite frequently in a lot of areas, and pushed products through, that otherwise should have been held, and they were Mid professional at best. The benefits were great, and the health care. Pay was mid grade- but doable."
good,"Great Employees, Management is O.K. overall great experence"
good,"Really busy place of work because there’s a lot of products made daily. The supervisor is not all in your face all day! They also have a excercise room, which is great for break time."
good,"Fast growing company"
good,"The many people I worked with and supported were very competent in their areas.  Many had knowledge of operations outside of their area."
good,Very knowledgeable management of their industry and markets. Truly business oriented more so than employees. In today's markets they took measures to stay competitive like outsourcing which upset employees but was a good business strategy. Their main goal was making the company the best in its class and they did that very well.
good,"compromiso con el respeto y la persona."
good,"Environnement serein"
good,"Not a bad place to work at, everyone is very friendly and polite."
good,Your success at MWV depends on the manager you work for and if that manager has a backbone.  Most do and they fight for their employees and put effort into developing them.  Some don't and you are on your own to develop.  Very traditional setting.  You have to work long hours for others to perceive that you are working hard.  Overall this is a 4 star place to work.
good,ok place. Traveled a lot worked with good people. work culture was positive and the company was ethical. I would recommend this place to anyone. Good luck
good,Very exciting place to work. I loved learning about import/export work. Most of my customers were in Shanghai. Google translator was my most useful tool.
good,"It was a good place to work but it was hot in the summer and cold in the winter. Work pace is fast "
good,"Had many opportunities at MeadWestvaco to see other operations, what they did and help realize opportunities to work together on projects, tap into each other's expertise. "
good,"Altijd druk bezig met alles wat met deze functie meebrengt, ook collega,s ( operator,s) erop aan spreken wanneer het product niet voldoet aan de eisen. Heb soms moeite het wel of niet goedkeuren van produkten. Heb altijd ruggespraak met leidinggevenden."
good,Difficulty in getting Second Level Leadership to work with process improvement efforts.
good,"good company to work for great training program,i would recomend this job."
good,"MeadWestvaco was a very desirable place of employment. Had excellent benefits and good pay. We had 401K, medical, dental and worked in a diverse environment. Enjoyed showing up everyday and earning my pay. Enjoyed a clean lunch room with coffee ad snacks."
good,"I didn't have any typical workday. My days were different and I liked that. One day I organized trainings for employees and the other day I welcomed guests and organized accommodation, transport and refreshment for them.  I worked closely with management and I think that they do their best. The hardest part in my job was the organization of trainings as there was 350 employees and about 20 trainings so it was complicated but possible to do. I enjoyed the most when there was some creative task - eg. designing of new flyer to advertise new intranet site."
good,"A typical day would be running a spraypump machine that Has 12 hoppers to filled at all times, keep work area clean, make boxes, put out 90 boxes in 8 hrs and sometimes run two of these machines."
good,"Minha experiência na Resitec é de grande valor profissional e pessoal, visto que meu aprendizado foi aprimorado e valorizado. O ambiente de trabalho com os colaboradores da empresa é agradável e a relação dos mesmos é independente ao cargo."
good,"loading raw material/paper, unloading finished product. this was a job that was physically demanding. you were on your feet 12 hours and the only provide you with a 30 minute lunch. it is repetitive."
good,I really liked my job at MWV. My managers were terrific people and they cared about their staff. My job was hectic at times (during Audits) but it was nothing that could not be handled. I was part of a two person team and we handled ALL of the tax information for every client that MWV had. We had a very heavy volume of work but they gave us the systems we needed to get our work done. We were trained and certified on the systems.
good,"I should not have left. The salary was not the best, but the job was great. I got caught up in chasing money. Wonderful people and management. Should still be there."
good,The job I enjoyed the most the co workers were nice and friendly. Everyone worked as a team. managers were nice and fair. Easy fast paced job with something always to do
good,"Good people and environment, benefits were good and the culture was supportive of advancement.  Typical day was one of interaction with various groups to coordinate projects across multiple operations"
good,I enjoyed working for this company the benefits and the salary was great I worked with nice people and really miss the job.
good,the ability to move around hundreds of ppl with out hurting myself or coworkers around me will carry with me for ever.team work was essential..
good,everyone pays attention to detail on safety as well as putting out a high quality product.  Plus there several events the company have.
good,"this is by far one the best companies to work for,i work in various dept printing,bindery,and warehouse,work on small presses,different customer mostly ad specialties,work on a bindery machine which collates paper and glues into a book form,work in dept as stock chaser,bring products for machine set up and taking finish good to drop zone for shipping to pick up"

Aprendi e repassei muitos conhecimentos na área de minha atuação. Contato e relacionamento com colegas de trabalho, gerência, terceiros e externos sempre dentro da normalidade. Toda dificuldade encarada como desafio e não como problema. Gosto do que faço, portanto, todo dia transformo em agradável."
good,"Es una empresa con niveles de producción establecidos y muy raramente cambian, es una empresa estable en la cual los puestos de trabajo pueden durar por tiempo indefinido."
good,My typical day at work is to check for defects on an ongoing cycle throughout an 8 hour shift.I have been with this company for 19 years and work on my own or as a team player.I have learned alot over the years.My management is great and work well with the employees in a big setting enviroment.I work well with my co workers and try to be as friendly as possible to set a good example for others.the hardest part of my job would be not having enough time in an 8 hour shift to get done what needs to be done in my role of a quality auditor.The most enjoyable part of my job would be the people i work along side off and the teamwork.
good,I learned a lot from working in a manufacturing plant . I saw how both sides of the scale work because I started out as an hourly employee and then moved over to a salary position.
good,"a typical day is ensuring a good quality for our customers.I have learned the ends and out of shipping.With the mangement we have in place they make sure you have all the training you need to be sucessful.I work with good co-workers and enjoy working with them..the hards part of the job is the heat,but the management helping with fans and making sure that you stay cool it's not that bad"
good,Management was great - Co-workers worked together
good,Treat people like you want to be treated. Shares your knowledge with new co-workers. Ask questions about work procedures. Most of all be safe on the job.
good,"Loved working for Meadwestvaco. I worked for this company for 17 years. Very fast paced, working hard to get the job done on time. Safety orieniated, hardest part of the job was working some long hours. The most enjoyable part of the job was that everyone got along."

good,"A typical day at work consist of prepping rolls of plain paper that range anywhere from 10,000 ft. to 30,000 ft. and placing them on a machine that adds Polyethylene. I learn that the paper we prep is used for solo cups, restaurant cups, boxes and many different items that consist of paper. The management team is very friendly everyday I see them. They smile and greet and make sure you are having a great day which is the best part of the job because they make you feel as if your very much welcomed. The hardest part of the job is working short handed with the heavy rolls which can be very strenuous at times depending on the customers order in which we receive."
good,"Working at MWV has been a learning experience every day.  The corporate Engineering Department and CPI (R&D) Departments have allowed me to expand on my Web Design, Database skills as well as  motivating employees when needed.  Learning the different things MWV is doing to improve environmental impact from industries is fascinating."
good,this company had great pay and benefits and is an ideal company to work for. unfortunately in their re-structuring they closed the facility where I live and moved some of their operations overseas.
good,MeadWestvaco had a great group of people.  Work was a great fit for a Chemical Engineer.  There was a wide variety of assignments and a good team atmosphere.
good,Mead had a fantastic casual environment with friendly employees.

When that plan fell through, I eventually had another opportunity to return to the company and was thrilled to be able to do so.

good,Was a good company based on solid old-school ethics.  Unfortunately the industry was becoming old and needed to shift focus if it was going to stay afloat.  A series of purchases of moves to innovate and bring the company into modern times did not go as well as planned as the 'doers' did not have the vision nor experience to make the changes profitable.  Thus the company was acquired.
