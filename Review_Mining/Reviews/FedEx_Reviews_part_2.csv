rating,review
good,"FedEx SmartPost was for the much part and easy going job, you clock in and youre there as long as the truck are there and until you finish the job."
good,"A typical day is not typical. There is variety every day. I have learned I can train others, and ask for training for myself and have that welcomed. My manager is a fair person. Most of my coworkers are hard working people and help each other get the job done. The hardest part of the job is dealing with delivering the product late when the weather is bad. The most enjoyable part is being able to be on the road."
good,it was a seasonal job so there wasnt much to it. trained well. gave opportunities for extra hours at work. got there about 5 am so it helped me plan my day.
good,"Easy job great beneifits, just needs more hours to work. a typical day at work is unloading and scanning through 4-5k packages every morning. the hardest part of the job has is lifting the overly heavy products like tv' full playground sets and various car parts and tools."
good,"Solid company with family feel, manufacturing environment, good management, wonderful ownership, mentoring and ability to see and work in all areas of the company."
good,"Having worked for FedEx for nearly five years now, it's safe to say that if you are looking for a basic, entry level warehouse position, then you should consider FedEx Ground.  Upon being hired, you are given a two day (paid) classroom education about the methodologies and techniques used before being handed off to a 'Package Handler Trainer.'  These trainers are experienced, veteran loaders who will help you on your way to becoming an acceptable loader.  The management is helpful and focused on ensuring that the day to day activities run smoothly.  You will be expected to load 300 boxes an hour around two weeks into your employ, with that being raised to nearly 400 after a month and a half.  You work a four hour shift, with variable shifts to choose from you can make this job work around your schedule. "
good,Difficult work. Early hours. Management very open and willing to listen to comments / suggestions. Only enjoyable aspect is it helps you get a good workout. Employees are nice.
good,"Great place to work because of its people and culture. Produces the most reliable management, efficient and high performing teams."
good,Very flexible with your schedule. Can get a little hectic especially during the holidays. Overall great place to work.
good,This company was very focused on pleasing their customer and were very professional about doing so. They did all steps needed to complete what they call the purple promise
good,"The dock work is awesome! The supervisors and managers are not so much.  They usually change out every year and the new ones think they know better or have a new idea we all have to try.  It's usually nothing new but we have to play along.  They gave us slower forklifts but want more freight moved, you figure that out..."
good,"Full time benefits with part time work, very fast paced, learning on the fly. A working man's job, not for the shy or timid. Get the job done or they will find someone who can. Mixed bag of managers, some good some bad. Couriers divided, AM vs. PM. Could use a little help getting into the 21st century as far as tools needed to perform job. All in all a solid company."
good,"The pay is great but if you are looking for hours then this isn't the place for you. Although, you can work more then the shift you normally work if you wanted to pick up hours. Shifts are 3-4 hours. It is a normally shipping company where you unload, load packages from wither trailers or trucks along with scanning them. The people are great to work with for the most part and you will enjoy your job as long as you do it correctly as with any job you will have."
good,"good benefits and pay. "
good,I have worked here for two years and had great reviews but no job advancement. I am an asset to the team and feel valued but I would like to also advance in my career as well.
good,I have learned how to scan and reassign packages to proper trucks. I have learned how to load a truck by visual. Managers as well as employees are respectful.
good,"Good benifit, loved working around aircraft ..good co-workers ..hardest part was leaving the comapny due to department close down."
good,"The position at FedEx is a great position, great place to work. fast-pace, warehouse environment. The manager are great,"
good,"I learned how to stack long trailers, hardest part was stacking those heavy boxes.  My coworkers was good people I got along with everybody well."
good,"Typically we can get really busy with several amount of freight, other times we can be slow with not a lot of freight. The front of the conveyor belt has to be sorted so the workers in the back can see their IDs and pick those packages up. I learned to read the IDs really quickly. My coworkers and I get along really well, we will help each other if we have heavy items or if one is really busy. The hardest part of working at FedEx would be getting all of our freight with the limited we have to put them in the baggage carts. However, I love working with my coworkers because we will help each other and we get along great!"
good,"It is hot and hard work, but considering the pay and the lack of qualifications, it is a good job. Where else will you find Part Time work with full benefits?"
good,"A typical day at work at FedEx involves learning, in which I do everyday through management and helpful and caring co-workers. From management to co-workers, we communicate thoroughly to make sure that we provide excellent service and to ensure that we get the job complete. The hardest part of the job would probably be the beginning. The most enjoyable part is definitely meeting new friends and people constantly."
good,It was good getting there seeing all workers gathered together waiting for the supervisor to tell them what the goal is today. Then we all get to our work place and get started unloading boxes. I learned a lot about how FedEx gets all the boxes in the right place and how the business works. The management was good. The hardest about it was the heavy boxes to unload. The most enjoyable part was everybody was communicating with each other and helping each other get the job done.
good,"Over all good job, fast pace always moving, not for everyone you have to be hustler. Management will give you the tools to do your job."
good,"keep on schedule without delays or breakdowns complete deliveries and pick ups. you have to manage your time and meet customer needs.it is fast pace work and physical. A good day to complete everything on time and arrive back in time to start another day,"
good,Great job for students or for just a part time job.  With early morning or late evening hours you can manage other tasks.  You receive benefits even if you are part time.
good,"On a daily basis I was responsible for providing clerical support to various levels of management and performing daily operational functions including: coping, filing, faxing, emailing, and answering telephones. I also reviewed and entered data in various systems to support respective functional areas. I learned how to multitask different assignments. My managers were in fact very tedious and straight-forward they expected me to do my job well. My coworkers were cooperative since we had to work as a team. The hardest part of my job was managing my work and personal life. The most enjoyable part of my job interacting with colleagues."
good,Great company to work for. Extremely considerate when speaking of work/home balance. Very flexible with hours and accommodations. Should improve in setting limits to weight of the packages.
good,"I won't go on long about FedEx Office. It's important to indicate which branch of FedEx you are because all other branches treat Office like they are garbage. I learned a great deal at FedEx. Transferrable skills I will use forever. They are more organized than most companies. They create an environment built on professionalism and hard work. There are many opportunities if you want them, but don't expect a single personal to help navigate the murky waters. If you do not take all of the initiative yourself, you will sit in the same job until they eventually fire you because you can't continue to roll with their ever changing processes and procedures. Biggest pros- great shipping discounts and great transfer opportunities. Biggest con - The work goes home with you, even if just in your mind. Over tasked and everyone has a lot of responsibility."
good,A day at fed ex would consist of a lot of heavy lifting and long hrs outside delivering pkgs. each day consist of a new pkg amount and different delivery route so you have to always make adjustments.
good,The hours were great i was still able to attend school an work I enjoy being able to work on my own without supervision the most enjoyable part of the job was interacting with the customers
good,"I really enjoyed going to work at fed ex every day because you never knew/what you might run into.I loved inter acting with the the different customers that I inter acted with every day,"
good,it is a great company. friendly staff and managers. the workers are also friendly and helpful also the drivers. i had fun.
good,"This company treats their seasonal and permanent employees very well! They pay great with excellent benefits. Seasonal associates are compensated for holidays and are offered an amazing 401k program via Vanguard! The pace is extremely fast and isn't a good fit for ""thin-skinned"" people. I enjoyed my time with FedEx and was grateful to have learned the ins and outs of home delivery!"
good,"On an average day during the Christmas Rush, we would be out there on the streets for nearly 10 hours. Help was very small if it ever arrived, and often times if we finished early we would be tasked with aiding with another driver's deliveries or being asked to pickup incoming deliveries from a supplier. Pay was very good though, especially for temp work."
good,"A typical day working at FedEx Ground consist of clocking in and getting right to work. While working there over the past year has taught me how to definitely keep my head on my shoulders. The work can pay a tole on your body but safety if one of the biggest focuses in the workplace. I really enjoy working there because of the workout that I receive. Though i am in a trailer the entire work shift, we have managers that come in and out to make sure we are not only doing the job that we are supposed to be doing, but to make sure that we are keeping a safe working environment. Doubling us up in a trailer keeps us interactive with the co-workers. Overall working with FedEx Ground is really great, not to mention the benefits and raises we receive. A great reward for the work that we do."
good,"typical workday: 1am - 11am"
good,a typical day of work is working hard and under paid. I learned how to sort boxes and place them on a belt. the hardest part was lifting the extremely heavy boxes without help.
good,"After clocking in we sit down for the presort meeting, go stretch, when the belt line is on you start scanning your assigned work areas packages and load them by vision in the truck for delivery. Management is good, I really like who I work for and work beside. Main reason why I don't want to leave the company. The hardest part of the job would be staging multiple bulk stops outside the truck when you run out of space. Most enjoyable having a good relationship with most of the people I work with, especially management."
good,It very fast paced great when  you need  a stable income.This job is hard work here at FedEx you will learn the value of team work
good,"I enjoy working at FedEx ground from a leadership perspective.  However it is very much either you can do it or you better learn quick.  WE have many metrics we have to hit and if you don't hit them, be prepared to hear about it."
good,"A typical day at FedEx Freight calls for the most stout of beings. One can go from a very slow day of about 500 shipments to almost a thousand shipments in a four to five hour shift, Being flexible and fast on a forklift is a serious requirement. "
good,good place to work for a part time job. Start the day off with some stretches. Sort and scan parcels onto the correct pallets
good,Learned how to use all their equipment and their process of sorting packages for the post office. I especially enjoyed learning how to hook up trailers and move them around the yard
good,It's hard to tell how much you will really make because it can be based off the number of stops you have. Really rewarding around christmas time.
good,You load and unload boxes in a certain amount of time.  The faster you complete the days work load the sooner you can go home.  The thing I really liked about fedex is that working part time they give you tuition reimbursement if you are currently in school still.
good,"Overall, this is a great place to work. Working in the Colorado Springs location however, job opportunities and advancement opportunities are very few."
good,"good place to work, If full-time positions we're available would be great. I learned how to operate forklift, and I also learned how to handle and tie down hazardous materials."
good,If you are willing to move you can get promoted every few years with good performance and networking. The brand is impressive and the leadership is very innovative.
good,"Great place to work, only reason I left was for the opportunity to better myself. Other wise I would recommend this company"
good,"Enjoy driving and also people. This was a great job. meeting new people at pick up zones and meeting new people that worked from home, and not but lease pick up mail at drop boxes."
good,"Reporting directly to District Sales Managers and working with a team of ten."
good,Work enabled me to meet customers face to face and received customer appreciation first hand.  Traveled to new zip codes everyday with the ability to find new routes and passageways to those destinations.
good,"Great benefits for Part-time work, stabil top rated company with opportunity to move around the country and world if you desire by transferring jobs and locations"
good,"Very fast paced, Manual labor very good pay and promotions from within. highly recommended as first time job. excellent benefits after one year and good time paid days off."
good,"Being a vendor contracted to FedEx Ground there are many limitation. One downside is there is no starting or ending times set. No overtime paid, work until you finish. If the trucks are delayed, and you have to wait for them, this is your time. You can be waiting for up to 4+ hours, this is on your time no pay."
good,Um verdadeiro seleiro de oportunidade.Onde aprendi muito e ganhei vasta experiencia na cadeia de Logística.
good,"My 9 to 10 hour days usually start off in the switcher where i park semi-truck trailers on the dock to be unloaded and loaded. Some days ill work on the dock unloading/loading, or ill be outside switching out full to empty trailers. Management is relatively easy-going as long as you show them you know what you're doing. The hardest part of my job is the extreme amounts of volume we get during the holiday season. The most enjoyable part of my job by far is the amazing workout i get each day, and the fact that I've met my best friends here."
good,"Dockworker- Good paying part-time job, good benefits and fun environment. Management structure is frustrating, day-to-day responsibilities are repetitive. Advancement opportunities are slim for supervisor positions. Work in all weather conditions can be tough."
good,"Empresa idônea e sólida com cultura bem formada."
good,"A very big family,"
good,"With this job I have learned how to balance five task at once and get them all done correctly in a timely manner. I have been able to learn how to deal with multiple situations and solve them all on my own. Being a person where I have to be doing something at all times this is a great job, you do have to be able to balance things or it will all fall apart and you will fall behind."
good,This job is good if you're going to college because they start early in the morning and are done with work around 8 am. Only half of the workers are there because they enjoy their job the other half are there for the money. Management is great for the most part
good,we as couriers understood that it was always about preparation and time. some of us had to unload packages from off the trailers onto the designated belts. when finished we had to scan every package and envelope on the route assigned from priority to 2nd day deliveries. make sure we were out of the station and driving safely to finish the first part of our delivery by 10:30. we had to make sure we stayed connected with other couriers in the area just in case they may need help. and we all could make it home safe. especially on winter days.
good,Working at fedex is a very rewarding experience. The staff is extrmemely friendly and customer oriented! The most enjoyable part of the job are the employee relationships that are developed on a daily basis.
good,"A typically day at was always a hard working day at work because everday was about the same as the last day if not way more busy.I learned in a working enviroment you have to stay consistent you have to be perfect but you have to be somewhere around the area.My management was not the worst but it wasnt the best .My co-workers were hard working and easy to get along with like i was ,great communication.I really never had to issues with the job that i can say it was difficult or hard.The most enjoyable part of the job is that i stayed busy and fun being around my7 co-workers"
good,"The hours are late, the packages come fast, but overall this job was good. If they had a first shift for this I would have stayed , but the hours can get to you and your sleep. Peek season was crazy, but it was a great time."
good,"Current Sr. Manager was way too ""hands on"" and tried to stifle any attempts to implement lean methodologies, even though that was my primary duty."
good,"Pick up boxes that can weigh up to 100 lbs and load, unload trailers. The managers can be mean sometimes but a few are very kind. The coworkers are nice usually. The hardest part of the job is getting your trailer done on time."
good,I was only a part time employee but it worked out well since i went to college as well as working at Fedex. They had three different shifts that i could choose from so I always felt that i could work around my school schedule.
good,The work/life balance is excellent. I have learned a lot from the diverse work culture here. The management needs to help in rotating the IC as much as they do the upper management.
good,FedEx was always a face paced work environment. The people I worked with always helped out and they didn't complain.  Management did their jobs well. They were on the floors with their employers keeping them busy and being positive.
good,"Each day was an learning experience that I enjoyed. "
good,THe managament here is kind of atrocious and the people are very rude. The pay was great and they worked with students going to school with your schedule
good,"FedEx has a great and safe work environment with well-balanced team members. A set routine that is progressive. Typically, I'd come in to a team meeting that everyone participates in, we stretch and head to our locations or trailers. I'd unload the products from a trailer with efficeincy while managing my time and making sure certain products are taken to the department they are supposed to, avoiding any complications for fellow employees or machinery. The job is fast-paced and challenging, which I enjoy. My only issue is the fact that after the winter holiday season the hours become very slim."
good,Short intense shifts mix comradely with hard work. The fast paced work along with friendly approachable management make the manual labor aspect of entry level warehouse work almost enjoyable.
good,"I worked the morning sort for operations. Managed package handlers during our sort which began at 0300am in the morning until 0800am. I have learned high level management and business skills. My co-workers were great to work with, we worked very well as a team to achieve our goals. The hardest part of my job was waking up early every morning at 0100am. The most enjoyable part of my job was working with my employees on a leadership level."
good,"Good company to gain experience in on all levels. Company has a great reputation and it pays to be a part of it. Job mobility is a big thing at FedEx, especially between OpCos. Great benefits too."
good,A very fun place to work at. Also the managment are great and very nice and caring. Everybody is nice to one another. When done with you can leave.
good,The process of my job responsibilities is usually a repetitive process. The work may be different but the steps to complete my job are the same. I have learned how important it is for each department to work together to achieve company standards. I have nothing but respect towards each of my co-workers and I understand working together as a team is the greatest commitment we can do to satisfy our customers. The hardest part of my job would be the hours(overnight shift). The most enjoyable part of the job is the learning experience. I've gained so much knowledge about how and why decisions are made and it has given me an ability to think outside the box.
good,Typical day includes loading and unloading trailers getting city drivers their routes ready for the day.Pretty faced paced working under a tight schedule digging out hot freight that needs to get out of the gate.Learned a lot about the LTL industry working for a scheduled for-hire carrier who is also a leader in the industry.Management is pretty gruff but fair.Theres a lot of supervisors.Co-workers are hard working but all are part time so theres a high turn over rate. Hardest part of the job is working there for as long as I was with all of the supplementals and tight schedules it can be stressful at times.I enjoyed working there though because time whizzes by keeping busy all day.
good,The job was good. There's a lot of team work. The manager is easy going with workers.
good,fast paste work. great experience in warehouse truck loading. great company to work for. there is always room to grow.
good,"I enjoyed working at FedEx, However I missed the employee to customer interaction. I liked the people i worked with and the job wasn't to hard all you did was scan boxes and load trailers. Management for my team wasn't so great, they didn't stay on top of anything. I learned how to pack boxes into a trailer to gain full capacity."
good,"Amazing place to work. Great pay. Inbound works at extreme hours. Besides that, supervisors, benefits and everything else is great."
good,Long hours with only one break though out the night. Hard work along with some heavy lifting.
good,FedEx is a people first company and puts a great amount of emphasis on the development of their employee's.  They helped pay for college and I learned many professional skills along the way.
good,"FedEx is one of the best courier companies in the world and have stuff to match that Title. Working at FedEx is a pleasure but I seek an opportunity in the IT field so I can follow a dream of being accomplished on Day in the programming Field. Hardest part would of been working away from the company, I had to adapt to a new environment quick and build trust with clients for my Company."
good,I have many opportunities to grow and move throughout the company. A great job to have if you have a family
good,"Most of the time when there, it is busy.   Somedays it can be hectic, when the company is behind on productivity.   I have "
good,"Fedex is a well paying, yet difficult place to work at times. While it is fairly well known what is expected, there were times the expectations changed without being communicated in a timely manner although when communicated they were clearly put and understandable. My co-workers were the best part of the job by far, and many of them I had time to get to know personally! Management was open and they listened, however many policies were strictly based on corporate input and not so much on employee input. The best part of Fedex was the consistency and reliability the company offered, although it was a very hard company to advance your career in due to a lot of competition for each position."
good,I learned how to take control of a team environment while almost solely taking responsibility when things don't go exactly right amongst my team.
good,Excellent company to work at.  Very good salary and benefits. Would like to work an earlier day rather than second shift with a guarantee of hours.
good,Come to work ready to work wasn't anything major jus do the job. the easy part was there was no one right over you telling you what to do unless u needed the help. There are always someone when you need them
good,"very repetitive but easy going"
good,Work as a member of a conveyor belt. Scan and ba g freight. I'm not getting a lot of hours right now so im trying to find a better job.
good,"Anything can happen on any given day"
good,"A great starter or part time job. I worked here for almost two years, would I go back....No. Very hard work!!!"
good,Very easy simple job depending what part of the facility you are working. I learned how to properly unload and load a trailer without damaging packages. I also learned how to scan parcels and meeting standard goals by using my time efficiently.
good,"shipping packages, keep my people on task.  Hardest part was managing 15-20 different personalities.  Time"
good,it a fast pased work place. always on the move to get the customer their package.
good,Always something new to do. Variety of workload. Co-workers were helpful and patient. Hardest part of the job is the variety of work place procedure and protocol . Most enjoyable part of the job would be learning new procedures and the satisfaction of a job well done.
good,"A very good job, had in awesome experience, but it is time for me to go further in my career"
good,Very well managed and great orientation training. each day was simple and outlined in the daily brief
good,"process packages, sorting mail and packages in crates by area for deliveries"
good,An expected van load rate is 200+ per hour. It is virtually impossible to keep up with that expectation. But they are understanding and will do what they can to help you succeed.
good,FedEx has been very good to me in the 10 years that I have worked with the company. It has allowed me to have good benefits and the ability to transfer to Phoenix from Fresno.
good,I liked the fact that my coworkers and i worked as a team. The people i met along this journey were awesome to work with. It made the day go by fast. The manager was very nice. It was very fast paced which i really like and made the day go fast as well.
good,"Excellent driving skills a must."
good,"I like the hours of the schedule, I like working on the trucks with limited supervisor visits. Management needs to better understand some of the things that go on in the shops"
good,"On a typical day you'd walk through the guard shack then head to your respective area to attend a presort meeting held by your manager to discuss what kind of work we're expecting for the day. If your area is in the load end you'll then step up into 1 of your assigned trailers. If you work in the unload you'll enter an open door and begin to unload. "
good,"Aprendi a trabalhar em grupo, a ser dinâmica e respeitar a opinião dos colegas."
good,FedEx is focused on customer first and providing an outstanding FedEx experience for every person the company impacts.
good,The hardest part about the job is peek season the work load is faster and very heavy
good,Start everyday by driving to a meetpoint and then loading my freight.  Delivered and picked up packages throughout day and did a shuttle run with outbound freight in the evenings.  Learned how to find a house even way out in the countryside without having to use GPS.  I can find any house anywhere just by using the house number and coordinating with the roads.  I communicated heavily with other drivers to stay in touch and meet deadlines.  Hardest part of the job was dealing with winterstorms and delays.  I really enjoyed seeing people thoughout the day while delivering.
good,"In a normal work day we would start by discussing numbers, the weather and expected freight for the night.  After the short 5-10 minute meeting we would then disperse and start our tasks for the night.  My task was usually to drive a tug and transport freight from planes to the hub for the first half of the night, then the second half I would operate a loader at a plane until all freight was on board.  "
good,"Overall, FedEx Smartpost was a fun and good place to work. We would come in, stretch, have a quick meeting about the day or the previous day's activities. Then we would begin our assignments. My co-workers were great. We all helped each other out. Hardest part of the job would have to be when we had a lot of trucks and we had to keep our line under control."
good,"Easy job to get up and do each day within the part time hours range.  Early or late shifts depending on preference.  Can be fast paced at times, but with other dependable co-workers, the job flies by with ease."
good,"The job duties weren't very complex, but they were physically demanding.  Each morning we would briefly go over the performance of the previous day and announce how much volume we could expect during the current shift.  Then, after stretching, we would go to our various positions on the conveyor belt (our positions would regularly rotate between unloading trucks, scanning and labeling packages, and sorting packages according to route and order of delivery) and work until every package was sorted and ready to be loaded onto the delivery trucks by the drivers.  It was mostly enjoyable: I grew close to some of my co-workers and I liked the exercise.  The most stressful part of the job was how certain positions on the conveyor belt would get jammed and eventually release a torrent of packages.  The employees would then hurriedly try to keep up with the flow (often unsuccessfully), but more likely than not would have to request help."
good,"FedEx Ground is a really fast paced work place, very quick room for advancement. The most difficult part of working in FedEx Ground is during holiday season when people are shipping their presents and the warehouse receives and ships about 30,000 packages per night. The enjoyable part to the job (At least for me) that times goes by quickly and you can get a good workout from it."
good,"I worked for 4 and a half years at FedEx Office."
good,A typical day at work was I would punch in three minutes before my shift started and our whole group would be with our work managers and discuss our goals for the night ( the scanning of boxes per hour). We got thirty minute breaks if we were working eight hours or more. I loved working with FedEx except I wish I had a full time job with them instead of just season.
good,"A keen eye for production is needed, this job is NOT for everyone. *Slow workers/learners will have a hard time adapting."
good,I worked here for over a year and They are good if you want to have a lot of free time on your hands but still have a bit of cash :) but they dont pay enough to make a good living off of.
good,Production job. Very repetitious. Has a pool table in beak room.
good,I love working for FedEx because they care about they employees and take good care of us.
good,co-workers great. Hours were good. Pay pretty even with competition.
good,"I like working there"
good,"FedEx was a great company to work for. I had to stay on task and be on time to delieveries. I got the chance to get to know lots of people and help them get the things they needed to. I made many friends at the places I delivered. I'd usually start by checking out my truck when I was driving to be sure everything was in its place and secure for the trip ahead. I'd then check my truck out to make sure it was good and no mechanical problems so I could make a safe trip. The day was pretty simple, just had to make the delieveries on time, "
good,"I get to work early, prepare, plan, and carry out a thorough and developed successful plan.    Plan to succeed and accept and adapt to necessary changes."
good,This position requires extreme responsibility and safety work ethics. Defensive driving is apart of the daily tasks that is crucial in effectively doing the job well and delivering on a timely manner. It is a position that requires quality customer service and routinely sale leads.
good,"A typical day at work was punching in and get your first trailor assignment . Once you received your first door you starting moving freight and wouldn't stop till your 4 hour shift was over."
good,"Excellent benefits."
good,"It's a great place to work part time with a good life balance. Many of the part time employees are college students or people with full time day jobs looking to make extra money. "
good,"The work environment there is great, you make friends there fairly easy, and the job is pretty self explanatory. The supervisors are there when you need them, but the higher ups are very picky on who can advance."
good,"A typical day would be to get there early ,clock in, talk with managers regarding locations being delivered, pick up a delivery log and check what van am i going to be using and make sure the van is in good condition, turn on the vehicle and make sure everything is ready to go. And begin my day getting to the first delivery spot, and meeting with the manager, then i unload the product or they load the product if i am picking up and come back to the warehouse and unload the parts and then go off again to the next destination till my i complete my delivery log and i have to Highlight each place i went to."
good,Warehouse executive with SAP end user with 8 years experience
good,"when i get to work i wait to be told what station i would be working for the day. i learned to work fast , multi task, think on my feet. i get along with all of my team mates, i work very well with people. the hardest part of my job is the schedule , we work very early in the morning (start time between 4 am and 5 am) and only work about 3 hours a day . i enjoy whom i work with ."
good,"FedEx is a team oriented environment that taught me a lot about time management and logistics. I enjoyed that my independent work efforts out on the road is facilitated by the team work done before hand in the warehouse. However, most of the management do not have enough work experience specific to the job they manage. The company ends up making decisions that are bottom line based and not necessarily business or employee based."
good,"5 days a week 10 months out of the year. Some long days though. Great benefits. Bonus based on achieving metrics, some of which are impossible to hit."
good,"The work environment could be fast paced and pressure filled, but I enjoyed that part as well as the problem solving parts of the job. The down side was there were people that became too comfortable in their positions and put more effort into avoiding work than actually doing the job they were paid to do."
good,"FedEx has trained and sharpened my managerial skills, how to build a team, and get desired results.  FedEx is a great place to work."
good,"Working at FedEx Ground is a wonderful experience. It was one of the best jobs you can have if you enjoy a lot of hard work that requires a lot of lifting, bending. The Customer being satisfied was one of the best things about working at FedEx Ground. If the Customer was happy with the service FedEx Ground had provided you could have a smile that was even bigger than the Customer's just knowing you were responsible in making sure that Customer received that package when it was promised to be delivered."
good,I learned so much during my experience there that I cannot be any more greatful about. I was given the opportunity to work as a product owner for several enhancements which was an honor as a business analyst.
good,"List of things completed in a normal work day:"
good,A typical day at work was 10 to 12 hour shifts. Everyday before we started work we had meetings about are job assignments. I learned how to build pallets and rap them. The management was great. My formal co workers were good to. We all worked as a team and together. The hardest part of the job was during holiday season. I enjoyed the fast pace.
good,"You bust your bottom from start to finish."
good,"scan boxes, load truck, drive rt given, great co-workers, great management.  Finding some address with no numbers on houses gets difficult."
good,Good place to work. Great enviroment could improve on pay and nature of the job when it comes to work and personal life time.
good,"Overall FedEx is a good company to work for. They have excellent pay and benefits. The jobs are not hard, overall the people are nice and friendly. The only real complain I have is that they are constantly changing their operations around which makes the positions unstable.  Every year or so they make a major change in operations which effects job stability. I never know if I will be laid off, forced to move, or forced to take a lower paid position."
good,"check your truck. get your papers from dispatch, hook trailer/s, do all necessary inspections then off."
good,good company go for a management position or a driver if not you will just be a laborer
good,Been with the FedEx for Three years. I find this job to enjoyable at time and hard work others. The people at this job makes it enjoy. This job do not have the workers it needs to get the job done. Good team work. I learn that hard work can get you far in the work place.
good,"The key strengths that I possess for success in this position include, but are not limited to the following: "
good,Most of job was good. Some days supervisors did not have trucks loaded on time.
good,very easy to communicate with management. hard work put coworkers make it easier.
good,Being an ECO Import Coordinator you had to be able to manage your time wisely in order to have your work completed by the end of your shift as well as paying very close to detail. It was a nice working environment and fun. I left the company with friends w are now more like family.
good,Was my first job. I have no complaints about the company. The flexible work hours were great. Working at the airport can be a hassle but the FedEx environment was great.
good,I have learned to work as a team member and try solving problems and to compromise. the most enjoyable part of the job is keep working with senior mates and you always something there to learn which is very helpful.
good,The overall experience working in the IT department as a contractor was good. The environment is very friendly and positive.

good,"Good location, in house certification. Good shift times. Good atmosphere."
good,It was a busy place to work.  Always something going on.  The office staff got along well. The management onsite was very helpful. The hardest part of the job was keeping suppliers up to date on their shipping.  There were a lot of employees and they were all good to work with.
good,"A typical day at work was quick and productive. I have learned a lot mostly concerning safety in the workplace. Management was always great, very helpful and considerate of every employee. Had a pep talk almost every morning to give everyone a good confidence boost on how well we were working and what we could do to improve. The co-workers were as they would be in any other job, working together gets the job done. The hardest part of the job would have to be the heavy lifting and limited space and time. Being that it was a fast pace job, heavy lifting slowed me down a little. I enjoyed the job because it was simple and i loved being able to move around."
good,"My day starts where everyone meets up and everyone greet each other but there is still a tense atmosphere. My boss gives me a trailer to work in and i start working hard. If there is trouble, I would assist my co-workers if i were done with my share or free at the moment due to the slow paced box placements. The hardest part of this job was being able to multi-task where the boxes could fit and where it would go. The most enjoyable part is that everyone there wants the company to succeed."
good,"Fed Ex is a great part-time job if u have a another career, or a family."

Enjoy the daily challenges faced with the operation."
good,Good job set up loads for dispatch monitor load quality and dock production.
good,"I work in the airport and the work is basically unloading and loading ULDs/trucks everyday. The pay isn't exactly the best considering the travel distance and being a graveyard shift but it's better than minimum wage. The job itself is an exercise, on certain days we get hit with freights real hard and on other days there's nothing at all. We usually get off work when the sort ends and that's both a good and bad thing since we get paid by the hour. The management isn't the best but my manager is very helpful. I was told that managers only work 4-5hours and get paid around 70k with bonuses. I was also told it is possible to stay with the company and get advancements. The perks are nice with health, dental and visual insurance co-paid by the company to part timers."
good,I usually went in around 10:00 p.m the work was very hard and long. I learned to value hard work and manage my money and it also taught me how to be a leader. The management was bad they didn't have order and never gave me a schedule for my own job. The hardest part of my job was loading the AMJ's and working my way up to Team Leader. The most enjoyable part of my job was the co-workers and gaining experience.
good,A type of day at work hard and intense. I lean timing team work dealing with new people The management was nice and respectful people and the co-workers were nice and friendly. The hardest part of the job was leaving. The most enjoyable part of the job is been there and working a nice group of people.
good,"I travel more than 25 miles to get to work. I push-in and put my things on for the job. I sign in with a scanner, so I can be prepared for items to come down a moving belt. There are three of us. One off-loads from pickup/delivery routes and the other two people scan and handle the packages to put into containers that fit inside the airplanes. About eight o'clock the other handler is put on-line to finish the sort, so we can get the truck out on time. Then I am responsible for closing out the containers, which is using their computer system. Then I start my PST. Which is required to check the trucks, station and office for anything that might have been left behind, after the truck has left the building. My manager is understanding when things come-up that is out of our control. My co-workers work well as a team. We are focuses on getting our jobs down without any delays. The hardest part of the job is there is no real down time, when we pull the containers to loading them. Other-words it is physically demanding,. The most rewarding part of this job, it physically rewarding, you do not have to pay for a membership to get into shape. Also when we get a 100% on our scans. This means that the consumers will receive their items on time without any delays in their shipment."
good,"I enjoyed working for Fedex. I was employed with Fedex for 15 yrs. I have the ability to transport items damage free because this is how we did it at Fedex. I learned to work smart and safe.I also demonstrated a great work ethic. I was a great team player, I believe in helping others. The hard part about being a dock worker was, reworking trailers behind others who improperly loaded the freight wrong. The most enjoyable part of the job for me was when a Supervisor or Manager would complement my work."

good,Ok company to work for.  Long hours exp duringing holiday seasons
good,crazy fast how to pack a truck the mangment  was real good at keeping us on track and the co workers was good the heat.
good,"they were very fast paced but all in all i like the company. the people were awesome (most of them) and the atmosphere was cool if you can get past the physical part the stacking becomes a breeze.one of the things i enjoyed was the compitetion between your fellow co-workers the person with the highest load rate won a prize. the hardest thing is dealing with all differnt sizes of the boxes and the various weights of them as well, you'll come across a box the size of you and it'll weigh 5-10lbs. and then right after that the next box would be the size of you hand (give or take) and weigh between 50-60lbs. it throws you off and slows you down while the boxes just keep comin but past all that it was all okay."
good,"Start of day is sorting out packages for delivery"
good,"Every day was a bit different. I was able to build skill in time management, & enjoyed interaction with customers. Management empowered employees to make customer happy even if it was inconvenient."

good,"Very busy, fast paced, pressure to get things done on time every hour of every day..  You learn time & deadlines so well that you don't even have to look at a clock.  Quite a few people move throughout the company.  Hardest part of the job is balancing all the urgency with safety everywhere (and dealing with all the cars on the roads.)"
good,"Good management for our work group, and overall a good co- workers to work with."
good,Working with FedEx Express has been a great learning experience. FedEx has great corporate culture and a very motivating work environment. I wish my contract was longer.
good,"Called customer regarding past due invoices, researched short paid invoices and submitted adjustments as needed.  Proofread and mailed invoices to customers. l learned it takes a lot of time management to manage your workload.  Management always professional.  They left you alone to do your work.  Co-workers always worked as a team as need to get the work done as needed.  The hardest part of my job was managing they workload to get through all the accounts.  The most enjoyable part of the job was being professional with the customers and getting to talk to them and being able to work out agreeable payment arrangements."
good,My day starts with a presort meeting.  That consists with a talk about the previous days work.  We stretch to prepare for the movements that we may have to make.  The management is thorough with their messages about safety.  My co-workers help each other whenever needed.
good,the was okay yuor learn new things only thing i didnt like was no hours .
good,"avantage scolaire, possibilité de faire les heures supplémentaires."
good,"FedEx was a great experience for me, despite only working there for 3 months. I learned a lot about working in a warehouse, and working overnights.

good,"I start my day at FedEx by coming in at 3:00 a.m. After scanning in my ID card, I pick up a company two-way radio, that I used in communicating among my co-workers, and setup the equipment that transports the packages to various trucks delivery vans.  Each package is scan and tagged with a coded number so that it placed on the correct van and deliver to its destination.  Everyday we strived to be 99.8% efficient.  "
good,"I enjoyed going to the job,and seemed like no matter how hard you,worked they always found fault,there was always reason to be written up, even though those power pads have failures.But I liked all my co-workers,got on well with everyone.I liked getting out on the road.Enjoyed my customers.The hardest part of the job was not missing any scans.I learned to put up and shut up!"
good,Great job to get in shape and maintain. Very tiring during the hot summer months. Long hours depending on route. Learned time management and very good with sense of direction and knowledge of San Antonio.
good,"The most fulfilling part of my job is I'm getting paid to work out and stay fit. Also this job suited my personality for the simply reason it is a fast pace job. You are constantly on the go and everyday was different and this was a criteria for this job you had to be able to adapt and adjust. I have worked for FedEx for 19 years, I have grown with this company, matured as a employee and feel that FedEx will always be apart of my family."

good,"Wake up early, two hours of hard work then you are done for the day. "
good,"I really enjoyed working at FedEx, the purple promise was a great asset when used properly."
good,The hardest part of the job for a new hire is to keep up with the time requirements while still delivering exceptional customer service. 
good,"From my first day as a package handler I bled Purple for FedEx. Employees are well compensated, provided with aid to advance personal goals, benefits which are usually more than adequate, and about as much job security as one can expect in today's job market."

good,My day at work is normally fast. I deliver and pickup packages from customer homes & business.

good,This is a great place to work. There are always new things to learn. The drawback is always having to work on the weekends.
good,"At work i am responsible for unloading trucks of boxes and getting them labeled with their correct address. Managers go about their day by telling everyone what to do. The hardest part of the job is the heavy lifting every day. It will being to take a toll of your physical body after a while. The best part of the job is the tuition reimbursement that they give you every year,"
good,"this was a very great place to work, the employees were all great, management was ok, and i love to work for them"
good,good people. permanent employees are very loyal. contractors are always coming and going.

good,"a typical work day starts early in the morning, organizing all the packages that would later be delivered to their destination, in a friendly environment with both the head and with the other employees, working together, the stronger and labored is on occasion when you have to walk long distances or rises with hand-truck full of boxes, and is ultimately more enjoyable when I see that all work is done with excellence and accountability."

The hours of operation are hard to keep from 4 am until whenever the days work is done that morning and then a split on Saturdays where you have to return at 4:45 pm for a second shift. Inconsistent hours make for difficulty in making plans and a steady sleep schedule."
good,being able to handle hi value loads and deliver them on time and safley
good,"FedEx is a great company to work for. They pay well and have amazing benefits; however, there are not many holiday's the company is allowed off. For example, Christmas, which is the busiest time of year for FedEx, they are only allowed Christmas day off. That means no travel and barely any time to spend with your families. One of the best things about working for FedEx, is the teamwork. Co-workers help each other. Drivers also get gifts and awards for safe driving. I think the management team could be a little better at communicating and working with each other like the hourly employees do. Working at FedEx I learned that hard work pays off. Going ""above and beyond"" is really worth the extra mile. The more we help others, the better we feel, which in turn, will encourage us to do better for ourselves and for the companies we work for."
good,"Very physically demanding and time consuming, but definite job security and constant work. Paid well and learned much about the geography and demographic of my work area and those around me. Management was great and I met many wonderful co-workers and customers."

good,"loved working here...The training was great! There is a lot of stress during the peak season, but the overtime pays good. Management was okay, but some are rude and do not appreciate those working under them. They love giving back to the community. There is a lot of unprofessional people working the company. However, overall its a great place!"
good,"Load trucks, unload trucks, sweat. We would do this inside of trailers as the conveyer belt brought new packages we would scan them and stack them neatly until it was full, then repeat."
good,FedEx Express has been very important to me for the past six years. It has allowed me a steady job and very good benefits. I have some good memories and have learned a lot about the freight and air cargo industry. I feel that I will effectively be able to apply these learned values at other places throughout my life.
good,A typical day at work included delivering & picking up time sensitive deliveries to residents & businesses throughout South Eastern Wisconsin. I learned how to manage my time while completing my route timely. I really enjoyed working for this company.

good,The manager took care of thier employees. Everybody strived to work steady and together as a team. We had mandatory meetings about production and where we stood as a whole.
good,"It was rough working as a material handler, We had to work outside at night in any weather condition. Operate heavy machinery, a lot of heavy lifting, pushing and pulling of cargo containers. The co-workers were half hard workers, and half lazy. We had to work as a team, so if they were lazy we had to pick up their slack."

The management was great and always have positive meeting before work to make us aware of what to come. A lot of co-workers were close friends of my from school so it was a lot of fun. Hardest part of the job is Mondays and Tuesdays because of the furniture. Friday is the easiest part of the job because the load is not so bad and its pay day.
good,Very Good training. Instructors were very good at teaching us how the system works.
good,"A good job working with others on the sort and then working by yourself in the outdoors meeting other people. Co-workers become your new best friends and management is like any other work place. The hardest part of the job is the beginning where you have learn your route and make the deliveries on time. Once you learn your area, the job is a breeze. The most enjoyable part of the job is when you look in your truck and notice most of the packages are delivered so you don't have to worry about going to the same place the next day."
good,Fedex is a wonderful place to work as a part time employee.
good,"Great employees and co-workers, enjoyed meeting customers. The hardest part is not having delivery lates. The most enjoyable part of my job was the opportunity to meet new people daily."

good,"The hours are very early so that I have all day to apply to jobs and interview while still maintaining a job with benefits. The benefits include medical, dental, vision, vacation, and holiday pay."
good,"Come in ready to work in whatever weather was at hand. Management was very strict on procedure and safety, and very helpful with workload. Co-workers were very high enduranced individuals. Most difficult part of the job was the various workloads on a daily basis. The part of the job that was most enjoyed was the company cookouts."
good,"Not much to say about this one. Its fast paced loading and unloading of trailers for hours. Hustle, Hustle, Hustle!"
good,"The company allowed me to grow, and develop into the professional I am today. But the company is very competitive with it's workload. They need to learn, and understand teamwork instead of just professing it."

good,Fedex ground is a Good job for someone looking for a little extra cash.
good,they help you learn more on the job and the code of conduct is the best because everyone follows the rules.
good,"I worked 3rd shift at FedEx, it was an upbeat pace that I liked. Work went by fast, but for me was fun. I learned how to load planes, drive a tug, and to operate several pieces of heavy equipment. Overall management was fine, as well as the co-workers. The hardest part of my job was the environment, we didn't have heat or air so it could be bad at times, the most enjoyable part would have to be the hours and the benefits you receive immediately."
good,"I was an intern here. Management was great as were the co-workers. It was a typical 9-5 job, but the day went by fast with the people I worked with. I really enjoyed working for FedEx."
good,Laid back atmosphere while getting tons of work done efficiently.
good,Working at this location is challenging and a constant learning experience. The co workers are excellent!
good,"A typical day presents various challenges, but with the right amount of room to work and adequate resources to complete tasks, the day isn't too bad. I learned self-management, and various routing techniques. Co-workers did not present a problem, however there were times when people mixed work with personal issues; not a good mix. The hardest part of the job might have been initially adjusting to certain routes. The most enjoyable part of the job is meeting different customers and being able to go into various locations (buildings) that I normally would not have the opportunity to visit."
good,"Become familiar with new points of delivery to which I have never before navigated, and present packages in a friendly and timely manner, obtaining signatures when possible/if necessary, taking note of particular routes to insure more quick and efficient navigation to these points in the future, completing deliveries in the quickest and safest way possible, operating the handheld Automated Manifest Verification software used to scan barcodes to both place packages into the system, and to release them at their points of delivery."
good,"I learned how to work fryers,prepare and cook food. The workplace has friendly and helpful co-workers which are really a team but more like family. The hardest part of the job was not eating the food! The most enjoyable part of the job was getting good reports on my food."
good,Work for this company for five years it was time for a change. Fedex just cutting hours every month. Was trying make out here with a part of a check. It is also hard to get a full time position with company. Maybe if I stayed there little longer I maybe would have a full time position.
good,"Typical day at Fedex is crazy. freight comes in every direction and trying to sort it is nuts. I learned patients while at fedex. Most the managers i had were pretty easy going and down to earth. the hardest part of my job was the weather. Driving a tug in the snow was fun but, the rain and sleet and being cold was the worst. I enjoyed being outside most of the time (when the weather was nice). I pretty much worked without supervision and did my job well."
good,"Unload/Load Trucks, Always Moving at a Fast Pace, Proper Lifting, The Management is Always Busy, Helping Others, Most Co Workers Are Helper"
good,"Easy but dronish work starting out, possible to move up as you gain more exp, pretty standard professional work environment where safety is an emphasis. You just have to watch out because all accidents are preventable, if you get hit in the eye with a class 4 laser, it was preventable, because you did not stop the supervillain over the weekend that shot the class 4 laser into your eye."
good,The best part of the job is that there is always something to learn and better myself
good,"My days with Fedex consisted of a pick up / delivery route where I drove to customer sites and collected the out going Fedex packages or delivered the inbound packages. Everyday was a different day as I would not only have regular customers to see but customers that would call in and ask for a driver to come by for their packages as well. All these stops had to be made in a timely manner and I was not supposed to be on the road working longer than the time frame established for this route. It's a very fast paced job and a sense of urgency is a must! I learned how to multitask on an extreme level. I was also a candidate for management there and later decided against it but by that time I was already into a Lead position on Saturdays and my senior manager wouldn't let me out of it! I had to relocate within the company and then transfer back to get a Monday thru Friday route where I was no longer in a position to be over an entire operation and its crew. I wasn't unhappy to do this position as Saturday Lead, it was the fact that I also had to be a courier, a customer service agent as well as a trace agent mixed in with a managers duties! Managers at Fedex do one thing..... manage. On Saturdays I did the job of 4 different departments which made it very displeasing to work on Saturdays for this company. I not only was the Saturday Lead but I was also expected to go on the road to help the other couriers meet their deliveries on time and had to relieve the customer service agent for her break by manning the front counter where the customers came in. I also handled customer phone"
good,"Busy usually at work. Ive learned more responisbility and team work. Management is ok, not to thrilled about them. My co-workers are awesome and amazing, i love them!"
good,Typical days were never the same. Responsible for ensuring job task were completed regardless of the situation.
good,"Busy, how to work at a fast pace and still keep everything correct, they were alright, friendly, getting everything on the breakers on time, working in my own space."
good,"Very detailed with training. Advancement opportunities always available. Acknowledgement of personal achievements and flexible. Only a few took their ""position"" too seriously to where they treated you unfairly or badgered you with their title."
good,"Pick up and deliver packages from various customers throughout the day. This requires accuracy and safety. The hardest part of the day is when there is traffic snarls, the best part of the day is moving around and talking with customers."
good,"Company understands that at the end of the day, the best we could have done was to continually provide the best service quality and customer satisfaction."
good,FedEx is a great place to work if one is to be looking for great benefits as a permanent part-time employee. It is a challenging job in the physical realm. Be prepared for a work out.
good,Load packages into trucks part time. Mark and help track packages.
good,"Fedex is a good company to work for. There arent many places where you can work part time and have such good benefits, such as, health, dental and vision insurance and 401k. There are minimal opportunities to have anything close to ""full time"" hours without working days and nights. The job is very physical and its not really a job where you use your brain much."
good,Customer service is top priority within the company. Making every customer experance outstanding. The chances for advancement are great if you are willing to relocate to different states as needed. Positions from the retail level on up to executive level.
good,I enjoyed working for fedex. I would not mind working for their company again in the future.
good,Driving all day delivering and picking up packages. Very fast pasted job that requires a lot of physical strength.
good,"While attending college FedEx Ground offered the perfect work schedule for me to balance work, life and school. Compensation should be better considering the strenuous and dangerous work environment. The Asheville management team, however, were some of the best people I've had the privilege of working for."
good,"I will not talk for all Fed Ex Careers, but the one where I was not organized at all. I started off as agency then grew from there. There is jobs sometimes then there is not. Some Managers are rude, but I did not take it as rude. I took as a simple task I can overcome to prove to them that I can succeed within the company. The job it self it not bad. But they do make you feel like apart of there team."
good,"This Job is not good with hours, we work at least three to four hours a day but get good benefits and discounts"
good,"This job requires tedious, fast paced manual labor. Very good college job. They are willing to work with your schedule. And it's like they pay you to get a workout"
good,"Working for Fedex freight  being part of the family was grateful that’s what my life and work ethics, responsibilities becoming the person grown to be.."
good,You have to always be ready to work because you never know how busy you will be. Whether you are loading or unloading trucks it is important to be hitting your target goal of boxes per hour as well as staying safe and keeping a clean work space.
good,"With its promotional opportunities, FedEx Trade Networks is a pretty good company for entry level positions as well as a place to further a career in transportation and brokerage. This is all office work and you will be sitting at a computer for 40 hours a week. Although it depends on the position, most of the work is data entry and customer service. "

good,"It all depended on your management staff. Some of my coworkers were were great.  My assistant were great but again it all depended on the manager that you had. My first experience with my first manager was like a nightmare on Elm street. The staff didn't want to train me. I went through a lot of ugly things. . Everyone quit, I was stuck with the manager she was horrible., but  I hung in their until smaupper"
good,Very productive and busy workplace. Very friendly and respectable people to work with. Need to be let people be off on reserved holidays to spend time with their family.
good,"I deliver early mail also did night unloading trucks"
good,The only thing that was good about fedex was the pay but everything else was in part time and full time it was always a hassle trying to switch.  Sometimes things were all over the place and not to mention the hours were terrible.  I would only be there for about 3 hours tops and then I'd be sent home which took a lot of time and especially gas
good,Great place to work with lots of opportunities for advancement. Opportunities to relocate anywhere around the country. great benefit package and overall good job security.
good,"Good company, slow to change.  Many legacy programs and such that they cannot let go of.  Benefits are very very good, salary is good.  Culture is good.  Not much advancement in I.T. other departments there is"
good,"Fedex was a wonderful company to work for, with minor rules you may have to adjust your regular life habits for. Relatively easy job as long as you know how to follow the chain of command and work in a timely manner accurately."
good,"Todo esta excelente en la empresa, lo único que no tiene mi voto a favor era la exigencia de horario con jornada de más de 12 horas. la ventaja es que se compensa con que te pagaban horas extra, así que era bueno"
good,"Enjoyed my time working at fedex, got on easily with the other workers, work load can be hard at certain times especially towards Christmas l. Management were pretty good."
good,"The work is very tedious, but keeps you busy. There is alot of standardization going on at the moment so there are alot of changes in regard to job training and functionality."
good,Is a good place to work at. Would love for the pay to be a little bit more. Also dont like the fact that theres no cameras out in the parking lot. My car was hit by another car and there was no way of finding out who did it. Overall i like the department i work in and also the manager i have. His a cool guy and does his job right.
good,Show up for work and do your daily assigned route and you will be rewarded. The benefits are great. Also with time employed you will receive plenty of time off to balance work/personal life.
good,"dovete sapere che questo è un lavoro molto stressante per la gestione delle consegne, dei tempi dei ritiri, perché a differenza di altri tanti corrieri in Italia, qui devi essere bravo anche a gestire i ritiri lavorandolì come agent service, con la consapevolezza che dalle tue mani arriverà direttamente su un aereo."
good,Spend a few hours loading large trucks. It can get difficult with all different sized packages coming in quickly. Must be organized and quick on your feet

good,"Good work invirement ,good team work . inspired to move up in company ,great lerning and skill development,  work in difrent areas of the wherehouse ."
good,Great company to work for. Low pay for some operating companies. Some departments have inherently lower morals due to the nature of the job. Claims and customer service tends to be more negative in day to day experience yet are the least compensated positions.
good,"parking sometimes hard to find, security measures can change from day to day even with the same personal, a good working crew that communicates well for what needs to be done, and a sense of accomplishment at the end of each work day."
good,Its a fast-pace job. You might work alone loading or unloading a truck. Many packages to sort through and scan. It takes a focus and strong mental to keep up.
good,"Shipping department,  we start and end of work shift have never been same times everyday. Someday we start early 5am (especially Monday) and next day would start 8 or 9am and next 2-3 day of the week would start 10, 11 or 12pm. And at the end of shift, we have never know the exact time we will be done. We stopped working at the last box got in the tuck."
good,Not recommended for single parents. Peak season is November (day after Thanksgiving through first week of January); Mandatory hours during this time period. Benefits are great!

good,"Only do this job if you are willing to be extremely physically active for the 3 to 5 hours you're on shift.  Typical package handler shift starts at 415 am and goes to about 830am sometimes a little earlier or later depending on how busy it is.  You are responsible for either unloading or loading several trucks per shift.  For the majority of the shift you will be on your feet, walking, bending, lifting up to 100 pounds. It's a great workout."
good,"At my time at FedEx coworkers and managers were friendly and always willing to teach."
good,"By the time I worked, I was able to move up  and progress, and also they helped me study. I am very grateful for all that FedEx offered to me. I'm  retired to start my own business, otherwise I would have continued on FedEx"
good,"Fedex was a good place to work. The workload is rather repetitive but it isn't anything difficult or challenging. You'd have to learn the routes you're assigned, have the ability to deliver a number of priority packages before 10am. Most enjoyable part of the job is meeting a diverse amount of individuals along your route and building new relationships."
good,I really like the experience of working an learning new thangs. Fedex thought me a lot like great costumer service. I enjoyed meeting new people am working together.
good,Nice place to work and get paid well. Team building helps the harder task go by faster. You don't have to work on Saturday and Sunday. But working one Sunday out of the month is required.
good,"Empresa com ótima cultura e muito boa para aprendizado, porém os gestores estavam muito mais preocupada em aportar culpados em vez de solucionar os problemas."
good,Fedex was a great job to work for. Started off as a package handler worked my way into the office due to it being a brand new building. Worked with the drivers
good,I much enjoyed this job since it came from me working at ups. So to me it was like going to work for the same job I use to have. So I was use to the fast pace and job.
good,"a lot of good people to work with very cooperative and helpful. The handler's main job is to load and unload packages, boxes, and general freight from trucks or other delivery vehicles."
good,Excellent benefits perks and discounts.I loved the fact that I was able to transfer to anywhere in the united states every six months.The routes was cool also
good,Fast pace work out job a lot of stop ane go driving and using maps on the phone once you got it down it's a piece of cake it's only long hours if you take your time.
good,Good part time work.  full time schedule not family friendly.  will work with your schedule and chance to advance if your willing to work nights.  Not for everyone.
good,"You have opportunities to do grow, by pursing more knowledge, showing up to work on time, and being productive. Your attitude carries you a log way at this job."
good,"FedEx is a up coming company that is very fast pace  in the work environment.  You have to focus on the task with a lot of distractions happening while you are trying to do the job.  Whether its working an trace or helping a courier on returned package or maybe an phone is ringing, maybe there is an customer at the front counter. Making quick and smart choices on the job is very important. Management is always there to help if needed."
good,Working at FedEx was great learned and gained alot of experience managers and employees were easy to get along with never had any hard time I highly suggest applying with them
good,Customer Service friendly . Repetitive work .To slow pace for e .Got bored quickly . Very expensive insurance. Chances to move up in company . Great training
good,You sometimes don't get the full 4 hours so u might only do 2 or 3 hours. But overall it's okay for it being my first job. Just make sure to have second job cuz this won't pay the bills.
good,"As a member of the sorting staff, I was able to clear the packages for shipment. Another feature of my job was to stack the uncleared packages away on bunks."
good,I think I will like working for ground cause I use to work for the hub for 10 years and like working I'm a hard worker learn fast good with people friendly face nice to work with
good,Needs helpers for delevry there are days when i could use a little help for that day when Im super packed with packages and the loaders don't help any by just stuffer it all in the truck.
good,"This job is not for everyone! If you possess a willingness to be a part of a team, and can handle the physical challenges, you will fit in nicely. The environment is user friendly if you get managers who care about you! The bottom line is productive, so be prepared to work!"
good,"I enjoyed working for fedex, although i manage to adapt to management, most people struggled with how managers treated them. My only issue is that the time aren't steady. You start 2 o'clock one day and the mext day 3. They don't tell you of schedule changes till the end of the shift. And you can't leave until the work load is down"
good,"I am still currently at FedEx   Hard work, pay could be better, but benefits are what keeps me coming back.   Used to be all about the package handlers, but with rising costs, and lower reimbursement, part of the culture of reward and recognition has dropped by the way side   Hope they can get back to that"
good,"You won't get many hours, but with the kind of work you'll be doing you more than likely won't be able to handle 8 hours of it. They do have opportunities to work mornings or afternoons if available, but I wouldn't depend on it much. Other than that, if you need a part time job to work around school or another job it's not bad to look into it, if you don't mind physical labor."
good,"Great job, could be stressful at times but overall a great enviorment and company to work for other than during peak season, can be easy at other times"
good,"A very good job........!!!!!!and good benefits as well as a good work , life balanced .the pay is very good and the over all job work is great , needs management work but can see that being fixed with it good couching and people skill ."
good,"good paycheck for hard work. it gets hot in the summers and cold in the winters, heavy,  sweaty manual labor, frustrating driving. But you finish on your own time and customers love getting their mail."
good,"Fast paced "
good,"This company is a fast paced, hard on your back and knees plus you are working in the heat at all times. But I will say they make sure you stay hydrated"
good,"The location at Troy Hill in Colorado Springs on operates 2 shifts"
good,"Fedex has many options, they are all very different. I really enjoyed my position in FTL, but had to start at retail here. The opportunities are many at Ground and Express, Office is limited but the environment is clean, friendly and fun."
good,Great benefits.. management is pretty nice. I learned time management working at Fedex.. Hardest part of the job is waking up at 3am each and everyday.
good,Pues aprendí cómo cargar mercancías varías uno solo y conocí gran parte del Bajío y rancherias cercanas de mi ciudad Querétaro
good,"You have to be there very early so that means you have to go to sleep earlier to function so it definitely gets in they way of your social life, but it decent pay for a quick morning shift job to make some extra money"
good,I will work at FedEx again nice working environment. U get paid training and rewards for improvement on the job . They let u apply to jobs before they post the to the public and monthly raises.
good,"Good place to work and easy task. The shifts hours is"
good,I enjoyed working with everyone at FedEx.  It was more like a family.  I fit in from the beginning and there is a lot of working together to accomplish goals.
good,"My typical work day involved meeting and coaching employees, reviewing and analyzing data, cooperative work environment. "
good,"You unload and load trailers of freight at a fast pace."
good,"Working for FedEx is awesome. I loved my job but management was very poor. It was a lot of favoritism. I had co workers, part time just like me, telling my supervisor how to run his job as manager. More men than women. Only want women who they like to get easy jobs.(just scanning)"
good,"Working at FedEx is very tough but the pay is definitely worth it, and they encourage you to move up. They've got plenty of shifts for any time of the day and are almost always in need of more people."
good,A very good work place and a fast pace you can move up in the company really fast . They train you and make sure you are comfortable doing the job before you are left to do the jod
good,Working in a fast pace environment I loved every minute of it. I had a good time even though it was only for 3 months. I would love to go back again if I’m able too
good,Great place to work;  howeverits just difficult life/work balance on night shift. The compensation is fair and adequate even though some nights are longer than others. Management are on top of thing a push for career growth
good,"I like working at Fed Ex, the work is fast paced,keeps me physically in shape and I like the people I work with ,mostly an enjoyable experience for me I have a couple of kids in college and it helps to pay their tuition"
good,I was in need of medical insurance for myself and family. I was pleased to find out fed ex offered it to even part time. Pay is weekly and it’s short hours if you’re just looking for a job with family benefits.
good,"A lot is asked of you, but I felt to be fairly compensated and had the pleasure of working with some excellent managers and supervisors. At times the work/life balance can be hard to maintain due to the schedule."
good,"A typical day, loading, organizing truck. Great contractors who are understanding and flexible."
good,FedEx Trade Networks is a great place to work and grow within the freight forwarding industry. The work is consistent and the opportunity for advancement is there.
good,"Very basic skills needed. Easy to pick up on daily routine. A good side job, especially if local operation is not full time. Little to no experience required so don't be afraid to apply"
good,"You get paid to work out!!! Drink plenty of water"
good,Its an ok 2nd job or good for college students. The hours are short and no breaks. Management is pretty good on both shifts. Fast paced work and very physical.
good,"Very busy days. As management, does not allow good work/life balance.  My manger was wonderful and was always helpful.  Hard to get approval to hire help even if you are drowning. Great culture. Good co workers."
good,"Working for FedEx is a customer service that shipped and delivered packages in a timely manner. Getting to meet variety of people, making friendly conversation."
good,"Great way to stay in shape, cool people to work,  if you get some that's not lazy..  that makes a big difference. They treat you if you have a good work shift."
good,"A typical day at work involved looking at the planned and forecasted volume and making staffing decisions based off of the plan.  Intense environment, but potential for development and advancement is high."
good,"Overall, FedEx is a great company to work for. The logistics Co-Op is far from perfect, still needs structure but could be great in the future. Benefits are great!"
good,"Fast paced"
good,"Decent job that can turn into a full time opportunity, as a delivery driver. Offers nice benefits for just being part time too. Can turn into a career."
good,Started in 1982 when the company was still very young. All employees were responsible for knowing how to do courier routes. Many good things to say about Federal Express and my days working in NYC. Its been too long since I worked for them so I cannot give a detailed review
good,Fedex was a nice place to work provided flexiblity but at some points the shifts would be too short therefore you don’t make enough hours on your check to make ends meet
good,FedEx is a good company to work for they take care of their employee's and treat everyone equally. I do wish they would give more opportunities to advance within. It seems like these come and go without any information given out. I do love the tuition reimbursement. This is a great part time job for students.
good,"Great core group of people dedicated to getting the job done."
good,Good place to work for college part time hours for people. Peak season is when you will make more money because you are allowed to work overtime. Tuition reimbursement
good,"This job will keep you moving nonstop, it is a labor, and is good for people who dont like to stay still. This job is also good is you want to stay in shape. The hardest part about this job is how busy it can get and how many boxes come at once."
good,"Over all working at FedEx is fun and depending on the people you work with it, you can have a great day. Everything is team work, very fast paste, hard work and lifting depending on where they put you."
good,"Day fast-pace environment"
good,"I worked for a Contractor of Federal Express - not the actual company, therefore this question can't be accurately answered based on the question provided."
good,Everyday was wonderful and challenging. The managers where down to earth and wanted you to succeed and be happy. They provided a great environment of trust and confidence that you were a part of the team and that they cared about you.
good,"Have your Superior put the papers in so you can get paid, make sure that you are covered when you get hurt, I was off without pay, now I do not know if I'm going  back to work, waiting for them"
good,I enjoyed working at fedex. the environment was nice. I learned a lot there. my first manager was great. but my recent manager was not so good. I loved working there but not enough hours.
good,"FedEx is a good company that takes care of their employees when it comes to vacation. In terms of paying, they are cheap even though they are a big corporation. Other than that FedEx gives you the expertise in terms of sales and creating orders by using a software easy to learn if you get the right mentor."
good,fast but fun and competetive job. almost like a sport . it was fun but they do want you to work your butt off. i would go back. it wasnt bad at all. the packages are usually under 20 lbs.
good,I love working for them It was fast paced and they give you a vehicle to drive. I really like the people and place was close. I would recommmend to anyone
good,Slow paced job. I have learned ins and outs of computer systems. Shipment details I am very fond with now. I enjoy the down time a lot.You usually would get mad about the way time goes slowly but you will learn to get over it.
good,its very fast paced but you have a lot of help they also believe in team work. they are very motivating. there is always space to move up in the company if you want to.
good,"Crazy fast paced, if you get caught up in the money, you'll let your physical and mental health slip, which what happened to me and i soon realized it wasnt worth it. Great start up company, if youre looking for more, you better have an idea what you want to do afterwards because you wont find it here."
good,"great workout while working, different managers run the shift differently which can be frustrating but as long as you complete your general task by the end of shift everything works out. water provided, snacks sometimes provided. the better your shift completes the flow the more rewards your team is given."
good,Fedex Is A Fast Paced On Going Job Its Temporary And Called in Everything Is Due on A Time Limited Its a Tiring job but It Has to Get Done. Its Well Paid and you would Get Enough Hours...
good,"A typical day at FedEx would be clocking in and going to the assigned location to unload or load the trucks as directed. As you finish up one truck you get assigned another until the day is done. "
good,"At FedEx, you will work with smart, great people who want to do the right thing for their customers. Like all very large organizations,  sometimes inertia makes it hard to move as quickly as you want."
good,"Very productive , you get the hours you need and and I love the fact that you have a set schedule , five days a week.  It’s a very fast paste job which makes the day go by faster"
good,It was a great job. I'm thankful for my time at FedEx.  I would recommend working there if you have the time and you need some extra money for the holidays or you are looking to start a career.
good,"The toughest part of this job is what shift you want to work and attendance. Only you can get yourself fired. Depending on your position the job can be easy. Some packages are light others are heavy but the ball matt floor can help for the heavier objects. You should be able to find somebody to be cool with while working there, it's a friendly environment."
good,"No rápido momento que tive dentro da empresa, pude perceber que era bem organizada."
good,Presort packages and delivery packages in assigned territory; enjoyed to challenge to meeting expected deadlines to make deliveries; most difficult aspect of performing my deliver duties were protecting myself from neighborhood dogs.
good,I recommend when you start at Fed Ex and 401K (retirement investments) presented to you. I would invest in it as soon as possible. As you work also grow as time goes by.
good,"In my 17 years with FedEx I had approx. 15 different center managers. The turnover in management is directly related to the stress put on them. Not to mention, they hire inexperienced, but college educated individuals who are clueless when it comes to the freight industry. They become overwhelmed and eventually leave or are asked to leave. The few great managers I had there got burned out and left. More promotion from within would be great, but there's little incentive for drivers to go into management because the drivers make more (on a per hour basis) than most managers and don't have the stress or responsibilities of management. Also, if you're really good at your job and productive..... expect management to put more workload on you while the ""slackers"" are allowed to continually slack away for the same amount of pay. That is the true culture and is what I experienced over and over and over again for 17 years."
good,Fast paced and competitive work place. within the first month I was trained to work in multiple locations in the warehouse and moved around as needed within.
good,"Con una esperienza maturata durante 16 anni di lavoro posso senz'altro affermare che FedEx è cresciuta moltissimo in termini di risultati ottenuti e riorganizzazione delle mansioni in fase d'integrazione a seguito dell'acquisto della azienda TNT. Il mio ruolo prevedeva un'attenta preventiva pianificazione delle attività commerciali che si sviluppavano attraverso conference calls / meeting settimanali e mensili, visite ai top customers nonché a risoluzioni di claims. Anche l'attività di training per i nuovi applicativi / servizi o prodotti , prevedeva un grosso impegno perché vedeva coinvolti i funzionari di vendita gerarchicamente miei diretti sottoposti. Inoltre la verifica puntuale dei risultati economici occupava buona parte della mia giornata , nonché il controllo delle scadenze e l'invio dei reports all'upper management. Oltre a ciò dovevo supervisionare l'organizzazione relativa a nuovi eventi che vedevano coinvolti i clienti e gli aspetti logistici relativi il tutto interfacciandomi con gran parte dei reparti aziendali. Relativamente alla parte più difficile del mio lavoro non posso che segnalare il grande carico di lavoro assegnatomi che necessariamente prevedeva un impegno medio di 14 ore medie giornaliere. La parte invece più piacevole è stato il raggiungimento degli obiettivi economici che ho sempre ottenuto e che mi hanno permesso di essere premiato come il miglior district sales manager europeo nonchè le gratificazioni che mi giungevano dai clienti e collaboratori."
good,"Good pay and good benefits, consistent loads, constantly busy, not much home time if you actually want to make money, some loads cancel before you get there and they don’t tell you"
good,"Overall, working at Fedex was very nice and collected. It can get hectic at time and was a very physical job, but if you understand that when you are hired then it should be no problem for you. I was very pleased with the friendly management, the understanding employees and was just delighted with a lot of the ins and outs of the company"
good,"Working at Fedex at first was very tricky learning to scan and load boxes in a certain way to avoid injuries. As well the environment was extremely loud and depending on the weather it would either be hot or cold, wearing the right clothes for the job was necessary or suffer working in terrible climate, although the break room has a nice variety of food in the vending machines. I have a few complaints considering working at Fedex mainly its most of the staff members that are not very flexible with personal or important conflict outside of work, the equipment tends to go out and the security checks when coming into work is a little bit unnecessary."
good,"constant customer stress, they want print work done right away and don't understand that it takes time to produce quality work. Management is great in giving you the tools to perform your job!"
good,load and unload freight on a forklift from one trailer and take to the corresponding trailer for shipping had to secure freight and build decks for the freight it came very easy and the people there were good to work with
good,"I set up our platforms, fill the belts up to get ready for our busy day, I assign employees to their trailers and, go around collect load nets put at the trailers that we will be closing up and shipping out."
good,the company believes most of accounts payable will be done by automation and bots. not much time to research matching errors - always need to produce more output.
good,Federal Express is a wonderful place to work. I was a courier and a dangerous goods specialist so I was always on call to receive questions from customers needing to verify how to ship dangerous packages through the system. The most enjoyable part of the job was being out in the sunshine and the worst part was delivering packages in the winter. Fedex has a variety of managers and  people from various backgrounds that made it a place to acquire different knowledge.
good,You had a chance to learn about scanning that you can use somewhere else if you needed to a quick pace of working. My co-workers were very nice and friendly
good,Fedex is a fast pace logistics job that gives decent compensation.Although this job does like most jobs requires dedication and you may find yourself away from your family more often than not.
good,I am only a seasonal deliverer but enjoy the job. Its fast paced which I like. I would consider dull time employment with this company. Best part is being able to bring people joy when their packages arrive.
good,Heavy constant lifting. Can be stressful during peak season such as November/December Holiday season. Most trucks are easy to operate with backup cameras.
good,"Awesome part time job! DON'T expect to be full time unless you apply for a driver or supervisor position. Fast paced and dirty but fun."
good,"FedEx is a good company with good health benefits.  While working there I had to endure standing on my feet for long periods, work in inclement weather conditions, withstand loud noises from machines and trucks entering the building and working at a fast pace.  Be mindful this was my experience. The office has since relocated and working conditions have changed."
good,"A fantastic job for those out of high school."
good,Just not for me and I’ve been asking my managers to switch my shift for about a month now . And now i just feel as though it’s not worth it . I spend way too much money to get to work and I’m barely making any .
good,Ability to meet new people on a daily basis. You can also do on the job training if you need a refresher on some skills. I have worked for this company for a few years now and i dont regret my decision to come here
good,No complaints about the job. Just wished instead of constantly hiring new employees that they would allow their existing employees to work more than 25 hours a week.
good,Had praises of handling customer's orders in a timely fashion. Stack packages in a careful and orderly manner. Sometimes would be team player on helping other employees within a timely manner.
good,A typical workday consisted of me and my coworkers coming together to get the job done. I learned how to load aircrafts and trucks. I learned weight and balance for trucks and aircrafts. I learned how to be a leader. Management for the most part was ok. Workplace culture was very upbeat. I don't recall any part of the job being hard. The most enjoyable part of the job was getting the job done and on time and without any injuries.
good,"My work was related on the HR department from our company as a call center vendors, employees working at FedEx were provided with training, feedback, and room for advancement."
good,Learned fast on how to perform in a fast paced environment with attention to detail. I enjoyed being in a different place every day. I was part time looking for full time employment.
good,"Working at FedEx is a fast-paced, competitive work environment. Management positions here require a high level of accuracy, flexibility, ability to think on your feet."
good,"I was an Administrative assistant and I enjoyed assisting management hire the FedEx drivers and other warehouse employees.  I helped with the background checks, made numerous company related phone calls, data entry, made appointments for conference meetings, and many other clerical duties assigned to me. "
good,"I like the FedEx because it was and still is friendly working environment to be at, and i like to help other employee's to work with at FedEx, because i was will to help the other employee's at FedEx."
good,New feel on warehouse working. Good benefits not so good sick compensation or understanding. Nice and friendly coworkers who are ready and willing to teach you things
good,"FedEx has a very fast paced mind set.  The work is hard, but rewarding.  Mgmt understands this and tries to lighten the mood.  There is advancement and the salaries are competitive."
good,"I thought it was a good place to work because the work kept you busy and on your feet.  What i liked about the job was that you got to meet people and learn new things while you were on the job, plus i also liked the hours because it was early morning.  What i didn't like was that we were working an a hot environment and some of the packages were really heavy and sometimes we would get send home early if it wasn't enough work to do."
good,"Learned a lot . Different from most jobs. Coworkers awesome. GM, HR Liaison are very nice. Had a great experience in regards to my assignment.  Would love to work again."
good,management company  is good fellow employees not so good work life balance is hard due to their hours but not a bad place to work overall benefits are good
good,"Simple and easy work environment. Hours were flexible and compensation was decent. With the proper effort and commitment, opportunity for job advancement was more than available."
good,i would work for fed ex again but only seasonally cause the pay is higher for the season after that its lower pay and hours. I only say this for the place i worked at .
good,"The job was enjoyable at times and overall a great place to work with affordable benefits. There is ways to increase your learning experiences,levels of advancements."
good,"Aprendi muito com meu serviço prestado, onde adquirir bastante experiência"
good,"High level of regard for employees. Company operates with integrity."
good,FedEx was a nice place to work for the short period of time i was there the atmosphere was family like. Training was hands on and a great learning experience. They really work with you to make sure that you know what your are doing and that your are being safe on the road.
good,FedEx was my first job but it didnt last long. The 4-9 morning shifts were not great and the work was fast paced and physical. Good benefits once you have stayed there for awhile.
good,Good job hard work. They pay decent but it is not a job for anyone who needs to be home at a certain time or anything like that. They are great people benefits are excellent
good,"There was always serious risk of injury working by the conveyor belts and vehicles, and improper lifting could lead to long term damage. The pay and benefits were at the time competitive in the Memphis area, but poor management and difficult advancement opportunities will hamper any experience."
good,Working the day to day operations to help reduce failures and increase productivity. Moving workers to the most optimal position to help them better complete tasks. Work with Area Manager and Sort Manager to better balance staffing for the operation. Promote positive energy on the dock to help keep package handlers energy up. Rapid change to volume with little balance to work life balance at current (pending future changes). The most enjoyable part of the job is engaging the package handlers.
good,Good culture and they provide great training for the forklift.  Warehouse was still lacking enough traffic to give everyone full time hours. I would highly recommend working here if traffic picks up.  They give regular bonuses and pay upgrades.
good,the company is pretty flexible if you're a dock worker but once you go to full time or management you'll easily work 10-12 hour days. but the pay is really good if you're willing to work.
good,"Overall, this is a good place to work with competitive pay and great job security. As with any of place of employment, there are cons, but the atmosphere is family friendly and definitely a place you’d retire from."
good,fedex is a great company to work for.  However management was bad.  managers showed a lot of favortism.  managers did not care if you had another job.
good,"My temporary time at FedEx in Chino was both a learning one and an enjoyable one. I met quite a lot of nice people with much to talk about their day with. A typical day of work there includes getting the scanners out while waiting for the alarm to sound indicating the start of the sort.  What I learned while being there was efficiency as well as time management.  To succeed in an industry that FedEx is in, one has to learn to adapt to changes in the work environment as the day goes.  The culture and management were both relaxed but also firm on what it is supposed to be.  The hardest part of the job is making sure that your share of packages are actually completed on the pallets as best you can.  There is no shortage of the standards at an environment such as what FedEx presents itself to be.  The most enjoyable part of it is the very end of the week when you can finally take a breather at home, after a long four to five days of lifting, stooping, bending, and moving boxes around the warehouse."
good,FedEx is a great company and offer opportunity to grow. I have met many great people at FedEx and I feel the company offer great job security. I will always be grateful for the opportunity.
good,Being a package handler takes a toll on your body. Room for advancement but you need to put in the hard work. Relocation is recommended for advancement. The pay should be higher for the physical stress you put onto your back
good,FedEx is not for everyone and since I worked the night shift a lot of the people I worked with it was their second job. This can cause for a lot of people to not enjoy what they are doing and some days are not very fun because of the people around you. But rather than complain like most people I chose to have a better attitude and work super hard so that we could all go home sooner. I liked all the managers I had at FedEx which also made the time more enjoyable as well.
good,Fast paced good place to work at recommend for anyone starting a first job  great management a bit repitive once you get the hang of it you/ll be ok and great work enviroment
good,Management was friendly and always willing to help. the pay was comparable to job functions and they were flexible with time off. I moved out of state for a short time and that is why I left.
good,"We work a pretty easy job but the hours are very early in the morning. great compensation. vision, dental, and health benefits all available  for less than 150 a month."
good,I believe that Fed Ex Freight is a great place that provides flexible hours as forklift operator and offers benefits that helps all. I would highly recommend working at Fed Ex Freight.
good,"You have to be in good physical shape to handle the workload; time is of essence, you must meet timelines on a daily basis. Hours are pretty set consistent daily. Rain or shine you're out there doing your thing and it must be done within given time frame."
good,This is a great company to start with and a lot of people stay until retirement. There is no work life balance and you must be prepared for that. Very hard to raise a family and give them quality time as the company demands your evenings and weekends often for entertaining. This is only if you are in field sales.
good,The people were great. I learned a lot about computers and servers in my time at FedEx and enjoyed my job. I just needed more pay to be able to afford to live at that point in time.
good,"SECURITE, Rigueur, travail en équipe, debriefing, réunion"
good,My only complaint is management not letting me break the 2 year contract I signed to move back with my family in another state. Other than that the company was wonderful.
good,Fed ex is fast pace. Everything is on a time schedule . Most areas work very well together although there is sometimes a lack of communication between management and some workers. For the most part fed ex prides itself on being a fast delivering company .
good,allowed for diverse working opportunities and uniformity  of workplace culture.  great place to grow with company and assure a competitive future and customer-driven success.
good,"Trabajo ameno y dinámico, aunque multitarea, siempre hay que tener varias cosas a la vez por resolver."
good,"1) Good learning experience with FedEx."
good,"I actually enjoyed working for fed ex ground, the requirements were that  when packages came down on the conveyed belt that. we scanned the the product and then store them in the proper place of the the truck. I also had to keep self awareness on if there were hazardous chemicals being delivered."
good,"empresa otima para trabalha, Os benefícios os treinamentos contribui muito para nosso aprendizado gosto dos benefícios porque o salário e muito baixo pra categoria e o tipo de serviço que nos fazemos"
good,Would still work for Fedex if I had the opportunity   Excellent pay. Great benefits and lots of vacation hrs. Not so family friendly when it came to ill
good,"The environment is very chaotic, but it has order to it.  One must have the ability to pay attention to detail and exert physical effort in order to get tasks completed."
good,"From what I hear, it isn't as good to work there as it was. FedEx seems to have outsourced most of the programming to India and now most local employees just manage the overseas contractors. It used to be a great place to work, but the outsourcing started before I was laid off and according to other workers, has continued since.  Sad really."
good,Good job till it hit slow season which last 4 months. Might work 4 hours then sent home after driving a hour in traffic to be there. Wrote up if you don't take your lunch break at 4 hrs.
good,"Uma boa empresa, com bons benefícios, várias oportunidades internas e que prioriza na maioria das vezes seus funcionários."
good,"One of the hardest parts of working for FedEx is the hours, there is no such thing as holidays. Starting at FedEx can be tough due to the entire job culture is based on seniority."
good,"I really liked working for FedEx, a lot of the reasoning was due to my immediate managers being the real driving force and lending a helping hand when it was needed, the only reason i left was due to the fact that there was no sustainable money to be made there. You were lucky to see 28-30 hrs a week depending on the season. A lot of what really helped me too was the people that i worked with, we all lend a helping hand if one of us were to fall short. "
good,The management are very great but they so many rules and regulations which you have to follow. It is a better place to work because they are very big company
good,FedEx was a pleasant experience in terms of general experience and knowledge. Quite an organized work cultural. I was exposed to individuals that I learnt quite a lot from also.
good,Great company to work for. Great team members. Great management structure.  Management strives to create a culture where hard and smart work is rewarded.
good,"Distribuição de Equipe,aprendi a definir prioridades,diretoria e gerência com bom relacionamento,ambiente de trabalho muito bom onde todos estão envolvidos no processo de crescimento da empresa,são as adversidades do dia,quando no final do dia tudo termina bem você ver q seu trabalho deu o resultado esperando."
good,"If you are a male the work environment is very good, but if you are female it's a bit harder to prove yourself. You would have to have a lot more experience to be hired."
good,A great company to work for excellent benefits decent pay lots of test always reviewing you knowledge and skills lots of challenges to make you a better skilled worker
good,"Tipical day work in the morning we check parcels and loansing van then we delivering to our customers, in time. Want I like in this jobs is was customer services, I like communicate with people"
good,Uma boa empresa de se trabalhar. Aprendi varia atividades que não sabia.
good,I really like working there I want to go back the work was fine interacting with others I work with was great and there was always work the work environment was great
good,"FedEx is a huge company with many job opportunities. The jobs are easy to learn, the work environment is good and fast paced. the management is considerate."
good,"Fed-Ex is a high paced physically demanding workplace."
good,nice job to work for would definitely recommend to a person that's in need of a job.  its fast pace depending what area you work in. there is field work and indoors
good,There is always work to do. The pay is great for a part-time employees. Great benefits if you worked over a year. The downfall is that hours are not always guarantee because there will be no more work to do during non-peak season.
good,"The things I say, would be for FedEx Contrator to think more into to their business model, and fine tune it. Secondly we need benefits, it is a must!!"
good,"money is good, but money isn't everything. I enjoy working for the company but the older you get the more wear and tear it puts on your body. Also the management can use a lot of training."
good,There are many global locations for employment and opportunities to advance. Online career listings provide insights for locations and areas of employment.
good,They biggest concern is that you deliver all packed at the correct location being home or business in an timely matter. And try every attempt to find the customer address.
good,"When going to MAPA or ALPA, wear shorts or lighter clothing, if you plan on moving around a lot.  Bring food in clear plastic bags : fruit or energy bars. Hydrate yourself! Get there early for good parking spots. Have fun, don't stress out over the little things. There is a language barrier, just go with it. Don't be an idiot and steal/hide stuff, you'll just hold up the line. Had a good time with the co-workers I got along with, it makes the time go faster. Help out as much as you can, but don't kill yourself. Listen & learn, it gets loud in there."
good,"fast pace work environment."
good,"Workin there was pretty fun , but you will be sore the next morning , but after a few days of doing the same thing over and over again , you’ll get used to it"
good,"A typical day at work would be like for a scanner is getting to your scanning station with a loading line full of Target Distribution stuff to ready to be scanned. I learned how to use and fix the hand gun and the printer to put labels on items. Sort them out into totes or boxes to be shipped down the belt line. Management is at the most communicating when it comes first thing in the morning for reviews and schedule assigned for the day. "
good,"I work in the fright part if FedEx Ground, were we are loading a package onto the truck and a large number of boxes coming down five different conveyer belt, the day started off good to when the unload started moving and we find that they were short of people.With that being said the boxes that were coming down in the top part of the sort were no one was their so all the boxes that went down the belt went anywhere so that slow up the process and put operating system behind we quickly work together as a Team and clean up the boxes and pull a little over time but we still meet our quota.I learned that if we work as a team we get the job done much quicker and that what we were taught to work as a team, the workplace is great clean an well mannered in safety rules.When the job short of people and a lot of fright the employees that been their work overtime and working all week, they work out or overwhelm but everyone still works as a team.Working hard pays off recommendation to the management and the company, so awards be awarded along with functions"
good,Excelência em Transporte e Serviços. Grande possibilidade de desenvolvimento profissional.
good,It is a really easy job. They offer lots of benefits after you have reached the minimum requirements of hours. It can be quick paced or slow paced depending on the day.
good,i love the environment i just with i was able to get more hours. the pay is good but if there were more hours it would be a lot better. the people are great but it is a little tough to move up
good,Great benefits for a part-time position. For 2.5 or 3 hours I loaded the freight from the trucks into the portable cans for delivery. This is not a position for lazy individuals but if you don't mind a few hours of hard work its worth it. Pay is weekly and you get all the benefits you would as a full-time employee. Some seasons are worse than other with the fright and organization can be off at times.
good,Fedex has many accidents and don't pay fair. They also go by seniority so a lot of available positions you don't need experience which isn't ethical to me.
good,"There are a number of different departments that you can work in (Van Line, Inbound Unload, Outbound Unload, Administration, etc.)  Most of the management team is respectful of the employees...a few bad apples though."
good,It's a great place to work  it was just not for me sitting on the phone for 10 hours a day as a Trace Agent  short Breaks. Peak Season was rough not enough Trace Agents on the Floor for the incoming call value
good,This is a good place to work. Good pay and very good benefits. Great advancement opportunities. Always provided with tools to complete my tasks. Friendly management.
good,"This jop is berry hard so many people who you dont know want do whatever want all the time."
good,"•	Installed hardware and maintenance"
good,"it was great expreiance, the was place was cold but because the face pace and the work it kept me worm,working with the younger people was a great expreicne"
good,Very good company to work for. The only problem is the hours they give. You only can work 4 hours a day and their is no overtime at all. Management is fair
good,"I loved working here. I would have stayed if at the time I had reliable transportation to continue coming to work every day. However when I was intially hired , it was for a seasonal position."
good,"I enjoyed my tenure at FedEx. They emphasized safety, teamwork, and efficiency.  The system ran like a well-oiled machine and the time always flew by due to everyone working together as a team to complete tasks."
good,"No complaints about FedEx. They do what they say and provide what they promise. Work usually starts between 4am-5am depending on the work load. I make sure the packages are scanned correctly and sorted onto the correct truck for delivery. Make sure work area is free of obstacles for safety. Work lasts for roughly 4 hours with nonstop movement which tends to make the hours go by really fast. Great work atmosphere, the managers and other employees are there to help you. Hardest part is that it can be overwhelming and strenuous at times with the amount of packages and weight of some packages."
good,FedEx is a family based company. Once you join our team you are family and treated as so. FedEx takes care of you to their fullest ability in any way they can.
good,"Good pay, great benefits, highly competitive environment, lack of work/life balance, GREAT recognition for hard workers, limited opportunities to advance if you don't work at corporate (Memphis)."
good,"I was a contractor with Fed Ex Home Delivery.  I made my own hours, I did not have any benefits provided by the company.  I provided my own benefits.  I hired temps to assist me when necessary."
good,"The biggest hurdles people will have to get over when working at FedEx are: 1. The early morning hours. At the facility I worked at, there were only two shifts, which were: the outbound shift that worked from about 6 pm-9 pm, and the inbound shift which worked from about 3:30 am-7:30 am. I was on the inbound shift, and I gets very hard sometimes to get up so early day after day. The second major hurdle in this job is that the pace of the work is quite fast-paced and hectic. "
good,"Heavy phones and customer service with people picking up and dropping off freight,  entering bills of lading for freight being shipped, Assisting drivers with paperwork, whether it is local drivers or line haul drivers.    You have to be willing to assist when and where it is needed, whether with customers, drivers or other office staff.   The terminal manager and operations managers are willing to jump in and  assist when needed as well.   No one is beyond getting the job done.  Customer service and customer satisfaction is a high priority and all is done to meet the customers needs.   The goal is always a positive result for the customer but there are those rare occasions that it is just impossible due to unforeseen obstacles, weather related, accidents, or reasons from another service area.   It is best to keep the customer apprised of  all events and offer the best solution available.   Interaction with the customers and co-workers is the best part of the job,"
good,"Activities on breaks (basketball, pingpong, tv), sometimes food and drinks, better pay then most none college jobs, they even offer college help, chances to move up in the company for hard workers, plus you get in shape fast. be prepared to sweat."
good,"Great job but very stressful, have to wear many hats. Bonus's can be few and far between and vary in range. Bene's are good as well as paid time off, go go go, 7 days a week 24/, if you want to relax in December, forget it."
good,"Its very busy at night at fedex must go through"
good,A fast pace work place. How to sort and stand boxes neatly. Excellent management in my work area. Good clean work facility. Hardest part was getting the containers full. Getting the job done with a great team.
good,A typical day at work would be unloading the trucks making sure all products are put in there proper place. The hardest part of the job was the humidity in the summer time.
good,as a manager at FedEx I enjoyed the ability to interact with people both as members of Fed Ex and Vendors throughout the North East Division. I enjoyed the travel and the People.
good,"had to load truck. "
good,"Load/unload tractor trailers. Scanning packages at a fast pace Always on the move. Safety is a must . FEDEX believes people first.   Good supervision and easy access to management,"
good,"every day is business, i learned how to off load and load the trailer with merchandise. my managers where very good at explaining the job task for the day and also relaxing important messages to the staff. hardest part of the job is having to restack tipped over or falling merchandise back onto the pallets and rewrap it ."
good,Fedex is a great place to work at.  They have a good work-life balance and provide different kinds benefits. Cultural diversity and mutual respect is the back bone at Fedex
good,Really a challenging job because everyday for the most part was different.  same route but different deliveries and package size and counts on a daily basis.
good,"Lack of career advancement is one of the main reasons I am looking to move forward. Also I am worried about my own and others safety, because of upper management decisions."
good,"Gosto de trabalhar na empresa por que  me dou bem com todos os colegas de trabalho, por que trabalho com mesmo caminhão então posso cuidar como se fosse meu sem que ninguém mexa em minha ferramenta de trabalho"
good,8-12 hr day learned how to drive semi management was easy to get along with really enjoyed working there but they just had too many drivers and i was not getting enough hours
good,"Amazing company and upper management in Corps Christi, would go back in a heart beat if still in Corpus and I know for a fact they would higher me and I would be back in a second."
good,"Same thing every day Collect Material and destribute to everyone."
good,"This is a good place to work. It is especially busy during the holiday season, but that is expected from a shipping company. It has a great team environment and has a great balance."
good,"Its all about getting your job done. What ever is planned for the day, it must get done. Employees may have some fun on the job but as long as work is getting done, it is okay."
good,Good paying job to work at. Wish they offered more full time positions. Management is fair to work with. If you need a day off they are usually willing to work with you.
good,The hardest part of my job there is wakening up at two or three a clock to go to work. I enjoy this job because it feels like you go to the gym and work out
good,"FedEx is a great place to work. There is a lot of training. The management I had was really great. They were willing to work with me on the route and get me closer to home because I was doing well. If you go to work and do your job, keep your nose clean and are respectful, you'll do great."
good,"Fast paced, physically demanding job. A lot of heavy lifting and walking involved. This job can be very dangerous, you have to pay attention to what you are doing in certain areas because you could end up hurting yourself or others."
good,I worked nightshift for 4 years at FedEx freight. I drove a forklift and loaded trucks. after 8 months of working here I put in for fulltime and got the job. its a fun place to work and it pays good
good,"Its very fast paced and physical and your constantly pushing, pulling, and lifting boxes. Its a very productive job and challenges you to push yourself and its definitely a workout."
good,"People-Service-Profit ... not just a slogan but a true culture in the workplace here at FedEx. The community of co-workers are nice, the atmosphere is good and the benefits are the best."
good,Working for FedEx freight was a great opportunity for me to see different parts of the world he provided me with great pay great opportunities and they was very supportive of school I really enjoyed in love working there.
good,Working at FedEx as an admin deals with more than just the typical administrative duties.  The role of the district admin involves much more from providing customer service to both the internal and external customers.  It involves much research and extensive investigative working on matters the arise.  Detailed oriented and being good with numbers essential to the role. There are many tools and resources provided that the company make sure training is easily accessible.  Achieving positive outcome  to every situation presented is the most gratification I get at the end of  the day.
good,"If you want to make it in the corporation, there is ample opportunity for training and advancement. The fast pace sometimes lends itself to younger individuals; however all ages, gender, and ethnicity are welcomed."
good,"Everyday at Federal Express is a learning experience. The problems"
good,The overall position provide a great avenue to learn and better my skills. There were great people that I worked with. I needed to relocate to a different part of the country so unfortunately I had to transfer to another company.
good,"The company has so many benefits for its employee  and an friendly environment in the company has made me to learn most important culture of market, industry in my life."
good,"Fast work environment constantly changing. The hardest part is learning a new route. Unloading/ loading can is the most physical part of the day. "
good,I have enjoyed my years at Fedex. The works is challenging and offers opportunities in other fields. The benefits are excellent and the pay is fair.  Tuition reimbursement program for those in college.
good,"It was a job that I was going to try and keep and maintain as my career for the rest of my life but things did not turn out that way.  I would still be there if there hadn't been certain factors that messed things up."
good,I believe it was a great place to work. With a fast paced and friendly atmosphere it served as a great learning experience. I got along well with both my manager and my peers.
good,The things I liked most was the hard work knowing that it was paying off at the I got along with a lot of co-workers the loading was a pretty good work out but I got experience the other things as well like unloading
good,"I have only been at FedEx for close to a year now and my experience has been on and off, I say this because the job isn't too hard and the pay is great for a part time job but my one complaint is that with the type of work we are doing we should be full time. The fact that we have to take a lunch for being part time dock workers is a little ridiculous to me and I believe this is something that should be fixed immediately, hire full time workers so that the rest of the crew can know for sure when they are going home."
good,I like the flexible hours and benefits. The work hours are ideal for someone in college or someone looking for a part time job. The ramp agents can be a bit challenging at times.
good,"Production has its own mind set on different aspects of the job. As for quality, there was no one more interested and caring than our supervisor. Classes were held and we were taught what a quality culture is and the fundamentals of working in a Quality Driven Management environment."
good,"I came to FedEx Express with no experience working on the ramp.  With good training, I am fully qualified and able to load and unload all compartments of a cargo aircraft.  "
good,Overall is a good environment to work for but it's also hard to move up in the company if you have supervisor and management that don't recognize your work.
good,"lifting 100 pound boxes every second was not something i like doing.. "
good,"Steady work and paycheck, great retirement benefits..."
good,"I think our managers need more training on people skills, we have a terrible turnover and I have seen our new hires and old employees treated terribly"
good,my experience at fed ex was OK. a lot of driving and i didn't receive much training before i was on my on i enjoyed most was that i was able to explore a place I've never been.
good,"As a Manager at FedEx Ground, I was able to enhance my managerial duties and utilize my past experience as a leader.  On a daily basis I checked the chart to improve the numbers from the previous day.  After breaking down the numbers, I would meet with the other managers to set a game plan for the day. Shortly after, I would meet with my crew members to conduct a strategy to have a productive day. "
good,An involved job with long hours that can be physically demanding. Employee centered and most teams work well together. Decent pay with excellent yet degraded benefits. Many life-long employees.
good,The job is okay if you like the stand up for 8 to 10 hrs and sometimes supervisor have there favorite people so watch out for that . The job is very easy to do.
good,Really enjoyed working with everyone that i did there. Lots of packages every morning. Hours were a little weird but not bad if your night person. Everyone is very helpful.
good,"depending on which site you are located, the hours can be anywhere from 3 to 8 hours a day. benefits are great. working at fedex can be stressful at times but, overall it's worth the learning experience."
good,"Good Place to work, good benefits, oppurtunity to advance career. Job is fairly easy gotta be quick on your feet. love the teamwork atmosphere. Would recommend to others"
good,"fast paced 4 t0 5 hours a day no breaks constant moving, unloading trucks, moving heavy packages from 50 to 150lbs constantly, managers are good but sometimes insensitive to employees conerms"
good,"great job security and autonomy for the well organized sales pro. manage your own territory and schedule."
good,"I loved this job. Everyday was a creative day. I always learned something new and fun. I learned how to make business cards, flyers, portfolios, and banners. I operated the copy machine using techniques to utilize printer. I mastered computer programs like, Excel, PowerPoint, Photoshop, Publisher, and of course Microsoft Word. That was the hardest part of my job. Everything was enjoyable, even the hard stuff."
good,"That is the motto at FedEx. Take care of your people, they will in turn provide better service which will in turn drive profits. Unfortunately too many others industries seem to have it backwards."
good,"Spent 11 years in the company , mostly inside sales , some field sales, took early retirement to pursue my own career goals. Had many sales awards and titles during my 11 years."
good,"It is a very solid place to work, and easy to become comfortable in.  Sometimes too comfortable.  Job security is high.  But crime in Memphis is also high so it is a trade off."
good,Worked the sales floor as well as the production machines in the back. Handled fedex shipping as well as overseeing customer projects. The management staff was fair and the coworkers easy to work with.
good,"Overall, you come in and work hard for your entire shift. Typically your co-workers and always in a good mood and help make the shift go by easier. Management can get a little out of hand, as far as their use of power.  During the summer, they provide candy and drinks (sometimes). This can help boost morale."
good,"FedEx is an amazing and stable company to work for.  However, you do have to be prepared to put in 50-70 hours per week for a 40 hours per week salary.  The work/life balance is not ideal for anyone who wants a life.  On the other hand, the company does take care of its employees and promotes an outstanding job culture that makes you proud to work for them."
good,As a package handler I worked very hard during every hour I was at the facility. The place can be fun and they all work extremely hard. Often the facility was understaffed so we had to make up the work for lots of unfilled positions. Very physically intensive. Positive and Hard-Working Attitude was essential for success in such a position. OVerall not a bad place to work. Try to stick with it if you want to advance further than your current position.
good,It's a productive and fun workplace. Security is also well taken care of. A place with career opportunities. It is a good place for a start. A place with no discrimination.
good,it was easy work witth great benefits the only downside to it all was the hours. at full time i was only working a max of 30 - 32 hours a week. if the hours were better i would have stayed.
good,I was selected by my manager to help others complete tasks in a safely manner. Fed Ex is a fast moving environment and it is really intense and hard on you.
good,"this was an amazing job, with great benefits and great chances to grow from within the company. they had a very wide hiring policy and many people I got along with and became friends with. the benefits were awesome hands down the best iv ever had at any job."
good,"Good Opportunity to work and grow also supports education growth. Good shifts and Decent work "
good,I enjoyed working for this company I was promoted several times ending up as a manager for one location I would enjoy working for them again even after my departure from the company
good,El ambiente de trabajo en la empresa es bastante agradable.
good,"Even though it took a while to learn the job, I still enjoyed it. I got an opportunity to meet people of all ages. i learned areas I didn't know existed in the city. it is a rewarding job which can lead to a career."
good,I found that working at FedEx as a package handler was a very ideal situation for being that I am a full time student. They were flexible with my school schedule.
good,"The job pays extremely well. There is a very big learning curve, you won't jump into this position and understand it right away. That's the number one thing every single new person says, no matter their experience beforehand."
good,"I learned how to drive a forklift which was very easy. Management was very well organized and always willing to help. The hardest part of the job was lifting product and cleaning out trailers, but the enjoyable part of the job was the hours and pay."
good,The place is a pretty good place to work and the benefits are pretty outstanding as well. There are many locations and many opportunities for advanced and relocation in the company.
good,I was hired as a part time worker but not only  was working full time but forced overtime. I don't mind working full time but I need a  manager  that will work with me so I can also go to school.
good,"A typical day at work would be an overload of boxes. Most days my duties were to scan and palletize about 250 pallets of mail a day. This was my first job out of high school so going to school and work became to much for me at the time. If I had a second chance I would love to go back to FedEx. its a well organized company with respectful management. The hardest part of the job was the hot days, having to sweat all my water out and keep moving. its a fast paste environment so every move is swift. I really enjoyed my time at Fedex"
good,a typical day at work was to clock in and do as much as you could. I learner how to scan sort and re label packages. the most enjoyable part of the day was that it went by fast.
good,"We did a 4-5 minute stretch before starting shift. There were 3 different areas, depending on people and space available it would sometime determine where you ended up for that day. Also carried or transported certain smaller packages when close enough."
good,"fast paced environment, i never personally had the experience to work in the hub. great benefits and pay for a part time job. management is willing to work with u on scheduling and they have tuition reimbursement"
good,I only worked here a summer between school but it was great my trainer taught me alot my supervisor was great it was a great experience if I wouldnt have went back to school would absolutely stayed
good,"Great team atmosphere. Always busy. Mgmt takes time to teach rather than instruct.  Work hard and advancement is inevitable, if thats what you want. Great place."
good,Everyone helped in the problem solving phase of things. The atmosphere was always energetic. The hours were great and the pay was fare for the service being provided.
good,Being a Package Handler is very physical job. The hours might be short but you  learn to move fast and you work as a team. The management team is very knowledgeable and hands on. the hardest part of the job is the physical labor there are packages that range from 1 oz to nearly 100 lbs. The most enjoyable part of the day is the people I work with we're like family.

good,"Everyone at the Fed-Ex Ground would come in, type their code, and then go to a specific position. We would unload trucks,separate packages to go either to trucks or pallets to be sent out, and then load trucks up to be sent out. The management were very busy to make sure the whole team were doing there job and paperwork things they had to deal with."
good,"The job is just as simple as it sounds. You will be taking packages from a chute and placing them in a truck trailer as quickly and orderly as you can. There is a a bit to be learned about performing this in a more efficient manner but if you are dedicated then it can be done within a few days. The only major concern you will have is maintaining a satisfactory pace early on, wearing the proper protection and getting used to the occasionally uncomfortable temperatures. The interaction with your co-workers is usually spars after your first introductory week, as you primarily work by yourself within a trailer, but during your first few days a senior employee will help you get adjusted to your work fairly often. Despite this the workplace culture could be described as a friendly competition. While you are all on a team within your section, numbers are recorded both individually and as a group. Everyone can see who is working the hardest. However; this can lead to the most difficult part as strong workers in the more favorable will likely be picking up the slack for newcomers. The most enjoyable part is the feeling of accomplishment when you consistently make the top of the board."
good,"Working at FedEx was a great experience, but I needed a job with more working hours. Beside that, working there was fun. Most workers there are friendly and helpful."
good,Worked for good managers. Great place to grow your skills and advance. The work culture was positive and a good place to work. I learned about the operations of distribution.

good,At FedEx customer service you take any where from 130 to 200 calls a day. A very fast paced environment. I learned how to help take care of people by being an effective listener.

good,"Honestly speaking FedEx was not bad as far as the pay and benefits, also the will keep you employed no matter what for the most part unless you blatantly break rules with no regard for safety. But as far as advancement part... Take note of the certain people part."
good,From unloading 18 wheelers to loading the delivery trucks...this company has it all.  Team work is the key to making this company run like a well oiled machine.

good,Buena empresa me gusta el hambiente de trabajo pero quiero mejorar
good,"the managers and trainers do their best to help you get through the high level of packages that you are required to load into your trucks. there is a diverse culture which is extremely nice to work with. the hardest part of the job is loading the packages that weigh over 75 pounds.  the most enjoyable part, is the fact that even though there is no music, you are allowed to talk to your coworkers. it takes some getting used to, to be able to scan every package and load, but after a week or so, it comes naturally!"
good,"It was a fun company at the warehouse. The job was very demanding physically, but it made for a great work out everyday! The contractors and how they paid their employees varied."

good,Great seasonal work and a great palce to work. Top of the line equipment to use let you take the vechile home at night set routs and grewt bosses to work for
good,"I mainly load and unload trucks and work on a conveyor belt at other times. Depending how long you've been in the company you might be assign to different areas. I started loading and unloading trucks, then I was sorting packages on the belt for a bit. So it depends on the job. You will be assign to different jobs throughout your stay as a package handler. It's about who is needed in a certain area. But you will generally be assign to a specific area, unless someone is out and the need arise for you in another part of the building. "
good,the most enjoyable part of the job was interactive with customers and delivering important and substantive materials on time and with professional standards that surpassed the industry standard.
good,"Routine transfer of freight from trailer to trailer for delivery, haven't learned anything I did not know before, multiple supervisors which makes management a bit difficult to deal with specially regarding communication, co-workers are just the to collect a check, very rare to see any that truly care. The hardest part is dealing with all the dust in the environment and the unmotivated employees.  It is a fairly simple job and I enjoy the freedom they have with scheduling."
good,I enjoyed the job because i was making the most money ive ever made. I was also working alot of hours and only enjoying my weekends. Its not a 9 to 5 its sometimes a 8 to 7 but it was even worse at the beginning when i was being trained. Its salaried so if you get home at 9 or 8 you getting paid the same as if you get home 5 or 6. I was working in busy part of chicago so the work load was very demanding but there were days i enjoyed scenery and food the city had to offer. I sometimes avoided taking breaks if i was swamped with work.
good,Overall an excellent company to work for with very fair minded management. The toughest part of the job is maintaining the hours with regards to work/life balance.

good,Good company to work for and for the most part the people are fun to work with and easy to talk to.  Management treats you well.
good,"Being in management things are a bit different. I was the only manager in the shop area. A typical day started with the review of RO's from the previous day and then into time keeping. As the morning shift arrived it was time to go back into MCMS and approve the morning punches. Then approve the prior shifts RO's for the end of the day for the 3rd shift. Clear and approve all vacations and PTS."

good,Good company and good eco-friendly envirnoment.I am great working with fedex and excellent company for long term.excellent and very good
good,Still relatively early to make to steadfast of an opinion at this point; But so far I am enjoying my employment here. I only wish that it was full time forty hour week type of employment. but I guess it is what it is.
good,"I loved my job and my co workers. I had very loyal customers who really liked me and appreciated the service I provided to them. The job was never the problem, my issue was with management who did not value me as a person or employee. The rules seemed to agree with their agenda and not me as an employee. I have had great management and not so great management. Overall I liked working there."
good,"Everyone at FedEx that I had the pleasure of working with was always upbeat, excited to be at work and all around genuinely nice people in an environment that I was comfortable in."
good,it was a pretty cool job. fast paste got to keep up at all times. loved working there just the hours wasn't enough. another thing that was cool is you get a pay raise every two months.
good,"A typical day at work in fedex begins with coffee, stretches, and then its multiple hours of lifting, scanning, laughing, and teamwork. I've learned that just because you are at work, it doesn't mean that you still can't have fun. Coworkers are friendly and personable and they all understand that a team effort is needed in order to provide the customers with great sevice! Management keeps everyone well informed, and they are always trying to help with your best interest at heart. The hardest part of the job is the lifting."
good,"Para mi ha sido una de las mejores empresas donde he prestado mis servicios, he tenidooportunidad de pasar por varias posiciones, con responsabilidad en diferentes territorios y reportando a difrentes gerentes, con excelentes resultados."
good,"Hard work, long hours but there can be advancement for those that are willing to stick it out.  Poor work life balance.  Only nights and weekend shifts available."
good,"FedEx Services is known for investing in their culture and it is evident throughout their workforce - a large emphasis on diversity and inclusion while linking their employees to one common goal.

Only complaint is pay is relatively low compared to other large corporations."
good,FedEx offers constant hours and a great place to start your career. It also offers great opportunity to move up in the company.
good,working for Fed Ex was easy just unloading the truck than putting the packages on correct number to be loaded on the correct truck.

good,"During my work day, I have to load cans and get them out to the flight in a safe and timely manner."
good,"When I get to work I get my equipment together and my schedule from my manager for what I'll be doing that day. I then figure out how I will run my route so that it will be safe and efficient. I always help my coworkers out when they are unsure of what they're doing or directions to where they need to go. My job is very interesting, enjoyable and personally rewarding when I'm out on my own running routes and delivering packages and making customers happy and in a safe and timely manner. I believe my job is a fairly easy job,that some may think is difficult operating a tractor trailer in all different types of weather and conditions.It's fun to me, but one of the harder things you have to deal with are other drivers and sometimes irate customers and damaged packages. Overall I enjoy going to work and operating big equipment and satisfying customers."
good,Great people to work with. Lower level management has their hands tied in regards to implementing any real change and/or improvements.
good,"I normally goes in to work, clock in, get my radio and flashlight then i check my email and close any preventing maintenance or correctives i have open. Afterwards, i walk my assigned area of the hub to check for bad bearing, loose bolts, bad belts...I learned how to change bearings, test swak scales, lace or change conveyor belts...management has it ups and downs, sometimes treated fairly and sometimes don't. My co-workers are helpful and most of them are team players. the hardest part of my job the way I get treated by management.The best part of my job is that, I love what i do."
good,"I worked on the dock."
good,"Amabilidad, compañerismo, seguridad, eficacia."
good,"Great place to gain skills and experience in a wide range of projects programs and Corporate Initiatives.  The most enjoyable part is meeting with customers, vendors, other FedEx Company employees outside of Memphis Headquarters."
good,"Fast paced environment where the players are always changing. Must be able to bend, stand, stoop, twist, walk and or climb for a particular amount of time. At Fedex  you get to be exactly who you are. My co-workers are quick to lend a helping hand. The hardest part about the job is the extreme weather conditions."
good,"Review data from prior day results"
good,"I had to start very early and most of the time would get done late in the evening .  My first delivery was 30 - 45 minutes away from the Terminal every day .  I made 99% of my deliveries to Residential Homes .  Customer service was essential when making deliveries .  I was on a Route mostly by myself and my co-workers were fun to work with when I did see them . My manager was a very flexible individual and helped me out as much as he could .  The hardest part of my job was delivering in inclement weather , mostly snow and ice .  However the most enjoyable part was making deliveries during the Christmas Holidays as we were essentially helping Santa with the deliveries he couldn't make .  Seeing the smiles on the Parents and Grandparents faces knowing that their package had arrived ."
good,"A day at work is always super fast paced , phones ring back to back , from customers to corporate and customer service reps out of state calling in to check status of shipments."

good,"This company offers great benefits and could potentially offer great pay. This job can be described as an ant farm, and can sometimes be racist or unfair based on i.e race, gender etc. Otherwise this is a good company to work for."
good,"A typical day...I arrive, gather my supplies and start the days work, which is subject to change due to the nature of the job. Its helpful to be a team player at this company, even working in office, there will be days you sweat."
good,My overall experience there was bitter sweet. the job taught me self discipline in dealing and working in management. I personal think things could be better working on the operation side of this. it would be better if they would give more interpersonal training for managers to interact with there staff in a positive form.
good,"Other qualities that I possess, which may not be readily apparent from my resume include integrity, intelligence, and high energy, along with a diverse background and range of abilities. I am one who embraces creativity, new ideas and able to work in fast-paced environments. My ultimate career goal is to grow with a company that is passionate about what they do, works above and beyond for their clients, and is well known for their explicit services."
good,Working for Fedex is great because they provide all their employees with benefits even if you are just part time. At my location it is very team oriented so getting along with your colleagues is a must. It is not difficult to work with anyone because everyone is happy to come to work and doesn't complain about the amount of work that has to be done. Everyone looks out for one another's safety and makes sure that everything is done safely and correctly.
good,"Interesting workplace with a lot of different personalities. The work is challenging, especially during peak season. Once the work is simplified, it becomes repetition. The people are also a great help and truly compassionate. The pace is difficult to keep up with, but it becomes easier with time."
good,Very upbeat and exciting workplace! The workplace is very faced paced and forever changing. The ceiling for growth is unlimited.

good,a fast paced work environment that is fun and professional. very physical with lifting and loading but its only part time.
good,I loved it their. the people are great and staff really cares for you. The hardest part of the job was winter season when it became extremely cold. It was hard to work at times.
good,Meeting a lot of people everyday and visiting various places. One gets positive energy from this type of work as most people in the workplace try to make their day more interesting and gets into you.
good,You have an opportunity to get into a routine which helps your speed on loading your truck. Time management skills plays a big part if you want to be a successful courier.

good,Put the packages on the belt so they can get sorted to the right location. Developed packages to business owner and to residents homes.
good,"A good company with supportive management. Company cares about both the internal and external customer along with professional growth and development, but these  at times are overshadowed by corporate policy. Sales compensation( commission) is difficult to ascertain and low but salary helps offset this."
good,for people who like to work hard and like fast paced work.  waking up at 3 in the morning is mainly the hardest part about the job but once you get the hang of your position it gets easier.
good,"Fedex Office is a Great Place to work for but the travel is far."
good,Good work environment with a young crew. Easy work the tasks weren't hard. Good management and co-workers with good hours. Overall a great experience working here.
good,"27 years of watching the company evolve. FEDEX is a great company. Mid level management decisions, which impact first line management and couriers, needs to improve. The bottom line is you deliver and pickup pkgs in a timely manor. Stop making it so difficult to like the job. Customers see it, don't like it, we used to be a lot happier."
good,"Fun work place environment with supportive management. Easy going work day, will pick up and can sometimes be hectic but it won't last for long as you only work around 3-5 hours a day/night. Breaks only happen if you are scheduled to work over 6 hours. You get a 30 min break after your first shift. Pays pretty well but not many hours so you don't make that much but you do get paid every week."
good,"FedEx has excellent benefits and the work ethic drive employees to work hard and smart. Safety is very important to the company and the use of ear protection. The job can get stressful due to lack of employees because of the  heavy freight sometimes. the management is very good and the HR  are good as well. FedEx can be fun but it can also terminate employees due to foolishness . The company has zero tolerate to horse playing on line, or damaging packages , the attendance rate is very important if violated it can lead to termination if giving three warning letters depends on the manager and to theft and stealing. The security is on point and governs the safety of themselves as well as company. FedEx challenges each employer and employee meaning ask to show the badge to stop fines and verify the person works here ."
good,"Provided customer service at customer pick up. Picked, scanned and verified packages prior to pick up. Weighed, labeled and verified destination and determined best way to ship out packages."
good,FedEx was a large company with plenty of work which kept you constantly busy. It was a very physically demanding job and working safely and efficiently was priority
good,"FedEx Ground is a very physically demanding, fast-paced work environment. The people of FedEx work very hard to deliver the service the public demands of them. They are unsung heroes working behind the scenes. There is a lot of red-tape on internal processes and a decent amount of politics, but like any large corporation, this is expected. FedEx has a great culture and internal promoting process where there is plenty of opportunity for career advancement. The majority of managers really care about the people and upholding the strong safety-first culture FedEx is proud to maintain."
good,Good job. Have to balance work and life or the demands will suck you in. Overall very good company to grow and develop management skills. Very results driven and fast paced.

good,"Had a LOT of job responsibilities while I was there. People are very nice, and are helpful if needed. Overall, I did enjoy my work there."

good,"Maintains uniform business practices and procedures to ensure compliance with customs and other government agency (OGA) laws and regulations and according to FedEx Express expectations. Analyzes documentation provided to determine that harmonized tariff number and whether the shipment qualifies for special tariff treatment, NAFTA, reduced duty rates and ensures all government agency regulations are followed. Also ensures that the required information is submitted or transmitted electronically."
good,Typical work day would include lifting packages non stop. This is a perfect job to make a good wage and also decent benefits. Employees are fine and management is alright. Do not enjoy being unconnected to the higher ups.
good,"I have already submitted my review about FedEx Ground twice before. Data job is easy, management focused more on numbers, not employees. Every manager is different"
good,"from 3am to 8am unloading trailers. Fast paced work environment with the best coworkers you could ask for. I have been there long enough where nothing is too hard, but management could be a bust."
good,hardest  part of the day is standing for long periods of time. . the company has been working on getting employee parking for years.
good,Challenging job both physical and mental. Strong company very driven towards performance output by their employees.
good,"Great place to work. You have to work, can't be lazy or slow. Good to see work completed at the end of every shift. Advancement is a possibility and pay is more than expected."
good,Overall fed ex is a great company to work for with pretty good benefits. The only thing I wish I could change is my hours. I only work part time hours and unfortunately that's not enough for my family and I.
good,"Unload containers that arrive to the warehouse, scan and load packages to designated trucks."
good,It's a fast past job alot of customer service all day long you got to be a people person but it's nice to be outside on a nice day.
good,"*everyday a new issue"
good,Not enough hours but a great place to work with wonderful benefits. Great work life balance & wonderful people to work with
good,"My typical day at FedEx was very tiring. Safety was always first. Integrity, responsibility, and respect is key for continued employment."
good,"Working for FedEx Freight had it's pros and cons, but overall in my opinion was a great company. A typical day at work consisted of me clocking in and attending a pre-shift meeting where we were notified of what was expected of us for that shift. afterwards we carried out the varied tasks in a safe and efficient manner. There at FedEx I learned the ins and outs of forklift driving skills and precautions. Loading trailers was sometimes challenging, but with experience, it became easy. I obtained the skill to load trailers as high and tight as possible without loading too much weight on the axles. Equipment that was used to ensure I didn't damage freight was decking beams and boards, rope, straps, and airbags. Management was so-so. There were a lot of changes in management that caused a lot of confusion and miscommunication which sometimes caused a lot of problems for employees."
good,"Love working here.. Enjoy my job, nobody make me upset if you are a hard worker,do your job there will be no supervisor treating you wrong or disrespecting you just have to understand respect is a two way road, you have a chance for an advancing career if you want to, if you work for it. There are few negative people but that's every where but if you ignore them and keep on moving you'll be just find."
good,fedex works around their employees schedule mainly the ones who are going to school to further their education.The hardest part of the job was loading the freight on the trucks and unloading the freight off the trucks.
good,The most enjoyable part of my day is just knowing that I contributed to getting the amount of work done in a short time span.
good,A typical day at work consists of various role playing. One minute I might be unloading trailers and the next minute I'm directing traffic throughout the building. I've learned to motivate other employees at the job that really needs the extra push. The hardest part of the job is the weather conditions. We operate in all weather. Winter and summer are the harshes seasons to work. The most enjoyable part of the job is when we meet our serviceability. Just knowing that we delivered a package on time is very satisfying for me.
good,Part time position. Good management. Work early in the mornings. Good benefit. Learned to work has a team. Friendly co-workers.
good,"hours for package handlers are from 4:00am-8;00am (home delivery)"
good,"I love working at fedex, my only grievance is that we never know what our shift is going to be like, we are always running late, and with commuting makes for some very long days."
good,"i love working for the fedex company, so  far as the part time hours i feel they should give employees the full 5 1/2hrs to work. Theres great opportunities so far as advancement. Theres also tuition reimburstment if your attending a trade school or college."
good,"I start my day at work looking at the day before results and sharing that information with my team. From there, it just depends on what's going on that week, we might have an audit to do one day or inventory counts. Also, running the production line and helping customers at the counter. I've learned a lot about how to better myself as a leader, how to coach the different personality types of people and got a more in depth knowledge of computer skills. The environment at FedEx is extremely well rounded. It's structured, with rules and guidelines but at the same token you are able to have fun and be yourself with your coworkers and customers. The hardest part is definitely coming from a mostly food service job background and having to work with computers in a lot of detail was very hard for me, but once I overcame that aspect of it, the whole job was easier. The most enjoyable would be the customers and coworkers. I get to work with such awesome, out-going, knowledge coworkers, as well as the customers. I have learned about myself as a leader from everyone I have come in contact with at FedEx."
good,On a typical day you would have to keep a loading rate of 300 to stay with Fedex I learned how to load a truck the proper way and use time management better.
good,Worked here for over 3 years. It was okay some days and not so great on other days. Able to advance pretty quickly if you desire to.
good,Very fast pace environment.  A great place to work if you are able to manage oneself.  This employer offers full benefits even to those that are part-time.  Whatever you do don't forget your map book
good,"A typical day could range from entering one of the aircrafts and pushing enormous mental containers onto the Moving Loader which would then be taken to be sorted to their proper station. Its an enjoyable work environment because everything is fast pace while everyone is working in harmony. Even though the hours are sometimes difficult, the management, the workers and the job itself make it very fun."
good,"As far as having worked there, good. Pay has been good. So good, I've received, like, a $0.50 raise, about, every 3 months."
good,"Schedule rigid company, fellow workers friendly, very helpful, equipment was above average to very good and mangers were very fair."
good,"Good place to work, just time to move on. I want to move to Arizona. My wife and granddaughter live there. I will miss it at FedEx. Busy work"
good,"A typical day at FedEx was coming to FedEx ground and meeting with your crew and getting to work."
good,Always a daily challenge never knew what new curve ball would come up daily.   Enjoyed maytime with them and learned a lot.  I enjoyed going to work everyday and the hardest part was dealing with weather.
good,"Fed Ex is a great place to work. Since working there I've learned how to drive the forklift, riding pallet jack, and the switcher. You can trust the management and coworkers work together to get the job done. The hardest part of the job is leaving because its a fun place to work."
good,Working at FedEx as a college student is great. the pay is good and the benefit they offer is great for just a part time worker such as 401k and medical insurance. A typical day depends on the time of year. first few months of the year is pretty light you work between 4-6 hrs.On busier months we can work up to 8 plus hr a day. the management are demanding because of the nature of the work which deliveries freight to customer as fast as possible.But they are very rewarding when done the job right such as company BBQ for each month without a injury at work. Co-worker are very friendly and helpful but something when lot of work to do can able a stressful environment.
good,"A typical day at work is kinda the same everyday. The co-workers are fun and friendly nobody had a problem with anybody. The hardest part of the job was trying to figure out a problem with a scanner that had multiple problems. The best part of the job was being around my co-workers, and getting a lot of experience."
good,FedEx is a great place to work but can be difficult to advance without relocating. FedEx offers decent pay with a great benefit package.
good,FedEx is a decent place to work. The local management team is what makes things difficult. They like to follow their own rules instead of the rules set forth by coporate
good,"Lifting and loading packages into trucks carefully to insure nothing is damaged. How to deal the HazMat and the proper techniques in how to lift. Management was fine, they were always willing to help IF my truck became backed up. My coworkers were fine we all worked at a steady pace in order to finish work as quickly as possible. The hardest part of the job is when you first get there. Its mental because you know that more than likely you are going to be very busy. The most enjoyable is when you actually know your work day is coming to an end. You lose soreness and you feel great physically."
good,"Each day presents new challenges. Everyday different circumstances present themselves and challenges to overcome, whether it be from volume changes to dealing with obstacles that come from the human aspect. I have learned that while you must abide by company standards and policies, every person requires a different approach when it comes to motivation and enforcement of those policies. The hardest part of this job is keeping my employees motivated to do their job above and beyond what is asked. To most of them, it is just a job that pays the bills, and it is my job to keep the workplace as fresh and stimulating as possible. When I can help employees learn something new, or feel a sense of pride towards their job that is the most rewarding aspect of the job to me."
good,"Loading packages"
good,worked in the cold and heat. this company pays decent money when you first start. I learned to drive a forkilift and load freight.
good,"I worked there in 2006 and i was very young and immature. I was not able to hold a job on the books at that age, i did not take it seriously. FedEx gave me multiple chances and the managers were great, If i had another opportunity to work at FedEx again i would take it in a heartbeat. I would definitely take the job very serious now that i am an adult and have a son to support and bills to pay."
good,"It is a pretty good company to work for as far as benefits go, but it is not enough hours and it is in the middle of the night. also it is open to the elements so you freeze in the winter and melt in the summer. Water is usually available at water coolers so that is a plus in the summer though. over all it is a great place to work but it seems kind of political in management. I love my coworkers they are great hard working people. We get along great. I have learned how to drive a TUG, how to check and T-stack an AMJ container, how to load a cargo plane. Over all it has been a great place to work I just need more hours. They only schedule us around 14 hours a week."
good,"Fast pace in assembly"
good,"Wait for incoming flight to offload inbound freight and load with freight from stations in a time manor. My team and I would download inbound freight off plane to be delivered. Load outbound trucks delivering to other cities. I learned team works is a must on this job and being fair. I loved my co workers, I have lots of great memories while working for this company. The hardest part working at this job is when the weather is against you. You work outside majority of the time. So when its hot its hot and when it rains we must continue with our goals and objectives for the day. The most enjoyable part was meeting great friends and learning the aircraft."
good,the work is physical it is hard work but the advancement opportunity's are not great  i enjoy my job because it is self work and you have to be self motivated they do have good benefits.
good,Seems like an excellent place to work pay was decent and the offered food before and after shift during the holiday rush. Though shift start time does change which is understandable because of weather and when packages arrive.
good,"Duties included calling customers who have their shipment held at customs for various reasons and getting them to send appropriate paper work to clear the shipment for example if a shipment was held for reason of import, they would be contacted via email, phone call, fax or letter depending on the method they prefer. Duties also included speaking to shippers abroad regarding shipments that have arrived in the UK using software called genius. Microsoft packages are also used such as word and excel"
good,I love working here but its takes getting used to. The weather is a big downfall but uniform is provided which makes it better. Sleep is essential before going in because it will wear you down as the night goes on.
good,"Loved this job. Everyone was friendly and helpful. Unfortunately this job was only seasonal, I would of loved to have stayed on permanently."
good,The job is very challenging in which you excel quickly and I have learned how to balance my workload with patience and efficiency. I have learned how manage time effectively and set expectations for my employees while meeting mine. Our management has taught me a great deal of the LTL industry and has been there for me. I enjoy working with my co-workers and have learned a lot of information from them over the years. The hardest part of the job is the hours and elements--3rd shift and being exposed dock. The most enjoyable part of my job is being challenged day in and day out because I am a quick learner and enjoy the challenge.
good,"A typical day at work will be assisting the department Manager and handling her ad hoc matters and also work related jobs."
good,A Typical day at work includes loading and unloading freight.  The job has a fun work place and good benifits. My Management and co-workers are great. I enjoy my job and enjoy the challanges of my requirements and making sure i do my job correctly.
good,Its a good job to have although the benefits aren't really too beneficial until you get promoted or move up in the barracks of the company.
good,Excellent it was a good environment to work in great people there that will help you learn about your job and position. I drove cans around the warehouse to the right place
good,Fedex was an organized warehouse that appreciates their customers work ethics and efforts. It is very hot during the summer season only because work hard think smart to a very organized delivery.
good,"you start how to manage the forklift operator, you need to be fast in the field, the co-workers they helping in any problem, the management are very strict, you learned how the weight is balanced on the trailers truck."
good,"Typical day at FedEx is always something different to look forward to daily. Always interesting, exciting, and yet productive. We continue to learn from each other by cross training. Management was usually like I like it non micro managing. The hardest part of the job was saying good bye because it was so family oriented. The most enjoyable part of the job was the team comradery."
good,"Typical day started with loading my truck scanning packages, delivering all packages returning truck to terminal"
good,"Its a good job, everybody is easy going, mature, funny, hardworkers and easy to get a long with. There's not one person in there i can say anything bad about.The supervisors are very lenient but will put their foot down when its time to do so. I learned with the right people you can get any job done quick and accordingly and i could work with everybdy at this job. Typical day at the job you come in wait till 2:55 am to clock in, stretch before you start unloading, so you wont pull anything during the job, we go to the built and start unloading the canisters until we don't have any canisters left to unload. The enjoyable part about the job is unloading the canisters with somebody you can get along and will do there job, the hardest part about the job is getting your full eight hours a day, if i could get my eight hours i would."
good,"My day consisted of scanning packages and loading them onto my truck. I delivered them on time to businesses and residential homes in a timely manner. I learned patience most of all. Not everyone has the same vision of utilization of time. My management team were a great bunch to work for. They always let us know how good we succeeded in the field and always showed us their appreciation. My co-workers and customers were more than that. They are my friends and family. I have life long relationships that I took from this company. I do not really think there was a hard part of the job. The work, itself, was physical; which I loved. I left there everyday with a smile on my face, looking forward to tomorrow."
good,I did inbound work on the Fed-Ex dock using forklifts at all times. I really enjoyed the work because I am extremely good with forklifts due to my previous job history.
good,Fed ex would have been awesome but was very hard work...maybe 20 yrs ago....
good,Each day runs usually the same. When drivers were late we had to work faster to meet deadlines so we learned to work well with each other.
good,"good company to work for, fully vested at 25 yrs, wanted to try some other career. good teamwork thru out my career with them. premotes from within. i became a manager after 12 yrs and left after 28 yrs. hardest part of job was the hors and the holiday season."
good,"très bonne ambiance de travail, équipement de bureau renouvelé, soutien technique adéquat."
good,"Come in and stretch before work, and when we're ready we wait until the packages come thru the belt, and we scan the packages and load the packages in to the trucks, according to how the drivers like for us to load them.  I enjoyed this type of work but except the pay and the hours that we work. Because this part time job is a Grave yard shift, we have to sleep during the day. and the pay wasn't as good, also because I was working part time."
good,I have worked for FedEx for two months and I am constantly going to classes learning. You get paid every week. My husband has been with the company for 13 years so I thought I would give it a try.
good,"It was fun, with plenty room for growth. The only thing it was a lot of work that I had to get used to."
good,a typical day consisted of fast paced work. i learned the building from the inside out and learned how to do most of the jobs there. My co-workers loved me because I always came to work a big smile and i could brighten up everyone's day. The hardest thing about the job was load because you can have from ten to fifty boxes come down your chute which could put you a little behind your work pace. The most enjoyable thing was the people i met while i was working there.
good,Co workers were great. But no room to advance.  The location was great and the hotel environment was an added plus
good,"After spending 20+ years at FedEx, I leave with a sense of accomplishment and grateful for the opportunity and skills learned.  This company is good at recognizing and weaving through troubled waters."
good,"A typical day at work I clock in & head to my load area 3min before start time for a brief safety meeting. I then head to whichever trailer or area I'm assigned to. "
good,FedEx is a great company to work for. Great benefits and numerous opportunities to promote growth.
good,load/unload trucks the job was hard at first but became easier through time
good,Extremely good place to work but the management could be a little bit better.
good,FedEx Ground is a great place to work if you enjoy a fast pace work environment. There is a lot of growth happening with in the company.
good,"Just worked there for a short time between jobs, great opportunity for young people looking to go to school, or to start somewhere that gives them the opportunity to move up based on their own ambition."
good,FedEx is a great place to advance - a diverse environment of all ages and skills.  I would recommend working there if the opportunity arises.
good,"Typically start around 5am and your day is over around 9am. You simply receive mail/documents and freight trucks with huge containers in them, unload them into the warehouse, and unload the contents of each container on a conveyor belt. As long as you're working, management is usually out of your hair and easy to get along with. Some days they expect you to do the impossible and work faster while you're working your fastest so the couriers can load up and leave for their delivery routes on time. The unloading process usually takes about an hour on average. Not bad. It keeps you fit."
good,Driving a truck and delivery packages at homes at downtown and NC university
good,"They pay well and have good benefits. The work is very strenuous, and the heat in the winter is sufficient. Though they do not have A/C in the summer and the trailers become ovens that you have to work in for 5 long, hot hours."
good,"Sometime heavy box in trailer and but it hot in there day, evening and night shift work"
good,"muito corrido"
good,"A typical work day is always working together as a team, if one person struggles we all struggle. working together helps us get our job done and keep our Promise to our Customers. Management and co-workers work well and always keep each other updated on current assignments. I'd have to say the hardest part of the job would be days where we'd get spikes of packages that tend to be very heavy, have a consistant flow coming into the facility"
good,"Productive workplace with great benefits and career advancement. I love FedEx. Great family, work can become hard but its worth it."
good,Loading and unloading packages in and out of trailers. Loading was the hardest because you had to meet a certain scan rate and the only way to meet that rate is to scan and load the packages quickly in a large trailer.
good,"if unloading and loading works for you, then this is the job. management was iffy. hardest part was waking up to get to work. schedule started at 3 am."
good,"Day at work is great this start off with what must be done.  Wait on the team you work with.  Manager give the team a time when everything must be done and other important information.  I learn how to write the info on the paperwork, drive the tug at fedex, and look up information on fedex computer.  Manager show me or made sure I was traning properly.  Co-workers worked as a team.  I enjoy the people and manager I worked with. Manager understand and work with his team."
good,This job offered me an awesome opportunity for growth.  I started out as a receptionist and worked my way up to a senior legal secretary.
good,my typical day at work is unloading and loading packages at work. my co-workers are good co-workers.
good,"Scanning 2,000 packages each in a 4 to 5 hour time period each night. I learned how to sort the packages to be shipped. Management was awesome and very understanding. My co-workers were very helpful and friendly. The hardest part was having to leave that job because I had to leave Nashville. The fact I was able to meet and work with a great group of people."
good,Unloading/loading trucks for 4-5 hours with no break by myself rarely got help. Management was fine but when it came to workers ideas they didn't listen
good,MY day would include training new employees how to unload or load a truck as fast as possible but also in a safe and proper manner.  I had to interact not only with 50 plus employees and make sure everything was done properly but also do reports on them.  at the end of the day I would check all the trucks make sure they were done properly and there was no packages left laying around.  I would stay in communication with the managers to make sure everything was run and done properly.
good,Great co workers...the hardest part of the job was getting to know all the areas
good,Typical work day includes sitting for long periods of time and classifying items.  There is minimum supervision.
good,Worked in a high paced environment where safety was  umber in getting the job done.
good,"Clocked in at 7:00 am got started working taking inbound calls in the auto dialer system. "
good,"A Typical day at work for Fed Ex Ground requires a little bit of nothing but you will get dirty from all the packages. First things first set up the sort and make sure we have a full staff. A high volume of packages would be about 1000 units plus, low volume would be about 700 units a day. I actually learned how to run the evening and morning sort with just observing my managers. The hardest part of the job was going home covered in dust, however, school start to interfere with my work hours. The most enjoyable part about the job was the team of guys we had and we were very productive"
good,"Overall a pretty good company to work for. The annual raises given per year are not up-to-par in accordance with the type of work being done in the warehouse, but i guess it's okay."
good,"I really enjoy what I do, I love enter acting with the customers. I'm a owner operator and my truck in a 2007. Unfortunately,  my truck isn't California legal anymore, for California Carb new regulations has effected my business. Working for FedEx Custom Critical has been a great adventure for me and its a great company."
good,FedEx is place where a lot things are going on at the same time you must be very focus and motivated.
good,Thankful for the opportunity to work with the people I have and for a good company.
good,A Typical work day would consist of early mornings starting at about 3:45-4:00AM i learned to work a production line loading and unloading of packages ensuring all packages were in designated loading areas while working with men and women of all different cultures the hardest part of the job would be the larger packages while short staffed and what i enjoyed most was the knowledge and skill that was developed while working as a package/ warehouse worker
good,As a package Handler it is very busy.Its ok if you have can handle a fast pace and can handle the labor.You recieve benifits after 1 year.overall not a bad job.very good for part time employee's
good,The wear and tear on your body doesn't match up to the compensation.
good,"cold- calls"
good,"Employees are really treated like family here though the economical times have been hard FedEx attempts to hold onto all its benefits for its employees until necessary to adjust. Fast pace and there are many opportunities to gain certifications and job growth. The benefits are the same for ALL employees including part time workers; again the only issue now is economical stress, so where benefits where provided no matter what employees must now make sure them meet the specified requirements. Each station is different so management can be either good or not as efficient, it is the luck of the draw if you transfer within the company. Physically the work is taxing on the body so there can be issues with needing medical check ups on individual health more regularly than an office job."
good,it was a great experience working with my hands to stack wallss of packages
good,Everyday day at FedEx we would have a pre-sort which is basically a meeting about all the requirements we need to meet. They also announce birthdays or anniversary. We would then go to our quads and begin work. I have the best co-workers. We always work as a team to get the job done. We never had enough people so we always worked hard. The hardest part of the job would be getting new people. We would be glad to have extra help but they would never have any training. But eventually they would get it. The most enjoyable part of the job would be getting paid.
good,"My typical day is great. My job was very organize great benefits, I really love working with people and I love to drive . I always keep a smile on my face because god bless me to see another day and Im just truly bless."
good,Constant and steady lifting and loading packages to destined load  points.
good,"A typical day at FedEx consists of starting by parking in the FedEx parking lot and then being shuttled over to security (On your own time and you have to make sure you’re not late waiting on a bus). You have to walk through TSA and go trough procedure typical to going through the airport. Then you walk out and catch yet another shuttle bus if your work area is not in walking distance. Then you clock in and go into your pre-work meeting which usually lasts about 10-15 minutes. After that you go to your work area. The work at FedEx is very physical and labor intensive. My day usually lasts at most 5 hours. So if you’re looking for something to do while in school or maybe you need to get home in time to get the kids off the bus the hours are great!"
good,"The hardest part of the job at Fed Ex is the actual physical labor, but my co-workers keep my happy and productive. I appreciate all of my mangers because they have pushed me to succeed beyond what is required. I have learned how to be a leader and work as a team. The most enjoyable part of the day is completing the task on time, and being better than the day before."
good,"overall in charge of Gurgaon branch."
good,enjoyed my time there but you have to do a lot to get hours to make a living when u first start and some people that are in higher authority abuse it
good,Providing customer service in a fast paced environment you learn to adapt with changes while self managing your productivity. Having helpful co workers make working much easier. There aren't any challenges because the customers are all smiles when you deliver on time/
good,"Good work environment to work at "
good,Empresa proporciona bagagem profissional de conhecimento e experiências múltiplas na área.
good,"I was always doing an assignment, had a lot fun working with my co-workers if someone had finish an assignment and a co-worker needed help we would be there for eachother it was never a dull day."
good,There is always work at Fedex. It is always fast paced. This company is based on time so there is constantly deadlines to be met. Management is rarely around. They have 101 things to do on there end. The hardest part about this job is the time commitment. The most enjoyable part is the fact that there is no one breathing down your neck. You are pretty much on your own.
good,FedEx Ground runs at a rapid pace and there are times at which minimal work is expected. The person must work effectively and efficiently at loading and unloading packages in a timely manner.
good,A typical day in the life of this job is going to work making sure packages get to its destination undamaged and handled with care. The magement team is awesome and team work isnt a issue. The hardest part of this job is lifting tryimg to lift packages that has a hefty weight on them.I enjoy making sure i know that what i did made the customers proud and happy that they choose this operation for their mailing needs.
good,"Excellent Leadership"
good,"An excellent place to work.  I attended college while I worked and they were very flexible about my schedule.  Pay is great, but there are no benefits.  The downside is that the weather outside is the same as inside the dock.  When it is below zero outside, it is below zero inside the dock."
good,"Hard labor. Making sure the on time packages get out and on the road at the desired time. Keeping all customers happy and satisfied. My co workers are hard workers and easy to get along with. The hardest part of the job is at the end of the night, making sure all of the overnight packages get loaded into the trailer and out on the road in time."
good,"Working at FedEx as a driver is no easy task.  This job is not an easy jb as some people might believe.  you have to excel with your organization skills, time management skills, as well as self discipline.  This job wills stress you out until you get the hang of it.  For some that takes weeks and others moths to years.  The best part of this job is that you are outside all day and you are your own boss for eight hours out of a ten hour work day."
good,"My typical day at work is flagging the pallets and moving them to the right trip or route that they are suppose to go to. I have learned how to use a star three scanner or MC55. I have worked every shift there is to work at Fed Ex and I know all of my managers. I have trained some of my co-workers. The hardest part of my job would be wrapping pallets because, the pallet quality needs to improve. Also, the other shifts before me, need to start pre-wrapping to make it easier for the shipping crew to wrap the pallets. The best part of my job is being on shipping because, after everyone leaves the warehouse it gets really quiet and it is really nice."
good,FedEx Express is a good place to work. Management overall is very good. Those willing to work hard are rewarded with more hours. Most managers are hired from within.
good,"I have worked at two different locations, Baltimore & Richmond, both were fun places to be every day.  Very similar culture, fast paced and customer driven."
good,"Great pay, for a lot of work. The overnight shift makes more money but the hours and workload can become strenuous. LOTS of opportunity for advancement after six months."
good,"first couple years were really fun, I got to work the Canada shift which was an amazing schedule. after some changes in management and protocol I decided I wanted to find another path to pursue"
good,As a team we worked together to unload packages in a timely and accurate manner.
good,"building a brick wall with boxes. Unloading and loading in cold and hot temperatures. Working in fast pace, scanning, picking and packing boxes."
good,"While lugging around heavy parcels and other components in natural fashion just to gain a few solid pounds of sturdiness, who is to say that this position is not quite fit for the usual. Alongside, others who may have it easier than you, being acknowledged of loading packages within appropriate time, just so the driver will have enough time to have a refill and then pull up to your driveway for delivery is a technique most should accomplish. Great entrance level positions, especially if you are looking to become a apart of the team while seeking or furthering education."
good,"Typically a normal day at Fed-Ex was loading big & small boxes into their trucks. I've learned to have patience. Management was good at understanding our point of views. Very acceptable at learning what everyone's weaknesses & strengths are. The co-workers were very off task, didn't know how to keep up with their duties. The hardest part of my job I had at Fed-Ex was working with people who weren't up to my speed in what I was working on. Weekly meetings were pretty enjoyable. Talking about what the plan is for the week, how we all can improve ourselves, what we can do to make us better as a team, ect."
good,Hours are different than most places but very good benefits.
good,"Having only worked there for the midnight shift and the sunrise sort, I don't know anything else about the company other than boxes. Lots and LOTS of boxes, that all need to go into their corresponding trailers. As such, the only thing I can say is that the work I've been doing is intensely physical labor that has really helped me get into shape."
good,You punch in get you dock assignment and go to work no bosses hanging over you
good,"Great pay and benefits!"
good,"This fast-paced environment has obligations and duties that are time sensitive.  This job can be done independently for certain responsibilities, but is ultimately a team environment that provides a great structure for communication and efficiency.  I've learned to maintain a calm demeanor when faced with challenges and focus on resolutions when problem solving.  My tasks are the same on an everyday basis, which allows me practice to exceed management's expectations of my performance.  My co-workers are a great group of people who I try to help out as much as possible whenever needed.  I believe the hardest part of my job is not being able to advance in my career; opportunities are few.  The most enjoyable part of my job is the knowledge I have to perform to the best of my abilities, providing customer satisfaction, and knowing that I can be there for my team and help any way that I can."
good,If you thinking about working there as a package handler you have to stay healthy because physically it is highly demanding.
good,"There were not really any typical work days but most were very fast paced and challenging and you needed to be great at multitasking and I am. "
good,"non stop call handling, the hardest part is not being able to follow a problem through to completion."
good,This job pays well start out but the payscale is broken.  10 years with the company make almost 17.00 and people start out at 16.08 same position.  Management is great but some decisions from corporate has caused trouble among some of the veterans.
good,"A typicla day as a courier driver includes getting to the office at 6:30 in the mroning and going straight to work. loading up your truck and getting ready for the day out delivering. The biggest thing I learned while at this job is how to deal with a stressful environment, which I think is something very valuable to learn in a workplace. some fellow co-workers were fun to work with and help out when needed and others not so much, which is typicla at most jobs. Hardest part of the job is the grinding, physical, everyday work and the long hours. Most enjoyable part of the job is being out in the city, working by yourself."
good,smaller terminal do not offer full time to part time employee I believe if they did there would be less damages etc because its someone main focus job. Its hard to tell these part time workers that most have full time or other jobs that fedex needs to be number one when some arent getting over 20 hours.
good,Not a bad place to be if you can pay attention to details and can handle pressure from daily tasks.
good,"The work is sweaty and hard. You get dirty, you can get hurt if you aren't careful, and there is a lot of strain on your body. However, the job is also rewarding. Most of the employees are friendly and quick to help each other out. The management is understanding and friendly. Many of the service managers are easy to get along with an quick to make sure that you are safe in the dangerous environment. Upper management takes the time to talk to you when you need questions answered or specific situations dealt with. There is always time for your needs. The best part of the job is the people. It more than makes up for the hardest part, which is the physical labor."
good,I found that management was a little slow at taking care of things. I also found that if you are part time that there was not alot of hours.
good,The most enjoyable part of work is getting the job done. The hardest part was working all night without breaks. My co-workers are easy to work with and understandable.
good,"Becoming noticed and advancing up in the company when I made myself noticable by being one of the most efficient and quality loaders on top of having a Bachelors Degree. The physical demands of having to lift boxes up to 100 pounds quickly, as well as the patience required from being overwhelmed with boxes as I went from truck to truck."
good,"I enjoy working at Fed-Ex Freight, however there is no room for advancement or full time employment"
good,"FedEx overall is a great company to work for."
good,Too early to review. I've only been working here for 6 weeks.
good,Its hard work but its very easy once you understand it. It is very detailed work which requires alot of time management.
good,"Individual contractors are great to work for. FedEx management itself is awful. No managers know how to get anything done quickly or correctly, and it affects contracted drivers daily."
good,"Loading and unloading in and outbound trucks.  Learned a great deal on the dock.  I was fortunate enough to get a lateral promotion that allowed me to train new staff.  Very competitive working atmosphere.  Hardest part of job was dock traffic.  Most enjoyable part was being able to be independent, yet helpful to others."
good,"What I learned about fedex as a company was fantastic.  They offer and provide great competitive pay and a variety of benefits to suit just about any lifestyle.  I also found the majority of co-workers and management genuinely care about you and the safety of others.  However, knowing the position of package handler would be an up hill climb for me, I was still confused as to why I was given less time to build strength, improve my performance, and move up in the company than others of my same diminutive physicality.  I went for the position convinced I had about 4-6 weeks to hit the required goals and solidify a pattern of work-ability in height challenged areas like a friend of mine had.  But despite my determination and dependability, I was only given a 15 day period instead. So, I was forced to resign to avoid any further damage to my muscles and reputation. "
good,"I spent my days loading trucks. I learned how to use my time wisely and how to conduct myself in a warehouse setting. Management was fine but very overbearing. They stressed productivity very much and did not settle for anything less than 110%. Co-workers were very aggressive, which taught me to be self-reliant. The hardest part of my job was the heavy lifting and the repetition. The most enjoyable part was getting the job done."
good,The job is a great job. Everyone is friendly and willing to help you reach your full potential. Managers are very nice and your team will be there for you. The pace of the job will take some getting use to but your manager will help you out your first week and after that you will have a partner until you get it down. I would recommend this job to people who don't mind getting up early in the morning. The pay starts of at a nice amount. Then after your first 60 days you get an increase and then you get an increase every month after that. In a years time you will then be able to have benefits through the company.I would recommend this job to people who don't mind getting up early in the morning and are looking for part time work.
good,"A typical day at work includes getting packages and routing them out in the most time efficient way to deliver them. "
good,"real fast paced, people are real helpful. kept us motivated"
good,Good place to work.  Opportunity for advancement high.  Strong leadership.
good,"FedEx purchased Watkins motor lines, everyone was promised a job. FedEx National LTL operated for 4 years the was  merged into FedEx freight. I was locked into the Mira Loma terminal. FedEx is constantly making changes. This terminal once needed over 150 drivers, now it only has 20 runs that are over 300 miles a day. The rest, 30+, are shuttle drivers and bid on runs as short as 5 miles. All road rivers are paid by the mile. They may be allowed to work on the dock for hourly pay if available. For this terminal, once the largest, there is no future for most road drivers. There have been only a few chances for transfers to other close by terminals"
good,"You walk in to a huge facility packed with zooming truck trailers, boxes, humans, and metal. Loading packages into an 18 wheeler trailer from top to bottom is harder than it sounds. With a chute overloading with boxes, varying from small tiny weightless boxes, to giant heavy miniature boats. Using a wrist monitor, powered by a candy bar sized battery, you scan every single package or chainsaw, at a rate of 300 ""packages"" per hour. If you don't like to workout this job is not for you. Stretching is the key."
good,"I would arrive at 3:45 a.m. and leave by 7:30 a.m. I learned how to pace yourself with the conveyor belt and how to properly lift heavy objects.  The managers left linesmen to their own as long as their job was being done correct.  Coworkers came in loaded their trucks and left, very independent job.  The hardest part of the job as injuring my back and the most enjoyable part was the wages and benefits."
good,"I've learned a lot working at FedEx, i don't have anything bad to say about the company!! Great company!!"
good,Good pay and benefits considering the lack of knowledge needed to start working at the company.
good,"Depending on the need and the volume of packages set for the night, I could be placed anywhere in the building. I've learned how FedEx Smartpost operates on a daily basis, trip management system used to coordinate routes, and how management makes scheduling decisions based on needs. The co-workers are hardworkers and most enjoy the work. But, some of the workers feel under appreciated and underpaid. The hardest part of the job is going above and beyond and not being recognized for all the hard work put in. Also, being able to deal the different cultures at the job. For example, FedEx Smartpost has many employees who are Hispanic and Somalian decent. Most of the Somalians are Muslim and they have special times in which they have to pray, which can be time consuming if we are very busy. The most enjoyable part of the job is being able to deliver the Purple Promise; ""I will make every Fedex experience outstanding"". To ensure our customer packages are being processed and maintained at a high volume so we can retain business and attract new customers is vital to our success here at FedEx."
good,"Good position and good company"
good,"Day starts at 3:30 in the morning checking my emails to see what volume of freight is coming that day, making sure there are no call ins, and talking with drivers about delivery times. Next relay the information to our customer, New Breed logistics, and make a plan for the day. Employees start showing uo at 4:30 and start uploading trucks. "
good,"Typical day at work: Helping customers w/claims, making something they didn't understand, understandable to them.  This was satisfying! "
good,You get in one or two in the morning. You head  to a morning meeting to know  how many packages we have for the day.We sign in an head to work.
good,"A typical day consisted of completing a night pick up route and then parking the trucks in the correct order for the next mornings delivery routes. I learned how to fine tune my time management skills and customer service. The management at FedEx is very knowledgeable and cares a lot about the company's success. My co-workers are great, easy to talk to and were willing to answer questions when I first started. They are very hard working and are very good at their jobs. The hardest part of the job is that it is manual labor and there are some heavy boxes that need to be lifted and sometimes it makes it tough to do in the weather conditions. The most enjoyable part of the job is that management while needing consistent and excellent results does not hound you. They only talk work with you if it is necessary and you are not fulfilling your duties."
good,A typical day of work includes offloading and on loading tractor trailers. I have learned how to offload and on load tractor trailers effectively. Management keeps us motivated at work. Coworkers are team players. The hardest part of the job is the heat and the most enjoyable part is that it's a productive workplace. 
good,LOts of billing experience. Customer service and phone calls.
good,"Working at FedEx, one would have to be mentally and physically ready to accept a full day's work. This is not an easy job that employees would quickly take on. There are many things that you must be aware of; such as, the hard and physical portion of the job, you MUST work as safely as possible AT ALL TIMES, be sure to stay hydrated, and most important of all, ask for help when needed. FedEx is a company where the employees are above satisfied, the only catch is that you must work hard to reap the awards and benefits. Overall, this is a great job to have."
good,i was  package handler and i loaded trucks the whole time i was there. hard labor work but i gave it 110% managers was nice and other workers was very friendly
good,this a heavy working job where you left heavy boxes in none tempture control place so you can get very hot or very cold.
good,Lifting heavy boxes with care. I have learned box routes. The managers are caring of their employees.
good,"A typical day at work once i headed to my appointed chute, involved stacking packages and containers in a safe manner inside of a truck or trucks if i have been a signed more then one chute. Aside from proper care of delicate and hazardous packages not much else was learned that was not already common sense. Not much to say about co-workers since you pretty much were in the truck stacking, so not much time to associate with co-workers. Hardest part of the job was dealing with a backed up chute since packages would come rolling down faster then i could stack on busy days and having to avoid messes on trucks. Nearly injured myself on a paint spill that was hidden quite well and couldn't do anything about it since my boss didn't seem to worry about it. Even though the work was hard I enjoyed the physical activity of staking the packages on trucks and i regret quitting the job for stupid reasons. "
good,"Problem Because my work ethics and dependability, my contractor piled more work and more delivery and pickups with out offering more monetary for the increase. I was a sub contractor and had to handle my own taxes and insurance. Fedex was a stable and professional company to work with. My contractor was for himself and didn't support his sub contract drivers."
good,Its a nice place but several human resource items are missing.
good,"Typical day for me consists of me and my co-driver going to the truck and doing a pre-trip to make sure everything is working properly. We fill out our log books. We get the paperwork for the load, hook up and leave for our destination. When we arrive,we simply unhook and repeat the process. You have to be patient and understanding on this job because the load isn't always ready when you arrive and you don't know where you're going next if you're not on a dedicated run. So that can be a little annoying, but it comes with the job. I really like this job. I get to travel all over the country and that can be fun, but I have a family that I would love to spend more time with; especially considering that my wife is pregnant. But overall this is a great job and I'm glad to do it. I just wish I was local."
good,I loved my job but the terminal management wasn't the best. If it were a normal job not contracted it would be much better or if FedEx ground allowed its contractors more freedom with their routes.
good,Well typical day started with the phones ringing and problems to be solved. 
good,Great company to work for. Not enough opportunity in NW Arkansas for advancement.
good,Pick up/deliver packages in a timely manner. Operate company vehicle responsibly. Calculate most efficient route daily to make service deadlines and save time/fuel. Evaluate customer shipping needs and problem solve or team up with sales.
good,"Boxes Sorter, team work and help each together to lift a box that is over 75 lbs to the belts."
good,"Nothing at this location is set in stone. Start times, work loads, and hours per week can vary drastically. You'll learn team work, quick decision making skills, and will have an easy time advancing a few positions. No need for a gym membership if you work here."
good,"Targeting new business, managing current customers, and always keeping my eye on exceeding goal."
good,nice day
good,"I only worked at Fed Ex for a couple of months. It's a good company to for; the training is good; the managers were easy to get along with; and if you stick it out, there's opportunities available."
good,"I enjoy working at FedEx because it requires my mental and physical awareness, and it gets me energized for the day."
good,"Overall I had a great time working for Fed Ex Ground being a package handler, and loading the trucks. Unloading was also a quick and fast paste environment."
good,"Good Company, good managers. I like working here, the traffic is not so good."
good,Courier & delivery of customer packages at FedEx
good,I manage fifteen to twenty people on a nightly basis to ensure that all group and company goals are being met in a timely fashion. I have learned over the past ten years that as long as you believe in the people you work with they will go above and beyond when it really counts the most. I converse constantly with my manager and senior manager to keep them abreast about the needs and concerns of the work group. The hardest part of my work night consist of changing plans(routines) at the last minute but the most enjoyable part of my work night is knowing that I successfully adapted to that change and did it with the help of my coworkers.
good,Typical work day is a 12hr shift sitting in front of 3 computer monitors and 3 TVs watching a global wide network.
good,My work day involved unloading trailers and trucks. During the night shift i also loaded truck and trailers. I learned to multitask dealing with moving boxes off the conveyer belt while scanning every box. Many of the people I worked around were all nice. Management truthfully sucks they don't tend to work
good,"I enjoy Fedex a lot because it is not the same day any day. I get a variety of different experiences each day, and I am also challenged each day."
good,My overall opinion of FedEx Express is that the pay is great for a part-time job. The benefits are excellent.
good,Shipping And handling Loading And Unloading bulk Selector CSR SAP Scanners
good,"good benefits, and good people to work with. management is fair"
good,I come in say hi to everyone. I will sit down at my desk and check my email and or phone in on conference calls. I would prep the building for todays operation as well pass information to my employee's on how they did the days prior.
good,"i learned how to palletize, scan, labeling packages with corrasponding herzal label, unload and load packages from trucks."
good,I basically unload trailers and load trailers all day. I learned more valuable forklift operating skills under my belt by being employed there.
good,A great company that inspires to deliver the Purple Promise.
good,Sorted all packages for daily delivery.
good,"It is a good relaxing work environment with long development cycle. If you want to work on few technologies your all life, this is the place. Nothing to worry about updating your skills every few months."
good,The pay and benefits were great for a part-timer. It was hard-work and sometimes long hours but a great time.
good,Most of the people you work with at FedEx Office are good people who know who they are and where they want to go. They are fantastic people to work with and you are likely to get some friends out of your job.
good,"The HUB recruitment center was a new challenge everyday, time flies because everyone is working every minute to meet the needs of the HUB. It was an excellent expeirence"
good,I delivered packages in a time sensitive environment. It was important for me to know most of the routes in the station since I was a swing driver. I filled in for sick or vacationing drivers. Most of the managers at the station level were great to work for as most of them had been couries. Upper level management had a disconnect with the couriers and workers. Route expectations (number of stops per hour) were calculated by a computer and many times mother nature or Murphy's law made it difficult to meet those production expectations. Most of my co-workers were satisfied with the job overall. The hardest part of the job was trying to stay in good standing with corporate managements production expectations. The most enjoyable part of the job was the people. I made some lifelong friends at this job as I did at Target.
good,"Start in the early morning hours to capture and correct any addresses, that customers have requested via customer service mail. Examples may include a re-route, hold for customer pickup, or a future delivery request, etc."
good,FedEx is a very good company when sharing the wealth with their employees
good,They are a good company to work for ive learned about being a team player and continue to learn new skills
good,The shift work was made available through an agency. I worked in a variety of roles on security and warehouses. Processing inbound and outbound light and heavy freight.
good,deliver packages and pick up packages in a timely manner. Load and unload trucks
good,its very demanding job. they want you to load at least 1000 packages it 4-6 hrs.
good,Working continously and busytime moves by very fast
good,Fedex pursues to really put people first in the company. It strives for diversity and creating a comfortable environment. There is a continuous effort to implement best practices and stay on top of the leading business and technology methodologies.
good,"A typical day at work for me would be to come in and have on-going shipments on my desk, I would look up the number on the computer to see what was going on with them. If they had issues I would figure out what was going on with them and fix them. Then I would turn on my phone and start answering questions, quote and book shipments. Before I would leave for the day I would pass on the shipments that I had to the next shift and let them know what was going on. The most enjoyable part of the job would be the people that I worked with, I still keep in touch with a few of them. The hardest part of the job was the hours."
good,"bom estagio, contabilidade, arquivo, operacional"
good,"If you know how to drive a sit down forklift or even if you don't, look no further, they will train you. If you need a part time job this is a good opportunity, they got two shifts, each lasting anywhere from 4 to 6 hours a day. A good starting wage for a forklift operator. Management is management over there, same like most company's. Co-workers are hit or miss over there, some you will like, some you won't just being honest. The job is not hard but if you are not use to that type of environment, the job probably isn't for you. The most enjoyable part, short days and paid weekly."
good,If you are a hard worker can eventually move up in the company. Takes time and effort though.
good,"A typical day at work was going out and delivering packages to residences and businesses, to its proper location. I learned a lot about the area that my route was located (pearl River, and Slidell). Management was pretty cool and was very helpful when I ran into some problems on my route. I had excellent co- workers. The hardest part of my job was around the holiday season when we had excessive amounts of packages and stops loaded on to our trucks due to the customers ordering christmas gifts and etc.. around that time of the year. The most enjoyable part of the job was when we got holiday bonuses."
good,Fedex is a wonderful company to work for management is friendly but not room for advancement
good,Fun work environment. Long demanding job but it does have it's benefits. It's an easy enough job as soon as you get the feel of the job. Not to stressful but it is hard waking up at 4 in the morning.
good,"Stretch, layout job tasks, and make sure the planes leave on time. Learned that time management is crucial and helping teamwork leads to successful days. Management jumps in and helps the job done. Co-workers are a mash of different personalities that contribute to a diverse work environment. Hardest part of the job was winter work hours and school. Most enjoyable part of the job was knowing that all the proper documentation as correct and on its way around the world."
good,"FedEx Office is a great company to work for. The work is fast-paced, but it is rewarding. Computer proficiency is required in order to be productive. A typical day in the shipping area involves consulting with customers and preparing packages for shipping. A typical day in the production area involves creating and printing documents for customers. Management is usually as busy as everyone else. Some co-workers can be very helpful, while others won't help at all. The hardest part of the job is juggling customer requests in a hectic environment. The most enjoyable part of the job is the fact that you are directly affecting the customer in a significant way. A lot of customers request services that could make or break their business."
good,i have been here for almost 10 years now. All in all its a great place to work. the typical day involves making time sensitive deliveries on time to meet our customers expectations.
good,"Admired leadership and personability amongst varied lvels of staff. Great internal taining opportunies, comitment to development of, and provisiopn of benefits to internal shareholder employees."
good,unload trucks coming from airport do inspection on truck load my truck
good,In the short time i worked with Fed Ex i have to say it was one of the best jobs i ever had. Not my favorite field of work but job wise a really good place to make a career if you like warehouse work.
good,FedEx is a good company. It's a very independent job. Most of the day is spent on road. So most of your interaction with people are the customers on the route. The management sometimes complicate the job by over thinking a fairly simple operation. The hardest part of the job is the physical strain it can put on your body. The most enjoyable part is the independence. When you get on the road you are your own boss.
good,"enjoyed working with the team, which appreciates your R&D."
good,Great envoirment. Follow the safety codes and this place is great. Drivers are nice and they help out. People really work together.
good,A typical day consist of finishing projects on time and doing it right the first time. Me and my co-workers make a fun environment that is pleasant for anyone by making jokes and also keeping it proffessional at the same time. Usually there is a heavy work load that keeps you busy the whole day so there is no room for slacking off.
good,"Great place to work, I work from home taking phone calls to resolve issues for customers. Management is in place to monitor performance by reviewing phone calls to ensure reps meet standards. Hardest part of job is absorbing the massive amount of information required to do the job. Most enjoyable part of job is helping people."
good,"FedEx is a great global organization that values their employees. I have been with the company for more than 12 years and have enjoyed the generous benefit package, camaraderie and amiable work environment."
good,I worked early in the morning from 01:30 am to 12:30 pm. The hours was not the best part but the co-workers and the overall team moral was great. Kind have spent alot of time at work but it was never a dull moment. The reward and recognition program was solid and the company does a good job at rewarding great work.
good,Was a good job. Wish I would of stayed had alot of potential and growth in this company.
good,In the morning on lap top checking e-mail and hot shipments. Make phone calls to cover problem shipments and make sales appointments. Bulk of the day our in company car calling on current and prospective shippers.
good,scanned packages and stocked trucks according to location
good,A great company to work for. Many advancement opportunities available. FedEx will work with you in continuing your education.
good,"A typical day at work run against the clock, hard work, drive heavy machine, client service and co- worker respect. The most enjoyable part of the job was my personal growth by supervising my team for make the goal of the company."
good,Transporting and logistics is what you learn in a place like Fed Ex. manafers are always busy so its important to hold your role steady. We work as a family which shows when times get tough. Getting paid weekly was fun.
good,"good company to work for, however due to constant rotation of managers, (4 in 5 years) it seems to cause frustration with not only the drivers but office worker too."
good,:Mail Handler
good,Great place to work but the management is very unorganized.
good,Iam great working in a team or by myself. I love to be the one everyone can count on
good,when i get to work i go to the meeting we always have after the meeting we start work thats when i unload the trucks on my belt which is called the yellow belt.
good,Long hours but it is an easy job. Not a career path set after management
good,"Fast pace, friendly staff and managers. Extremely Physical."
good,"I took it as a work out, its waking up early and doing cardio. However, I found it to be fun and healthy as long as you are drinking enough water and lifting boxes properly."
good,I load trucks for fed ex and sort packages that come down the belt.I have learned to be quick and how much work you can get done in little time.
good,Fast-paced and detailed
good,"great place,good worker,managers helpful,many learning experience."
good,"Excellent place to work, however I need benefits. The hardest part of the job is no flexible with days off and holidays. Excellent management team."
good,"The job faces many tough challenges ahead but allows for you to work on your own in a fast past environment. In addition, the start out pay for the entry level positions are high but they tend to become stagnated over the period of time."
good,"i had the most amazing boss, he was so cool that we were close buddies. he was nice and friendly. i also miss my co workers because when ever we are working it feels like thanksgiving where you get to meet everyone and come together as a big family."
good,"Really enjoyed hunting for address corrections and the problem solving involved. The van audit could be a little tought at times, but a lot of that was due to the drivers codeing something wrong or a package handler taking a package off the truck that should have been left on it. In either situation I get hit for 'missing' a package that wasn't there in the first place. After I left they redid the whole procedure to make it easier on the person doing the audit."
good,FedEx is a great part time job if your single with no kids or your in college.
good,Worked a.m shift 4-8 a.m had spare time for school and second job. Worked with alot of good people.
good,My typical day started in the afternoon and started with load assignment number and either start a new trailer or finish a trailer. I learn how to load a truck from top to bottom and from back to front. I learn how to use a zip code chart to make sure the right package goes to the right truck location. I learn how to organize the truck from big packages to small packages including the odd packages. My co-workers were fun to work with and if you happen to fall behind they would take the time to help you catch up. The Hardest part of the job was during the season where you had to work at a very fast pace to keep up with the packages that came down the shoot.
good,"Start at 3am work till 7-8am. Scan and load all packages on correct trucks. fast paced, mangers are helpful, Staff members use team work, Hardest part is the pace, the best part is the pace."
good,"Fedex is a nice company to work for especially if your in school full time during the day. Even thought this is a part-time job, it allows you to work just enough to make ends meet."
good,everyday you learn something valuable. management is very understanding. the enjoyable part of the job is fulfilling the task
good,I enjoyed my time at Fedex Trade Networks. The job training is outstanding. I have been trying to return since I was laid off in 2009 but they not give me an interview! Its not that I left by choice.
good,Fed Ex Ground provided excellent training for this position. Supervisor support was also top notch.
good,I enjoy working with this company because of the fast paced environment. The company has also taught me a variety of safety measures that I had no previous knowledge of. I would recommend athletes give it a shot on during the off season.
good,"Great place to work, mind your business, do the job, go home."
good,"I love a company that values diversity in the workforce and Fed-Ex is that kind of company. Advancement within the company however is limited and management is reminiscent of the move Office Space, about 15 managers who all have a direct saying in what should be done and how; this is very confusing when trying to accomplish a goal and in my opinion limits productivity within the workforce."
good,A great place to work at. You learn a lot about shipping and receiving. Great pay with increases like no other. Fast paced and the day moves at a great pace.
good,"FedEx is a great company. Full-time benefits for part-time work was a major hook for me. My managers were very friendly, and even made food for us!"
good,"Fast paced working environmnent, could us more hours of work in the flight operations area"
good,"Nice work environment, good management, good peers, I never face any problem in my work period."
good,Very productive work environment and a great company culture.
good,Fedex Ground is a great part time and full time job with benfits and have good management
good,"FedEx Office is a branch of the FedEx brand which is a Fortune top 100 companies to work for. The company in general is good to work for and it gives you good knowledge of all printing solutions and ability to learn computers, and the general programs we use everyday on them very well."
good,"Very enjoyable place to work, lots of training opportunities and ability to move up if you are willing to."
good,"It started out as the ideal job with a great work environment and excellent pay. However, it became very time consuming and i felt i had no life."
good,I didn't work for FedEx.  I work at FedEx Field.  I work during the football season.  I enjoy it and I enjoy the flexibility of my schedule.  My boss is great ad supportive.
good,"At FedEx you aren't stuck with your first position. You have the option of moving to other areas that you feel suit you more. For example, after just 3 months I was able to move to the forklift."
good,This company for the most part is fine. I worked for the owner of the vehicle. The communication is pretty good. Naturally things can't always be great. When I needed some special help I was taken care of. I had very few problems. If you are an owner operator you will make money if you want.
good,I'm not sure on what I'm supposed to write about here. The job depending on the location is great. The bigger the center the more the work and chances of advancing to higher positions.
good,Great company to work for and room for growth. Many opportunities to learn different aspects of the operation as a whole. Neet new people and many opportunities to satisfy customers experience.
good,I like my job. Good benefits good work hours but I will take more hours. My supervisor it's ok easy to work with just want more hours but I do get my 40 hours  & also need a raise
good,"Great job, overall great workers . Hours usually aren't long due to operational needs. There is overtime available from time to time. Usually during the holidays."
good,"This company is good if your looking for 15 to 20 hours a week. They are good for the customer has well as the employee.  I had to leave to find more hours but, I would go back in a heart beat."
good,My fellow employees are great. Managers are easy to talk too in regards to personal issues. Fedex will work for your schedules if you have multiple jobs or school schedules.
good,FedEx has many opportunities for people to grow their careers. The workplace culture is good. The most enjoyable part of my job is working with a team.
good,"Good company, only if you work for the right contractor, or become one. I was fortunate to work with the 3 best contractors there. There are contractors I would not work for."
good,"The atmosphere at Fed Ex is pretty chill, the workforce is diverse and everyone is willing to help one another, the pay is decent but the lack of hours is the only downfall"
good,Promotions focused on favoritism over ability. Minimal training given with many performance targets although they may or may not be enforced or made priorities depending upon management mood.
good,"Boa empresa para se trabalhar, apesar de ser puxado o horário de trabalho e o esforço durante o trabalho."
good,A typical day at work would be delivering packages to houses and businesses and getting signatures and doing pickups. I learned don't wait for opportunities go get them. Management was good. The hardest part of the job was organizing the boxes on the truck and losing packages in the truck and finding them later and the big bulky heavy boxes were hard to carry. The most enjoyable part of the job was the long drive to another part of the route.
good,"Fefex have quartely meetings about the performance in every dept, dock, clerical, sales, company profits & benefits..Fedex is a diversity company"
good,i was a package handler i was in a truck all day sending packages up through a belt i was always chosen to  go inside of 53 foot trailers because of how fast my work was
good,great career opportunity for the motivated individual.  High earning potential.  Hard work while dealing with the elements.  Good all around management staff.
good,"Productive place to work, works with employees on family and personal matters, no down time in productivity most of the year, keeps employees updated with new rules and regulations, flexible on start times. willing to cross train office employees."
good,As a forklift operator I actually really enjoyed my job at FedEx. They kept me busy without me having to break my back. Always had my break times. Management wouldn't hassle over vacation days or use of personal time.
good,"I only do this part time, but the time I'm working I love it. You are basically your own boss, I sometimes have a rider w/me on the busy days to help deliver packages. And the meeting of different people is awesome."
good,Just need to find a work life balance for yourself and be focused on the job not the people.Take your time to learn you area and try and build with your surrounding routes
good,It was a joy working for them. The environment that I was around was great. Managers always kept the place a joy. The energy that each person gives one another is encouraging.
good,"Working for fed ex can be fun and can be dangerous. My time there was fun, but dangerous. You can get hurt if you’re aren’t paying attention. Also your time there can be bad if you aren’t following policy"
good,trained good a number one fast paced environment handling packages and sorting in the correct ares. safety number one . daily communicatins to let employees know whats going on
good,It's a hard job I liked it. It was like getting paid to work out so I really had no problem with the work. I don't mind working hard for what I want so it was ok.
good,"Good job to work at employees  are good  to work with no drama there, I got the time to find focus and excel at where I started out as a scanner on one side and end up  to being all over the place because  of being. A fast learner it was great working there just hate someone hit my car causing me to be out of work."
good,"I load and unload freight with a forklift. I load and unload freight correctly, safely, and on time to ensure the customers receive there products in the best way possible."
good,The company is fairly consistent with the work and there’s no heckling upon employees by management. Also the pay is worth the price of potential extra tasks that may be given
good,Pay could be better; benefits are good.  Part time hours are decent.  Holidays are good.  They have fun times for their employee's.  There's not much more I could say about this company.
good,You have to be able to multi-task throughout the day. It was a wonderful experience throughout the time of working with the business. I did indeed learn more when it came to repairing mc95 scanners and laptops
good,Nothing bad to say about fedex. I worked in the warehouse and was an assistant on the trucks. Both were engaging and yes you will work but that's expected.
good,"Ayude con la implementacion del proyecto Bayer, buen ambiente de trabajo."
good,The managers are fair and do their best to be consistent. They also create a cohesive and morale driven work environment. The hardest part of the job was working outside in extreme temperatures
good,"Responsible for warehouse duties: including the physical loading, unloading and/or sorting of packages of varying sizes and weights by hand, including lifting, pushing, pulling, carrying, scanning and placing packages in a fast-paced warehouse"
good,"Sustainable job, wage could be better for the load of work you receive. Benefits are not the great. Management makes it easy to work around your school schedule."
good,Great pay but have to work nights. Management works with you and lots incentive to work safely. You start off part time but with full benefits except paid holidays and you acrude paid time off no vacation
good,"It's a good fast paced part time or full time. Able to work more than 40 hour a week. Good if your in school or as a second job. And, people are mostly respectful"
good,"Good work life balance. Very good company. "
good,The environment was positive. I was grateful to be employed whether with FedEx or any other company. Not enough advancements and need to communicate with employees better.
good,The typical day begins with checking in with your supervisor and being assigned a trailer to work. As the packages come you scan them and stack them in the trailer
good,It’s a place that has a good working environment. They offer a decent amount of schedules to offer to people that are willing to work for their company.
good,FedEx is a great company to work for. It gets slow sometimes but I still manage to get my hours by cleaning up the place. When it's busy sometimes I get overtime as well. I have awesome supervisors very down to earth. My manager is pretty cool to recently in the past he has done holiday dinners and employee appreciation week for the staff. Moving freight can be dangerous so always be alert. Safety above all and the purple promise baby.
good,"very fast pace work place and a fun place to work you stay busy pulling,picking, and organizing customers orders which makes the time go by super fast."
good,"Working at Fedex is not the funnest job, but it keeps you real busy. The people I met are helpful, understanding, and amazing to work with. The day so by so fast and the management team helps you out. The hardest job is waking up. My schedule is 3am to 8am. Not the best."
good,Se ponen metas elevadas de trabajo y se van aumentando las metas hasta ser muy dificiles y se exigen que se cumplan.

good,"hard work but fun to do"
good,"I’ve gotten very accustomed to answering phones and helping customers with any problems they have. I’ve also become very well versed in typing, especially on the 10-key, and I’ve become efficient at looking at the finer details of my billing job and excelling at the tasks given to me. My bosses have given more more responsibility other than billing by setting appointments and handling with drivers."
good,great work environment and met a lot of new people and friends. I learned how to organize and load a truck properly and also i learned how to manuever throughout my route.
good,Good company i would recomend it for young people who wants to agarra career and grow up .
good,Since I’ve been at fedex I have learned a lot. I have gained a since of independence and have taken on a bit of responsibilities that have helped me grow as an individual and wouldn’t trade it for the world.
good,This job requires a lot of movement. You will be sweating at some point but if you're not shy when it comes to manual labor then you should be fine. Teamwork and efficiency is key here.
good,"Trucks and planes with freight have a schedule to follow.  Therefor the warehouse members are always working at a prompt pace to play beat the clock.  Because everything runs on a tight schedule, people are expected to be at work on time and not call out every day."
good,"My day starts at 7:00am"
good,"great job offers"
good,"It was fast paced, and it was always busy, quite fun when you got to know the people on team, leadership was decent and the training was easy and the teachers taught to everyone’s level."
good,Only left because my husbands job relocated him. I planned to retire from fedex. I was proud to be a part of the purple promise. Forever looking for another opportunity.
good,"busy terminal, biggest 1 in North East.  most drivers were nice& helpful. Weekends off.   did your job, you were fine.   plenty of OT, during busy season."
good,FedEx is a very high paced work environment. When I was employed there the management was not up to par with the demand of work load. During peak the work load was very labor intensive. They expected 400 boxes to be loaded an hour but during peak that wasn't fast enough.
good,was very flexible in regards to managing family/work.  Had the ability to work remotely when needed.  People were great.  Didn't hate going to work there.
good,"great place to work. its fun and they treat employees very well. The only downfall I have is that it is part time. your lucky to get 15 hours a week, pay is fantastic though."
good,Hard fast paced work. got to keep up or get fired. Good enough to work there part time but it sucks because I need more hours to make it. Part time is 2-4 hours which don't really cover my bills so I have to do other jobs.
good,I mean you get a free workout everyday for like 5hrs straight or less a day full time benefits but work part time I like being there but for someone fresh out of high school I would definitely recommend
good,"Great Culture. FedEx has been a great place to work and is very diverse from a corporate standpoint. However, there is much room for improvement from a diversity standpoint at the higher levels within sales. Overall they are a solid company and I've learned a lot from working there."
good,It’s honest work & very hard. Box’s come & won’t stop coming for hours & they are all heavy. It’s definitely a great 2nd job but I wouldn’t recommend working there as an only job .
good,"Fed Ex was a face-paced job. You were lifting, sorting, staging packages. All packages had to be ready for delivery in approximately 3.5 hours. Some days were more rushed than others. Christmas season is the roughest."
good,Sort packages deliver each package to there locations. Packages can weigh from 50 to 100 pounds on a heavy day. Each location has a number for eash package to be delivered to.

good,"I was managing the office by myself during my shift"
good,Great experience can develop working for FedEx customer service wise. FedEx offers a driver development course in house to get a career started. They offer great warehouse experience as well as shipping and receiving structured training. The only thing they dont offer is Management career advancements unless your part of that specific group of employees. Alot of favrotizom!
good,Good place to work for n good pay to. Management is knowledgeable about everyday operations and giving us information for each workday so we can get the job done right.
good,"Its was a fun experciene, once you learn to get your route and routine down. most driver out on the road supported each other in time of need. I do it all again if i was to worked for the same contractor before"
good,it okay love to work with everyone there the atmosphere is a family oriented very out going company and very concern for safety and working in a very steady pace
good,It was a job I should of kept but the hours were too early to do. 3am to 7 or 8 am.  Repare yourself  to be hot so don't wear too many layers of clothing. It's not climate control because it's a warehouse where the doors are always open for trucks to pickup and drop off.  Wear comfortable shoes for standing long periods of time scanning and moving things around. Good pay friendly people.
good,"I’ve learned how to efficiently load and unload trucks while also using a scanner. The people were always great, and I never had any problems with management. In fact, the people are the most enjoyable part of my job. The hardest part however would be the labor; but that’s typical with most jobs."
good,A typical day is just chillin not that much work.The managers are cool they not on you all the time. The work place is good just that is hot inside. They give water and other cold drinks.
good,Fed ex is a great place to Work from entry level to career minded individuals. This company  has positions ranging from entry level to management in every job field you can think of.

good,"No complaints, good pay, friendly co workers, easy money. Physical, Routine, work.. easy to get more hours and work your way up. Management do a good job"
good,"FedEx is a great company to work for. If you don't slack off and do what you are supposed to do, you will do great. A large portion of the job as a courier you are alone, so you need to be motivated to keep working without a manager breathing down your neck."
good,Nice company. Fast-paced. Worked well with other local companies to help organize and co-sponsor events for charities. Company is loyal to the groups it works with.
good,"easy place to learn and possible growth "
good,"Since I gotten there it's been a really nice experience from the work atmosphere to my coworkers and managers. Simple, easy work nothing too crazy expected from you only to show up everyday and do work. Nice place to make new networking connections as well. Chance to move up in the company as well every couple months."
good,Good place to work not a lot of hours lot of strenuous lifting very high pace had to be able to work with others to get jobs done helped me build a good work ethic
good,"I liked it there. "
good,My experience was good.  My position was contract and it expired. I would  recommend working there. Management is always changing but the people make it enjoyable.
good,There are so many avenues you can venture off into with this company. When you show management you want to do more they provide you with the tools for growth. I started as a city driver moved to road then into management The pay is good  and you bump up progressively hourly employees paid weekly. The downside management is paid twice a month it’s constant training. Management misses the target a lot sometimes. The upside hourly is paid weekly there is constant training and if they need volunteers you are always allowed to travel and they cover all expenses and if you come out of pocket they reimburse you and don'ttax that check they cut you. Bonuses are good could be more than 2.3% of your yearly gross stock options are healthy I love It though overall been here over 2 yrs
good,"Ótima experiencia, pois vivenciei de perto o conteúdo que aprendi."
good,"FedEx is a great company to work for. They are very big on diversity and inclusion. There are many opportunities to advance your career throughout the company, not just in Memphis, but world wide."
good,"Fedex offers a lot of benefits with healthcare provided after 90 hours. It's nice for a part time job, but it is part time only. There are opportunities from time to time to apply for higher paying jobs within the company. It is fast paced, and a lot of times, you may come home very tired, but I got used to it after a while. If you like a challenge, this is a good job to look into."
good,Empresa seria y comprometida con sus clientes y empleados

good,I a typical day for me would be getting to the terminal at 9am. Checking my truck and then taking off to make all of my deliveries. I usually get done with the deliveries around 1pm and then I would start my pick ups. I would be completely done and back at the terminal by 545.
good,"A typical day at fed ex consists of a brief 5 minute meeting about the workload we will be receiving that day, and then jumping right into the action. It is very exhausting most days and at times can even be stressful, but the main thing is knowing that we will all get through it at the end of the day."
good,"I can see why people would have negative reviews it’s hot, fast paced, and can be stressful at times. My facility the managers have been great they push for increased productivity, like anywhere else, but have been more than fair. There is never enough time to do what is necessary and things are always changing or reorganizing but that is to be expected in such an environment so I have no complaints.  It’s not for but it’s an opportunity for me to test and improve my time management skills.everyone that is for sure"

good,"Fedex is a great company to work for. They have great benefits for you and your family. They have tuition reimbursement. Job security is great. People are always going to send packages. The job is easy but can  sometimes be stressful depending on your route. Different routes have a different number of packages. Just take your time, deliver the packages and you can make this job into a career. Paid holidays off and a 501K. Depending on your work ethic will determine how long you last at Fedex. Depending on what location you work at will determine how long you will stay with the company."
good,well managed hard working job with good camaraderie. Very hard work with a 400 package pace in often times hot or cold trailers. very professional management that are very personal and work hard at learning who every worker is personally.
good,"The job overall was a good experience, but as it was my first job, it was a bit too much. Good pay and people, but stressful work as a first job or if you're not used to heavy lifting. This was, however, only their part-time job, so conditions are obviously better when it's full-time."

good,The job can be challenging at times but there is always opportunity for advancement. The company culture is probably the best feature of working for FedEx!
good,"It's a very busy job with little to no brakes. Most of the week will run into issues with belts stopping regularly or trucks coming in late, which in turn causes the day to run late. The worst part about the late trucks was managers in turn wanted the unloaders and package handlers to work get the job done at almost double their individual labor output"
good,This job was a good productive environment respectful employees around you always something to do stay on your feet good positive environment to be around

good,You walk in and clock in to get prepared to offload trucks. I learned that it is very fast paced and a hardworking environment. Management is hectic sometimes with unknown cases happening day by day during inbound shifts. Hardest part is being physically constant picking up heavy packages.

good,I enjoy the fact that you are able to communicate with coworkers and management freely. Communication is very important in all aspects of life and also to succeed on any job.

My manager encourages me to succeed and works on my development, my team is a lot of fun, and very flexible on vacation and work hours.

I learned a lot about teamwork and how important it is to be a leader in your team. I also learned how to plan my schedule to get to work on time which started at 3am. The management when i first started to work there was great! My manager was really polite, listened to anyone who had and usually let us do our work without micro managing. The workplace culture was pretty fun, seeing planes land all night coming in with sometimes cool freight like animals or cars, using big machinery with caution to unload the plane. The hardest part of the job was having the responsibility of balancing the plane and delivering on time with the pressure of not scratching the plane or damaging any products. What I enjoyed was the fact that my crew members were always there for me and each other as if we were a family."

good,Good place to work. I was hired to work 25 hours per week and liked it very much. I left when I was passed over for a full time route that came open. Should have stayed as the kid who took it didn't like the route and quit. He had slightly more seniority than me so I'm sure it's why he was given first shot at it.
good,The company offers great benefits with a productive work place. Management support the employees to better their career. We learn great techniques to improve the the work day.

good,Fast Pace but easy work.  Nice people to work with and for.    Facility is close to home and easy to get to.   It takes about 10 minutes to get there.
good,While I worked at fedex there were a lot of days I did not want to come to work simply because I was tired but the people there make it worth the while and the managers were so nice
good,"A typical day at work consists of me and my coworkers loading trucks and loading aircrafts. I learned diversity and aircraft and truck weight and balance. Management gives you space to get the job done. Workplace culture was mostly upbeat. I don't recall any part of this job being hard. Working with people to get things done, management there to assist and help not down talk and belittle employees, every part of this job was enjoyable."

good,"they only offer part time positions here at fedex but otherwise great company to work in, great benefits too! pleasant work environment. the only full time positions would be the courier position."
good,Hours are good can't complain and the pay is decent. It would be great for a college student or someone who is looking for a second job. They promote within so you have a chance of getting promoted whenever a position comes open

good,"work is good not very challenging mentally, mostly physical work. Hours aren't very good if it isn't seasonal, only about a few hours a week but if its holiday hours are about 12+ per day so good money during holidays but wouldn't recommend for a year-round position."

good,A great place to work. Has many opportunities for the ones seeking to advance. Very fast pace operation depending on the area you are assigned. Most of the jobs are part-time but FedEx does offer additional hours for the ones who want them. If one get in good with a different shift manager you are able to get countless hour. Work conditions far as working in the elements can be harsh. Safety can be another concern if someone is not following the rules.
good,Really fast-paced and you have to pick up really heavy boxes. If physical activity is not your thing then do not waste your time applying. You will sweat everyday and be sore on some.
good,I learned a lot in the short time I was employed at FedEx. It was a fast paced environment and there was a collaborative effort to complete the daily goals from work.
good,"They hire and pay your fairly and give you a good place to work. It is a great place to just keep ypour head down, work hard and punch out. Simply put."

good,Well compensated and  supported by the management by providing training and seminars to improve quality service being given the their costumers. Happy work place.
good,I worked at FedEx one year at Christmas time as a seasonal job. It was really busy and hectic but I made good money for the short amount of time I was there.
good,"Working at FedEx is a good experience. You can move up from being a handler to a manager in no time if interested. The pay is good, but it can be difficult to get extra hours, so if you're working 4 hour for $13 an hour, it's not really much a week"
good,"Empresa ótima para se trabalhar, oferece oportunidades a seus funcionários, tem vários benefícios, ambiente armônico. Empresa de excelência!"
good,Working at Fedex has allowed me the opportunity to learn how to work in an environment that causes one to watch surroundings. A typical day at Fedex includes writing and entering information in a hand-held computer. The information is needed for tracking customer packages.

good,"Good environment to work in, great company to work for long term. As a part timer, you are qualify for full benefits, including medical and dental for your whole family."
good,"FedEx is a great place to work, even though it is very challenging at times. Supervisors that are fair and notice your hard work. Pay scale is way better than their competitors by 40% for entry level (Package Handler). I was shocked by that difference. FedEx understands for hard work should be reimbursed with good wages. For that, I commend them. Good luck."
good,I retired from teaching and coaching and continued to work at full time and part time jobs for the next 22 years.  Much of this work was in retail sales and also did some commercial driving as a courier for several different companies.  I enjoyed teachers and my retail sales and courier work.  I have good people person skills and would enjoy doing that again on a part time basis. My last job at Fed Ex was enjoyable because the working conditions wre good and they stressed efficiency and not excess stress.  They had activites on occasional week ends for the employees.
good,A very good place to work They were good to their employees and treated us good. You could always go to them to talk if you had an issue with anything.
good,"Fedex is a great company to work for and has plenty ways to advance in the company.  They provide many training and education options.  Good bbq's and food days.  The company is great the employees are good.  Management is okay, depending who you are under."
good,Good company to work for. The company's economy is good. There is job stability and good management. The working environment is good and people work as a teamand the management support it.
good,Made 14.29 an hour. FedEx has a tuition reimbursement program that is eligible for up to  $3000. This allowed me to be able to afford taking calculus and organic chemistry over the summer. Really grateful for that.
good,"Part Time Workers get Dental, Health and Vision Insurance, and are paid pretty well.  Full Time Workers are paid even better, probably the among the highest in the industry."
good,working for fedex was a great experience although it was through an staffing company. Fedex often bought its staff lunch and I even was able to attend the purple promise week festivities during the assignment
good,We transported heavy cargo on and off trucks.  It was intense manual labor.  We wore special safety equipment.  We worked in all the elements outdoors.
good,the hardest part of the day was when peak season was around.  learned a lot from this job. I learned how to deal with people. Workplace culture was decent

good,My 21 years at FedEx was the best work experience I have ever had.  The opportunities I had were the best in developing my work skills.  The training I received were the best in the industry.
good,"a typical day at work is could result in learning how to load an unload trailors of freight. The management is consistent on letting workers know what is needed of them. The hardest part of job is working in bad weather conditions,"
good,"Great part time job with great full time benefits "
good,I enjoyed the fast paced environment at FedEx. There is a lot of room for growth in the company. I felt comfortable knowing I was working with like minded individuals.
good,Excellent company with outstanding benefits. Very good training opportunities. Great environment to gain experience and learn about aircraft as well as work with equipment. Very technology driven.
good,Fedex Freight in my opinion is the best LTL company to work for. I was a Road Driver for a couple of years pulling double trailers terminal to terminal. The company has good benefits for Full time and Part time employees. Career advancement is very likely to happen if you show you want to advance. I learned a lot about trucking and the LTL industry at FedEx Freight. A lot of Road Drivers turn over due to the fact you have to work the dock on most runs under 400 miles round trip. Seniority rules all at this company but once you get your time in things get better.
good,"Large corporation, very performance oriented. Has many rules and guidelines to direct staff performance. Culture is high pressure, performance driven, and pushed by stringent timelines for accomplishment. Advancement may be difficult as employees stay for job security and vacancies are not frequent. Career Opportunities are more available if relocation is an option."
good,Very great work environment. The pay was very good considering this was a seasonal job for the month of December. I would strongly recommend getting into this company.
good,I had this job when i was in high school and I remember everyone treating me well. I do not remember a lot of the details of the job because it was such a long time ago;
good,"Provided my entrance to distribution operations"
good,Depending on the position you might spend the day loading aircraft or taking customer complaints. Overall I think the company is a great place to work. Most importantly you have job security as long as you show up. NO LAYOFFS.
good,This job requires a lot of physical labor but if balance right it is manageable. learnt the ins and out of a commercial shipper in the US. worked at many different stations throughout the sort facility.
good,"Would recommend this job to mostly younger people, of course you can move up in any job field but i personally don't think an adult with responsibilities will be able to provide for they're family with this average job one you first start working here."
good,FedEX LTL was a fast paced job but overall it was a great job. FedEx LTL knows how to pay workers for the hard work they do. If the location i worked at never closed down i would still be working there today.
good,Fedex Hub was fine to work at. You sort packages to the right locations and you do it for hours on end. It's good if you want to exercise. Keep in mind that it gets pretty loud there so you need protective hearing.
good,"it was great to learn how to use the scanner.It was also great to meet new a"
good,A fast pace environment in the morning loading or unloading boxes from trailers or loading boxes into the vans. Lifting heavy or light boxes always moving never slowing down
good,"Good place to work, offer flexibility in work schedules depending upon your job title and work location. Job benefits include health and life insurance. tuition assistance."
good,"Work is easy, people are friendly, managers are helpful and understanding. The only bad thing is, the hours aren't enough. If more hours were offered this job will be amazing."
good,"Good place to work, have a lot of opportunity for advancement, management is great, hardest part of the job is the climate of the environment, hot to cold"
good,this is a big ole' company but things are pretty good if you can handle the bureaucracy. I enjoyed my time here and would work there again. A lot to be appreciated.
good,"A good place to work if you want to move up or just looking for supplementary income, mostly fast paced depending on your area and title but good place to work overall"
good,The best thing about the job is the team members.  I met a lot of the great people.  The hardest part is finding a parking space...and going though security check.
good,"I love working here, it is a place where you come in and you get out and do your own thing. You make sure you deliver the items efficiently and in a timely manner while helping others if needed"
good,the company I worked for was bought out by fedex freight  they where a great company to work for great benefits  .and when they closed they helped us find new jobs
good,"In the current position, even for part time, there isn't enough hours provided. The management in place does their job well and does what they can to help the individual employee."
good,The people our friendly easy to learn  the boss and supervisors help if needed  change up so you are not doing the same routine every day it is fast pace but runs smooth
good,Was a lot of changes over the years through mergers were hard to get use to. And was hard watching contract carriers take the freight that we should have been hauling. Over all I wished that I was still there. This is where I wanted to retire.
good,"Great part time job for someone looking to earn extra money. Friendly people, and consistent schedule. No work scheduled on holidays and overtime is available."
good,"enjoyed the fast paced while answering 300 plus calls a day,, exceptional training while joggling with 3 to 4 screens at the same time. Multitasking a must and very productive"
good,The corporate culture at FedEx was great at that time. It has been a long time though. You will see folks who have worked there their entire life. The company invests in technology a lot.
good,"good company to work for, definitely helped me get through school. I wold recommend this company to anyone. It is fast paced but also fun. You are on your own when you get on the road so its stress free in that aspect."
good,A typical day was constantly moving. There is a lot of standing and lifting. Safety and good body mechanics are very important while working at Fedex. The management is great!
good,The job starts out with a daily briefing of the night before and what is expected of us for the workload of the day. You find your place and work until your shift is over.
good,Perfect for many that have full time jobs if need insurance for example. Knock out few hours in the early mornings and go to day job. Retired? Perfect for you too!
good,Worked hard unpacking and packing trucks to and from deliveries. Great working environment but had lifting. Sometimes you have to stay longer than shift scheduled. Paid weekly.
good,This is a great job except that it is only part time it is very fast paced and the good thing you do not have to be around customers just other employees.
good,"Part time job - very good co-workers and management."
good,I truly enjoyed working with the FedEx IT team - committed to making projects work.  Aggressive management team committed to getting new business and retaining current customers.
good,"I started at the Call Center at FEDX and loved it. "
good,"This was a good job for me as it emphasized much of my skill set; Independent, Self-motivation, Good communication skills, Team player, Unselfish and honest."
good,It was a great learning experience but unfortunately they close down the office that I was working for and moved the company to Houston TX. So I and many other employees moved.
good,"This job fast pace, great for people who can not keep still. There is  always something that can be done, people always working together. This job also pays well."
good,"Every position is different, but overall, FedEx is a fast-paced place to work.  There are high expectations because the motto is centered around making customer an employee experiences outstanding.  All of my direct managers were amazing, which is why I stayed with the company for so long.  There is somewhat of a lack of consistent recognition and also fair pay.  As someone who was with the company for many years, it was very discouraging when new, unexperienced employees were brought in at the same or higher pay rate."
good,"Well, its really fast paced and deliveries have to be on time. Customers are very welcome to see you. The hardest part is working over 10 hours. "
good,"it is a very hot/cold "
good,active; learning experience fast pace job team working field.I learned how to multitask and communicate better  the management was nice people we all made sure the mail got done on time so we can send the mail out
good,"I would work at FedEx Custom Critical as a contractor, and recommend FedEx Custom Critical to young drivers to begin a career. To learn and get the best updates of the business and D.O.T."
good,"hard work, fast pace really fun co-workers management is there to help anyone that needs help but the hardest part is the first 3 weeks just getting the hang of it"
good,I had a good time everyday was a breeze I didn't have any complaints  at all it was a thriving working environment everybody was nice calm and collected.
good,I have worked for Fed Ex Smart Post the pay was very low. Now I work for Fed Ex Freight and I am loving it. we get a great pay increase every 90 days.
good,Very competitive job driving mail across coutry as well as interstate locations. Drving double trailers as well as sleeping in the tractor during the time between destinations
good,I enjoyed my career there for the most part. I didn't mind the HARD labor. Be prepared to work because you will be exhausted.  It really requires physical mobility unless you are in a comfortable position in the offices.
good,"I worked for FedEx for 6 years and the only thing I can say is... the benefits are great, which in my opinion, is the main reason most people are employed there. Management was shaky as they were transferred to different areas frequently, which was a major adjustment. However, if you do your job, you should have no problems."
good,FedEx pays well and offers people a simple way to make a decent living. Management provides the drivers with the help they may need while out on their route.
good,"Work here was just basically belt line, box trucks & semi trucks.. loading & unloading, Management was strict but also relaxed so long as you follow guidelines. the best thing was building walls for the semi trucks, the worst was working in the weather conditions upstate in an open warehouse."
good,"i loved the job overall, the only down fall was that  we werent getting nearly enough hours to make a decient living, but if i could work there full time i wold"
good,"responsibilities included but not limited to customer relations, inspect truck for defects, complete and turn in all related daily logs in all completed"
good,Fed ex was a good company to work for. I would work there again as a Customer Service agent if there was an opening. They train you and pay you for it. You can apply to different postions once your hire.
good,"Fed-ex was a nice place to work. If you like being independent, working by yourself and challenging yourself then this is a great place for you. It is hard work being attentive and alert at all times."
good,"hard work, and qucik paced. Expectations must be met or the whole line will suffer. You have to work as a team to succeed with this company. Great overall place."
good,"Great opportunities for advancement, very good benefits that start  immediately. A working environment that encourages and motivates employees to thrive and advance."
good,Job can be quite challenging trying to meet the expectation of some customers.  It is retail based so hitting plan requirements is a must.  Can be very stressful especially during holiday season.

good,FedEx is a great company to work for.   Nice benefits and solid work.  I have learned a lot working at several FedEx locations.  I appreciate that all of our uniforms are provided.
good,"I cannot really comment as an employee as I am temporary. I do plan to apply for permanent positions when I am eligible. I do enjoy working here. Environment is relaxed; however, a bit cliquish. I do keep to myself so this doesn't bother me much. The Managers all seem to be okay to work with"
good,"Its stressful dealing for fedex. the are always under staffed and there empolyees only give abput 75%, but they expect you to give 150%, they take no accountablity for there actions that can cause problems for drivers at the point of delivery."

good,its hard work but its simple and some positions are pretty relaxed like van line but you don't get break. and you usually work 3 to 6 hours. some times 8 on good days. I say good because of the money but you still deal with heavy packages hundred pound dumbbells tables dressers treadmills.

good,everyday we would show up and stretch then we would get on the line  to open the cans with boxes or equipment in them and throw them onto the line or carry them over if they were to heavy to throw. management was great but would rush us a lot so it was kind of annoying since were already exhausted. i loved being physical at this job. i had so much fun.

good,The Memphis Hub is a huge workplace. Management will literally throw you into your field of work on your first day and you are on your own. Intense and heavy work. Not a very collaborative place of work everyone has there own area on the line. For the amount of work and labor you are doing we should get paid way more.

What basically goes on is loading boxes onto trailers that are going to other facilities or loading delivery vans. The managers are nice people who care about their employees but try to make sure the job gets done at the same time. The other employees are usually helpful if one person's boxes get backed up too much on their trailer. One thing about work at FedEx that's to be expected is many of the employees do tend to swear, so be cautious if this isn't your thing. Work can get repetitive but it's always worth it when you finish the job knowing you did well."

I have also found the company to be loyal and committed to my growth as an employee.  The transportation industry is an intense one, particularly these days as ecommerce makes up much of the volume we see, but FedEx truly strives to be company that takes care of it's employees as well as it's customers.

good,"A typical day at work was easy because at the san diego ramp dealing with 3 aircrafts you be out of work in 4.5 hours. I moved up in the company from a material handler to a ramp agent during my 2 years employed. overall the company is good to work future wise because of the benefits and perks fedex has to offer. one thing I can say it could be a drain depending on management it can ruin the mood of working at fedex.

The hours are either 4-8(pm/am) and getting on the afternoon shift is usually reserved to the people that have been with the company a while. You receive pay increases for every couple months you work there and can move up to management and even into easier more technical work that pays better but is still under the same hours.

good,"A typical day at work takes me to many different towns where I encounter all kinds of people and animals. I have learned patience and fine tuned my driving and customer service skills. Management is very supportive and willing to help you when you need it. The fedex team is a pretty laid back group, everyone gets along well. I think the hardest part of the job is the peak season. Around the holidays we all work 6 days a week, in all weather. The best part about this job is the customers, the friendships you develop and of course all the animals."
good,Worked only an hour a day everyday unloading and sorting packages on trucks. Sorted packages to designated cargo bins. If you want a workout this a place for you.

good,I take packages off the belt and sort/ load them into my truck. I plane my route and deliver the package in a time limit. Everyone there is friendly and nice to work with.
good,Long hours and a lot of lifting and bending. Not enough help for the job that is required. They move you around a lot and if you fall behind they tend to want to replace you and send you to the warehouse where they give you crazy assignments
good,"A typical day working for FedEx involved waking up and driving to Cannock depot. Once there I would load up my van and scan on the parcels and organise this onto the van.

good,Lots of good people to work with. There is a big difference in Federal Express versus FedEx Ground. Federal Express was within the corporation and offered many great benefits and chances for advancement. The hardest part of the job was having to learn a new route or area but became easier as time went on. The most enjoyable part was my co-workers and getting to meet different people on a daily basis.

I also took responsibility for the incorrect actions that may have happened. New manager above me wasn't good and would often try to be a friend rather than a boss. Hardest part of the job was the early hours, and the most enjoyable part was being in charge of around 30 people."
good,A typical days work depends on what day and what movies comes out. I learned a lot about racism. The management was laid back. Co workers were fun. Hardest part of the job was the crazy hours. I enjoyed free movies.
good,"Typically each days starts the same way with a short meeting with our manager who keep things professional but also leaves room for every one to feel free to express their individuality."
good,"Hard work, long days, hours available, write your own check, but the hours are available. New Pay structure effective October 2016."

good,This was a great job to work at. All of the employers were nice and professional there was never a dull moment at this company. I enjoyed my time there and I would recommend this job to anyone.
good,"Stable job, lower pay, management is only concerned about what is right in front of them. Resolving root cause challenges were not a priority for this company. Don't expect change in the company, or organization and don't try to advocate for it or you will be sorely disappointed. The definition of insanity is doing the same thing and expecting a different result. This is FedEx Trade Networks for sure.

I worked my tail off for them while being fast paced for over two year's. But it did have flaws of course like everything else does.

Helping other work areas that need help with getting production down.

Management, like every other company, is very good or in a few cases mediocre.  Upper management in Memphis has a good feel for economics.  In fact, FedEx is  looked upon as a good barometer of the economy's health overall.  The workers tend to be very highly motivated people.  The hardest part of the job is the long hours especially around the Holidays.  An understanding family helps.  Finally, the most enjoyable part of the job is the generous benefits package and opportunity to move around."

good,"i would go in, do the morning stretches as a group, talk about the previous days numbers, set up the line. When the time came the line would be cut on and the packages would start to move. Management was very helpful and willing to work with me, and my coworkers were easy to get along with. The hardest part of the job was the weather. When its hot its hot, and when its cold its cold."
good,"My typical work day was 10-12 hrs,  and I learned how to be very patient in getting an opportunity to help on assembly line and code product scanners.  Hardest part of my job was making sure people worked in a safe environment and I really enjoyed the social time with co-workers."
good,"FedEx truly is a great company to work for.  All of the ""hype"" about it is warranted.  The people are friendly and maintain a customer focus.  They also take pride in creating a ""learning environment"" where people are encouraged to develop.  I highly recommend it as an employer of choice!"
good,"Fun workplace, treats employees like family (for the most part). Good company to work for though its dependent on position."
good,"Supervisors that are very helpful"
good,"I commence work at 6 am or 12.30 Pm depending on the company needs, pretrip my truck and do  stretch and flex exercises to get the muscles warm, then have a meeting with the managers after which we load our trucks. We deliver the packages in accordance to the addresses sequences where priority packages are delivered before 10:30 am. Upon completion of deliveries we head back to home station and do post trip on our vehicles and then essential paperwork."
good,"You basically go in and unload freight for about 4 hours a day, you have a lot of people to talk to which can make the day go by fast, its really not that hard of a job, but doing it so long you get tired of it quick."
good,"Work is typically fast paced and the employees tend to rely on one another in terms of safety and accuracy. The management is ran pretty tight and the employees all seem to have knowledge of their daily duties and follow instructions without hesitation. The hardest part of the job can be to keep up on the busiest days, which are Monday and Tuesday. We receive a large volume of packages and have to have them all loaded onto the proper trucks by a certain time."
good,It's a easy job to do and environment is small and content. I enjoy the easy sales/offering process its not a difficult process at all.
good,"really grate job, fun and fast paced. The people are very friendly and  ready to work, cool vibes in your work space management was tough but so is every other job, hard part of the job was trying to finish my task ahead of time witch I am very good at, most enjoyable part of the job is knowing you make a difference every day you try harder than the day that has passed ..."
good,"Its a great place to work. Great contractors and workers. Management is amazing.Overall its fun place to work.The hardest part of the job is time management. There are so many task, but little time to do it in.  In order to work for FedEx you need great time management skills."

good,Being employed at FEDEX was a great opportunity for me. It allowed me the opportunity to attend school during the day and work at night.
good,"I was in a data entry position. Pretty boring, predictable job. Not much of a challenge. Management was decent, but didn't ask employees for input much. The hardest part of the job was sitting in the cheap chairs provided by corporate all day. The most enjoyable part of the job was not having to worry about work on my off hours and the stable schedule."
good,Great place to work with great benefits and very competitive pay and great environment with growth. i wasn't employed at Fed Ex for long but i could tell that it was an awesome place to be employed
good,my days are rocky I wake up in the morning for my first shift just to leave at 8am to come back at 7pm. I have learned to be a better team player. I have a slight problem with one of the managers but other than her working with the other managers fedex feels like home. the hardest part of the job is the back and forth I don't like the split shift. im currently looking into another position in fedex because you just cant make it off of 4 hours its gas and ware and tare on your car and your body with the fluctuating times. the most enjoyable part about the job is the laughs with my co workers its really a family based work place so you feel at home and comfortable with everybody if everyone is on the same page. its a wonderful jobs some of the people there just need attitude adjustments but hey that's every job right?
good,great company to work for. they pay well and take care of their employees. they benefit package is pretty good and so is the 401k plans.
good,I enjoy working for fedex but I need benefits. The vehicles always had something going on with them where I always had to swutch vehicles and or drive a rental and customers would complain about the vehicle not having fedex on the side of it. I was also bit by a dog and FedEx did nothing about it. That was disappointing.
good,safety was our first priority.  My manager Carl was great he always understood everyone problems. I met some of the great people there.The hardest part of the job was when the trailer got hot and there were two person on the trailer that made it twice as hot. For me that was a work out with out having to pay a gym membership.
good,Courier Driver delivery and pick up of packages to customer. Electronically check the incoming and outgoing messages regarding packages and envelopes
good,Enjoyable working at the airport and seeing the planes.  FedEx is considered a airline and that is vert interesting in itself. The company continues to grow and directly compete with UPS
good,"Typical day at work is busy, I try to help in both departments shipping area till 7 p.m. and production, which means helping with printing jobs till my shift ends at 9:30 p.m."
good,"Não é líder no seu seguimento por acaso."
good,I learned a lot of the freight industry and the advancement the company offered. It always provided good insurance and benefits
good,"Some days were busy and some were not, it all depends on how many packages we had to sort. The hardest part was getting everything sorted when it's close to Christmas. They speed everything up and we get 10 times the normal amount of packages at 5 times the speed. The co-works were good. They worked hard to get things done."
good,"on a typical workday, I worked in the hub. I was a inventory clerk, in the hub. I worked in the reviving department of the warehouse"
good,A typical day at work is very fast pace and  work flow is always up to par. At work I learn that safety is always caution to all employee. Team lift is always useful for lifting items up to 70lbs plus. Proper lifting is important to health wise such as getting injured towards lower back. Any problem with a co-worker or Manager always report it to Human resource. It is always important to clock in before work and clock out after work. When any boxes are damaged or a hazardous is spilled report it directly to the manager. Co- worker are always focus on doing their job and completing every job that is assign. The hardest part of the job is doing 2 jobs at once when there is no co- worker help loading up incompatible on to a tugger cart while scanning packages coming out of a trailer with two un-loader. The most enjoyable part of the job is working with the co workers and the Management is outstanding.
good,the hours at fedex home delivery allow time for a second job and to go to school. there are always opportunities to move up.
good,i have to lift packages and be responsible in safety ways. bosses and coworkers are super friendly. they offered flexible hours.
good,"Working for FedEx is a great opportunity for people that can't stay in an office for 8 hours. FedEx is always training the staff and making sure to deliver the Purple Promise. I have many opportunities to meet people in my route and learn about different businesses. The most enjoyable part of the job is to hear a customer say ""thank you for deliver my package""."
good,"Extremely physical,punctuality in all areas,limited supervision ,great team work no eras allowed,making the customer happy daily."
good,"20-25 Hours a week. You'll make $200-$250 a week doing this. It wasn't too bad, but as far as movement goes in the company, You won't see too many handlers get promoted."
good,Come in and begin to scan packages that have been placed on the conveyor belt. I learned about how package delivery works from the inside. Management and my co-workers were fine. The hardest part was having to unload the trucks and hurry back to the scanner when other workers did not show up for work. I enjoyed being able to wear regular clothes and making great money.
good,"FedEx is a great company to work for."
good,"A typical day at work would be me loading and unloading trucks with the fork-lift, also doing the safety meeting every Friday. At FedEx I learned how to be a team player and the management at FedEx Is awesome because any questions I had they answered them all for me. At FedEx my Co-workers were always positive and always had a smile on their face. The hardest part of the job was getting used too the work load. The most enjoyable part of the job was the people I worked with."
good,great place to work. very busy but ok pay. i just didnt like the hours for third shift. overall i didnt have many complaints.
good,"I really enjoy working at FedEx Express. I believe that there is room for growth and development at FedEdx. They also have a excellent management team, as well as a great group of people to work with."
good,Lot of new things to learn and implement. You will get all the support you needed from management. Overall a good place to work.
good,my typical day at work is when you get the asset which means equipment that belong to you and you bring them in and you do a pm on them a inspection and change any parts that need to be changed. I work on light duty gas vehicles to heavy duty diesel and heavy duty hydraulics system to a inspections to major overhauls. I had a little bit a knowelegde of diesel and heavy hydraulics equiment but learned working here at Fedex express. The hardest part of the job is when the equiment breaks down during uploading and filling up the cargo plane to get the packages and plane on time. You get called out there and you have to solve the promblem quick to get the packages and the plane out on time. When the cold weather hit its hard to because of the diesel and every gas powered vechicle is carburator and have them start by closing the choke and the hydralic system need to warm up and then they start working right. Also working on the diecers is a heavy task to they start to fail and you have to get the plane dieced so the plane can take off and get the packages out on time. The most enjoyable part about my job is that i have learned a lot and being around the heavy duty equipment is nice and helping the company so they can make there promises with delivering there packages on time.
good,I enjoyed the fast paced workplace. You were never caught standing around. There was always some work to do.I really enjoyed working here.
good,Great company to work for. Learn a lot about the logistics and transportation side of the business. Learn how to deal with employees and independent contractors.
good,Work day can consist of monitoring the loss and or damages of customers packages to containing HAZMAT damages. Management is focused on productivity to provide the FedEx Purple Promise in making every FedEx experience outstanding.

good,"Once you enter the building you clock in and go to your designated area. You are either scanning packages out of the truck, doing IC's, loading trucks or smalls."
good,". Started about 7am ended as early as 2pm but could be as late as 8pm"
good,I would recommend applicants to work for fedex. It's a vey fast past but you get use to it they train you for about a week and you are on your own unless you need more time.
good,Fedex gets pretty hectic certain times of the year but to many lazy people as well. Summer time it gets hot in the warehouse and winter time its usually below freezing  but honestly management could careless about you guys they sit in a nice warm room and summer time nice cool room all day and watch a cumputer screen instead of doing there job and run there shipment lanes.
good,Fast paced environment  with chances of advancement within the company. Package handlers unload vans and load trailers of packages so they can be deliveried  to their destination .

The most enjoyable part of my job are interacting with my co-workers. My managers and co-workers are hard working and fun to work with."
good,"The work environment was fast paced as you might imagine.  Each person had a unique perspective and financial need.  Some, like myself, were just happy to have seasonal work.  Most of the drivers were full time and needed the weekly paycheck to stay afloat.  Although, I was seasonal until January, it was necessary to feel like I was a regular employee.  The boss and other drivers helped greatly when I was stuck on a route.  Each day working there was a challenge, but I would have stayed full time if the boss would have discussed a future, full time position."

I learned so much about how the building runs witch belt to be on when im needed and most of how the company works."
good,Fedex was good and I loved working there. I didn't like the fact that they cut hours or that they called us out on days we had to work.
good,I like working there.  its a great place to be and very enjoyable. Very nice and friendly people.Very nice. I work hard evERYDAY.
good,"I learned how to work in a fast paced environment."
good,"My overall analysis of Fed Ex Ground is that is a great company to work for. I was challenged on a daily basis in all areas which in return helped me become the person i am today. Many aspects of my work ethic and leadership abilities were molded by my experiences with Fed Ex Ground. During my tenure with Fed Ex i discovered what it meant to satisfy customers, how to use facts and data to get results on a daily basis,how to save time and money without sacrificing quality,and most importantly how to use your failures as an opportunity to improve dramatically. The most difficult as well as most enjoyable part of the job for me was the daily challenge that came with it . Without that experience i wouldn't have the confidence or the ability to bring the best out of everyone that i get the privilege of meeting in a workplace setting."
good,"The job was a fun and easy place to work, while the pay was good the employee's will only get a minimal of 2 hours of work per day."

You were granted to catch a sweat in the truck, luckily they let us dress in comfortable clothing just as long as we wore boots, a typical day at FedEx home delivery."
good,I Been with the co. for almost three years I Like it.We get paid every week wish i worked in the morning but i am thankful i have a job
good,"I worked at FedEx for almost four years and it gave you a reason to get in shape. From when I started until I left FedEx I lost around 70Ibs in body fat. Loading and unloading boxes range from 2lbs to 100Ibs so most of the time we usually needed help with the heavier boxes. I also got the chance to drive a tugger which is a battery powered three wheeler that tugged wheeled carts that carried around 50 boxes in each cart from one belt to another. During the summer, all we had was swamp coolers and fans to keep us cool and that was brutal. In 110 degree weather a lot of people couldn't handle it but as long as you kept yourself well hydrated it wasn't as bad. I made a lot of really good friends that I still keep in contact with. My specialty was loading the bulk trucks because it was constant work and it made the time go by really fast, I really enjoyed that."

The enjoyable part of the job was making the customer happy.
good,The daily ineraction with co-workers.  The support of helping each other with loading and delivery of packages.  Management was positive and fair.
good,"On a typical day, working at FedEx Express is ""Great"" the management and other employee are great also.  the pay and benefits are great... the only problem is the hours ... just wish there are 8 hour shifts."
good,"It is fun to work as a delivery driver because you're on your own pretty much the whole day.  No grumpy boss or bully employee to deal with."
good,A typical day at Fedex is stretching and unloading boxes. I learned how to pick up boxes the right way. Management is always on top of everything. I learned how to deal with different co workers. Hardest part of the job working hard even if you tired. payday was best part of the job.

Packages were then driven to the designated routes for delivery in a timely fashion according to package service. During the course of the day, pickups were assigned to the route by the dispatchers. After delivery of the packages for the day (or during package delivery, if time permits), the assigned pickups were completed. After completion of the last pickup or delivery, couriers returned to the building. Undelivered packages were offloaded and taken to the office for customer pickup. Packages that were picked up remained on the truck for offload later on in the evening. All paperwork regarding delivery or pickups were turned in to the office for processing. "

The whole day there was enjoyable.I have no complaints about the company."
good,"driving forklift to load and unload freight from trailers "
good,"A typical day at Fedex Freight is pretty easy going.  You do your daily taks, wait on drivers to come in and it goes from there. A repeat day in and day out.  I have learned different things that go with the transportation industry, billing, customers reactions and concerns, and patience ddelaing with those customers.  Management and co-workers are easy to get along with. They both know their jobs and what they are doing.  The hardest part of my job is not understanding everything that goes on. There is (at times) miscommunication and that is key to this type of industry.  The most enjoyable part of my job is the typing.  I love to type, and billing 150+ bills a night fulfills that desire."
good,I had fun in I love my work when I was working there. that all I have to say about my old job. good place to work at
good,I would load and unload trucks. boxes from a truck would come down the conveyor belt. I learned the basic functions of a warehouse and working with a conveyor belt. my co-workers were good workers. They would help me at any given moment if needed.

good,very busy working for the company break place to work responsible for safe shipping and invertory
good,"Morning meeting every single day at the beginning of my shift. Always criticism towards my department area. Whether it was good or bad it helped us all get better and b etter each day at our job. I learned that rushing through work is not the key to be successful. Patience and timing are more important. Fewer mistakes and less people yelling haha. Co-Workers are some of the best people i've met in a long time. All striving to become something better. Hardest part of this job in the beginning was working with other who isolated themselves from everyone, Most enjoyable part of this job was that at the end of the day we got proper managing and helpful tips on how to improve ourselves. It was a pleasure working with these people."
good,"Typical day is high energy. "
good,"It is a very fast paced,on point job. There are alot of opportunites as far as helping you pay for school tuition. Good benefits and great teamwork!!"
good,"You start off the day by loading a few trailers with the earliest cut times. And go from there through the night to ensure bid compliance. Learned many skills which will help out in future warehousing opportunities. Skills include uses of forklift, clamptruck, rug pole, drum dolly, pallet jack and dock scanners. Maintain a safe and clean work place. Management is very help-full  with any questions."
good,Fast paced and physical. Management there to help you..I've learned that there is a lot a package goes through to get from point A to point B. Co-workers bond together to get the job done. Hardest part of the job is lifting 100+ lbs. Most enjoyable is the end of the day knowing you had a good workout.
good,Great company which provide many opportunity for personal growth and have EXCELLENT benefits.
good,"First one in last one out, Managing the belt line."
good,"Loaded and unloaded trucks, used forklift to move packages around the warehouse, as well as hand trucks and Walkie Riders. "
good,I love working for FedEx. The culture is great and warm. The only draw back is promotions. I am currently locked in my position and cannot grow or expand.
good,"Like UPS, FedEx is different everday as far as packages because it's a logistics company as well. I've learn some vital information while I was there and I still use some of those things to this day. The managers was okay in there own way but managers in any warehouse are most likely the same (they want the work done with quickly but, efficiently and the numbers up.) They also have a huge diverse group of talented people shipping packages there too. The hard part of job (when I was there) is the advancements. To get out of an area to move up to somewhere or something else you would have to bid and since FedEx is non-union it makes it all the more harder to move up in the company. The good thing about about FedEx is that it is a job that has all shifts so it is very flexible when it comes to job/worklife balance."
good,A typical day at work is a friendly atmosphere. Co-workers are very nice and I deal with different people on a daily basis. The most difficult part of the job is advancing. The most enjoyable part of the job is learning new things

good,"A typical day at Fedex consists of an abundant amount of freight, pretty good attitudes,and one common goal in mind. I learned that it is a lot easier to get things done when there is one goal in mind and when coworkers understand what is expected of them. Management will work with you through various situations and understand the different needs of hourly workers. My coworkers make my job easier through good attitudes and the willingness to help one another. The hardest part of my job is dealing with the weather during the winter and the blazing hot summers. The most enjoyable part of the job meeting the needs of the customers in a timely and efficient manner."
good,Great place to work. Good benefits as well great potential for growth.
good,Management was great and understanding of life outside of work.
good,good environment with a lot of teamwork to help get the daily job done
good,"Interesting job and interesting employees.  Takes unique people to work the 'sunrise shift' - generally 3am to 8am.  "
good,"It was an great experience being my first job, I learned a lot about safety I think that will stick with me to other warehouse jobs. A typical day at work would be everyone grabs a scanner and head to their assigned trailer dock and began to load the trailers. The management was okay at first until a few months later the management got bad enough people started to quit left to right. The works were okay kinda like family when you work with them long enough we started to do out of work activities like vocational things. Hardest part of the job was when it was late sometimes we'd get hit with with a lot of stuff (Packages) . I love putting in hard work there because it paid to the package handlers of free food before work starts or at the end of the shift that was the most enjoyable part of work."
good,"Fast paced constantly changing environment,no two days are ever the same. I strive daily to provide the best in class service to all my customers, corporate and individual. "
good,Great place to work. Co-workers and Management always willing to help and teach. Fast pace and labor heavy.
good,SOS is a great staffing agency. They do a great job finding you work. The pay is pretty good compared to any other businesses. They have a great staff.
good,Most positions are part time depending what you're doing but it makes sense.  The full time positions are there as needed.  The job can be repetitious but it's not hard.  Management are people...some good at what they do and some not.  Co-workers always fun to work with though some can be be a challenge.
good,"-  trabalhar sempre com harmonia."
good,"Fedex is like any other entry level warehouse position, long hours, hard labor. The hubs are not climate controlled so it is cold in the winter, and hot in the summer. Be prepared to sweat no matter what the season. Be sure to stock up on Icy hot and Ibuprofen because the first 3 weeks to 1 month you will be sore."
good,"Wonderful managers, excellent co-workers, fast paced work environment, busy from start to finish."
good,"My day at Federal Express started at 9am. I had my usual routine where i would come in, run my reports, scan equipment from the couriers in and out of the office. I would then go down to the BSC where customers dropped off and picked up packages. I helped customers choose the best shipping method for their package depending where it  was going. I would call customers about packages we had waiting for them. I also helped my boss with paper work and tickets the couriers would bring in on a daily basis. I worked for Federal Express for 8 years, i worked with the most amazing people ever. Overall all i have to say it was the best job of my life i learned so much and am very greatful!"
good,I enjoyed my time here as there was a very small team and we all got on and helped each other. the teamwork was excellent and my graphical knowledge of my local area became second to none.

good,"Hardest part of job was lifting 50 lbs or more, some boxes were heavy and some not. Management was very understanding when I decided to leave"
good,I have to be in at 3:50am every morning to scan and load packagings to be delivered.  I'm learning to be structured and responsible and learning to take criticism.  I am easy to get along with co-workers and supervisors.  The hardes part of my job is getting up at 3:00am and being on time.
good,"The hardest part of the job was just the workload that we had to complete. During certain seasons of the year, the volume would be increased and the workers were doing more than usual and staying longer as well. "
good,"The FedEx Express Memphis World Hub provides a unique work experience. It is as large as a community, employing approximately 3,000 employees, with scores or airplanes landing and departing with freight each day. "

good,Sorted packages on the conveyor belt and remember different zip codes
good,"This was a high paced job. Production and time was everything. Here i learned how to operate heavy machinery, such as fork lifts and commanders. Safety is also very important to this company."
good,"Getting my paper work and operation ready for off loading packages. How to managed 2 floors of 64 employees to off load packages by the sort down time or sooner. Worked very well as a team to meet our deadline. Pulling containers from flights, trucks in extremely bad weather. Staff being dedicated in fun getting the sort down earlier than the deadline and also seeing there faces by getting bonuses."

good,Excellent benefits package for part time employees.  Flexible time off.
good,Management cared how we felt about things. A lot of room for advancement.
good,"A typical day at Fedex Ground were Loading, Scanning, and packing boxes. Working as a unit helping, conversating about motivating with eachother on how we can get the task done ontime. There raley wasn't hard-times unless someone was very tired. The most enjoyable day is when the Company have a barba-q out back for the empoloyees. My manager John kept us welled motivated on how to keep a possitive attutiude throughout the day and with eachother."
good,"FedEx is an innovative and exceptional company to work for.  It offers plethora of opportunities to learn, advance and grow within the company."
good,"The typical day at work basically consisted of very much loading and unloading of packages off the trunk and into the truck. But it is a very fun and face paced job, very many people are met on the jobs because of the different business deliveries."
good,The job is easy work it just requires that you work while your there which is fair to me. They will take care of you if you handle business.
good,"I report to the terminal every morning and analyze the numbers and/or issues from the previous day for each driver. Then I make rounds from each truck to truck to communicate with the drivers and make sure the load is okay and without issues. I also check for maintenance and make necessary note for upcoming needed repairs. If need be, I fill in as driver or help out a driver in back-up vehicle."
good,Friendly work environment and they were professional.  I have to say this one was my favorite of the CDL type of jobs.  I liked the guys I worked with.
good,"A typical day would be checking our daily log and verifying that it matches with the corresponding freight. Unloading the trailer using a forklift and checking for any damage. The freight is then reweighed on our scale and dimensions are recorded. If the freight is to be screened then proper methods of screening will be done. Freight is then palletized if necessary. I have learned many regulations regarding freight distribution; including Dangerous Goods, perishables and TSA."
good,"Very detailed oriented job."
good,"Typical work day. I learned how to apply myself in order to grow. Management was helpful. All the workers did their job proficiently. The hardest part of the job was waking up so early."
good,I liked the the job. It was the same every day with Sundays and Mondays off. It was a team job so my co- workers were good team members and friendly. I basically learned about how home delivery works and how people receive their packages and mail so fast. My favorite part of the job was coming in at 5a.m. and out by 11a.m.
good,"Really not that difficult of a job.  Excellent benefits.  As a part-time package handler you can get paid vacation, paid holidays, and health benefits.  Opportunity for advancement is there if you're willing to relocate.  Management is easy to get along with as long as you actually do your job."
good,"basically i enjoyed the people. "
good,"If you're looking for a job that offers great benefits and a good work for about 4 hours per day then this is the job for you.  Overall, not too many companies offer medical,dental and vision and a guarantee of minimum of 17.5 of work per week."
good,"Working for the Marietta Terminal at FedEx Ground, means giving 110% of your efforts to accomplish the goals of the day. When people show up to work in the morning they have to make a choice, ""Will I give this job everything I have, or will I let it bring me down?""  It can be a challenge to always be ""at the top of your game"". As long as you learn from your mistakes and are wiling to get back on the horse and give it 110%, you'll do well. Management understands this, and they are willing to work with you so that you can accomplish the goals for the day. "
good,"The start of the day is entering into your load and sorting through to make sure every stop is correctly in order. Looking through the load making sure there are no missed loads. You have to check the truck to make sure it's in proper shape for DOT regulation. Then the best part of the job begins with customer service, delivering the goods to my people I serve everyday. Some days are harder then others when the weather is nasty but safety becomes the issue of the day to prevent accidents and injuries then . , so everyday is a day you have to have your head on right and pay attention because mistakes can get you behind."
good,"Excellent place to work.  I gained tons of knowledge on transportation management/employee management field that I hope to make a career out of. "
good,"A typical day at work consisted of checking forklift for damage, unloading a trailer and loading freight into outgoing trailer. There I learned how to work a forklift in a safe and timely manner. Management and co-workers were a delight. We were able to work together and/or separately quickly and efficiently. The hardest part of the job was dealing with misloaded freight. When misloaded freight came in we would have to rework or restack the freight so it was properly prepared for shipping. The most enjoyable part of the job was my coworkers. great guys with great work ethic and sense of humor"
good,"A usual day at FedEx is very fast paced due to the amount of freight coming in. We started our mornings with a quick briefing  and game plan, then hopped right to work. I learned how to unload trucks here, and also separate packages sending them down the right assembly line."

good,"> While starting Institutional business  ."
good,Fed Ex is a fast pace job and they always try to meet goals. I've learned at Fed Ex you can work your way to the top. There are a lot of co-workers to many to know everyone. The hard part about this job is the physical labor and weather conditions you have to face in completing the job. The most enjoyable part about this job is meeting the co-works and the managers and finding out about there personal lives.
good,"The setting up of scanners getting them ready for the contractor so that can deliver the packages. Answering customer service calls to make sure service was provided. There is a lot that goes on in transportation, many factors that effect pickup and delivery time. Management overall helpful and run for advancement. I wished I could have worked out having a new born and  working in such a demanding environment. The relationship I had with contractors where I knew who to call me when I needed to meet certain deadlines."

good,"Great Place to work. Not many advancement opportunities in Wichita, KS."
good,Good place to get familiar with logistics. Being on time is a must this atmosphere will make you aware of being prepared before you come to work
good,"Management was relatively well-mannered and passionate about their work.  Difficult aspects of the job were the variable hours and requirement to be there six days out of the week.  However, they were also lenient about absences and taking time off.  Most co-workers were generally unhappy, with there being an unnecessary rift between management and workforce due to a variety of unresolved issues."
good,Work life balance is way off. FedEx is a very stable company and the expectations are very high. Fast paced and results driven.
good,"Many benefits, fun place to work. Managers are understanding about personal life for the most part. Guarenteed job unless fired but they give many chances to correct yourself."
good,"My typical day at work consist of sorting incoming and outgoing mail throughly. I have learned how to work safe by following safety procedures with various warehouse equipment. Management gives me and my co-workers motivational speaches daily and safety awarness messages, wich is a good reminder for the dangers on the job. I work with over a hundread employees with different backgrounds and experiences. I've learned how to become a team player within a vast staff. The hardest part of my job is working with heavy packages for long periods of time. The best thing i like about this job is building some strength wich is required to lift, bend and stoop."
good,I learned a lot about building walls in a trailer and how to them with freight. Management was switched a lot. Co works that stayed were fun to be around. Hardest part of the job was you never knew who was in charge and each one of the management team told you a different thing so you never knew which one to answer too.
good,enjoyed working for FedEx. Construction job market picked up so I was able to pursue this field.
good,Although the hiring process was a bit long I would have to say it was well worth it. I have been employed at FedEx Ground for 17 months and going. Yet the actual work might be hard on the body but it becomes a great workout after a few months. This is my first job and cant say anything bad about it.
good,The most enjoyable part about my job are my customers. I enjoy having the opportunity to converse daily with customers to assist with any need they have concerning international package clearance and delivery.

good,it was a good company wish my position was not seasonal would have liked to had stayed.
good,"I noticed that if you came to work and did your job no one in supervision would bother you. Over time, I learned to like that concept."
good,"While I was working at FedEx Ground there were some friendly people and others that were mostly quiet. Considering it was a job that started around 2 in the morning it wasn't too bad. It was always the same thing every day, either waiting for boxes to come down the belt to be loaded into a trailer or unloading a trailer to send down the belt to people that were loading. While working there, I learned how to properly pick up a box to ensure it wasn't going to cut me, or that if there was something very heavy inside of it you could tell quickly. Management was there to make sure that we got the job done as quickly as we could, meaning they would help sometimes but at other times they were checking on other priorities. A lot of the people that worked around you were friendly, unless you had someone next to you quiet. If they were quiet they usually stuck to themselves. The ones that were friendly would always offer help or advice when things got a little hectic. The hardest part of the job was definitely the time in which you had to work and when you got off work. A four to five hour shift at 2:30 in the morning was hard to get used to. The one thing that was enjoyable about working there was that you almost always had help, no matter how busy the night was."
good,"I really enjoyed the management team and co-workers. I was not prepared for the volume of packages I encountered during my first ""peak"" season. With the support of management I survived. I knew it was for just a few weeks but have to admit I will miss it."
good,Great place to work. Very good benefits; unfortunately I got accepted to UGA and hand to terminate my employment because they would continue my employment part time. I would be approaching retirement in a few years if I would have stayed.
good,"Long hours, but great company to work for.Managers worked with you on your route, and helped to manage overall truckload."
good,"At FedEx Express I work in address Correction. I am required to sort packages into different baggage carts according to where they are going (i.e. going to the input, going to our non-cons) . I also have to make new labels for boxes that won't scan due to some type of problem with it, for example if the label is torn, wet, or dirty. I have had a chance to learn about different operations and I have also taken a few training classes. I currently don't have a manager, but the manager that was put over us in the mean time makes sure that we get our job done as well as make sure we have what we need to do our job. My coworkers are very helpful when it comes to getting our job done even though in this particular area it is a lot of independent work. I would have to say the hardest part of the job would be not having any control over the large amount of external misflows throughout the night, The most enjoyable part of the job would be having the work area cleaned with no boxes left in a timely manner and before the cutoff."
good,"It was very busy and enjoyable with co-workers and management was fair. The hardest job was making sure the boxes were checked in on time, the enjoyable part of the job was working and getting to know the crew."

good,"Each day you have a set amount of product to ship and sort. Some rewrapping is necessary. I've learned to drive a tug. My co workers were friendly, helpful, and easy to teach when I had to train a new person. The hardest part was to train someone who really didn't care about the job. Most enjoyable was the end of the day."
good,FedEx Ground was a great place to work. Everyone worked as a team. The job was demanding physically sometimes.
good,"FedEx Ground is a good company to work for, the manager's are very eager to help there employees when they show them that they are a hard worker. Continually mode to various positions throughout the warehouse until the individual excels at the designated area."

good,Wonderful Co workers. Management is excellent. Very good training.

The hardest part of my job was sometimes loading the bulk shipments onto my truck because there would be any where from 45 to sometimes over 200 pieces of freight weighing from 5 lbs - 75 lbs or more. I think i enjoyed the mornings best when everyone came in and talked about what they or their kids had done the night before. It was like an extended family.
good,"FedEx was a good work environment.  It was a place that recognized your talents and gave you opportunities for advancement after 18 months of employment.  I had the opportunity to learn about International shipping rules and regulations.  My customers sold anything from milk to diamonds and everything in between."
good,"Driving Cargo to different air crafts. I learned to back-up containers with the tug. It was an impressive skill that made my job more fun and exciting. Management was supportive at times, but in the process of eight years, many managers were changed. Co-workers were fair. Hardest part of the job was to make the cut-off time in order for planes to depart. The most enjoyable part of the job was when we had accomplished the operation on time and made all the cut-offs time accurately."
good,"Customer Service Rep.   Worked with customers shipping both small packages and heavy freight both domestic and internationally."
good,get to terminal and go through packages to figure out the basics of your day then head out and deliver all your packages on your pre determined route and make your daily pickups  at their assigned times
good,"Working at Fed Ex normally consist of about five hours a day, most of the people that work at Fed Ex are really helpful. The managemnt team normally keeps us informed about changes to the company or things that will directly affect us. The hardest part of the job is working in the summer time, simply because we are working in a warehouse and its extremely hot. Everything else about the job is fairly enjoyable. I have learned alot about the effectiveness of team work."

good,working at a fast pace through out my shift loading freight.Loading freight properly and secure not loading the trailer over weight and also   loading in a timely fashion.Management is good to work for.My co workers are easy to work with as well.The hardest part of the job is picking up freight by hand but usually I get and co worker to assist me.The thing in enjoy the most is the pay.
good,"The day was always busy, Everything was subject to the weather. My major responsibility was the couriers. I checked out their equipment, ran their paperwork, and entered their timecards into the computer. I scanned all packages in my office. I helped the customer service agents answer the phone, and locate packages. I learned the necessity of teamwork, and wore my FedEx uniform with pride. I had the best manager ever. The job could be stressful, but the couriers always made me laugh."
good,"I had to pack and store Hazardous packages by their class, and compatibility. By the end of the night I would have to go out to the plane, watch the Hazardous shipping container, sign off with the pilots after an inspection, and lock it down while delivering the correct paperwork. I really enjoyed my job and the people I worked with. I did have to resign thought because of family issues that have now been resolved."

The most enjoyable part of the job is wearing what ever makes u comfortable."
good,"Every morning I would have to call in and see what time I would have to clock in, there are no set schedules at FedEx Express because of the difference in freight coming in every day. On the job my duty was to at least scan and stack 420 packages per hour for about 4 hours a day. The scan rate was stressed by management even though we were short on workers. There was not an even flow of work being distributed amongst my co-workers so some of us took more workload than others, and that would have to be the hardest part of the job.

My typical day at is unloading trucks, breaking jams, pushing non-con on the non-con belt, helping co-workers, and making sure that all the boxes are not on the truck or around the belt before we leave. The management is okay, but they have their days when they want to do certain things and my co-workers are just fun to be around. They the day go by faster and easier. They hardest part of the job is lifting up heavy things and most enjoyable part is coming to work knowing that your co-workers will make your day.  "

Management at this workplace is always on top of things, listening and responding to the employees in a urgent manner, and are always updating the work groups in company changes, procedures, and policies during meetings.

Kay and Brian was awesome and event eh people in the office were nice. They looked out for their employees and took care of use even during a recession.

The hours could be better, but my position is permanently part-time which is a little unfortunate, since I could really use more hours. This job is excellent if you have an additional part time job during the day."
good,Pre-sorts are held before production. We are given a goal for the night/day and are expected to reach it by the end of the sort. I have learned many new positions and have been given many tasks.

good,"A typical day would be to complete a job that a customer has trusted our company to be handle and done correctly. Some documents were confidencial information such as personal or regarding the company they work for. What I've learned are many aspects that could be used in business that could be used for marketing and advertising such as account information, discounts, and software. I've learned to do many things at one time and to be focused at each task, at this job within the company each person must know how to do every job within the store and learn how each machine works to help the customer. Since the company is very corporate and global the center had to adhere to many changes in policies internally and externally. My co-workers are very smart and are very good at what they do. The hardest part of the job is having to tell a customer that we can't do something for them because of legal aspect or time issues.

good,"its ok for now, people are okay at times, managers dont speak to everyone but they run place to succeed its goals"
good,FedEx Freight was one of the most organized and professional places to work.
good,"A typical day at FedEx is the definition of hard work. We learned that if you don't use teamwork, which is essential, not only would we be behind in productions but paychecks as well. The teamwork is okay at the end of the week, but doesn't compensates. There were too many people behind in production and performance that the turnover rate was below mediocre at times . Some days would seem like absolute misery for the average worker. It is important to have a goal while working here, unless you're just looking to get a quick buck, but otherwise stay away. I enjoyed the hardcore experienced. It reconditioned my mind for the worst. It felt as if every day was the hardest day of your life and if you'd stop you'd only be wasting your time. In short, expect to burn some calories!"
good,"The staff is great, and working with customers directly is a plus because there was never a middle man and no loss in the communication circuit.

good,"nice place to work, great friendly and professional environment, management would use more training"
good,"During my time in FedEx, I've learned a lot about productivity and how time management, safety, and proper planning are important in performing the job at the highest level possible. Our day starts of early in the morning with the process of packages. Each driver recieves thier manifest and then carefully scanning each packages to ensure that all packages are accountable and to ensure that the packages are not damage and are ready for delivery. After accountablity, drivers are given a map with given routes to use during delivery. Each packages are labled by numbers which are used in the map to determine what package should be deliverd. Everyone works together in order to get the job done safely and in a timely manner. Thier were times when my co-workers and I would help each other out during delivery to finish in time or if one of us were late. The hardest part of the job would be working with equipment that breaks down while performing our job. In some situation while delivering packages our scanner would malfunction and we would have to drive back to the warehouse to get a new one and this would push back our time for delivery. The best part about the job is meeting different people while delivering packages and working with individuals who are helpful and fun. Overall, I've learned a lot working with FedEx and I enjoyed every moment of my time working with such a productive and safe environment."

This is a great company to work for if you need part time hours and full time benefits. Tuition assistance was also very helpful. I would love to find a full time position with FedEx, I would return immediately!"
good,"There is no such thing as a “typical day” in management. Everyday was a new day with new challenges. My co-worker, other supervisors, had the same goals. We all wanted to be successful. I learned to pick myself up from the worst. I’ve learned to lead by example with hard work. I learned I produce a service not a product and I have to quality to keep providing that service. I learned that my diversity helps others diversity. I learned that I am the only one that can defeat me. I have learned to lead and to provide leadership that is successful. The hardest part of my job is when you have failures that are not in your control. For example weather and construction can cause service failures when you knew that you were so close to success. The most enjoyable part of my job is beating the odds. In conclusion, when you are a supervisor there is no day alike. There are good days and bad days but that is what creates your drive that you will always enjoy."

The hardest part of the job was waking up at 2 in the morning. I enjoyed every aspect of this job from the time I went in to the time I got out."

good,A typical day at work is really simple. I arrive at 2:30 p.m. everyday to get my shift ready.As a leader I have learned to treat others as you want to be treated and you will get a alot of respect in return. Also do not expect your shift to be willing to complete a task that you yourself will not do. This is a key to being a strong leader. I say the hardest part of my job is being away from my family at night. Other than that i like my job.
good,"The Best Company I have had the pleasure to take part in to date..A typical day at work would be interacting with clients,greeting,having a little chat and moving on to the next.I learned that some management are not all the same.,some are very well respected and a previllage to work under..The most enjoyable part of the job we're my co-workers and the Hardest part of the job was leaving them.."
good,"solid work daily, good pay . no benefits , long hours only downside"
good,"Great interactions with customer, got to deliver excellent service to dedicated customers, great management support"
good,"Coming to work loading containers, trucks, and airplanes on a daily basics. Getting to see how great the company is with all the packages lets me know there's committed costumers out there and only ship through Federal Express. My employees and nice easy to talk to and makes the job more enjoyable and the hardest part is when we have a late aircraft and making each costumer gets there package on time"
good,Thrived at maintaining a high call volume of over 100 calls per day contacting current and former
good,A typical work day at Fed is busy but having co-workers and great management the day goes by smooth. Making sure nothing happens to the customers package can sometimes be the hardest part of the day; but knowing that the customer is happy makes that the best part of my job.
good,lots of driving and walking i enjoyed working with the public
good,I enjoyed working there and the people are nice and easy to get along with. Most of the time there is teamwork and the job gets done
good,processed packages for daily delivery. ft position. hardest part was keeping shift staffed.
good,Great company to work for. Wonderful benefits and great learning experiences. Also a good place for networking.
good,"I thoroughly enjoyed working for this company and had an opportunity to relocate to different work sites. I was given ample support from the company with regards to training and technical assistance. However, my original position was discontinued due to nationwide corporate mandate, so my place within the company was downgraded to Customer Service Associate."
good,I've worked here for nearly a year and must say it has been fun but alot of my co workers have fallen into the slump of doing as little work as they can.
good,Great place to learn customer service and knowledge about the printing industry.
good,it was very fun for me to get to work with people everyday i enjoy this kind of work also it helps you get to know people and also works on your strengths and weaknesses
good,"its overall good for beginners like myself,should have more plaaces to work. the security is very good. i recommend anybody to join fedex"
good,"FedEx is a very good company with a great reputation with it's customers. It is a very fast paced job that requires very good time management skills, in order to service the customers and make sure their packages are delivered or picked up on time. If you like working outside independently this is the job for you."
good,At that time I was into alot of things wanting to keep things moving in a upward direction in life. I could not really move up when it was time to advance in life.
good,"FedEx Ground is very efficient at what they do. Always raising the bar, always moving toward the goal set. Very physical job, if you do it well, and very demanding conditions. This job requires a positive mindset, or you won't make it. Would be the perfect job if you could get overtime."
good,Was not really pleased working at FedEx when I did. Management was poor and the job was unfair.
good,Good work area for anyone who can keep up with the pace they set.
good,"Fast pace and room for promotions. If you would like to get promoted quicker, transferring to other facilities help tremendously. Very early morning shifts for most employees."
good,I enjoyed my time at FedEx. I gained a great deal of knowledge and experience working at FedEx. Employee oriented.  Customer oriented.  The Company strives to deliver The Purple Promise to it's customers.
good,This was one of the more manual labor jobs. The pay was good considering the amount of work being done daily. Management and coworkers were very accepting and inclusive.
good,"It's honestly nice working at FedEx. The most enjoyable part is having a chance to grow and try more positions, outside and inside of work. I'm currently learning how to use a forklift and other means to transport materials. The part about working here is good management and interesting spread-out of the employees. No man is an island at that workplace."
good,"It’s great, didn’t work for very long but the benefits made it worth every second there. I got paid really good for no college experience and all I had to do what throw a few boxes around."
good,"FedEx is an amazing source of income. Most of the time it is very gratifying work. There are times when it becomes stressful like during peak season ( which is Christmas time), but with the right manager they can make it smooth sailing and much more manageable."
good,"The people you get to work with are great people, it is a fast paced environment but you still have time to joke around and get to know your co-workers"
good,"FedEx was a wonderful company to work for, however I would have liked to stay longer than seasonal or contracted. The HR department was really well-managed and friendly."
good,"Great company to work for.  Management was extremely positive and encouraging, as were the rest of the office staff.  Ongoing training and safety meetings were implemented throughout the year.  Fellow drivers were always willing to help each other especially during weather that was difficult to handle.  Safety of drivers was always a priority which certainly helped with moral."
good,It involves a lot of heavy lifting and long periods of times by yourself. It is  a fast paced and very physically demanding job.  The managers are very helpful and they want everyone to do their best.
good,It helped me experience more with dealing with the daily issue of work. Learning and being able focus on the task at hand.. it was a very humbling experience.
good,It was a fast paced energetic working environment I enjoyed being apart of. I worked witt a group and it was our job to load airplanes in a timely and orderly fashion
good,"Fedex is a good company to work for, they work with employers on off days needed for family reasons or any other . They pay great wages and offer good benefits."
good,"Coming into work at FedEx, I would always be ready to do the tasks that I was assigned to the best of my ability. At first, I would be moved around the building to different belts or assist with unloading the trucks. Once I found my footing, I would just focus on my work. Management would come by every once in a while and check up on our progress. If it looked like I or the other workers were struggling, he would let us know what we were doing wrong. I learned how to work at a fast pace and evenly stack different packages. I also learned how to spot open and damaged packaging and set them aside. I enjoyed the ability to move around and stay active while on the job."
good,Loved who I worked  with and what I did. Wish it paid more. They have bonuses  but that's not reliable  way to live. It keeps getting  lower. Not real room for growth.
good,"It was a great learning experience with awesome medical, dental and vision benefits.  I had very good team leaders and managers. I met some really good people in the northeast input.  There wasn't a lot of Administrative jobs to bid on. The hardest part of the job for me was the bitter cold nights."
good,Great place to work fast environmental heavy great benefits holidays paid great opportunities to move up nice people to work with but I only work only part time for a couple months.
good,Good company to work for and there is opportunity for growth within the company.  The pay is good and they provide overtime during busy holiday season.
good,"FedEx is a great company to work for. Some areas can be quite challenging, but there is plenty of room and opportunity to move around and move ahead in the organization."
good,"Great company to work for, can be stressful if you dont balance as a manager, great benefits, room to advance if interested. Great pay and retirement options..."
good,"It was a learning experience for a first time job. Taught discipline, time management, and build organizational skills. If you showed the motivation to move up it was easy to get onto new positions. You had your good managers and your bad managers, but you always took home a lesson from them."
good,"It is a good place , good friend good people , lots of work , to hot , really busy busy job , I will to be a mechanical teck or a truck driver for this company"
good,Um lugar onde realmente os funcionários são valorizados e são vistos pelos mais grandes dentro da empresa.
good,FedEx is a great job with many of job opportunities! They are always hiring! They have great a good management team that is willing to work with employee needs
good,"FedEx is an excellent job! Pay is good, and as long as you can deal with people you have a good future with FedEx. Be ready for them to add hours as you go along! And be ready to answer the phone to some people who are mad about their packages not being received on time! There are times I get yelled at and cant act on it. I have to take my time and not argue with the customer. The customer isn't always right. Whoever wrote the saying the customer is always right, has never worked in as a caller rep. Management is fine even tho there times they get to me when adding hours to my schedule that I wasn't ready for. But I get over it. My supervisor is fun and used to be a customer service rep too, so having that be she knows the daily routine very well and understands what my other employees and I go threw on a daily basis. Working at FedEx has really taught me some great character traits. I've learned to deal with people under crazy circumstances."
good,In all for the short time that I worked there very good vibes many Good Vibes good family good work team nothing negative to say I probably would have stayed if I didn't hurt myself or if it wasn't just temporary for me ultimately looking back I really should have rolled up my injury it was legitimate the air system I went down as we were moving big freight but no regrets but my advice to anybody if you do hurt yourself don't second-guess it right it up ultimately still good place to work
good,Working at FedEx allowed me to learn more on how a company works on the inside. It was a great hands on experience always pushing you to the best that you can give.
good,"FedEx is a large corporation, which allows for tasks that are usually geared towards one department to be divided up into several smaller ones. Even though the company is really big, everything is well-organized, the work environment isn't too high-paced, and the other employees are very nice and helpful."
good,"I worked for GP Delivery, great contractor. Very down to earth, good company all the way around. Would definitely work here again. Highly recommend. Great environment."
good,Fast paced environment with great work life balance. The shift are short with an option to work 2 shifts a day. Safety is paramount because the complex is always in motion.
good,"For my experience it was more about the people then the job. I did also love the work it was fast paced,very organized, careful but it's fun and if you like to work out FedEx express is for you."
good,the job isnt to bad but is pretty physically demanding. to load and unload trucks can get overwhelming. the training was kind of short in my opinion(2 weeks but too little to get your speed up to where it needs to be) and i felt unprepared after leaving the training area
good,"Pros: Great training, benefits for part time employees, doesn't take long to get personal, sick and paid vacation time, can only be fired for damaging packages, violent behavior or repeated absenteeism. "
good,"Very hard working and demanding but its a warehouse so i can’t complain. Pay rate was good , It just wasn’t enough hours but thats not whyy i left i didn’t have a reliable babysitter"
good,Its a tough fast paced jpb that is not for everybody. The training is very intense because there is a lot to learn befpre you learn your route and get comfortable where you are
good,I'm trying to get back with company its fast and fun to work in but me i was the best to them i got raising and it just an great experiance working for fed ex
good,"The work is hard and fast paced, but the team is excellent and it's fun working there.  The benefits are unbeatable full benefits even for part time workers."
good,i will go in at 4:00am have the morning brief meeting gp to assied trucks or to the unload an start the day depending on how much work had arive and go home 2 to 4 hrs later
good,"FedEx is a place that doesn't discriminate, and provides opportunities for anyone that can handle the type of work involved. It is not for the weak hearted because it is very labor intensive work."
good,This was a fast paced but very organized job also very physical management new exactly what they were doing putting people together and moving them around in a timely fashion
good,"great company but more hours without having to work two shifts would be nice, and for the type of work and the pace of the work should be compensated with way better pay than 13.00 an hour for only 17.5 hours per week. plus dealing with the extreme elements of outside and dangerous equipment all around the pay needs to go up."
good,The work is easy. Its repetitive which tends to be boring and predictable. The compensation was good and the company benefits are excellent even for part-time but its not an intellect enhancing job
good,"I've learned a great deal and my supervisors are wonderful and very patient. Everything is quota driven, which can be exciting and frustrating at the same time."
good,"Company offered great pay and benefits, and opportunity for advancement. The pace of work was very fast, but the work was fun and not very difficult to do."
good,"Fedex was a good place to work. My only problem was the amount of hours I received. Management was fantastic.Overall, Fedex is a good job opportunity."
good,My job was to separate packages by city and sort by zip code.  I also did the box scanning to make sure  processed bozs were goin to the right delivery truck
good,"I enjoyed working at fedex, managers were pretty great guys and I bonded Well with my co-workers.The job itself was easy some days and unforgiving other days. After about two weeks of scanning, stacking, and packing 1,000 plus boxes ranging from 5 pounds to 250 pounds, things began to get a lot easier for me."
good,Working at fedex is a very relaxed but challenging as well environment. It invloves pateince and determination which i ahve both The hardest part was on busy days having to lift so many packages.
good,I believe FedEx freight is great company to work for. The pay and benefits are excellent for being part time. The driver program is excellent as well. They pay and train you can't ask for more. To be a full time freight handler that is a different story. Not all dock have them. And they are supposed to go to people with seniority. But most of the time it's about who you know not what you know. Unfortunately this has been my experience with it.
good,"The pay was pretty good at FedEx but it was very hot and the managers expected a lot out of you, making you work at extremely fast paces. Overall positive experience."
good,"Decent place to work. Overtime is almost always available. 1.5x Very very fast paced and physical, if you cant hustle dont apply. Simple as that. I say that because i dont want to pull your weight. But ,if youre dedicated, lookiking for job security this is the company for you. They are always looking able bodies."
good,Went in at 2 AM and worked till 8-8:30 AM moving boxes off of belts and putting them into tugger carts. Then drove carts to drop off areas. Offloaded boxes onto rollers. Managers were understanding of problems that arose during shift and dealt with them promptly. Was paid fair for the work being done.
good,"For the most part I found that FedEx was a very good organization. My last manager, however, in my opinuon, did NOT meet the FedEx style of management."
good,This was my main job when I was back from the military. This job is very fast paced and there is a lot of work to do especially during the holidays and summer.
good,"Each day at u go in at FedEx u have to be ready to put in 100% work, it is very fast paced, and could be a very dangerous job if u are not aware at all time and also remembering all of the safey tips given to you throughout your days working there, and like I was told from my manager, ""Never let the number of boxes phase u"", I would say the hardest part of the job is trying to keep up with all of the boxes while also trying to neatly load the trailer. The mangagement there is great there, and they make sure you are taken care of."
good,"Empresa dinâmica, organizada, sabem reconhecer o esforço de cada um, há premiações, um ótimo horário e um diálogo excelente entre chefe e funcionário, a empresa ta de parabéns."
good,"A great workplace for those that like to work within a fun, diverse and fast paced environment.  Have had many opportunities to develop my skills and i am appreciated by my coworkers."
good,Very high pace on forklift need to unload and load freight with accuracy it is very challenging but pays wells at the end of the day you feel that you accomplished your goals .
good,"FedEx is a job where they do not have layoffs, its a job where you can grow, the job security is great. They have all shifts available to you, so its easy to maintain your work and life balance."
good,"I put in looking days but,  the money is great. I could take less work if I wanted. Came from previous jobs on a route,  this is almost to easy. Got a real good contractor"
good,Our jobs for the day are given at the morning meeting. Therefore everyone knows what they are doing. Managers are understanding and try to make sure every one is doing good.
good,"FedEx Freight is an good job with great pay and benefits, however it can be stressful at times and a bit overwhelming. The job is not difficult, but you definitely need to remain prompt and consistent. Moving freight around all day with a forklift may sound easy, but there is more to it. Attention to detail is crucial and you are required to run 6 bills per hour. Management is very strict and they have their eyes open, you don't want to get called back for corrective errors. Bottom line, move at a consistent rate, pay attention and dress accordingly to weather as you are exposed to the elements in the dock area."
good,"This job is NOT for everyone. This job requires you to be organized, prompt, patient, and detail oriented. I've work for this company for almost a year and a half. They have provided me the opportunity to better myself and promote to a management position while I was in college. The benefits on top of the pay is good for someone who is trying to start their career."
good,*A typical day is sometimes very hectic.
good,"I was here temporary and it is a great company to work for you can move up easily depends on your work performance etc..."
good,The pay is pretty fair for the work you do. depending on the area you're in it can get cold or hot depending on the season. Advancement is pretty easy so long as you put in the work. This work place is best when more geared toward team work but not always necessary.
good,"Unloading and loading trailers with boxes or packages up to 120lb, repacking opened or damaged packages. Communicating with management on the next trailer and flow of packages."
good,Fed Ex was like a boot camp with pay as it kept you fit and alert. It was fast paced and you never had to look over your back as the packages were coming fast and furious.
good,Great benefits and work life balance. They train you for about 6-8 weeks for your job so you feel confident to do the job you apply for. Overall an enjoyable job.
good,Good job but can be very stressful especially around Christmas holidays. Excellent benefits.  Excellent pay. Depending on job it can be physically hard.
good,"Easiest warehouse to work at, management is great and scheduling is very flex able. Discounts r great and co workers r fun as well. Short hours sometimes but when peak comes there is a lot of extra pay being handed out!"
good,"Fast paced environment with great people to work with.  Work life balance is a challenge.  Great pay and benefits.  Good health care, life insurance, and bonuses."
good,"A typical day at work began with package handling, sorting and delivery prep. I learned to ramp up my mind and body to get the most out of every minute"
good,It’s a great company to work for but like every other company it has its flaws. Management tree could always use some more structure. The culture is great between everyone mostly. Great people to be around. Makes you feel like a family.
good,"The job was great. Got paid well, worked with great people. I'm a family man so I was very disappointed that the job consumed my time and did not get overtime pay. Your entire day is the job hardly any time to stop for lunch and no time to spend with family at the end of the day."
good,"Is a good company with a great paid and benefits but I was just season worker not for the company but it is a good place to grow and keep the goods."
good,I loved being independent and had no worries about handling the business I needed to take care of. I also loved goin from place to place and metting different people on a daily
good,"Empresa com ótima estrutura, com supervisão de qualidade, ambiente agradável."
good,"The job i was doing was laborer work and have to empty a 40 feet container and by the time you off, you have empty 4-6 container. With all my degree hard."
good,Fedx is a great part time job if you have a full time day job.  Fedx have great benefits for their part time employees. Fedx offer on the job training with pay.
good,"Benefit package is great. The expect salary employees to stay too long though. Pay is based on a 50 hour work week, have worked 80 hour weeks no problem. Sometime get stuck on overnights as a supervisor too"
good,Fast-paced work environment with opportunity to advance if you work hard.  The managers were great and really cared about the employees.  Enjoyable experience overall
good,"Typical day is busy with you partnering with the management team to  provide them with their staffing needs. You go through the necessary steps to eventually select potential candiates to fill the manager's staffing needs.  After the managers make their selection, you continue the hiring process by assisting them with orientation and any other resources needed.  Working for FedEx provides you with medical/health benefits, 401K, paid vacation, and other benefits.  There is room for advancement and tuition reimbursement along with other perks. It's a great company to work for and unfortunately, some of the managers forget who the CEO of the company is and can act as if they are the CEO."
good,I would recommend FedEx to anyone who is motivated to grow this company will guide you in the direction. The training is amazing compared to other companies. They are a flag ship company.
good,"Very beneficial to supplement income"
good,Very physical place to work a lot of movement and lifting. Co-workers and management are great! Train you on how to forklift if interested and it is easy to move up at FedEx in your career working there.
good,"Just about everyone that I've come in contact with has been relaxed and cool, nice place to work, and I love the store that they have every Friday. Opportunities for career growth is definitely there."
good,"Good place to work. all the people are friendly. Supervisors and managers are always open to your opinion and to help you out. its my first days as a driver and it is a good experience. you really need to stay on your toes and be very attentive to your surroundings while driving, and be at a fast pace while delivering."
good,"I was employed by a third person who have a contract with FedEx.the way I saw things yes FedEx is a big and developing company,all the workers are being call to a normal weekly meeting for feedback an problem solving"
good,"From the time I've been here, I've had no problems with most coworkers. Well, maybe there is a select few. Other than that, I would recommend the job to anyone who is looking to get hired as soon as possible. Peak season is right around the corner too"
good,"I worked as a seasonal help, and was contracted through a work agency. I enjoyed the job and it was an easy 1000 before Christmas. I worked and was capable of nearly everything the full time worker do."
good,its a very fast paced job that allows a individual to work along side others to collectively achieve the goal of the day in a safe secure manner as well as successfully doing a outstanding job that will allow the company to grow thus making it enjoyable to be a part of something good
good,"Great company, friendly environment, good benefits, learn a lot everyday, global presence, management is good in mostly all marketing areas. You will need to deal with the typical problems of big companies processes and bureaucracy but nothing new there."
good,"It is possible for those who wish to advance in the company to do so. The community there is strong, with group summary of what is expected for the day at the beginning of every shift. Hardest part of the job is lifting heavy packages. The management is extremely understanding of any issues you may have, and encourage you to come forward if there are any problems.  Overall a great but hard job."
good,"Working at an airport location was fun. Being able to learn about planes, the certain types of planes worked on. Depending on position it could be stressful or relaxed depending on the time crunches. "
good,"I would come come to work grab a radio, read the inbound walk back to the lanes and send the team to different locations to start the shift and start loading the trucks as i walked back and fourth to help employees so there lane wouldnt jam up if so i would fix them ,  Then hardest part was running back nand fourth to keep each lane from jamming , witch made me feel good about helping others so we could hit high number along with working in inductions"
good,"Its a good place to work. I have noticed though over the years of working there that people are getting more lazy. "
good,It’s a great place to work friendly people and such but the management could use a little work other than that I love my job and it’s an awesome place to be
good,I worked fedex part time as a college student. I received great pay and decent hours for what I needed to balance my schooling and work. The management their is fair and respectful. A decent work environment but definitely be prepared for the weather as you are working on a dock.
good,Opportunity for advancement is there if you work for it. Great Company to work for! Leader in the Freight industry. Competitive pay and benefits and continuously looking for ways to improve as a company for the industry as well as for their employees.
good,it was very humble relax and we also had snacking  water or juice. we can have t it but we ztill had to work alot of shipment  was coming  in somedays it would be so hected until we had to go get help from some the people  on the other side i like fed ex it keep me busy
good,Empresa de médio porte no mercado de transporte e logística mas ambiente de trabalho muito bom
good,"Extremely fast paced and you will definitely lose weight by doing over 20,000 steps everyday Monday thru Friday and the option to work Saturdays. tough stuff"
good,"The people I work with are great and helpful.The pay is fair. However, it is a part time position, fast pace and very labor intensive. There are no breaks unless you work over five hours. They expect you to be able to stay later almost daily, even if you have another job. You may be obligated to come in on your day off with very little notice."
good,The most part of this job I've enjoyed is Inventory Control. This is a face paced environment and very friendliest employees/teammates I've ever worked with.
good,Operations is pretty easy going at FEDEX everything is very easy to learn. But that's every job when you have the right trainer. Pay is good however in terms of moving up its all who you know  and if the manager favors you
good,"A typical day at would FedEx is a very fast day, i learned to pace yourself throughout the day.  The work space culture at FedEx is great the environment is a friendly environment everyone works together to get the job done."
good,Working at FTN was busy and there was a work place culture there was plenty of work which made the day go by fast.  Co workers were helpful to one another.   The hardest part of the job was getting it done timely and learning the various systems that employees had to know.
good,"Great coworkers easy to deal with but can be demanding on your eyes and stress level."
good,Would work there again  just  Make sure you're always watching  The clocks.  Keep track of everything  Good or   Bad  Keep your own records  And   Make sure you take your lunches on  Time
good,"it was fast paced, worked on a great team but just didn't get the hours I needed to pay my bills. The manager was great. You would definitely be tired when you got done working."
good,Great culture....putting people first followed by service and profits....is observed regularly.  There are constant attempts to put people and family over work.  Managers encourage team members to develop and further their careers.
good,I enjoyed working for FedEx Freight. As long as you come to work with a good attitude then you should have no issues. Decent management. I had no issues with any managers.
good,"FedEx definitely encourages career advancement and promoting within, but you end up with managers who are not skilled in the products/projects they are managing."
good,Me gustaba mucho trabajar en fedex. Es una empresa que se preocupa por sus empleados
good,"The overall environment is fast paced and involves significant amounts of running, lifting, and pushing. If you're an athletic person that doesn't mind getting paid to run around and drop parcels off and pick up hundreds of boxes at scheduled times than this is the job for you!"
good,Everyday we organize and ship packages. Managers are very cooperative and understanding. Gives higher chance at extra hours with fair sign up program. A lot of new opportunities for new jobs in the hub. Workers are prioritized.
good,It is a good part time job with benefits. They work with the hours and school. There is advancement if you want it after being part time or working there long enough and a job opens up.
good,"Great place to work,fun co-workers,cool managers,decent pay,great benefits.Pay could be a little better.More hours definitely wouldn't hurt.Overall it's a plus working at FedEx."
good,"If you're looking to climb in a retail environment FedEx Office is a great place to do so. You receive a TON of training so be prepared to cram info. "
good,This company had great benefits for the employees.  They are very much centered on customer service which is the purple promise.  The turnover at this company is not high.
good,This was one on the best jobs ive had the work was okay and the other employees were always around if you had a question which made the day go by faster
good,"FedEx is a fast paced environment that will make you move for the entirety of your shifts, you will be required to sit, stand and move very fast at all times so that tasks may be completed. Short hours with working with numerous packages to fill trucks in the alotted time."
good,"13 anos de vida dedicados com muita alegria e satisfação à esta empresa que colocava seus funcionários em primeiro lugar. Através desta ideologia éramos fiéis ao seu desenvolvimento e vestíamos a ""camisa"". Salário compatível com a função desempenhada, ambiente amistoso, com metas e monitoramento de desempenho adequados. Infelizmente a empresa comprou uma empresa nacional para cobrir o segmento doméstico e todos os benefícios tiveram que ser nivelados junto a empresa nacional. Alta demanda de saída de funcionários com PDV, demissão voluntária por estarem de certa forma contrariando princípios da CLT."
good,"Salary, benefits and opportunity for advancement are terrific. Management needs improvement to lessen the obvious favoritism that takes place, but is denied. "
good,log into my scanner in the truck and start scanning packages for the day. Also label each package and load them according to the stop until there's no more. Deliver each package by sequence number til the last package is delivered.
good,Not a bad place to work for part-time with benefits. Plus you get to learn different jobs meet different people each and every day I learned a lot about FedEx itself.
good,Just like other big corp. FedEx is pretty much controlled environment and your typical day at work is very routined. Managements are good and benfits matched most of my needs.
good,"over all a good place to work, short staffed a lot, people quit a lot, the work is hard and fast pace, and unless you been there over 10 years the pay could be better considering you have to work twice as hard a lot because of short staffing, but you get the opportunity to learn many different skills and the option to transfer to different departments for advancement."
good,It was a great job while it lasted. People would do their jobs and start to sing or make jokes with everyone so time would pass quickly. We would converse about our day and how it was. I learned about scanning the packages and putting them in their right location. In general you could go in there and come out with at least a friend.
good,"one of the prestigious brand with worldwide spread and earned a customer and employee satisfaction."
good,"I worked outside over night and i met a lot of very nice people. The work itself wasn't ""hard"" but what made it hard for me was the climate. i started in September and it was warm some nights but the later months started getting cold and the pouring down rain was incredibly difficult to work in. so it didn't matter if it were 12 degrees, ice and snow, or monsoon-- you still are required to come in. fedex has a customer promise to fulfill and it is our job. i do not recommend for the older crowd or anyone who is not ready to physically move your body because it is fast-paced and high demand.. but there is excitement in it. also incredible benefits and pay for the amount of experience/education needed (which was next to nothing)"
good,This Job is for the young at heart whos willing to learn. Lots of mental and physical stress. Production work is always challenging. Pay is pretty good.
good,"For what I do at FedEx, the money is decent. The drawback is that hours are based on volume.  Just because you have a Full-time position doesn't mean you get full-time hours."
good,"It was an ok job. steady and consistent. There is not a lot of room for advancement on the driver side, but lots of opportunity in the warehouse. The People are great. Management will always work with you, regarding anything. No benefits/healthcare, which is a bummer, considering it's a driving job. All-in-all,  its a very good job. Just get ready physically."
good,"Good place to work but the downside to advancement is you have to really stay on the managers good side, if you don't you're not gonna make it anywhere."
good,"FedEx is a productive and fun work place, just the amount of hours you get a week as a package handler is not enough to get a good consistent paycheck"
good,"Long hours, but packed with action to past the time."
good,"Some of the things I learned at FedEx were unloading and loading trucks. The management at FedEx were decent at doing their jobs and making it a productive competitive and fun workplace. They made it a productive and competitive workplace because they would make sure the truck was unloaded and loaded on time,and  they motivated us to get the job done. Fed ex was a fun workplace because everyone got a long for the most part and everyone was nice and friendly."
good,The only thing keeping me from leaving is how great this job is. Show up. Pre-load trucks for drivers. have fun. Go home. I wished that they started at ful-ltime instead of part-time
good,Worked 8 years on 3rd shift. enjoyed the outdoor work. help me learn a lot of day to day job skills. demanding on the body at times but great exercise.
good,The company dont have any medical insurance dont have sick leave  No set time that you get off no overtime they pay you by the packages. The company really does need to pay you more
good,"Great job, especially for part time. Benefits are almost identical to full time employees. Downside is paying your dues with regard to seniority. It's hard to get vacation at premium times when bidding against senior employees. Not a job for crybabies or people with a lot of drama and are afraid to work."
good,"FedEx is a very professional and efficient company. The training was extremely thorough and prepared me completely for the duty and responsibilities of my job position. A typical day at work included clocking in and taking part in a team meeting where the employees, as a group, were informed of our workplace positions for that particular shift. All questions were answered by management prior to each shift and any potential discrepancies handled immediately. Once on shift, my position as a material handler in the warehouse was assumed, normally transferring boxes along the conveyor belt to its appropriate destination safely, adhering to the guidelines provided by the company. The workplace culture was very open and friendly while maintaining the necessary quick paced professionalism to get the job done effectively. The most difficult part of the job were the night shift hours. Aside from that, it was a very fulfilling experience that I would recommend to anyone geared toward that type of workplace environment."
good,Very great place to work. Pay and benefits are great. You work on a dock with no doors and the weather can be brutal. But the compensation is very suitable.
good,Working at FedEx was a second job just to help save money to move out. It was fast paced but not overly hard on the body. They run shorter shifts so it makes for a perfect second or part time job.
good,"Not a bad place can't really complain."
good,I would  recommend FedEx because of the benefits and advance opportunities. I like the fact the management to got involved with the employees and every morning before work we had a warm up meeting and objective of what the goal was for the day.
good,Good balance of Personal and work life. Friendly management and supervisors and lead. Nice team to work with. Got opportunity to learn new technologies.
good,FedEx is a very organized and great place to work. They take care of their employees well. They offer great insurance and healthcare benefits even to part-time employees.
good,"Great company to work for. Great benefits, room for advancement, great opportunity to learn to become a driver, room to attend school and company reimbursement."
good,"The job was good for entry level people. If you are looking to get experience at a first job, FedEx is where it is at. Comprehensive training and on the job hands on, you learn a lot about different types of industries."
good,"Good company with a fast pace environment. During the peek season it gets hectic, so a lot is ask to make commitment and service. The workplace culture is above average."
good,It's a pretty good job. If you know the right people it could be can greay. Once you get used to the work it's not that bad. You get good discounts and flexible hours
good,Customer service excellence expected from every position. A fast paced teamwork oriented job. Physically challenging while focusing on safety both driving and in the warehouse.
good,"very face paced"
good,"Been there over a year and a half, Fast paced,for the most part good teamwork management fairly good, advancement slow sometimes.The only downside is working in cold weather and high winds."
good,"Very fast paced but time goes quickly, and you have to do some heavy lifting occasionally, and don't be late or tardy. You can apply for other positions like every 90 days or so, and your benefits kick in after 60 days."
good,"Demanding environment, very fast paced and no room for error. Working conditions were harsh with little to no breaks in between. Good management. Paid time off and flexible hours. Learned a lot of different skills there, loading and unloading packages off trucks in a timely manner, meeting goals and practicing warehouse safety."
good,Fast pace work as soon as you come in. Be ready to work. Learned to make sure costumers packages ready to go on time. Management was pretty effective and motivating. Safe working environment. Hard physical work for the most part. The learning experience was very good.
good,Great place to work for a part time position.  The job keeps you in motion and in shape.  People and management were easy to get along with.  There was a lot of communication and information that made it easy to see how your position affected the company.
good,"Direct freight distribution"
good,I loved my position and the advancement is quick if you take the initiative. There's always work and extra work. I was injured in  motor vehicle accident which ended my career there. I'm missing it everyday.
good,I enjoyed my time at Fedex. I had the best coworkers. Very closeknit family like atmosphere. I enjoyed providing the best customer service to the customers.
good,"* A typical work day depended on the time of year. From about May - August was our busy season. I was part-time so I had to be cautious about how many hours I was averaging. "
good,"Overall working at FedEx has been a good experience. It is a fast paced environment, even at smaller centers you can get busy. I have had the opportunity to be placed in larger and smaller facilities and took on many different rolls. I like the job and the pace doesn't bother you after awhile. However my pay is lower than desired. I've been promoted twice and have worked here for awhile but still don't get paid that much."
good,"Very professional company. Top US management is very technology driven, for all the aspects of productivity measuring they have a tool. Which makes things easy for manager to judge the candidates productivity....extremely amazing company."
good,rushing around on forklift loading and unloading trucks I learn how to load the truck properly and how to use the rack system and airbags as well management was good the culture was the diverse hardest part was doing hot loads most enjoyable part was making new friends and working with staff
good,"Very fast paced and physically demanding, good people, always there to help out if one is behind. Good about providing drinks to stay hydrated. Provide free lunches."
good,"Working at fedex was fun but,the little hours were horrible. i would still be there if i didnt get hit in the head with two heavy boxes. and i would ask for longer hours."
good,some days will be heavy day and some days will be light days. the hardest part of the job was fast paced environment while doing multitask. but i still manage to get it done inside and outside of the  office.
good,Working at fedex was not only fast paced and relaxed  but the people were also . It was a very hands on job that required lots of physical labor . A typical day at fedex will leave you exhausted but ready to come in the next day ! Really a fun place to be and involve yourself around people that want to see you success .
good,"Fast Pace for 2 to 3 hours a day, average work week is 12 and half hours. You work as a team where you go working on the belt, unloading the trailers. you work as if you were one body"
good,You clock in load your truck and do your route. You had to make sure you delivered priority packages first on time and at a certain speed. the management only bother you when you're not keeping up with stops per hour or when priority packages aren't delivered on time. Unless told otherwise your job is usually the same every day. you work independently in your truck which is probably the best part along with interacting with the customers and building relationships with them. The hardest part of the job is dealing with the weather. sometimes its cold sometimes its hot. you rarely get a perfect day.
good,On a typical day at work. You would get there get searched by security clock in ans get straight to work pretty much after that its an easy paced work day. Good employs manger amd business.
good,"I worked a backbreaking 4 hours a day lifting boxes, but them hours werent enough to benefit and save off of. My checks i was earning from the company did only a little bit of help."
good,"A typical work day at FedEx Express is very fast paced. They are a great company to work for. They are willing to train in any and all positions. The hardest part of the job is getting used to a graveyard shift.   Management is very easy to work with as they are professional but also treat employees with kindness and respect. The most enjoyable part of the job is that you can speak to your superiors in a friendly atmosphere. At which they are there to listen and help in any and all situations. You can also trust to speak with them, and know that your conversations are kept confidential."
good,Just make the work equal the work pace was fast depending what tower you was in the management was ok they was understanding the culture was mixed the hardest part was them not being equal
good,FedEx Services provides IT support for FedEx Ground. The org is transforming to a modern technology/development methodology. Great opportunities and personal growth. Absolutely one of the best companies in the world to be part of.
good,Good pay with super benefits. Stressful at times but gets easier with time. A chance to make good money ina fast paced environment. A opportunity to do more than just drive or work the docks. Can advance into manger and supervisor positions.
good,"I don't know about other locations but the one I work at is very fast paced. It usually takes all my energy just to keep up. We also have more rules than any other location I've heard of, I think it's actually a bit ridiculous how easily you could get in trouble!"
good,"Great position if you enjoy a fast paced, challenging job.  Pay and benefits were competitive even for part time employees.  Good paid time off and sick day policy.  Over-time was always readily available."
good,"Fun workplace, lots of people, only part time, not alot of hours, good place to meet alot of new people, easy job, hot in summer, cold in winter, easy to advance"
good,Fedex was a very casual company to work for.  The culture was excellent.  They have lots of training about how you can improve on your own mood and how to do it.  Also they have a lot of compensation and benefits other than health.
good,"Fedex isn't the easiest company to work for but it a good company to work for, team work is the key to a successful business. Purple promise is always our goal."
good,"I loved working for FedEx got to travel and learn different approaches to work with different types of 50 plus truck drivers.  Not everyday was the same. That made it nice that the day may be different   I had to help with breakdowns, schedules, and accidents"
good,"I love my job. I started as a handler making $12.50 an hour and have advanced through the company in my 4 years to a ramp agent at $18 an hour. FedEx offers $5,000 a year in tuition reimbursement! It is fast paced and you will get your exercise!"
good,"I enjoyed working at fed ex. I didn't get the hours I wanted, but I enjoyed the time that I was there. The company has a reputation of high wages, and good benefits. I saw a lot of growth within the company."
good,"no meu primeiro dia, foi bem complicado entender a minha função na empresa, mas foi só uma questão de tempo se acostumar com a rotina e os afazeres dentro do meu setor, claro que tive bastante auxilio como oque deveria fazer, a direção/gerencia se postaram bastante competentes com meus ensinamentos e dos demais aprendizes, não digo a parte mais difícil do trabalho, e sim a que deve se ter mais paciência por quê tive um bom desempenho em me adaptar a empresa, e em questão do que foi mais agradável, bom toda a experiencia e os curso de auxiliar de  logística que obtive."
good,"Some days are better than others. It can be stressful one day and relaxed the next. Overall its a good job to have, especially if you don't like sitting still."
good,"Excellent company to work for. Great people good atmosphere. You need to hump to get the job done but the day goes by quickly, and most the day is spent on your own with little supervision."
good,"To note, I haven't worked that many jobs in my lifetime but this by far is the best one. For a part time job, the pay is definitely better than the majority of other available jobs in my area. And this job has amazing benefits. The work really isn't that bad either, even though it can get a bit stressful at times. But that could be said for a lot of jobs. So overall, this is definitely I would recommend."
good,I monitor fedex alarms and manage my accounts daily. The most enjoyable part of the job is my co-workers that I work with are very helpful and we make each other laugh.
good,"Love the job, great pay. But you live next to your phone Monday thou Friday to wait to be called into work. Benefits are great and paid weekly is nice."
good,i worked night shift so there is a whole different atmosphere to it. The teams are all separate but all work together really well. it is very structured yet fun to go to work.
good,As a FedEx Material Handler you get to unload and load full containers of packages at different openings of the airplane. There are a lot of different positions around the plane one employee could be doing.
good,"Good part time job to work for. Average 4 hours a day. Work hard lifting, sorting, and loading trucks.  Pay was good. Raises were quick. Benefits after you work so many hours with company even a part time."
good,Diverse group of different ethical and cultural backgrounds. Great place for longevity and career advancement. Full and part time opportunities available with great pay.
good,"You get what you give. Work hard and things come easy. Great company to work for. Overall good management, good people, and everyone is easy to talk to. Lots of room for advancement."
good,Friendly environment which makes me and my workmates bonds easily . Safety is always our top priority which makes everyone feel safe working in the warehouse.
good,The day usually starts very early in the morning and start by a meeting and stretching. Then one crew unloads trailers and another loads trucks. The culture is dependent on the people but the managers were a lot of fun. The hardest part of the job is learning to get up very early.
good,"Its a good place to work if you're looking for a job that pays you to work out, in a way. However, at times management will take advantage of  hard workers. Be expected to work alone most of the time, and lift heavy object weighing from 10 lbs - 150 lbs."
good,"My experience with Fedex was extremely positive. I worked full time which involved two shifts. A mid day shift typically 11am-4pm, and a night shift that was from 6pm=10pm. Giving me an hour break in between. Unloading Packages in that environment is not for everyone. However, if you can adjust to the hot/cold it is manageable. As you are lifting packages ranging from under 5 lbs. to 200lbs. you must utilize team lifting. Working smart and  building relationships is key to success. Management can be a bit harsh  at times, pushing employees to reach their goals. My only complaint was several verbal altercations while working. Managers cursing at senior citizens and  excessive language. I am about building positive workplace relationships, There are many hard working, good people at Fedex.The hardest part about working at Fedex, is the labor involved. As you are lifting heavy packages for several hours, adjustment can be difficult. The most enjoyable part of the job, were the people. Building strong team relationships and gaining positive life skills."
good,Working for FedEx is easy and rewarding work. My only complaint would be that the working conditions are not ideal. You work outside in the hot/cold you are at the mercy of the elements.
good,"My position was shipping and handling assistant. it was time to work this for me I really like.i used to different thing at this company "
good,Good place to work. Always busy and have things to do. You drive for independent contractors. Pay is decent and lots of driving. If you get s good group of guys its a lot of fun.
good,"One a typical work day I drive a tug and handle pakadges and make sure thay get to the customer on time. The type of equipement that I use are tugs and fork trucks. the hardest part of the job is the manual laber but even then that is manageable to me."
good,Great place to start and has big time potential.  Can move anywhere in the Country and keep moving up in the ranks. Little incentives here and there to motivate you to do your job right and I like that.
good,"I love my job its an independent job, you are put out in the field to work by yourself delivering/pick up driver. The job can get heavy though, you have to be able to lift 75lbs on your own of course if you need help you're allowed to ask for. theres no holidays off cause its the busiest time"
good,"Good place to work at and the benefits you can't beat. The pay is good too, especially during peak season. The management is very professional and I had a good time working with my team players, made work feel like not work."
good,"-Go to the Fedex depot at 7"
good,My working experience here has been great.  Th atmosphere is very relaxing. Each one is respected by different culture.  My typical day at work was to Input of vessel manifest information into computerized system and complete invoices in the computer system by adding all pertaining charges without mistakes.
good,great company to work for. but they dont really care about there employees like they do there packages. there vehicles are very out dated like there computers and powerpads
good,I was working outside so it was cold but I enjoyed the job it wasn't bad or anything good job. If I was smarter to dress warm I would of love the job 100% of the time.
good,"This is a great company to work for. Great benefits, great security, but there is very limited growth opportunity. I moved to Rochester from La Crosse just to get a full time position."
good,"Werken bij FedEx  geeft voldoening vanwege de fijne gezellige werksfeer. Hele goede samenwerking met alle collega's en waardering voor je extra inzet."
good,Great place to work and very stable. The average person at FedEx has been working there for over 20 years.  They start out at an entry level job then progress to senior level jobs.  The culture is set to succeed and is the most valuable part of FedEx.
good,You will earn every dollar on your check. the work was strenuos at times. I dealt with Aviation side of operations. Early morning hours and very slow advancement opportunities. great benefits and good pay
good,"I would get there and pick up my personal scanner to start the day. i would just unload and load boxes into the trucks provided. "
good,Quando entrei não empresa não sabia quase nada sobre logistica com o passar dos meses fui me capacitando ganhei promoção para operador de empilhadeira e muita experiência
good,Blessed to be associated with a good company such as FedEx. It's a good stable company that offers job stability and benefits. It takes a lot of focus and rule keeping.
good,My time working at Fed-ex was an learning experience I've attained from the company over the expand of 2016. I've learned the ability to  be profession on the job force and to do my job at hand.
good,"* load and unload 20-53 foot trailers "
good,"It's a very intensely physical job, but it keeps me in shape, I scan boxes that the unloader puts on the belts, we are required to scan at least 1000 packages an hour, and keep our area free of debris, and also load packages and bags on to the IC  belt for heavier items."
good,"The hours for a seasonal package handler are rough (ie 2am shifts)"
good,Its a good job with good benefits. I believe that if you work here you should deniftly have a flexible schedule and I think you should defintly have a second job
good,"As usual, that job is very fast pace and I really enjoyed it! I am very fit and in shape, thank to Fed Ex. I have been working here for almost two years now. The management is really cool and flexible, only if you're their favorite worker. The hardest part of this job is unloading all those heaviest big packages out of the trailers, but I often get an assistance. Some co-workers can be friendly and really fun to work with."
good,Day to day operations are handled well by management.  Management is fair and willing to work around school schedules and other things that come up.  Strong work ethic with a willingness to get work done but a friendly atmosphere.
good,Clock in and get a scanner go to your assigned trucks that you load every night. Wait for boxes to come down the conveyor belt and scan each box into your truck. Using the vision number place on the apporiate shelve or apporiate vision number located on the floor.
good,A typical day at work i would show up in the evening to check in and start unloading trucks. While adapting to companies environment i learned how to lift the right way and gain skills in time effort. My co-workers were just as busy as i was throw out the hours unloading and learning basic skills while doing it. the hardest part of the job was finishing up trucks while cleaning area.the most enjoyable part of the job was working together to accomplish goals and helping the business grow.
good,It is my job first and foremost to ensure the safety of the equipment both tugs and aircraft used to complete the task of off load and on load of packages onto and off of the aircraft.  When the safety is the priority then accomplishing the task at hand becomes easier.  Working together as a team is paramount both the safety and completion of tasks.
good,Great food. Work environment isn't that great. The job itself is very fun and very busy. Great benefits. Really great for someone looking for a part time job/position.
good,Really requires lots of physical demand. You are lifting boxes non stop for 4-6 hours that vary in weights from 1lbs.-150lbs.
good,FedEx is a fantastic company to work for ! I looked forward to going to work everyday. It was a rewarding job and I was always satisfied whenever I went to work.
good,this place is a good work environment it just takes a while to get used to because there are a lot of people that don't speak any English.
good,"Responsible for the physical loading, unloading and/or sorting of packages by hand, including lifting, pushing, pulling, carrying and placing, in a safe and efficient manner. The job is very demanding. I've learned multiple locations of the building with roles of my title. Management is good for the most part. Co-workers are good, and normally friendly. The physical demand and pace can be the hardest part of the job. I enjoy the job in general."
good,"Nice place to work, people are nice, always helpful. benefits are great. not so good hours. Depending on what department can be very fast paced."
good,"Very rewarding job, fast paced. If you like to work hard and earn a decent living this is the place to work at. Love how fast you can move up well depending on management."
good,"Great place to work three years ago, but since then upper management has failed to discipline dock management. Dock management has a lack of drive, which has resulted in a lack of drive in dockworkers. There is no accountability for actions which has created a sense of carelessness in dockworkers. Management has shown that you can get away with just about anything and not suffer consequences, whether it be a dockworker or supervisor. Therefore those individuals like myself that do their job and show potential are often overshadowed by the mistakes of others and put in the same light as everyone else.However, there is great pay, benefits, and if run correctly, it is an extremely fulfilling place to work. But when there is one piece of the puzzle missing, the operation cannot run successfully."
good,"I loved the plant style job, show me 1 time let me go and it will get done im a very fast learner and a hard worker. Loved the people i worked with!!!"
good,"Fedex is a great company to work for. Some days and tasks can be tough and even confusing in the beginning, but all of your co-workers and managers have been in that place too and can assist you as you learn. Everything usually runs like clockwork, meeting times, deliveries/pick ups, belt start/stop times, but there is still enough room for you to develop your own personal routines for efficiency."
good,"Working for FedEx was a fantastic way to learn a new city. I found the people I was working with in Victoria British Columbia, were a fantastic crew and very supportive when help was needed. I highly recommend working for the Victoria branch if the opportunity was available."
good,"A great place to work, but due to the way management works some people are required to pick up the slack of those who don't work hard enough. A typical day at work is pretty straight forward. We unload and load freight into trailers safely and without damaging the freight at our best ability. The hardest part of the job is the physical demand and the amount of freight we need to run, however it is a great job to stay active and learn how to push through difficult times like peak season and holidays."
good,"Relay fedex is very good flat form for employes further growths and comany giving same value for employ growth and as well as company growth."
good,Great Place to work.  From the CEO down to the entry level employee there is concern for the work life balance.  I still feel like it is a small company even though we are an employer of 400 thousand people.
good,A typical day very busy and fast pace environment. engaging with co- workers that are team players. I Learned how to operate a lot computer systems. The hardest part of the Job was not being able to please all customers. the most enjoyable part of the job was pleasing my customers and talking with customers and co workers across the globe.
good,Infelizmente decisões sobre desligamento não levam em conta a avaliação de desempenho nem a opinião da gerencia direta
good,A typical day of work at fedex could be either easy or back breaking but always rewarding. It is a very professional institution and the only con would be the fact that the job is only part time.
good,"Overall this is a great place to get started in the work force.  The company is filled with employees who have worked there longer than a year.  It was ultimately to demanding of my body and the stress of the physical labor was too much.  A variety of people work at FedEx, mostly a younger crowd, 20's and 30's."
good,"learned  a lot, i had a great manager and he made it easy to balance my work life and be home with my 2 kids during the day. i really loved working there."
good,"It was a really nice job, where I was able to take care of my family and provide for them. The pay and benefits were really well. The staff was pretty good and the co-workers were also really great to work with. The hardest part of the job was getting up in the early hours of the morning and working outside in the heat or the cold."
good,"This was by far my favourite job, the guy's that work in the aircraft hub where great. a typical day was super busy with large amounts of freight passing through so lot of physical work and processing work."
good,"Working at FedEx was pretty fun. I practically got paid to work out! The hours could wear on you though. My typical day started off at work at around 3 am and I usually worked until 8 am, or however late was needed, due to late freight arriving. And we worked in all weather such as rain or snow. I learned the value of completing a job at 100% on a very slim time frame. Our work helped to get packages and important letters out to everyone in a timely manner, or even at a specific time."
good,"FedEx freight is a high paying job in a fast pace environment. The company is striving to improve management. The way they engage in conversation with people needs to change, as far as speaking down to employees and also making people feel as though they care when they really do not."
good,"I've working at FedEx for over 6 months. It is an overall good place to work, the pay is fairly, co-workers are nice, managers are knowledgeable and caring. The one biggest problem anyone would tell you is the work/life balance. Sometimes you are asked to come in as early as 5 am and sometimes 6:30 but the problem is for part-timers, you don't get enough working hours in one week. Unless you're lucky, you barely work 20 hours/week which really sucks because the pay/hr. is pretty generous. Sometimes you work 2 hours/day yes..... 2/hrs. and if you want more hours, you're going to have to come in for the evening shift and work another 3 hours maybe. That's a horrible work life balance because you have to be there twice a day to work hours or so. For full-timers and heavy routes part-time couriers, they don't face that problem. But good luck on getting a heavy route as a part-timer unless someone is sick etc. It is a good company but you got to be lucky to get enough hours to survive."
good,"- The work can be frustrating at times especially if you are unfamiliar with the area you are working, but the support you receive from dispatchers and other drivers keeps you moving,"
good,I enjoy working in an environment with limited supervision. I'm a team player and working here is a total team effort. I like to keep busy and working here will keep you busy.
good,FedEx Grounds is a fast pace working place. For the most part the people there are friendly. It's not a job that you would go and play around. It's no time for playing you would get to work and get the job done. You just have to be prepared to work in a hot place.
good,"Fast pace work environment, management is easy to get along with, co-worker are friendly and easy to get along with, hardest part of the job is getting everybody on the same page, most enjoyable part of the job is the pay."
good,I learned that safety is key in the work environment. Most enjoyable part at work was working the slide section. Co-workers worked together to provide safety.
good,great building great people. Training program needs some work but over all has been a good experience. Low base salary for the industry but decent commission plan.
good,"in this job I will more enjoyable,to deal with public people,and run around to know more about city."
good,"escalation handling,"
good,Great place to work & learn. Fare treatment for all employees.Transparent & ethical work culture. Equal opportunity for people to grow across functions
good,"FedEx can be fast-paced. The people are great to work with depending on the group your in. Able to pick up extra hours if needed. Only thing that sucks is when they have a slow month, they will have hours cut. Overall FedEx isn't a bad place to work at."
good,"Most days are hot inside the trailers but i showed up to work to get the job done. I learned how to bend and carefully lift packages ,sort packages, and work accurately. I got along with the co workers and managers well and they gave me no problem as long as i showed up to work and i do my job. There really was no hard part of the job but going threw 3 or more trailers with a fast pace and 2 ppl. the most enjoyable part of the job is being there with other workers and being apart of a growing successful business. Also learning new things and receiving a pay check."
good,"I would have loved to stay at FedEx longer and would have until I found out I was expecting and a warehouse atmosphere and the work is not necessarily compatible for a pregnant woman. The management was very understanding and helped you whenever you needed it. The benefits and PTO was wonderful. The only negative thing I could say is the harsh conditions of loading trailers in the winter, it was very cold."
good,"never a dull moment, always trucks to unload and boxes to scan, makes work fly by. I like that i was able to learn different positions and when i became aware i was pregnant they were very helpful in finding something less strenuous for me to do"
good,"Fed ex has great benefits, a lot of fun and hard working people."
good,"great people to work with always a team environment, lots to do all the time. "
good,"Has the same operations each day, but the events that take place each day are never the same. This makes for a exciting and challenging work environment. This job has a very good job enlargement for an individual who is willing to improve their abilities in the workplace. Get to work around planes everyday."
good,"If you are going to drive a truck for a living, FedEx Freight should be your employer of choice.  Great pay and benefits, good equipment, and you will actually see your family."
good,"Good place to work and get your feet wet. Decent pay and benefits. Management plays favoritism, of course they say they don't but that's not the case. Also, this place is 24/7 so be prepared to work terrible hours to start if you do Customer Service. Overall good place, people and experience."
good,Load & unload trailers with aid of forklift. I learned to keep busy an do as you're told without shortcuts taken & you will move up. Management is good to you as long you don't give them a reason not to be. Co-workers are characters in their own right. The hardest part of my job is dealing with the weather conditions otherwise the most enjoyable part is getting a higher than average hourly wage pay check weekly for easy work.

good,"FedEx Express offers a great set of benefits for all positions and jobs.  It allows for advancement and pay increases, and the other employees become a family.  The work is fast paced and physical, but is a great job for those looking for some physical labor.  Plus knowing that you are delivering what people want put a smile on my face every day"
good,Good work place that works around students schedule. Managers are helpful and easy to get along with. Coworkers are good and supportive of one another.
good,Working at FedEx is a great experience. Probably the most enjoyable part of working at Fedex is meeting the different people through your route and being able to help them however you can. This job can be labor intensive which doesn't help when you are dealing with Florida weather but working with your colleagues and delivering packages to people makes it worth the work.
good,FedEx is a Fortune 500 company that is a people first environment. It is a great place to work with many opportunities for advancement.

good,"Scanning and stacking massive amounts of packages and documents neatly and carefully at a very intense speed. What I learned from my seasonal job at FedEx was discipline it taught me a lot about working hard and efficiently at a very high pace. The management at FedEx is decent it reminded me of sports in school due to constant coaching and yelling. As your work day progresses your co-workers become your team mates and when your team mates fall behind you have the choice to lend a helping hand. The hardest part of the job was the job itself there is never a time to take a breather, it is one long sprint to the finish line but that's also the most enjoyable as well because when your shift is over our co-workers always competed on who had the most productive day."
good,Great job i liked it a lot they just need to improve their management.Its a nice environment and friendly.The job keeps you moving.

good,"I usually arrive to work 10 - 30 minutes prior to the shift starting. In the time I am conversing with my fellow co-workers. We all head onto the floor about 10 minutes before our sort begins and wait by the time clock. Once everyone is clocked in, we begin stretches and  a manager will let us know the amount of volume we have, safety message, and any recognition to be given out. I head to my designated area. If the belt hasn't started yet, then I will begin base wrapping pallets that need wrap. While working I am able to talk with nearby Co-Workers without being distracted and maintaining my rate when the volume slows down which make working here very enjoyable."

There was not a lot of room for advancement in the area I was in. I would have to move to Memphis for a better opportunity."

I have various managers who are all very helpful, and answer any question or concerns that I may have.  The hardest part of my job would be the labor, I have to lift very heavy packages and carry them to the pallets.  The most enjoyable part of my job would be that I am able to work independently."

good,"A typical work day at Fedex is about 10 to 14 trailers, 9,000 to 13,000 packages that we have to unload in a timely manner. Ever since I started working for Fedex I've learned how to scan, sort packages, load & unload the correct way, operate a manual pallet jack, and address corrections. Management does a good job in making sure the sort runs at a steady paste. My co-workers are always fun to work with, Like we always say team work is the best work. The hardest part of my job is about 2 hours into work, thats when all the belts get slammed with boxes coming down the sort line. The most enjoyable part of my job is when we are finally finish."
good,I love the environment of my work place. It is a fast pace job. I like being able to talk to my supervisors and having a understanding about thing. I am just trying to find a job closer to home.

Management would step in and help, the hardest part of the job was that the pace was sometimes quick but there was plenty of help. The most enjoyable part of the job were the people."
good,"The company provides a good work environment, full paid training, full benefits. The hardest part of the job is working with customers who have issues with packages being delayed and are not satisfied with the service so you may run into issues with that and the schedule change from time to time can make it difficult if you have a family. Otherwise a good company to work for and coworkers are very friendly."

good,"its a great job if you like fast paced kind of work, if you work hard and have a good attitude it is the place for you, and there also is advancement opportunities."
good,My work day was very busy. I learned how to check and sort freight as well as drive equipment. Management was very helpful and always available. I got along well with my co-workers. The hardest part of my job was also the easiest part of my job that was the very fast paced environment but on the other hand it made my days seem to fly by because I was always busy with something t do.

good,"The hours were a little rough, but the experience was interesting."

good,"A very relaxed atmosphere where work-life balanced was encouraged and embraced.  Your creative opinion was more than welcomed.  My management team and co-workers were an awesome team.  The hardest part of the job were the latest changes to the company's business model...the close relations with different departments were changing as some were being moved to parent companies (i.e. from Ground to Services--which is located in Memphis, TN).  The most enjoyable part of the job were the great people FedEx employed and learning to work effectively with other departments like the IT group to develop programs that were specific to the department needs.  This is where I discovered my dream of becoming a programmer or developer."

Only worked 5 hours a day 5 days a week."
good,"No complaints just get ready to do hard work."
good,"A typical day consisted mainly of fast-paced loading of packages into delivery trailers, usually preceded by a safety briefing before the shift started.  The emphasis on safety was enormous and largely justified, because nearly everything in the work area was made of metal and one lapse of judgement could easily leave someone with a lasting injury.  It's most fortunate I did not suffer any injuries myself.  I got to take home a sense of pride that I'd made sure packages made it safely to their destination, something my tendency to be sure of things was eager to do.  The hardest part of the job was pushing oneself faster every day to meet a certain output of packages per hour, something that not everyone is capable of doing easily.  Management is quick to respond to a drop in productivity, regardless of whether or not its deliberate, and willing to do what needs to be done to increase said productivity.  One thing I enjoyed and thought was fascinating was a sense of community among fellow handlers.  I got the sense that some of them treated working around friends as a way to make the job bearable and fun, though I didn't always receive such luxuries myself"
good,"Staff and management are great, everyone gets along and helps one another. Job was a bit difficult at first but easy to get the hang of. Pretty fast paced, grabbing your package off the line, scanning and loading it on the truck before another one comes down the belt. Packages weigh an average of 25lb so you get a good workout. Physically demanding but after a while you get used to it."

Most enjoyable is meeting the people coming through the airport ."
good,"This was a great job, they treated you like family.  I learned alot about shipping materials with Fedex and procedures.  The hardest part of the job was the busy season, it was a very face-paced environment. I looked forward to my next shift."
good,"Fed Ex is a good company to work for, overall they are still a corporation though, which means those at the bottom who keep things going, don't really matter anyone is disposable."
good,"Great opportunity for advancement, cross training, and good benefits."
good,"My day at fedex are never the same every day has it's individual up's and down's. although our business is the shipment of packages, that not the end of the story when hundreds of hands handling a package when it get to you it can tell you a tale just like a good novel. everyday we face different challanges to get the customer what they pay us for and that service, and as per our company motto the purple promise "" i will make every fedex experience outstanding"" i think this motto say it all and shows the great culutre me and my fellow employees at fedex work hard at everyday..."

As with anywhere, the management and fellow employees can be both good and bad. I have a lot of respect for many of the people in management positions.

I enjoy the occasional moments where the work slows and I can take the time to work with other employees rather than always running in the other direction."
good,"A typical day consisted of unloading inbound freight from trucks and loading them on to FedEx trucks to be distributed throughout the state. I learned how to stack fast and efficiently. Management was good, friendly and intelligent. The co-workers were very enjoyable. The environment was pretty fast paced at times and would slow down towards the end of the shift.

good,"Its a good job for anybody looking for extra money. Working here has taught me a lot so that i could use this in the future, the hours are OK and i am saying that because i came from a temp agency so this is from this point of view, some of the co-workers were OK. i enjoyed unloading trucks, i didn't like to scan packages on the pallet because it could get stressful and the boxes would pile up and sometimes you would be by yourself, would i make it a permanent job? No. Its doesn't pay enough."
good,FedEx is helped me gained a lot of much needed warehouse experience. They also provide flexible hours and competitive pay.
good,A typicall day consist of taking packages off of a belt and van scaning each individual package to its designated truck.
good,"Working at FedEx ground is a very physically demanding company. I learned a lot of different things like working conditions, teamwork, employees safety, and taking responsiblity. Management is very respectful and courteous to their emloyees. The co-workers are fun to work with, but will not hesitate to lend a hand in need to a fellow worker. The hardest part of the job is dealing with the new employees and trying to mold them into the company right, training them properly and give them a sense of importance on working at Fedex. The most enjoyable part of the job is when at every meeting before we start the next day, the manager tells us what a good job we are doing in the company, that gives us the positiveness to try to do more that next day."
good,FedEx is a great company if you enjoy learning about how the world works! Their business relevance and diversity of customers give sales professionals unique insight into a wide range of industries. I always thought it was like earning an advanced degree on the job with what you learned and who you had access to over time. Internal support was exceptional and I really appreciated the authenticity of the senior leadership team.
good,"Clocked in, had a 3min safety meeting, and then we all split off into different trailers and started loading packages. If trailer was slow then went to one on either side of you that was busy to help out the co-worker in there."
good,"Ive been working here for 3 months and its not bad. The hours are nice, it allows me to balance my life and make time for other things. I work anywhere from 25-30 hours per week, but my checks are still decent because the starting pay is pretty good. I walked in and got offered 15.90 an hour. For what you have to do, its not bad. Its fast paced, and you do need to work... but its definitely not something I dread waking up to. I work 6 hour shifts, go home and have the rest of the day to myself. Its only part time, but im still making what someone would be making full time @ 10-12$ an hour (which most warehouses do offer). Benefits after 90 days. Cant say much about management yet because I just do my work and mind my business... one thing I can say is you need to be careful. There are about 20-25 forklift drivers at once on the dock and its very accident-prone. Ive worked at 3 other warehouses and I'd say this is my favorite. Pay increases every 3 months until you max at 18 i believe. Not bad for a part time job. If you can land a spot here, i dont think ud be disappointed.. at least for the first year lol."
good,"A typical day at fedex would be loading and unloading trucks. in a 4 hour shift you would probably be able to knock out two or three trucks. The management at Fedex was great, they made work really fun for me. The most difficult part of the job was unloading trucks, after a hour or so, you get drained from lifting those heavy boxes at such a fast paste."
good,"A typical day at work is everything is urgent. I learned to be calm while under pressure, which helps in getting procedures done correctly. I learned to manage with a firm but calm voice, if you respect all co-workers the majority will respect your position. Having to give my normal one hundred and fifty percent and watching co-workers only giving seventy five is one of the hardest things to see every night. The most enjoyable part is getting all freight out on time without any injuries or faults."
good,"If you are looking for a part-time job this is a great company to work for. FedEx provides good pay and benefits for its' part-time employees, but the hours vary and typically range from 15-20 per week."
good,"Package Handler working with the Incompatables(ICs) packages. Learned the process of building safe, stable walls with customer packages with the highest regard to customer satisfaction in mind. Work as a team to maintain efficient, clean work space"

good,Nice Short days
good,"Typical day at work is to be the first employee to show up, so I can setup and make sure that everything is ready to start the operations... My manager is always happy to see me in the morning, because to him, I'm a like the head of the snake, once he sees me, he feels relieved. At least those are his words... My co-workers are very understandable and very easy to work with. Overall, we're like family who looks forward to see one-another and work together everyday... Hardest part of the job is to wake up in the morning and come to work, but for some reasons, I always find my way to be energized and get to work everyday. And once, I get in the building, I'm ready to do whatever my boss is asking of me to do... Of course, the most enjoyable part of the job is when it's time to be heading home, why? Because not matter how fun the job is, we all want to be back home to our family at the end of the day. Therefore, to me, it's the most enjoyable part of the job."
good,FedEx Express deliveres parcels overnight and the employees strive to make it happen.
good,"Overall, FedEx TechConnect is an excellent company to work for. Each day was different with various projects always needing research, updates or actions to be taken. I had the great opportunity to work on a wide variety of projects for the company and worked with many different people from diverse departments. The management team is very supportive and involved when needed in the tasks at hand. I have learned a great deal about project management and each of the phases involved. I enjoyed getting to work on new projects often and learn more about the company and its operations."
good,"My work nights are the same; the main objective every night is to have on time departures. I do whatever it takes to make that happen. Having to be in a position where everything is about time, i've learned that mistakes will be made, but what's most important is capatilizing on those mistakes and making the next night a better one."
good,challeging rewarding and willing to work hard. You are really valued by your co-workers and management. The hardest part of the job is helping customers to the best of your ability when you are unable to help them. Most rewarding is when the customer is 100% satisfied.
good,"Loading or unloading trucks. Watching the sorter to make sure packages don't get jammed, Management was very helpful, I learned how to supervise other employees when management wasn't around. Co worker were fun to be around. Picking up the slack from another co worker and the end of the shift was the most enjoyable part."
good,I work on the docks at night. its a very fast pace but if you are in need of help your co worker are there to offer help. The compensation is very good. I learned something new every day from co workers that have been there longer then I have.
good,"Fedex is fast pace, you had lots of shifts to chose from. The faster you work the quicker the day goes by"
good,First thing in the morning you come to the terminal and load the truck the way you want to accomplish the route.
good,it was very demanding dependingon the type of route. you have the rural routes which require more driving miles and usually fewer deliveries. and in-town routes which requires more traffic and quick stop and go deliveries. you heave to know your zipcode well enought to know when to avoid traffic and schedule yourself to finish all deliveries on time.
good,Hard working place. The weather is the hardest part of working at FedEx when it's cold it real and in the summer it's real hot
good,"One's experience at FedEx greatly depends on which area you are placed. I sort, and anyone can do it. I hardly ever break a sweat."
good,"Fun , friendly work area , fast pace job , great management , the only hard part about the job is the hours"
good,"A typical day at work would be scanning each package on the assembly belt making sure the inventory is updated, loading each package in the assigned trucks depending on the destination."
good,"While working at Fed Ex I was exposed to a fast paced, time oriented job. Each day was different from the last keeping the job fresh and exciting. Getting to know the customers was a highlight of the job. Knowing that you delivered a birthday gift or a vital component of convention display made for instant gratification and added importance my occupation. Constantly being on the move kept me in shape and felt like I was being paid to workout, a plus in my book. The job was physical and sweltering summer days did make parts of the job more difficult. All together I felt it was a great experience helping me build strong interpersonal skills as well as improving my customer service skills"
good,This job gave me tons of experience! I loved this job! Its an awsome place to work!
good,The day would start off with a meeting with all the staff to on our goals for the day.
good,"As a career employee, I still enjoy working for FedEx and you meet people of all cultures. A very fast pace and friendly work place. The hardest part is not being able to satisfield the customer. the most enjoyable of my job , is still having one."

good,"FedEx is an interesting job where you never know what expect. It's a fun and very physical job. I grown to understand respectable values. I've learned how to think for myself rather than rely on someone else's ability. I've learn how to deal with diferent personality and still be respectful. Some people would say FedEx is a hard job, but I think it's just a physical job."
good,being a handler at fedex requires steady physical strength because your dealing with freight that could weigh 75lbs. or more during the day. I learned to work as a team at fedex or else you would be physically drained. co-workers are diverse at fedex but still are good team members. management is great at fedex becaise they help the crew members complete the job.the most enjoyable day at fedex is the communication between other workers.
good,I worked for small to large scale companies and I was always productive because I love to work. Also I maintain friendly relations with my management and team members which helps me have fun at my workplace.
good,I think it is a good place to work if you are looking for a little bit of money. My co-workers are good people. A typical day at work consists of about 3-4 hours a night.

good,"very fast paced, non-stop movement and activity for pm part timers. Must be able to catch on quickly and adapt to constant changing tasks. i have learned how to prioritize various task on my own. Management looks out for your best but after the companys goals are handled. hardest part of the job i havent reach there yet. the most enjoyable part is doing a shuttle run to newark airport to drop off hot packages."
good,Without a doubt one of my best job. Great pay and benefits with opportunity for career growth and advancement.
good,"I Don't Work Anymore,I'm Excited To Find A Good And Better Job."
good,"Very dynamic work place. Be ready for fast paced, continuous learning, and team work orientated work environment."
good,Fed ex is a very busy job that requires your best. I learned that its best to work hwell with others. Some of the managers that are there are easily to get alone with whikle some are not. I work well with my co-workers and they work great with me. The hardest part of the job is lifting heavy objects.The most enjoying part of the job is communicating with others and learning new things and delivering The Purple Promise
good,"It's a good company to work for. The benefits are great and the financial compensation isn't bad. The work environment was positive and workers are treated with respect. Often you have to deal with irate customers who can be disrespectful and difficult to deal with, you also encounter coworker with this characteristic also."
good,"I had to scan, unload and load FedEx packages. Everyone there was really nice and a hard worker."
good,a typical day at work for me would be challenging. management is always looking for ways to help make our jobs easier great management. I work around amazing people which i have learned to adapt and get along with people very well. The hardest part of my job is catching the bus to take me to the hub we have way too many workers and not enough buses. The the most enjoyable part is seeing that plane that i just loaded takeoff and knowing that i did.
good,"Interning at FedEx was a priceless experience. It is a company that is dedicated to ensuring an outstanding experience to its people. This is evident from the facilities (state of the art cafeteria, work-out area, massage and yoga areas, break-out rooms, etc) to the extra-curricular activities that employees have the opportunity to be engaged in."
good,I have worked on docks for the past 10 years and this is at the top of docks I have been employed by.

good,love the job overall great team member and managers i can honestly say it gave me a good overview ob hardwork and expanding my work experience
good,This job is very hands on and fast paced. Exciting and very demanding! Not only this for working actually on the floor but also in the office as an A&D Clerk.
good,"The job is fairly physically demanding, but the staff there was always there accommodate when needed. The only bad experience of the job is that the drivers who are hired by a third party are extremely rude and arrogant to the loaders. Creating a toxic environment."
good,good place to work with many things to offer such as promotion within the company over time and visual progression. Management talks within the lowers and seeks involvement within.
good,The only problem I have is the impersonal training.Your trained on a computer instead of hands on training.Although people helped me with questions I feel I'm on my own alot of times.
good,"World Class employer. Full benefits and room for advancement. Be proud to work for Fortune 500 company and globally recognized Brand. However,  there is always room to get Better for the management."
good,"Management, it is a very simple job process. whatever you job is that is what you are expected to do. As long as you come to work everyday and on time, you will have a job."
good,"Daily work environment can differ depending on the workload and if everyone shows up.  Multitasking is a must and requires each individual to partake.  The hardest part of the day is locating a high value freight shortage, especially if a center doesn't have cameras, or if the cameras happened to be unavailable at the time in a specific area.  I've learned quite a bit as far the daily impact and high-paced functions of LTL Freight.  It amazes me on how much freight is moved daily and gets to its attended destination.  Very impressive."
good,"I loved working for this company and recommend it to anyone that want to go for their own personal goals. You will have to put in a few years before you start seeing better pay, take a long time to get $$"
good,This is a great job if you can last past your body getting used to the equivalence of working out for 4 hours straight. A lot of women actually do work here successfully.
good,Pays well. Advancement possible with skill and political prowess.  Great culture where practiced.  FedEx Supply Chain is relatively new and struggles to adapt to the culture in some facilities.
good,Was told I would work 25hrs./wk. Been there 7 months and still haven't got 25 hrs. The work is easy.  Not really there long enough to have any problems with any one.
good,"FedEx is able to keep productivity at the maximum while also ensuring a nice and safe work place , they treat all their workers with care and respect."
good,"This is a great company to work for. It is a high paced, high activity job. Energetic work environment. Great team working. Competitive and fun place to work"
good,They should have at least 2 or 3 people loading and unloading the trucks .besides that nothing to complain and more pay 12.50 should be 17$ hard work and heavy....
good,Work is part time where I'm at so you still have a life.  Pay is good and you get a raise every three months. After a year you'll reach your highest pay.  Job is easy and people are down to earth and relaxed.
good,You learn every single day.. the people are very nice to worth. it is one of the safest company to work for it terms of job security. I worked for 18 years and the time just flew!
good,Ive had fun during my time there is was easy and ver fun but fast pace I was able to work with poeple and understand what I had to do anhad to be done I have always got the job done no matter what
good,"Must be able to lift heavy items. Must have alot of patience as a Driver, dealing with traffic, road construction and other drivers. Good benefits and good bosses."
good,"It's an average place to work if you need a job it's not hard to get started. You can pick your own shift so the hours are pretty flexible. The negative of working part-time is the twi shift is usually 3 hrs at most m-f,  which means you get less than 20 hours a week. You do get the option of coming in during other shifts for a combined sort but it's during the day which didn't work for me."
good,"Nice part time for some extra money thinking about going back. It's a Fast pace job can be a little stressful at times but your day goes by pretty fast. I wish "
good,I was a part time dockworker for 3 years for Fedex freight. It was definitely a family atmosphere and if they had more full time positions available I would’ve stayed. The managers were cool and so were supervisors. I got along with all my co workers. The only tough part is that the dock has no climate control. Super hot in summer and freezing in the winter. Even if your part time they offer full medical benefits and 401k
good,"Very well taking care of employees ,very fast paced, great hours and scheduling, making open opportunities to grow and succeed. They work with the employees if they have any issues"
good,Made me a very independent with high production.  Management respectful and professional. Friendly environment.  Sometimes the packages require a lot of muscle.
good,they were very kind and energized. i got along with my co-workers and we enjoyed working with one another. they had great spirits and knew how to motivate another.
good,I Started working at BVY IN South Boston as a package Handler . Experience was ok managers are very pushy though. Co workers were great . Saw a chance to transfer to the Boston Ramp at Logan Airport . A lot better working environment and a chance to make more money . I totally recommend it ....
good,It was great and good experience but I didn’t like that my locker was broken and my boss would be pressuring me and I didn’t feel comfortable and I started not liking it
good,"Working at FedEx is like going to the gym. It's a very laid back job, great pay, great benefits and just and overall great place to work. I've been there a few months and I've had more appreciation here than I've had at any other job."
good,"Very good company to work for. People service profit philosophy is great."
good,The most enjoyable part of being a courier is delivering customer package on time when they waiting on it for something important and they see you coming. The smile and gratitude says alot.
good,At FedEx it is very organizational and safe unless you put yourself in danger. At FedEx you load the trucks and you are assigned a different truck each day with a new partner. I personally liked working at FedEx because of the safety environment and friendly staff making sure everyone and everything was okay and safe
good,Easy to move through the company.  They offer in-house opportunities. Willingness to help from managers to senior employees.  The bidding process is fair
good,The work they expect don’t account for the little hours they give workers. The work loads and timing is unbalanced. I felt like I was working 8 hours in 4.
good,"A typical day at FedEx is hard working. You learn how to be physically challenged and competitive. Fortunately, I had an awesome manager that made my work easier. Delivering on time is a stressful part of the job. At the end of the day. It's enjoyable to be part of the FedEx team."
good,"Competitive pay, fast paced work environment. Good opportunity for further advances. Lots of on job training for what role you'll be working. The dock is open so keep that in mind."
good,Its pretty stressful at times but if u want a safe secure job with part-time benefits its pretty good. I mean... i like it the workplace environment is nice
good,Fun place to work if you are young and/or young at heart.  I didn't really feel comfortable as a more mature employee.  The staff is very helpful and will assist when needed.
good,"My typical day working at FedEx would consist of starting at either 3:45am, 4am, 4:15am or 4:30 am and working as late as 9am.  I learned how to work in a team fashion in a fast paced atmosphere with nonstop workloads.  The workplace culture is one that is very team-orientated and based on efficiency and productivity.  The hardest part of the job was keeping pace during the heavy rush periods and getting the trucks loaded in time which could have of up to 800+ boxes of which there is one loader per truck.  The most enjoyable part of the job was gettting the trucks completed and helping my coworkers finish theirs if they were falling behind."
good,Great place to work with flexible schedule and weekends off. Only issue is management which at times can be quite unapproachable especially the higher level managers.
good,The company hires from within first if someone wants a job in different department they will take the inside person first if they have the experience needed.  They have great benefits and would love to go back there if there is a job available.
good,"The job was simple and straightforward, Short days, Great benefits. the worst part was the co-workers."
good,It’s an ok  job that benefits are outstanding that was the best thing about even working there other than it was ok working there wasn’t the best job in the world
good,"It can be hard on you after a while, because of the hours, but this is a mostly good job they got the managers in spots that suits them, but sometimes they need you in a different than usual spot, and the don't have time to train you properly and all you can do is your best"
good,"Working in the weather was not a preferable work environment."
good,Enjoyed working at fedex had a lot of fun learned a lot met great people would love to return one day full time. Would definitely recommend working at fedex to a friend
good,very well I enjoyed my experience and it proved to be very interesting with fast paced workers and a excellent supervisors. I got a chance to grow in a new place.
good,Fun fast paced job that required long hours and physical activity.  Geared for individuals are okay with little interaction with others.  Great benefits.
good,perform physical labor and must be fit enough to lift packages that might weigh between 50 and 100 pounds. management makes sure you are taking water breaks and check on you to make sure you are okay and safe. everyone helps.
good,"Great place to work. Great pay, opportunities for advancement, affordable healthcare, set schedule. You only work Monday-Friday with all major holidays off."
good,"Great place to work as a driver. No benefits, but great pay. I worked as a home delivery and a ground driver for two different Contractors. The package handlers work part time with the possibility of full time."
good,"Great company to work for, great benefits, solid service, many opportunities for advancement, family oriented culture.  Pride in the work they do, strong brand loyalty"
good,"This was a overall good job (as far as how much you get paid and benefits) but the hours available weren't enough and it was VERY fast paced. If you can pick up stuff weighing up to 100lbs then you'll be fine,"
good,In the short time that i worked at FedEx i really enjoyed it. FedEx offers career advancement if you want it. It is a hard job though depending on what department you are in.
good,"the work environment is relaxed yet busy "
good,"It is fast pace and have to be able to multi-task and prioritize duties and task in order to finish end of shift work detail. Workplace culture needs improvement with team building, and high morale for employees from management staff."
good,"I apply data science to solve business problems ranging from sales, marketing , retail and customer experience. My average day is to crystallize business requirements into a data science challenge and build models to solve them. Of course communicating(read selling) the result to stakeholders and making sure its becomes an actionable insight is the final node in the workflow."
good,Great place to work but have to move your way up and you start part time and do not get many hours but as a full time worker you make good money and it is a fast paced workplace.
good,"Working there, your mind have to be Positively focused on getting your work done, and out to the designated area on time, all while being a team player and keeping a safe environment."
good,"I enjoyed the people I worked with, very fast paced. As long as you are looking for a part time job, it doesn't get any better. Benefits are excellent."
good,All in all a pleasant place to work. the time you spend during your workday goes by very fast. the work environment is very satisfying. got to meet alot of people and make new friends.
good,"I have nothing negative to say about my tenure at FedEx.  I found it to be a strong company driven by its mission and principles.  The only reason I even contemplate exploring the job market is to validate my reason for staying.  I need to know if the grass is really greener on the other side, as the saying goes."
good,I enjoyed my 9 years at federal express. Some days really cold. Some days really hot. But we get the job done. Teamwork is necessarily at the job. My last manager wasn't kind. But it's okay
good,Always good to feel like family and have a great team of people to work around mangmaent is cool and There to help and listen we get help with your problems and they understand life happens
good,"The job itself is not difficult. As long as you are willing to pick up the phone and have drive, you could do great things. Heavy relationship building skills are needed to be successful."
good,"I was a delivery driver in company vehicle or buy your own vehicle sprinter van ,you get a list on where you are going load vehicle and delivery packages to homes and businesses."
good,FedEx is a great company to work for however they don't encourage advancement to higher positions with greater pay and an opportunity to plan for retirement one day.
good,"Great place to work to also advance to other levels of work.Great benefits,good pay and good paid time off. You can also move up to several levels of management."

good,I usually worked from 10 a.m to 4:30 p.m.. I learned about the shipping and packing while working there. The management was ok it just really depended on he person. The working culture is good its just your in the climate all day long. The hardest part of the job for me was being in the climates but I was also pregnant at the time I worked there.
good,"The work place culture was good, the only disadvantage for me was the evening work.  I found it to be quite late and the hours unpredictable. The evening hours were not consistent so that meant I could not rely on a consistent salary."
good,Always gotta be on the go go go and keep up or else you’ll fall behind and that’s where all the trouble starts is if you fall behind and nobody wants that
good,"Great place to work. Great health  benefits program, Opportunity to advance, The company prides itself on the PSP (people service policy) which is the foundation of the company."
good,The salary for a package handler is great. The work is fast paced. There is downtime when a airplane lands late but you get paid for it. from October to the beginning of January you get extra hours because of Christmas time package shipping.
good,"I worked part time for 4 years and my last year was as a full timer. FedEx Freight is definitely a cut throat company. Very fast paced. You have to be able to multitask. I learned to keep up and it helped me immensely with my communication skills. The hardest part of the job was getting everything done within 8 hours. Overtime is unacceptable. I was crossed trained  from driver check in, billing, appointment clerk to shortage investigation clerk. Management could definitely improve with the way employees are spoken to and how certain situations are handled."
good,"Depending on where you work, the job can be a little stressful and strenuous but its still a decent job. The managers work with you and there is a lot of teamwork involved."
good,"FedEx has outstanding benefits . PTO, discounts, pretty much anything you name FedEx has it. It is a great company to move up in. Only thing I would say is you will work hard! You will earn every penny."
good,"Management in the workplace was great."
good,"LOVE MY JOB OVERALL, just wish they offered more positions and gave more hours so that most people won't have to work multiple jobs if they're not a courier. even some couriers are part time and work double jobs."
good,"I haven't worked there since 2006, it was great then, but not much work/life balance. Now it's changed.even my manager demoted himself to courier. The only thing FedEx cares about now is the bottom line."
good,It’s is a great experience if your looking for something to do during college or even make a career if that’s where you want to be for life they make it so that the sky is the limit to what you can do there so many opportunities  and great people there

good,"Management is fantastic, people are collaborative, but resources are thin and can make completing your job difficult at times.  Hours can be quite long, but overall - fantastic place to work"
good,Fedex has great compensation! Don't expect an easy day. All well worth it with benefits and discounts out the hoo-hah! Punctuality is key. Extra hours are given to those that need/want it.

good,The work environment is great just need more work hours. The manager's are very helpful with whatever you ask of them. Overall its a good company to work for in the long run.
good,"Great place to work, nice people, great culture, less than stellar location.  I have thoroughly enjoyed my time here at Fedex.  Would only consider leaving for a personal ""dream"" location"
good,The warehouse is clean and you the production is a team effort. Each individual has a job to do and they do it and then they help each other out. Many employees have been there for a very long time and working there I have met many different people from all walks of life and my health has improved since I worked there.
good,Working at Fed Ex was a great part time job because it fit great with the other full time job I had. I also met a lot of great people at Fed Ex; one that even led me to a very good full time job. This job kept  me in good shape and allowed me to meet a lot of different kinds of people with its diversity. I often think about re applying at Fed Ex.
good,"Overall It is a good company to work for, however, the location I was at does not offer the hours that I need to be successful in my volunteer activities."
good,"I worked here for a little while and i liked it for the time being. Only problem i had was that i wasn't really used to doing a lot of heavy lifting and manual labor so i had to get used to that. Other than that, job was cool."
good,I am a loader so sometimes the belt moves slow depending on the area you work. Management is very helpful. the hardest part of the job is keeping pace when its a big sort. FedEx is a decent part-time job.
good,You will encounter so many different people while working at FedEx. The environment is quick paced place where you have a lot of chill and sit down time once finished with the work.
good,"Being a package handler at FedEx can be a somewhat stressful job, but your mindset is what will make a difference between a good and bad work day. It is fast-paced and sometimes can be unorganized and rushed, but just keep working and you will feel like you really earned your check on pay day."
good,"This corporation is very well managed with great workers and management staff. It was a very quick-paced environment which kept me on my toes and I enjoyed. Overall, this job is a great job for someone looking for part-time work."
good,"You're basically assigned a forklift for the day and a trailer full of freight that customers order. Your task is to take freight from your trailer and put in inside a trailer that's going out for delivery. Once a trailer gets full, drivers take them to make deliveries and replace it with an empty trailer so that dock employees have somewhere to place the freight."
good,a day at fed ex is a very fast paste job you need to be quick and also make sure you are safe at all times management is good and caring they provide drinks to stay hydrated at all times its a good company to work for.
good,"Cultura norte americana, rígida, exigente, porém fornecedora de toda infraestrutura  e recursos mínimos para viabilizar o trabalho."
good,"It is a fast-paced job where there is always work to be done. Unloading trailers is the first part of the shift then you load the trucks that will be delivering to local businesses. Some days the unloading goes smoothly some days they weren't loaded properly and you have to fix it. That could include taping, wrapping with plastic, restacking the freight or putting it onto a new pallet entirely."
good,Not for everyone. don't go in thinking that you can do the job because you probably cant. hate to say it but that's the way it is. Great place to work if you can hang.
good,"I really enjoyed working at FedEx.  My manager was fair, knowledgeable and set very high expectations.  There was a lot of opportunity for advancement with a company that's number one priority is people."
good,Working at FedEx was a challenge. Maybe because i was overnight but it was stressful but i had its nights when it was full of fun. the pay is great so i didn't complain.
good,Fed Ex is a great work enivorment were everyone works as a team. Fed Ex offer great beniefts that separate them from any other company. I love how the company lets u adavance.
good,"FedEx offers all plenty of opportunities for growth and leadership. Security is a plus. Everyone is held accountable for his/her actions. This a great place to work for, especially for career development."
good,Fedex is a great place to work if you are looking for part time work you get paid every week the work is hard but once your body gets used to it it becomes more of a routine some stress but all in all in my opinion its a great place to work
good,"FedEx Freight has flexible  hours, Company cook outs, teaches employees about The Purple Promises. Chances to move up in Company by putting out openings on Board."
good,Wonderful benefits. Great co-workers. Fast paced and extremely stressful.  Main goal is customer satisfaction which was very enjoyable.  Great opportunities for advancement.
good,Fed Ex was a great job. I enjoyed working for fed ex. I only wish I could have been full time. the benefit was great and overall it was a great experience.

good,"Great place to work, fast paced environment. The culture is to treat everyone fairly. The company is very diverse group of people. FedEx is a Fortune 500 company that moves freight from continent to continent continuously."
good,"-Great place to work over a long period"
good,I would work here again without question. The only thing that could use a change is they really like to hire part-time and its a long road to get to full time but if you don't mind hard work you'll get there at the same time there one of very few companies that give benefits to part-time employees and there's a lot of room to move up especially if your willing to transfer out of state. I just wanted to try a different career.
good,"Fedex is good place but im just looking for a better career for me and my family.I learned when the it get tough you keep pushing and never quit, i love the people there always keep us laughing and wondering how are life is going."
good,"FedEx was a great job for the most part, the job itself is very hard on the body but after three weeks or so you get used to the physical labor. I learned how to scan product and pack properly making sure not to damage anything and I also indulged in a small amount of forklift work. Managers are in charge of distributing flow of package flow throughout the building. FedEx is typically a hardworking company from the time you enter until the time you leave it is a non stop grind.The job does have it's luxuries sometimes you get released early if flow is kept at bay and they also have employee appreciation day."
good,"A typical work day at FedEx Express would be first thing in the morning we would stretch as a group, unload all the packages out of cans, and load the packages on to the correct courier truck to get ready for delivery. The overall workplace is fun and everyone gets along with each other. I've learned a lot, far as new area's and new addresses. My job as a courier is pretty easy, but i would say the hardest part of the job is getting the package to the pin point correct location which can be a hassle at times. Overall not to bad, Management is always a call away if you need help."
good,"foi minha primeira experiencia com logística foi uma área que aprendi desenvolver em muitas áreas. trabalhava com responsabilidade com alocação dos produtos que vinham tanto externo quanto interno para o estoque.trabalhava no setor de controladoria responsável por controlar e acompanhar os produtos desde a entrada do produto para o estoque ate a linha de produção."
good,This is one of the best jobs that I have had.  Great job with great benefits.  Company takes care of their people.  FedEx was like family.  The pay was good and FedEx gets paid weekly.  Great Job!
good,"My reviews were always good and the only areas for improvement were to have quicker handling times on my calls. I loved my job there."
good,"Very rewarding job, it's what you make it. Made you feel apart of a team and was rewarded for your hard work. The pay was good as well along with a good working environment."
good,Very good company to work for. The managment team were good and proffesional. I really enjoyed my role there and have gained so much experience within the operations department.
good,"fedex is fun workplace with great benefits that allowed me to excel at teamwork qualities, with great advancement opportunities. fedex is also a company that focuses on safety and customer satisfaction."
good,"A little over one month working at Fed Ex and you definitely stay busy to the point where time flies. I just wish I was able to work more hours to support my family. I've learned every second counts. Management is greats, no complaints here. Hardest part would be when your trying to catch up due to a heavy workload. I enjoy working with great people."
good,"It's hard when you first start, but after a while it gets better. They have great benefits. The hours are short around five to six hours a day. And you will basically be exposed to outside weather conditions."
good,"Fun, work hard, take of care of physical mental health, body for the shifts, stay healthy and active. put in some work, and if you need help have someone help when u need it and they work work with you."
good,"Part time job, could have moved up to full time but chose not to. Easy to do job if you can listen and follow instructions. Good pay, good benefits. Great co-workers."
good,"This job is great for those looking to get help through school great benefits PTO, Health Benefits they will work with your schedule great company to work for.  they do give out food during the busy times of the year, they set goals to go have fun activies"
good,I been working for an international company FedEx for past 2 years which have been a good experience and helped me learn more about logistics and courier services. I find it a good place to work for .
good,"FedEx Ground is a good job. It's difficult because it is a physical job. Working at FedEx is like being paid to go the gym. You get your cardio from the fast constant pace that you must work at, and you get your weight lifting from some of the heavier packages. The pay is all right and the benefits are good."
good,"The days were long, but they seemed short. All the different jobs you have to do keeps you on your toes and active. It was all about finding ways to make the job easier on me and my body. I like unloading the trucks. It's the quickest job to do."
good,"Working hour for analysts are quite flexible, which allows employees to handle personal business while work hard for the company. FedEx put people first, encourage physical exercises."
good,"Nice Place to work for. Flexible Shift With School, Managment is Awesome. The hardest part of working for Fed Ex is getting used to unloading trailers."
good,"overall, great company to stay with for the long run . working in los angeles the only thing that sucks is that you don't get full time . management could improve a lot , they lack a lot of work ethics. you do at times have to pick up the slack of your co workers cause most are lazy . the director at lax hub guy capriulo is an amzing guy . very good guy , he takes care of business"
good,Its Great place to get a workout. Get paid doing it. Its super fun and you get to meet a lot of new people. Management is great just remember to keep yourself hydrated.
good,This job was wonderful to me because it fit perfectly with my school schedule plus I had full benefits. I also enjoyed the people who I worked with. I learned how to be patient with others and understand their working capabilities. Fedex also guaranteed hours regardless of how long you worked as long as you were not late or called out. My manager was pretty firm but as long as you did your job and did it well he stayed off your back. The hardest part of the job was working inside a warehouse during the summertime. There are fans and a couple of swamp coolers but the building is very large and there wasn't enough circulation. I would say for the benefits alone the job is well worth it.
good,Great company. Great Benefits. Advancement opportunities. Excellent management. Moderate raises and No Bonus. Great vacation benefits.
good,"Its a very busy place that takes production seriously. The bosses there are nice and interactive, they like to know how their employees are doing. They also reward their employees with cookouts and various other items for doing a good job. They offer some movement in the company although many of their hire ups will not be leaving anywhere. I didn't want to be a commercial driver which is what they push on you almost right at the interview so if your ok with doing that this is perfect for you."
good,"Good environment to learn system and networking."
good,"The typical day for this job ia always busy at work, what i have learned at this job, multitask, ability to manage time, i learned to work faster than before, i learned to manage the packgae the delivery according each location's route, i learned how to mange the route, my co worker like to work arround me, because am upbeat so evryone get be up beat like me, the hardest part of the job is liffing and loading, the most enjoyable part of this job, handling the package directlt to the owner, is fun, meeting new people."
good,"nice company to work for just didn't have enough hours for permanent workers free food "
good,"You get the work done as quickly as possible there is no problem. Management has a heavy burden, so they push you to the limit. EVerything is based on numbers. A time sensitive environment as well. You have to have a punctuality rate of 96% or better. They dont play with time and attendance."
good,"Working at FedEx, has provided me with Great learning and exposure. i have always been keen for learning about aviation which became possible with FedEx. I am learning a lot about the cargo business by being a major contributor within the team."
good,"Management needs to put their heads together but it's a cool job. a lot of free stuff, but a lot of bad decisions!!! Hours are great."
good,It's fast paced good environment  good management excellent pay good hours excellent benefits and perks good job if you like working in a warehouse
good,"A typical day at work starts with team leader giving a schedule briefing. After the briefing you're to either rotate from your position to an alternative one, depending on your team."
good,"Great, Great. Loved the job, management were great and understanding. Fast paced, however you were given the support and tools to do your job. Just wish there would of been more hours."
good,"Good work place ,co-operative staff & management."
good,"Best experience I've had working for FedEx supply chain, the area i worked in was very well put together and organized. I had a great team to work with also."
good,i enjoy working at fedex. great company to be working for. work starts at usually at 5am-9am so if i could change anything it would be the hours.
good,work hard and staying fit and helping people do better . its fun and times when you get off dreams..okay. love. hope...hey......
good,"Overall a great place to work, and has a great training program. Fast paced, goal oriented and driven. Build your own book of business and all the tools needed are given to you.  Great management and co-workers, very friendly, and a growing part of FedEx."
good,"Fedex Ground was a learning experience as it was my first job outside of my first job of ten plus years. At first I was told that I would load 1 truck when I went for my ""sort observation,"" but on the second day of work I was loading three trucks already.  It was not an issue once I got used to the pace of work, but I wish I was informed correctly about the job requirements.  Everyone at FedEx Ground was polite and very helpful, especially my belt manager. Co-workers always tried to help each other out as much as possible with the heavy items that could weigh over 100 pounds.  I would say the hardest part of the job was to keep up with the pace of boxes coming down the belt at a quick pace and if the belt would break you would have to manually get your boxes and cart them over to your belt/truck. I enjoyed meeting new people and learning something new outside of customer service."
good,Good company to work for. Plenty of opportunities for advancement if willing to relocate. Management positions can be very rewarding if you can manage stress and multiple assignments. Good benefits and retirement plan.
good,"No matter who you are, when its busy season everyone at all levels works as a team. Only downside is its part time and difficult to support day to day normal lifestyle!!!"
good,"Physical labor, great job to stay in shape. Everyday is like you a new day. Once you are done for the day that is it. No queue's to work out of. Pay is good for the type of work that you do. Benefits are great. Management can put pressure on you and sometimes feels they are out of touch. I would recommend this company to anyone who likes Logistics work."
good,"The job is definitely a workout. Packages are heavy, but the teamwork is great. Everyone helps each other out the whole time even the management."
good,"It is a very lively environment to work with people from different backgrounds and expertise."
good,"I enjoyed the job, but I could never get full time employment with benefits.  That was they only issue I had with the company."
good,The people are amazing. FedEx is a great company to work for with tones of amazing benefits. They have great training and many opportunities to move up in the woke force.
good,Great work place to have job security. Over then being over the road a lot routes have quick turn around runs to make it home every week.
good,"e uma empresa seria que busca crescer no mercado de trabalho,uma empresa que se em porta com seus clientes mas de que seus lucros e sempre disponibiliza um melhor serviço e com eficaz"
good,"Empresa com funcionários colaborativos, dedicada as suas metas, possui foco no cliente e seu maior patrimônio são seus funcionários."
good,"It was fun and miserable at the same time, cause we would go out in any weather condition on 3rd shift and move really heavy/big cans around. A lot of older guys who liked to harass me, I didn't say anything to the boss cause it was the guys who had been there the longest, and I didn't know how to bring it up and I didn't want to cause trouble."
good,FedEx is one of the best place I have every work to. Co-workers and managers are really helpful specially when you are new.
good,As a part-time employee you do not have seniority at all-however this is a good place to work. If you want to move up you do have that opportunity. Enjoyed billing during the evening shift.
good,"A typical day of work included: To start the day I walked around of my vehicle to ensure it was in safe working condition for the route. Next, I loaded my vehicle with packages and sorted them for the route. Next, I left the building and delivered the packages. After finishing the deliveries I started the pickup route. After scanning all the packages and loading them into my truck I would go back to the building and unload. I improved my time management, organization, and problem solving skills. I enjoyed my co-workers and managers. The hardest part of the job was learning new areas and setting the deliveries up to be efficient. The most enjoyable part of the job was exploring the area."
good,"fed ex is one of the most fun but hard places to work. they test your skills of reading, movement, stacking and organizing. its hot during the summer, cold in the winter. very nice people who is willing to help"
good,I drove a forklift. unloaded trailers. When I was needed I would also deliver frieght to customers.  They did train me to get my cdl.
good,"A very productive company, managers are easy to talk to. Fast pace environment. I really enjoy working at fedex freight."
good,It is a fast pace job. I learned to be a team player. My managers are fair. My co-workers and I make a pretty good team. When the job needs to get done we have each others backs. The job is physical in nature so you better have your game faces on or else it will be hard to keep up with the pace. The most enjoyable part of the job for me is that its a work out everyday.
good,Very productive and fun place to work. Many challenges that made me work even harder to become a well rounded manager. A place where you are appreciated.
good,"I worked the preload so I would start work at 4am, load two trucks with about 250-400 packages in each and would work roughly until 8:30 every day."
good,"Hardest was sorting the mail ,loading the truck for delivering the mail on time.    the enjoying part about this day is freedom all day just get the work done."
good,"They take care of their employees, and work with them more than any other company I have been with. I enjoyed all the years I worked with them"
good,"I love working for fed ex. flexible hours, great benefits, and the pay are good. The environment is typically that is a high school if you look at it that way. But as long as you stay to yourself but work well with others then things will be great"
good,This job was similar to FedEx due to it being a warehouse type job. Also I sorted packages and helped the electricians run cables through ceilings and walls.
good,Excellent place to work. Company really cared about their employee's. Received a lot of training and career advancement. Wished I never left.
good,"They have a awesome production line, it is a fast paced work environment in stacking packages ''WITH CARE'' meaning they take proud in servicing the customer packages not damaging nearly all packages. With that in mind if your young and want to grow with a company that has value Fedex is the place to be."
good,"-ability to multi-task"
good,FedEx is very nice place to work.They take care of there workers. Loaded the truck went out for delivery's. went to businesses apartment complexes and a lot of houses days go by fast.
good,"fun work place with suppostive management. Not at all about the numbers but how you personally grow and develop.Decent amount of red tape and politics, butthis is expected of a big company."
good,The enjoyable part at this job is just being around your co-workers and some of the managers. Everyone is friendly to work to me.
good,"A great company to work for during the past 20 years.  Made some outstanding friends, travelled the world , made good cash, and tried to balance work and home life with my wife .  Its a job not for everyone ..must enjoy long distance travel, expect to love night work!  some prefer domestic some international depending on time away from family.  I put family first , and the rest comes along with the fun of flying cargo ops"
good,"Uma empresa muito boa de se trabalhar com funcionários bem treinados, e muito preocupada com o bem estar deles, aprendi muita coisa com eles pois a empresa propõem ao funcionários que todos são lideres passando assim tudo que foi aprendido"
good,The managers were nice and the job was hard work and fun. The only bad part about it was that HR never did anything about all of the employees talking alot of smack behind each-others' backs.
good,i enjoyed my coworkers and the job was easy to me. i learned alot and it wasnt hard for me to adjust. the hardest part of the job was recouping damaged frieght.
good,I work early mornings from 4am to 10am and my managers and co-workers are loading trucks and unloading various sizes of freight containers as fast as we can.
good,"Job is fun management is poor we do get rewarded lots of responsibility but they don't appreciate the job you do.Mating the aircraft and loading air planes is tricky ,hard and very exciting, always be on task. Very fast pace environment no breaks have little time do load the airplane."
good,"FedEx was a opportunistic company with a lot of room to expand as a employee. Working at FedEx I received a lot of training in using different materials such as a hand forklift, scanning machines,and more."
good,"Being at FedEx is boring, but working there made me a hard worker. The hardest part is working quickly at a consistent pace. I have great co-workers but sometimes I feel like they are not pushing themselves as much as I am. A typical day for me is pretty much unloading about 5 trucks and ending the shift tired without feeling good about myself."
good,"• Work starts quick and remains constant until the end of the night"
good,Soon as you walk into the work area and everyone is working hard and taking the job serious due to the great staff they have encouraging people to work as hard as they can.
good,Great company with excellent benefits for part time employees and also was great work mates.  Everyone completed tasks on time.
good,"on a typical day i work with customers to help them get their "
good,"I was a good assignment, temporary in nature. My section manager  was both clear and proactive, with all under her charge. The staff arround was cooperative, yet very dilligant about their work."
good,"I love working for FedEx Trade Network. Its a Monday through Friday job. My co-workers are great, they help get through the work day, they don't mind helping if you don't understand certain things. I get to enteract with my customer over seas through phone, fax, and email."
good,"Overall this is a very good company to work for. There's plenty of room for growth and the management team will really push you to succeed in every way. The employees are great to work with and they have a really good and fair system for tracking employee performance and rewarding you for it. The hardest part of the job is adjusting to the timing system, always working on schedule and time management."
good,"Fast paste and busy, phones are constantly ringing and there is always something to do very little down time. There isn't much bad I can say about FedEx I personally enjoy the fast paste and constant work."
good,nothing bad about this place.... only sucks when working on the dock during winter. get to pick your hours most of the time so working this as a second job is greT
good,I loved Fedex Express but the Management needs to be better. The People are wonderful and I love the work environment but the managers play a lot of favoritism and that's not cool.
good,fast paste lots of fun working their. well taught. most will work with you. the company supplied free coffee that was great. breaks was also great if you got tied you can rest. the people their worked with you if you needed. it's a good company to work for.
good,This is a good way to move up the company. You would have to do a lot of calls on to previous employers for everyone that applies to be a driver to verify the driving experience. We also had to do some other assignments that the managers in the office gave us. It was fun doing new things and using your brain.
good,"Sin duda una empresa en la que volvería a trabajar."
good,"FedEx is a great place for employment. Seeing the operation of sending & receiving all types of packages first hand is a great eye opener for someone who is usually just a customer. I learned a lot of things at FedEx that I will take with me for the rest of my life. FedEx definitely improved my leadership skills & taught me how to be expeditous but careful when handling a customers package. My work group consisted of people from all ages which put my communication skills to test. Working through rain, sleet, or snow and making sure the planes departed on time were the hardest parts of the job. Meeting different pilots & watching planes takeoff was probably the most exciting part of the job. I enjoyed working at FedEx and would recommend anyone who is able to do some physical work to apply."
good,FedEx is a nice place to work at. They offer good benefits and insurance. Safety is not an issue due to the police officers and security officers that are always on duty.
good,"I enjoyed the job would work there again"
good,wonderful working environment for individuals wanting a Fortune 100 structure. Ability to work freely or closely with others. Company strongly backs their employees.
good,"I had such a great time at FedEx Express. Great place to work and amazing atmosphere."
good,"came in to work for a package handling and sort. i learned the importance of treating the packages with respect so they reach their destination undamaged co-workers were good hardworking people. the hardest par of the job was when we were short on people and the sort would take longer to finish. the most enjoyable part of the job was going home after a hard few hrs of heavy work, almost felt like a nice paid workout."
good,Mostly men working so I would like to find another job that requires less lifting of heavy packages. The pay is good but the work is not best for women despite my strength
good,"A typical day at work would be me driving a forklift, driving into trailers and unloading and loading the shipments, or freight, that came on the specified trailer. Management is good at managing the warehouse, but people skills a lacking in some. My coworkers are all from different walks of life, easy to get a long with, we all worked as a team. if one person was struggling with something, someone would get off of their forklift to assist them. "
good,This company was great. It was very high in demand and wanted things done at a fast pace. It was physical and I could see someone growing in this company with a plan.
good,"A typical day at work is hard, fast paced and early in the morning for the inbound shift there is one other shift for later in the day. I have learned to work hard and efficiently at a quick pace. The managers are good at there jobs and pretty relaxed unless otherwise needed. The other employees aren't difficult to deal with at all."
good,"Best job I ever had. very quick, learned how to work together to accomplish tasks. The management was very understanding and open. My co-workers were overall good but a couple was lazy and made jobs harder. The most enjoyable part of the job was having a good time while working"
good,Great company to work for and I had hoped to retire with. REviewed reports and diagnosed what went well and what did not. I learned how to build a strong team and how to use teamwork to be successful. Hardest part of the job was meeting the demands of goals which increased at times double digits. Most enjoyable part of this job was teaching frontline leadership to grow and promoted to the next level.
good,"Every day is unloading and loading packages from and to trucks and scanning the package to the right truck or work area. After one full trailer is done, I switch the empty trailer for another full trailer. Work can get busy and hard. Co-workers are great to get along. They will joke around sometimes. They will always try to have a smile in the morning. Anywhere in the warehouse is tough, no hard part in the job, but maybe one or three spots will be very busy. The managers are very friendly and will train with you and ask your assistance if needed."
good,A typical day day at work consisted of loading and unloading packages from trailers for half the shift and Operating a switcher tractor to remove and put up new trailers on the docks. I learned how to back up trailers from 28 to 52' to docks proficiently. Management was great they got the job done and provided plenty of direction. There was a lot of workers there and they came and went do to the work load. The hardest part was constantly lifting packages while keeping up with the flow to the trailer. The most enjoyable part was everyone could have fun as long as the work was getting done.
good,"thoroughly enjoyed working for this company, team was very cooperative."
good,Great company to work for part time and Full. Management is great. It all depends on how well you work and how much time you put in.
good,"If you can handle the physical demands, this is a great place to work."
good,"Great company, but the dockworker position would be better if we can work more than 30 hours per week.  The company does offer benefits after working there for a certain amount of time.  The pay is well, but would love for them to offer more hours.  I love my job and what I do for the customers of FedEx.  We work hard on our own as dockworkers, but since we are a team we love to help each other when needed."
good,Enjoy working here. A typical day is really relaxed and smooth depending on how much freight is supposed to be sent out.
good,Great company with plenty of room for advancement within. The hardest part of the job is working the night shift. Overall a good work environment with plenty of direct management communication.
good,Excelente para colocar em prática todo conhecimento adquirido em estudo. Gerência com fácil acesso e aberta para novas sugestões e opiniões.
good,"Great company, and great benefits. To provide an efficient pick up and delivery service, support to customers on any issues regarding features of services, while complying with all operational, security and safety policies, procedures and processes with the objective of meeting service commitments and maximizing customer satisfaction."
good,"Definitely a great place to work at. Great co workers and Great benefits. Fast paced environment, company cares about their employees. Very flexible with schedule. Hardest part of the job is making sure packages are loaded by certain time frame and making sure all packages are scanned."
good,Fedex has excellent policy procedure and equipment. Management is very in line with all operations and if it were not for the sort hours would have been a great place to retire.
good,"load/unload trucks. Responsible for the physical loading, unloading and/or sorting of packages by hand, including lifting, pushing, pulling, carrying and placing, in a safe and efficient manner. Package Handlers (PHs) may be assigned to or rotate through various areas and positions such as Loader, Unloader, Scan Weigh and Key (SWAK)."
good,"Gerencia próxima e sempre ciente dos acontecimentos, ambiente agradável."
good,My day consisted of loading and unloading trucks. I learned how to operate a propane forklift while learning how to properly load trucks. The hardest part of the job was to make sure you are moving enough freight an hour. But the best part of the job was you were always busy.
good,the job is very fast paced and requires you to be n your feet for all hours. i learned how to load trailers by hand as well with heavy equipment. as well as communication skills with radios and other cultures.
good,I have enjoyed my last four and a half years with the company. It is a great workplace with advancement opportunities.
good,"A regular day is very busy and fast paced. I started off unloading trucks and slowly moved on, which is the best part of the job. This job requires a team effort, the hardest part is to work with a team member that is not motivated. If you are not ready to work hard day in and out this job is not for you."
good,A typical work day at Fedex consist of arriving to a on time clocking in 15 minutes before start time. I learned at Fedx older people can be lazy and start drama at times. Management at Fedex wasnt that well. Some of my co-workers were nice others were lazy leave the slide for 20 minutes or just sit down and not do anything. The Hardest part of my job at fedx is making sure I dont fall when knocking boxes down the slide or making sure I dont injury myself on the job. The enjoyable part for me was the benefits that FedEx offered me and giving me job.
good,Busy and productive atmosphere that teaches it's employees to self manage and step up to the daily challenges that occur.
good,You are stacking packages daily and you will not be bored.  Its a workout.  Managment was great and you got help if you needed it.  The hardest part was making sure you was in shape.  The co-workers made it a great place to work.
good,each night/ morning we stretch to get our body loose and ready to move none stop until the next shift. I worked full time. OTP shift and Preload shift. Load and unload boxes unto the truck or unto the conveyor belt. You have to have an good scan each night.
good,"The type of work was very fast and they have very good team work. I learned how to activate pallets and how to verify and move the pallets too there  proper door location.I also learned how to scan packages and weight them, and cherry pick in specific lanes, how to face packages so you can see the proper letter location, and finally how to sort the packages coming down a big slide.My co-workers where very friendly and helpful whenever you needed assistance. The hardest part of the job was to find a lost pallets because sometimes co-workers would place the pallets in the wrong door.The most enjoyable part of the job was that you get recognize for your work. The management was excellent because the managers would listen to your concerns."

good,"Very good place to work, learned many new skills and still learning new management skills.  If you want to advance then Fedex helps you get where you want to get."
good,"Good in Techs, good people culture, top leadership is good."
good,"My typical work day, loading my truck with freight to be delivered to customers on my route. Learning each day that doing my job to the best of my ability makes customers and my company happy. Management is only used when difficult times come along which isn't that often. The hardest part of my job is when we don't get freight on time and my day is pushed back it takes a little more time trying to get my customers to understand that there was a delay in the arrival of the freight due to certain circumstances. The most enjoyable part of my job is seeing my customers happy when I walk in the door knowing they can depend on me to get the job done and when I can return back to my job location with my truck empty because I've delivered all my freight."
good,Unload freight and help load trucks. learned how to run routes for deliveries. You could move up in management if choose to. Workers was fun to work with. The hardest part of the job was unloading the freight. The most enjoyable part was driving and delivering.
good,"One of the best jobs I ever held. A lot of responsibility and very ,very fast paced. This was a very safety oriented , time sensitive position. So many variables drove this position, but overall at the end of the day it was a very fulfilling job. The only other job that was more appealing to me would have been the Army."
good,It was a nice place to work just needed more hours to work. The co-workers were nice and outgoing people.
good,"great place to work, just not enough hours would have made a lot of people happier"
good,"Typical day involved driving to other warehouses and places to pick up packages, lifting heavy boxes and stacking them."

good,"Great place to work, good pay comparing to other companies in the same area;"
good,"We start the day by stretching out and have a quick meeting about yesterdays work pace, number of boxes today, safety and damge reduction topics, then we work fast and safe through the day the entire day and leave before 9:30 pm"
good,"There were some managers there that were far from being nice or understanding. Some were condescending even. There were even others who had no ethics while they worked there. Every job has workers/managers that are a mixture of bad things. Also, every job has managers/workers that far exceed quality. I had managers at times that were very understanding of my health (Diabetic) and the times that I had to leave or be absent due to my diabetes being out of control. The H.R. lady even helped me sign up with AETNA for FMLA leave (Intermittent) and at the end of my job it was Continuous leave."
good,"Technology, quality, customer satisfaction, and people are priorities with FedEx. FedEx provides opportunity for personal development through excellent training and upward mobility within the many divisions of the company."
good,at fedex ground you need to be physically and mentally prepared. If not you will not last here. They have great benefits here.

good,Load and unload trailers.
good,"Working for fedex is great. You constantly have things to do so being bored was never considered. My typical day was to make pallets that would stack up at least 7 to 8 ft. high, neatly so the packages dont fall then wrap up my my work in saran wrap for shipping. Or I would unload the packages from the inbound trucks. Everyone I worked with was pretty nice. The supervisors were very helping and always there when you had questions or needed assistance. The best part of the job was working with the other employees because you never really know who you might work with next because you constantly work with someone new and dealing with different personalities on the job."
good,A day at FedEx Smartpost is going into loaded trailers and keeping the companies sort slide full in order to keep productivity high. Ive learned how to work with different people with a variety of attitudes and personalities. The management is superb on working with other employees to keep everyone satisfied. My fellow employees are very enjoyable to work with and its a pleasure to work there. There has not been a very hard point in my job that i would have a complaint about. The most enjoyable is just going to work knowing i help with the productivity of the company to make it grow.
good,"The job itself was a good challenge in the fact that I was completely new to it all. Through hard work I was able to get into the groove of things after a while, with the hardest thing getting used to the routes and just having the knowledge of the areas. It's a rather fun job with all of the driving though and getting to see the different areas while interacting with the customers."
good,fedex is a great company to work for. they know how to take care of thier employees. the management is good and work well with team members and try their best to make all team members feel comfortable and professional in the work place. i love working one on one with customers and seeing thier expressions when everything goes as planned.
good,Everything at fedex was great. I learned alot about team work and productivity. The hardest part probably was peak. The most enjoyable part was probably pay day and the people you get to meet along the way.
good,Well a typical work night consist of me co- leading in the preperation with my manager for the smalls area of the warhouse. Ive learned about the shipping process as well as loading and unloading along with downpiling to the pallets. The management there is great as well as my co workers. The hardest part of the job is the long hours of me standing on my feet. The most enjoyable part of fed ex is recieving my pay check.
good,great place to work helpful co workers everyone hepls eachother i learned the true meaning of team work
good,"A typical day at work is a 3 hour shift. We pack miscelaneous packages into trailers, sometimes one person is assigned two or three to themselves at a time. Occasionally you will recieve help from coworkers if you are having trouble keeping up with your flow. The management is excellent, they listen to you and keep you motivated. Coworkers are hard to get to know in this environment only because you are trying to achieve the best possible producitvity rate and that doesn't leave much time for chit chat. The hardest part of the job is all the heavy lifting and keeping up with the fastest people. The most enjoyable part of the job is seeing that you can finish a trailer on your own, and the feeling of accomplishment you get from doing a good, hard job everyday."
good,When arriving at work would go straight to our cubical and log onto our computers and start making calls to the FedEx customers. We would have three 30minute breaks and hour lunch.
good,"A typical day at work involves a lot of customer interaction. An employee must be flexible enough to help customers with many needs: printing, faxing, shipping, and others."
good,"The shiftwork can be brutal and work is labor intensive, but if you can handle that, the pay is outstanding."
good,"I learned alot about working with computers, microsoft, and adobe. A typical day at work would consist of answering the phone, making copies, taking orders, shipping and recieving packages, and selling the product of the month such as anything that is on sale for that particular month. My boss has taught me alot especially working on the computer and how to better serve a customer in need. One of the hardest parts about working for FedEx office would be getting use to all the different programs that you have to go through to get to anything throught the company sites and taking customer orders. It took me a while to get to know all of the different programs that are used but now that i am familiar with it, its alot easier to get through. Although i do enjoy the fact that i can put a smile on customers' faces. Helping customers and answering phones are what i really enjoy about working for FedEx. At this job there are only 3 other co-workers besides me. They are all fun to get along with, great attitudes, and helpful when i need time off for somthing."
good,It's a very fast pace environment and extremely noisey. Temperatures can vary from very hot to cold. Usually a sort can last three to four hours a night. The hardest part is lifting the different packages that come in.
good,No breathers straight work from clock in to clock out the type of work I can do standind for.Long periods of time while doin loading and unloading protocols.
good,Fed Ex is a great place to work and has great benefits. Lots of room to expand
good,Fedex ground was a good company to work with what I learned that it was a team based job and everyone helps no matter what was the cause. My co-workers were hard working people too they made worked in this fast paced environment. The most enjoyable part of the job was the early morning wake up and the hard but fun part was just making sure the belts for all the packages were separated and delivered to the right truck.
good,"fast pace,meeting new people,looking how big the planes are"
good,"As a part-time dockworker for Fed Ex Freight, I experienced a comfortable work environment that allowed me to learn the skills I needed to complete daily tasks and understand what was expected in terms of performance level."
good,"attending to clients according to their needs , answer phone calls , attend to customer files."
good,Loading and Unloading trucks at a very fast pace. Very hot in the summer. Very cold in the winter. Getting paid to work out five days a week. No weekend work. Great benefits. Good Pay. Good people.
good,FedEx Express is a great company with many opprtunities to grow in the company and rise to the top
good,"Working for FedEx is fun yet difficult, it is great job if you like hard work and lifting. I personally enjoyed it when i was loading 2 trucks at the same time but then they moved me to 3 trucks and I couldn't handle it.."
good,"Though I have only been here 4 months, management is very positive and responsive to my personal ambitions and they reward good additudes and high work ethic with more desirable roles and ligher levels of responsibility."
good,FedEx Ground great place to work if you are ok with a fast pace work environment. FedEx only offers part time for package handlers. your job is to unload packages from inbound trucks onto a conveyor belt. then each package is scanned and tagged with a route number. from there the packages are sorted onto different belts depending on route number. then the packages are sorted for each driver and are put on pallets for the drivers to re-scan and put into their trucks for delivery.
good,"Honestly, it's a great job you get great pay, but they overwork their employees even after there shift ended don't mind it cause overpay but this is for athletic people"
good,I was earlier morning shift it's was great waken up unload the trailer which really wake you but they want you to stay their to long to get more money and get pute in position.its not all but some of them favorite people. So others was selected over other.its not a out perform so i can get the spot it's let see who I'm going to give the spot to
good,"FedEx is a very good company to work for. If it had possible I would have liked to spend my whole career with them. At times the workload is vast, but comparable with other companies. This being a common problem throughout the industry. Aircraft maintenance engineers/mechanics numbers are in desperate decline."
good,"The attendance policy is terrible, safety is the second priority, and they make you lift heavy boxes with no help. I would have enjoyed my time there if the pay check was more."
good,"I would still be working here, had I not been in a car accident.  The pay was great and the job was easy.  The only downer is when it's freezing out side and you're on the dock on the forklift and the wind is basically freezing your face.  I bought plenty of masks though, so it was ok."
good,Es una empresa que te daba estabilidad y te permitía dar a conocer tus ideas ya ha cambiado pero sigue dando estabilidad.
good,"Delivered packages to customers"
good,"Great place to work at, friendly people, friendly supervisors, clean place, has cool air conditioner whenever you get hot. Good paying rate. You make friends with your co-worker."
good,"Had a blast. Learned many things. No Drama at the location I was working. Very helpful staff and co-workers when asked. ALWAYS REMEMBER TO ASK, sometimes everyone are too busy provide info... so ask."
good,Very fast pace atmosphere and very busy but overall great place to work. Would love to retire from there some day. The benifits are excellent as well!
good,"I had a variety of positions at fed ex first being a secretary to a director at a call center in Sacramento, CA."
good,"Typical day includes starting around 9 am. The summers usually start way later as decent weather means way more freight to move. Though it's not policy, being at such a small center allowed me to keep my same truck every single day and almost always had the same route. This meant I got to know customers very well. FedEx Freight only guarantees 30 hours of work per week. So getting hours during the winter was sometimes a struggle."
good,"PROS:   Actually worked for a 3rd party vendor that did IT for FedEx employees but we still fell under FedEx from what I understood....Anyways I am a full-time college student seeking a nursing degree and they allowed all the students to schedule work around school schedules. There was always weekly awards for meeting goals and about once a month we would have food catered for making performance goals. "
good,"It's rough work but the managers are great people, and if you're willing to stick it out and put your best into it, the company will work with you, they start you slow and build you up as you become more conditioned to the physical work."
good,I loved working there was stressful at times and very physical but other then that pay was great management was fairly nice was laid back just wish the climate control was little better other then that gravy
good,"I would work there again and I'm happy that I was given the opportunity to work with Fed Ex Freight. You can always look on the job board for more opportunities. I've been with the company off and for twenty years.If in the future I need another part time job,I would work for them again."
good,Provided a fun fast paced environment for the early risers. Management was very understanding of any issues or concerns you may have. Great team building environment.
good,overall easy job can get boring at times. you mostly load boxes into trailers and aircraft cans. Management is relaxed and easy going. They offer on sight job training.
good,"I have to say, I have never worked in a warehouse before.  Because of extenuating circumstances I find myself working there now."
good,"Very physically demanding job but it was fun and relatively easy, most of the Courier's at my station were more than willing to lend a helping hand when needed. managers were great, always collaborating with each other and employees to find the easiest and most efficient way to do things."
good,Como call center billingue existe mucha presión por ser un filtro de atención a clientes
good,"I love working for such an awesome company. Awesome benefits and decent pay. I love everyone I work with and work for. It may not be the most glamorous job, but it certainly gets the bills paid when needed."
good,Been working at FedEx for a while now and I really enjoy working there. I've been treated as if I'm an important part of where I work and that makes me happy to keep working there. They also have great benefits.
good,fedex you have to move quick and smart sometimes you might get a manger that's acts kinda mean but that's apart of life and the work place is nice but when its cold its cold when its hot so dress appropriate.
good,one of the best company in the US great pay and good benefits. lots of work company is growing . management can be better but ok  also wish we get paid more. lots of hours plus OT.
good,"E' una compagnia aerea merci con servizio di trasporto espresso che ha dato la giusta valutazione all'aspetto ""People"", inserendo una serie di benefit aziendali e accesso a piattaforme di E-learning che spronava alla continua autoformazione. Purtroppo a causa di riorganizzazione aziendali in Italia la mia esperienza sta finendo, ma per questo non posso non considerare i quasi 7 anni passati all'interno di questa azienda."
good,Supervisor was cool with there employee Fedex look out for all there employee took trips were every you wanted to go.  Fedex was a company you can always move up in the company because they had training classes.
good,a typical Days come in month Of December. Where we have to handle more then 450 boxes an hour. we learned how to handle boxes. how did the management work.
good,"Empresa muito boa de se trabalhar, funcionários bastante acolhedores, verdadeiros lideres."
good,I enjoyed the challenge of learning new things and being able to advance in the company.  I had excellent training and was offered to learn more when I felt ready for it.
good,Loved working their but just needed room too grow was in the positions all my time their couldn't advance forward took on new tasks did inventory once a month memember of the safety team CPR certificated
good,Extremely good company but little ability to rapidly advance due to seniority preferences over ability. Takes most years to become full-time. Incredible benefits and excellent pay.
good,"Busy but rewarding!  FDX has many opportunities for advancement, if you are successful in station management.  I advanced up the corporate ladder every 1.5 to 2 years with them."
good,cut throat job that never stops. you better be prepared to work because a chain is only as strong as the weakest link. don't be friends because you probably don't have time to talk.
good,"FedEx is a great place to work with plenty of opportunity. From the benefits to the training, it is a hard company to beat. The only downside is that if you are in management it is difficult to maintain a family/work balance."
good,Love the job & people as well. I’m planning on being here for the long run. Because there are literally endless opportunities. I hope to become manager
good,typical day was i got my truck hooked to my trailer and delivered the freight in the trailer. very good company to work for. great benefits very good management. they care for the company.
good,great place to work...awesome benefits. Fast paced work. wonderful place to work if you need a second job! Medical and Dental insurance can't be beat. Travel benefits are wonderful.
good,"The hours are variable and are determined by the amount of inbound freight. As a dockworker, opportunities for raises and moving up are actually pretty good. Benefits are excellent, even for part time. I highly recommend this position for anyone needing to supplement their income while providing the security and stability of excellent benefits. I do not recommend it as a main source of income, as the hours are limited to 15 to 25 hours a week."
good,"I enjoyed my time working at FedEx. They have quality managers, benefits, an no forced overtime. The ability to transfer to a different city or state is a great perk."
good,"Me gusta trabajar y ser positivo, me gusta set honesto y si tengo la oortunidad de ayudar a otros lo have sin esperar nada acambio."
good,i like to work for fedex because is good place to work and good benefit but i loose this job because i travel to africa. and i like to meet the other people friendly  with people is a good place to advance .
good,Great management and great team work. Lots of advancements if interested. Fun place to work. Management acknowledges your work and you are rewarded with points able to pick out anything you like with your reward points. Often everyone is rewarded for a great job!
good,"A typical day at work involves same routine of managing inbound and outbound logistics. However, every day presents new unseen challenges which improve your decision making capabilities in tensed and fast paced work environment"
good,"I enjoyed working under the conditions presented to me."
good,load trucks / unload truck unload tuggers help other lines  go to other areas  help co-workers lead the team be helpful when need stay productivity people loved to see me come in there area
good,"A typical day at work would be analyzing data and building reports for management, performing administrative duties, coordinating events, setting up meetings, stocking supplies, and continuous improvement applications to various processes. "
good,"- Fast paced but felt like comrades "
good,"a typical work day at Fedex is fun, i learned a whole lot working their and how everything is on a set time and the smallest infraction can cause something to go wrong."
good,"Its a great company , I would most decently recommend to others. Manegers are great there and helpful, they are flexible and always try to help you better your self..."
good,Very fast paced and competitive place to work at.  Management is understandable and is willing to help when they can.  Many opportunities to move up if you so desire.
good,"less than 30 hours a week part time."
good,My job was face pace. We have some days that are busy and slow. I had no problem with management. Management didn't bother you as long as your job was done and completed before the shift ended. I enjoyed working at Fed-Ex. The environment was cold in the winter and hot in the summer. We worked together as a team. Helping each other if needed. We could relaxed and not be pressured as long as we got the trucks loaded and unloaded in a timely manner.
good,I loved this job and it was unfortunate that i had to leave it to move back home. The management are very flexible and work with you. The pay is great and you have plenty of chances to get raises.
good,This is a good company to work for if you like to work by yourself and not have a manager all over your back. I work for a contractor. So there was no benefits such as health dental or vision.
good,"This is my review for the company."
good,"Just an up beat work place, keep on your toes because they'll be watching you to see how you stack up to standard, but will recognize your unique talents as you continue to improve and benefit the company"
good,"load unload trailers using a forklift, learned how to use a forklift, management is friendly and want you to succeed, everyone is friendly and everyone will want to talk"
good,I worked hard with plenty of overtime. spit shift and mostly part time position at best. but to me heavy wait was the best. more of an early but not late shift.
good,Fedex was very easy but hard. I was handler and what I did was throw boxes on the line.What I enjoyed about my job is the workers. The hardest part of my job was picking up heavy boxes. At fedex you must be prepared and ready to work.No breaks at all. What I learned was you got to work hard jobs to get what you want.
good,"A typical day varied depending on the weather and the volume of work as well as the department you were in that day or night.  Starting out as a handler was difficult in the beginning because there is a rate you have to get freight out and it doesn't matter how heavy it may be.  Working as a material handler, work got slightly more attainable and easy.  Material Handlers drive instead of constantly and directly handling freight."
good,"I enjoy what I do, I like my sort manager brent green he's a good manager. Honestly I need to switch shifts but I really don't wanna deal with a new manager, and I like the crew I work with so I really don't wanna work with a new crew either. The hardest part about the job is when we are short of employees and when my scanner don't scan as quick as I would like for it to. The most enjoyable part is when everything is completed at a timely matter, and time flies on the midnight shift."
good,"Great place to work for a part-time job. Depending on the time of year, the work load can effect a person physically. Workplace culture is usually busy but, not very stressful as long as everyone pull together as a team."
good,FedEx was a good position but there was no room for advancement and very little pay increase. It was close to home so the commute was very convenient and they provided excellent benefits.
good,Lifting packages and loading trucks with packages up to 100 lbs. Scanning packages to make sure they are in the right area. Great and hard work out. Fast pace and very challenging.
good,"Aprendi muito sobre sistema. Meus lideres, a gerência e meus colegas de trabanho sempre prestativos. O mais difícil era acordar cedo pois  acordava às 4:20 para pegar no serviço às 6:00. O bom é como eu falei no início, aprendi sobre sistema operacional e tinha muita liberdade para desenvolver minhas tarefas."
good,"job was good to me, managers and co workers were friendly and easy to get along with. It was good for extra money to have in my pocket to do more activities."
good,FedEx Freight is a great company to work for. They truly care about their employees and are very flexible with their schedules and work with you on every level for you to exceed and di better.
good,"As soon as I integrated into the team, the formalities blurred out and we worked as a unit rather than individuals. Couldn't have expected more than that."
good,It good for a person who goes to school and work. The benefits is nice from health insurance to life coverage. I been working for 4 years and it is very fulfilling.
good,Its not a bad job just not very stable hours. It would be nice if FedEx would allow full time dock workers at end of line centers. Usually work around 20 -30 hrs per week.
good,"When i go in to work i know exactly where I'm supposed to be and what I'm suppose to do without management telling me. Very professional and welcoming. The only time it can be rough is when we have a freight truck coming in later than usual and thats when managers have to decide who will be staying back to shuttle the late freight out to there designated routes and who will go and and start delivering the packages we have that can be delivered before commitment time. However, in the event that does happen Fedex notifies all customers in the area about a service disruption and to expect possible late deliveries."
good,A  typical day at FedEx you'll have to run reports and assist couriers with day to day issues. Your the couriers manager at times and resolve customer complaints as well.

good,Due to a transport delay a customer did not receive their package which contained a passport.  I was able to have the package rerouted to the destination which they were traveling.
good,"It is an ambitious company that will become a household brand by a strong long-term vision and a talented team of individuals."
good,"This job is mainly for people who can deal with hard work like lifting up to 75 pounds on own, not afraid of getting minimal injuries like bruises and being fast paced."
good,A average day at work was short. The best part of working at the job was partnering up with my co- workers to complete a task. I was able to learn a lot when I teamed up with my co-workers.
good,where you handwork can actually payoff because there is a lot advancement opportunities once you're in the company. having to to be willing to get your hands dirty from hard work
good,"Great company to work for, pay is excellent and the work is hard but definitely do-able however there is very limited opportunity for growth due to seniority and limited opportunity even if one has greater skills in particular field."
good,". una empresa  que te brinda apoyo "
good,Excelente lugar para trabajar y aprender y desarollarte buena cultura laboral
good,As my first job I enjoyed working for this company. My typical day pretty much was the same....loading and shipping. The co-workers were polite.

good,FedEx is a great company to work for and I've enjoyed it's challenges. Everyday is new and there is always something different to face.
good,"As a FedEx Ground Driver you work until your load is completely delivered, meaning you can't go home until your truck is empty. You get to setup your own route and learn the scanner. You will be trained on use of the scanner for 3 days, by an experienced driver. ASK a lot of questions while on the job, this will help you to master the job and your ability to handle customers needs when they arise. I worked there for 5 years and enjoyed learning the job and meeting some great people along the way. The hardest part about the job is at Christmas time. You will work 6 days a week, usually from  5am to 10pm. That depends on the work load, so drivers finish very early and are at home by 5pm. While on the road, you are your own boss, you take breaks whenever you want. But you still have to get all packages delivered and one more thing FedEx expects you to all Business packages delivered before 5pm or it counts as a failure against you as a driver."
good,"great enviorment to work  at , good people ,  management could be better in certain areas , the job culture is great  most people i enjoyed working with  would love to work for your company again"
good,it does not give the type of hours i would prefer but ts a good job. they should pay more for the hard work the workers are doing
good,Excellent company to work for with even better benefit program that is available even for part timers. Best part of the job was the people I was able to work with. Very challenging during the holiday seasons but exciting environment.
good,"Good company. Discounts with other companies through them. "
good,everyday is was a new challenge and everyday is different everyone worked well together to keep the plant running smoothly and to make sure packages went out on time. management was great they rewarded you for the hard work you put in
good,This was a great company to work for I learn alot and was able to continue my skill set beyond Fedex. .............................................
good,Fun workplace with ample work life balance. A lot of focus on team work. Not the place for you if you like a fast paced life.
good,Very productive workplace with friendly co-workers. Demanding fast pace work environment. Management is always there to help with any questions and has the right mindset towards success.
good,"Split boxes on belt"
good,A rewarding career that is physical hands-on work but offers a meaningful customer experience. The company philosophy promotes    customer satisfaction. A fair mangement team that is mainly grown from within the company helps young couriors establish good customer relations.
good,"Great part time job. Every location is different, so if you get a location like the ones that i have been able to encounter, you'll love the job. the job itself is only as hard as you make it and want it to be."
good,It is a very demanding job. You have to have the drive to work and be very goal oriented within this environment. It is a warehouse setting so you have to be able to work in extreme weather conditions at times.
good,A typical day at Fedex consisted in packing away boxes from the line into the trucks and from the trucks on the lines to be delivered. Management was very flexible and understanding. The hardest part of the job was the lifting was a little bit heavier than anticipated.
good,"I enjoy the people I work with and the people I work for. The working environment is busy, yet professional. This company has great opportunity of advancement, and they provide amazing benefits for their employees. I have a better understanding of how this company works; therefore I have a better appreciation for what they do. The hardest part about this job is the unpredictability of the working hours, based on certain circumstances, but in the end, the work gets done. I truly enjoy the people I work with."
good,"I really liked this job but they hire slackers and I was finding that I had to pick up other peoples slack. Which got to be very tiresome.  They will keep you even if your bad but have good attendance, Wish there where more go getters there."
good,Great job good people management and co workers you learn a lot from people you work with daily day begins at 7pm to 11pm mon-fri no hard parts to the job enjoy working and making a living best part of the job
good,"Come in everyday at 7:00pm, clock in and get to work. The place is fun to work in, your co-workers are relatable and always ready to help should a problem arise. Whenever there is a problem that requires you to wait for any period of time, you can wait in the break room, pour yourself some coffee and get a snack before going back to work. The conditions are great, and you get taken care of. The benefits kick in in about 3 months or less and they are absolutely amazing. The work is easy but demanding, so essentially all you have to do is get yourself up to speed and keep it up. Easy enough, right? If you have any problem that requires you to speak to a manager directly, They are always there to help you and they do so in the best way they can. To kind of give you an idea, I was a good, hard worker. Because of that, whenever I saw that some people had a certain hat that I liked, I asked one of the managers if I could get one. Three days later, the manager called me off of work for about three minutes to his office just to present me with the FedEx hat I had asked for. If that doesn't prove that the job conditions are good, then I don't know what would."
good,The most enjoyable part is that I work the overnight so I still got time to work a second job and spend time with my family during the day
good,went in for work did the work went home. I learned how to work a dolly and the belts that the packages went on . my co- workers I liked they all were fun and made the day go faster . some of the trucks that we unloaded were not packed right and the people on the belt made the work harder stopping the belt and the most enjoyable part of my job was the money
good,Busy .Be it when delivering mail or working at the desk for customer care.managers are very respectful.They interact well with other employees.Co workers are great.Hardest part of the job is to get lost while looking for a particular address to deliver mail.
good,Very nice place to work with great pay and some very great co workers. I worked there for a summer but it is a place I could of saw myself staying and advancing in the company.
good,a typical day at work was never very typical everything was different from day to day. I learned how to load a truck pretty quick. the hardest part of the job was getting more hours
good,I love the Company and its fast pace style of work. LI have learned that loading and unloading of packages take time and skills. Management is great they really look out for their employees through all needs and understanding of their position. My co-workers are great and always willing to lend a hand. The hardest part is keeping up your scan rate. I enjoy the workout you get by doing this job.
good,Easy work once you get use to it. Body will be sore the first couple of weeks but it is not that bad afterwards. The work is mostly consistent. They pay every week which is a plus.
good,Every day there is normal for me. The people are cool. Management is cool. Its just like any other job I just come in get it done and go home.
good,I have been here for many years and experienced different locations and office environments.
good,Was working here part time 4 hours a day if lucky. Fast moving pace. Co workers were help full. Just unloading trucks.
good,"fast paced"
good,Typical day of work was 40 hours a week.  I learned a lot about Fraud and Security area.  Management was very easy to work for and very flexible with work/life balance.  Co-workers were very friendly and experienced.  Hardest part of the job was to figure out if the items was indeed fraud or just a mistake.  Most enjoyable part of the job was the challenge of working with fraud.
good,"The internship mainly consists of going through each set of FedEx Freight's field operations, including sales, city and road dispatch, billing, and supervising dock operations. This makes for a fantastic learning tool; I came away with knowledge of the entire supply chain rather than just one or two parts of it. The people with whom I worked, including management, were all very helpful making sure that I learned everything I could and still worked hard to completed their goals for the day. There weren't all that many difficult areas, although I was the service center's second intern so they were a bit confused with what to do with me. I really enjoyed getting out of the office with the city drivers and sales representatives. I would highly recommend apply for this internship because it teaches you a lot not only about FedEx but about the LTL industry as well."
good,Very fast pace part time job early in the am. I learn how to manage the work area in about a year being at the job. Management and co-workers are pretty good when we all working together to get the job done. Hardest part of my job is when packages are coming heavy while im loading three trucks at same time. The most enjoyable part of my job is getting a good report on a daily basic.
good,"Ok you work hard at FedEx but you are paid very well, great Benefits and they treat you like family."
good,Fedex is one of the most stressful job I have worked. Only becuase of the physical actives. I load and unload boxes every 6 sec to meet my manager standards.
good,Fedex gave me the opportunity to grow within the company. I started off as a package handler going to work every day making sure I got the job done. Then I got promoted to a WALPH( work area lead package handler) then I got promoted to Service Manager.
good,"I believe that overall a typical day at work includes fast paced work, good workout, and great learning experience. Talking to my peers/co-workers, I learned that being a package handler isn't the only option I have. Working my way up to different positions in Fed Ex requires experience up to at least 1 to 2 years. My goals is to learn new skills and gain knowledge to achieve upward mobility within the organization. "
good,Prodction atmosphere. Lifting bending and pulling products. Standing for a long period of time. This job requries endurance. Teamwork is a must.
good,"Our typical day is very busy and set on a deadline. This helps me push to meet a certain bills per hour goal of 10 or better. I unload trailers and load for delivery. "
good,a typical day at work included coming in and breifing my team on da flight arrival times nd issuing equipment.
good,"I like that fedex has taught me to be precise and what it is like to continually work hard for a long period of time. I would scan the boxes as they came down the belt and had to scan it to the right truck. i had three trucks i was assigned; I had to to place the boxes in the correct section on each truck. Management was a little too expectant but then it was only to build mental strength. co workers for the most part worked hard, there was no time to complain only time to work so you pick up where work is lacking and keep moving. Hardest part of the job was scanning and placing the boxes in the correct section before you get backed up with boxes that are continuously coming on the conveyor belt. Most enjoyable part was when you beat the probability and end up clearing all the boxes before anymore boxes come."
good,Even part-time position will work with you to try and get you more hours on your pay check!
good,great company with awesome people. Always willing to lend a hand with all workers and upper management always there to help too
good,loading various size packages in a efficient and safe manner.
good,"Very diverse co-workers, always advancement opportunities"
good,"aprendi a fazer controle de estoque, inventario, boa convivência com os amigos de trabalho, tendo agradecido pelo a oportunidade, mas infelizmente foi contrato de final de ano, não seria efetivo"
good,"At most I would work 2-3 hours a day, Monday through Friday. During Peak season, I can work up to 3-4 hours. No Cell phones or personal items are allowed in the Building. Access with a badge. I learned how to properly handle shipping packages, check for damaged packages and the process of how to correct a damaged package ( i.e. if only the box needs replaced or if the product itself has been damaged) This leads to a satisfied customer more willing to continue shipping through FedEx. The hardest part of the job is the weather conditions while unloading trailers ( i.e if its snowing outside, the trailer will be freezing cold). The heat is the worst part. Management is great, They are very reasonable and understanding. Had no problems with them at all. Co-workers are easy to get along with. They help you out if you need it and/or ask for it. The most enjoyable part of working at FedEx is the People that I work with."
good,great place to work in meet wonder co-worker if you love working fast pace then fed ex is it can move up fast if you put in hard work
good,delivering packages in north fort worth.  giving customer service to clients daily.  following all traffic laws and driving carefully large cargo vans
good,A typical day at work starts with the focused goal of getting freight from point A to point B in an efficient manner. There is always a sense of urgency. I've learned that the quality of ones work will no doubt affect the quantity for the better. Managers are always on hand to assist. All coworkers actively participate as team members. The hardest part of the job is trying to get work done without the correct equipment. The most enjoyable part of the job is getting freight to the aircraft on time every night.
good,"The benefits were great "
good,"start a 3   Am"
good,Its a moderate paced job with equitable compensation.  They really stress the importance of safety and teamwork.
good,I love working for fedex I just wish I was full-time instead of part-time
good,"Typical day would include loading and unloading truck by forklift "
good,"Helped load and unload trucks, sorted documents, and went to help out other accounts"
good,"Unloading and loading was the main part of my job. It allowed me to stay in shape and also gave me the opportunity to get to know my co-workers and managers. It was a very fun environment, I enjoyed the challenge of lifting heavy work loads. I can also say that was the hardest part as well in the beginning. I learned how to physically take care of myself better."
good,"One of the best companies I have ever worked for in my life. They offer great wages, benefits, paid time off, and the ability to career advance, if you are willing to put in the time and possibly move. There is so much potential if you know what you're looking for. I would recommend this company to anyone and everyone. The management is understanding and on the same page. Everyone works for a common goal. "
good,FedEx is a great place to work but the pay could be a lot better. They have all the benefits that you will ever need. 
good,"I enjoy working for FedEx ground.  They have pushed through economic hardships and made sure no layoffs happened within the company.  The job I do is simple but physically demanding.  I love the people I work for and have a fun time with management.  The rewards are many here; from free shirts and hats, breakfast or cookouts for goals met, amazing health benefits, retirement, etc."
good,it was a nice place towork but the people their were very rude managers included and likedto belittle you..
good,I clean out the code 8 cage and than I handle documents. After sorting documents I handle and sort the packages by zip codes. The employees are diverse and the easiest part of the job is communicating with other and the hardest part is the relationship between management and employees. The most enjoyable part of the job are the benefits.
good,"I've been with FedEx for a short while now, but I can say this is probably one of the few companies that actually cares for you as an individual. Regardless of it 100,000+ employees, at my location, you aren't just a number, we're a family !"
good,We start out loading a truck with packages sliding down from a shoot and prepping them evenly so as to keep the movement to a minimum. I learned how to properly stack as well as lift using my feet and not my back. My co-workers were of no issue and pretty cool people. Hardest part was doing the job itself. Most enjoyable was that random basketball court we used after work.
good,A typical day at fedex is hard working. I have learned how to be on time for work and how to sort boxes. The co-workers are very nice and everyone get along. The hardest part of the job is when you have to work at a certain pace and the most enjoyable part of the job is learning about the shipping industry.
good,good place to work nice people great location this job lets you be you
good,go in do a team meeting talk about whats on todays agendas and who get what routes and who's working with whom .
good,"Atypical day at Fedex consist of overlooking mail, responding to necessary messages, assisting contractors and drivers to situate their daily routs, troubleshooting within the Quality Assurance team to resolve incorrect address information, providing efficient customer services to all customers, answering phones, creating copying, and filing important paperwork. I have learned how to work effectively with others in a fast paced environment. I feel the management of Fedex could make some minor improvements to create a more positively influential atmosphere while working. The hardest part of my job at Fedex is multitasking fast enough to satisfy the above management. The most enjoyable part of my job is satisfying customers and working together effectively."
good,"I worked the night shift at FedEx so a typical day of work started at 6pm for me. Normally, packages would flow in slowly to start the evening, but once 7:30 would hit they would start flowing in. We would have to load trailers with packages and sometimes scan those packages to make sure they were going to the correct address. On a good night with a good pace, I could get one truck out and fill half of the second truck before my shift was over. I learned that there's a reason some jobs are called ""hard labor"". This was a good job, but you had to be up for the challenge. Management was great. I had a really down to earth shift manager who made our shift a little easier. The hardest part of the job would definitely be when a small package would come into the trailer and it appeared to be light and I would go to pick it up and it would be the heaviest package in the trailer. Or when we would have a slow night and our shift manager would let us go home early. I never liked that because we wouldn't earn anything for that night. The most enjoyable part about it was the conversations between the co-workers."
good,What i learned alot and management. I learned to listen to your employees and find the right way to coach.
good,"Everyday is a different and challenging experience, which I look forward to, because I work with the best co-workers."
good,"Very repetitious work. You get in a trailer, packages come down the chute, and you build walls and check zip codes. There were times I'd be working two or three trailers at once because of so many packages. I loved it though. The quick pace makes the day go buy so quickly. My manager was one of my favorite people on our side. He was very down to earth yet a good leader with good communication skills. The co-workers were all much more experienced than I but the did not look down on me at all. We work as a team to get the job done. I miss this job."
good,"We would have a staff meeting every morning where it would tell us who's team made more calls made, how fast and how many upsells were made."
good,This company and position were excellent. It was for personal reasons I left. They have excellent benefits and pay great for the position. The only con about the job is you have to bid on shifts which are based on seniority.
good,"I'm usually out on the dock working with or helping my package handlers. To help make sure that we keep the belts running, so that we can get the drivers dispatched on time. I work well with my co-workers, they're fun and energetic which makes the work place much more enjoyable.The most enjoyable part of my job is not knowing what's going to happen that day. Everyday is something different and a new challenge."
good,"Well a typical day at work starts with parking.. then you have to walk to the shuttle bus station where you have to wait patiently for a bus. The bus takes you to the actual workplace. then you go through security and proceed to your area. It starts with the daily stretch and flex, basically to warm up your muscles and get them prepared to lift freight up to 75lbs. After that, you proceed to your line and you process the freight onto the three different conveyer belts. The hardest part of the job was the mail bags. the fun part of the job was working with people you have grown to like while working for the company."
good,The days are very busy from open to close
good,Great company to work for if you want full benefits for part time work. The job is labor intensive depending on what your doing.
good,"typical day at work would be providing customer service, make copies, place printing orders, and process shipping packages."
good,"At the office I would give tours to all interested candidates that wanted to apply, to then screen applicants and conduct interviews. Prepare paperwork for new hire orientations, attend staff meetings, engagement meetings, and conference calls. Assist employees with all questions regarding benefits, direct deposit, tuition reimbursement, payroll, leave of absence, disability, training, and any complaints. Ensure all my paperwork was in place for audit purpose, return calls, processed reports and work on all pending items."
good,"I started working here 3 years ago and I do not regret it. This is a part time job with unique benefits. During my typical day, I am responsible to scan more that 5,000- 8,000 packages everyday and with my ability to hear ( Yes, I am hard of hearing ) is a blessing. I am able to think quickly, act fast, and do the job effectively. The best part about the job is getting all the knowledge I can, show leadership among women and minorities, achieve my goals, and career advancement."
good,Overall the nature of this business was extremely wonderful due to the fact that they were very competitive with UPS as a fast pace working environment.
good,great company that will challenge you and give you support to be successful.  Company that is growing and has been in the top 10 companies to work for.
good,My time working at Fedex was a great experience. Employees was good with helping each other out when another employee was running behind. Also employees would call each before they clocked to make sure you were ok
good,Safely is the most important thing at this job. Employee understanding what you are doing and your duties to unload the trucks. You learn how to lift and place the packages on the belts. You also get the opportunity to grow in the company
good,"The experience i had working at FedEx was real competitive, and the reason i say that is because we are always on the move. Once we finish one truck its off to the next constantly so we can meet a certain quota of how many trucks we needed unloaded."
good,Although I no longer work for the company I truly appreciated my time at FedEx. The management was very helpful and supportive towards me and really strived in accommodating the needs of employees.
good,it was my first real job i loved it a whole lot . wish i could work there again because thats some i like to do all night i like the environment  that i was working in too.
good,Everyone is pretty humble and is willing to help you get the job done. Management is pretty great and if you need help everyone around you can probably help you before you need to go to management for your problems.
good,"Great place to work, the company overall is goal oriented and makes sure all employyes are aware of the expectations placed upon them. Coworkers can easily become friends and management is often very approachable and willing to help newcomers."
good,It’s very fast pace and mostly always busy. Never slack or not do anything because there is a chance they will send you home. It’s non stop working.  There’s always something you can help out with.
good,I enjoy working at Fedex. Its a good environment good money. I have no problems with the manager or with my co workers. Fast paced which is good and you learn a lot too.
good,"Good job, fun, fast paced, not for people who don’t like staying on your feet for long amounts of hours on end.yeah . All n all it is a solid place to work if you like that sort of stuff"
good,I’d recommend this place. It’s a good place to work. Sometimes it depends on the people that you work with. It’s a great opportunity for you to explore.
good,"Management there doesn't treat you as one of their employees, they treat you as one of their peers. Awesome work culture. Professional and friendly atmosphere."
good,Over all. It was a great place to work.  The hardest part of the job it was that there was no end time.  You could work 8 hours one day and the next be there for 14 hours.
good,Great place to work for people with a second job or students looking to work part-time. The job is physical and hours vary depending on the volume of packages.
good,"This is a Fortune Magazine top 10 best Employers to work for. For package handling the environment is very fast pace almost like a war zone but it is also very rewarding. It may be physically demanding but it will get you in shape and the management, pay, and befits are top noche in this company."
good,"Fedex was a great place to work for. I appreciate the training and skills I have learned from the company. Working with fedex was like family. You are with them 8 hours a day. The hardest part of leaving fedex was leaving your co-workers. We had a nice lunch area outside to eat in the summer. On certain holidays, we were able to bring in foods to celabrate what ever holiday it was."
good,"It was a great experience to work at Fedex. The job required you to be social and work as a team to be able to complete certain task. Fedex gave me the opportunity to do more leadership roles, such as train incoming employees how to perform the job."
good,I love working for Fedex as a courier. I get to work outside as well as meet new people everyday on my route. The hardest part of the job is lifting heavy packages. We are required to lift at least 75 lbs. This can get tiresome if you have more than one package weighing that much.
good,"I learned quick and easy from the other workers there, everyone was nice, supportive, understanding, and were on their feet at all times even if the freight was late."
good,"fast Pase"
good,"I was able to wear many hats at FedEx. A handler, driver, dispatcher and manager. I learned to work fast, multi task, drive a tractor, operate a fork lift and manage employees. Management was good. They allowed you to learn and advance. The hardest part was coping with the weather in the winter. The most enjoyable part was everyday was different and I enjoyed the challenge each day brought"
good,Great for 2nd job. Good leadership. Good team. Dock is basically a cover so outside temperature is what you get. Company provides great benefits for part-time employees. Employees are fed often. Some MHE outdated.
good,Typical day includes loading and off loading trucks and planes. Scanning packages on the conveyor belt. Making sure planes are stocked with refreshments for the piolts and planes ensuring the planes are completed in the computer before take off.
good,The only thing I  didn't like about the company was how they split the hours. I couldn't work late nights so I was only able to work 3 hours a day. The atmosphere was great and so were my co-workers.
good,"I learned how to be part of a team, I learned to do a high pace job quickly, and accurately because others in my team depended on me to do so. It was a great building block to learning how a team operates to accomplish a goal."
good,"A great place to work and advance yourself to a higher position if you choose to advance."
good,Great job if your going to school or have a second job. every day is never the same. you stay busy. There is always room to grow. Constant motion you are never standing in one spot for a long time.
good,In my five years with this company I have been able to expand my knowledge in the transportation industry as well as develop my leadership skills tremendously.
good,Come in start working in your trailer. Job is doable if you like being active. Good work place. Hardest when it's busy and during holidays. Team is nice and management is good.
good,Good company fun place to work good place to gain experience with in the work field great way to use leg arm and communication skills! All around good company
good,On paper this is an awesome company and job but after 31yrs doing it I am looking for a change. Its very difficult to be on the phones this many years and want to try something new.
good,"Working at FedEx Freight for the past 3 years has taught me a lot and has impacted my life outside of work to deal with real life situations. I've learned how to use leadership to help others just by observing conversations and speaking up in work meetings. Working FedEx Freight is a pretty simple job to achieve. Once the supervisors train you to do everyday work , you just flow and transport Freight in and out of trucks. The company holds all types of ethnicities. Most of the employees and staff has good attitudes each and everyday. The only slight difficult part working there is the weather climates and conditions. You have to dress accordingly each day weather its hot or cold. The enjoyable part is the  conversions you have can with anyone. Everyone is cool and I enjoy talking to all the OG's in there because I'm one of the few youngsters in there. They give me great advice and guidance on life."
good,No complaints but it is a lot of work but it's a great place for work and even a gym that pays you to do. Great benefits only complaint is that the management was slightly unorganized they keep claiming they gonna do something but the same issue with cell phone is still a issue which can make everyone else's job harder to get done
good,"A typical day at FedEx is a fast pace environment which requires one to be mentally and physically fit to endure the demanding challenge of making sure customers receive their goods on time. What makes it challenging is the busy traffic, whereas one has to be aware of their surroundings every second, because that is all it takes for an accident to happen. With all the equipment in motion it can be very dangerous. Therefore, everyone has to be on their toes at all times. Also, the seasons of summer and winter are challenging as well. In the summer it is brutally hot, and in the winter it is extremely cold. One of the interesting things is having the opportunity to understand how packages are sorted and shipped. I have much respect for management simply because anyone in management does not mind getting dirty along with team members. The culture is diverse, and with that it gives opportunity for growth in people relations. One thing I have notice since my employment, and that is, FedEx does not discriminate. If you can walk through those gates on your own you can work for this amazing company. However, the hardest part of the job is getting behind when there is a heavy flow of freight. Yet, when everyone work together it is a piece of cake. The most enjoyable part of the job is interacting with other team members, and learning their method of getting the job done."
good,"FedEx had great benefits even for part timers like myself when i worked there. Health, dental, vision and 401k. Worked early morning shift to load trailers for city drivers to deliver."
good,"I learnt a lot while working at FedEx in BA role, the good thing is about work environment and culture they provide to their employees and flexibility of work location is also big benefit."
good,"I'm a very Nice & Calm individual, I'm also very caring & I love to Meet New People . I'm smart fun & A very hard worker .I'm always greeting my fellow workers in the mornings. I hate standing in one place not working so I move around too keep myself working ."
good,"A typical work day at FedEX consist of, get in and checking the volume forecast so that we could make a decision on how many employees we needed for the daily sort. Whether it meant using the staffing agency or not Or giving a few employees the day off because short volume."
good,"A typical day never lacks for a challenge; each day brings a new one.  Due with the job duties and responsibilities, there is always something new to learn regarding the federal regulations that pertain to this position.The manager and my co-workers are all wonderful people  to work for and with; there is a family-like environment. The hardest part of the job are having to deal major incidents, the most enjoyable is having the satisfaction of doing the job well."
good,"Very generous company"
good,"Uma empresa muito seria em sua cultura e valores, com grandes lideres e que sempre da oportunidades para vagas internas além permite o colaborador  desemprenha seu trabalho com tranquilidade e segurança."
good,"enjoy working for fed ex "
good,"all of my coworkers were pleasant,kind and respectful a day at work consisted of fax filing making phone calle and using mail merger"
good,"You wake up b/w 2-4am til 7am or packaging is done for that morning. No electronics are allowed into the company while your working and at the end of the day you leave with a security check out to insure nothing has been stolen."
good,I liked working at Fed Ex but the only problem was the hours. i wasn't able to wake up everyday at 2 o'clock in the morning. The job was basically just scanning the boxes then load the boxes into the correct truck.
good,typical day at work u load packages in a truck the hardest part to some people is loading the most enjoyable is picking the belt
good,They want you to think of their table as your family table. Create new memories and enjoy the foods you love with the people you love — they'll take care of the cooking. They're happy to be the ones to serve you.
good,"The company does a great job listening to the employees regarding pay raises and benefits. Like many companies, during the holidays you miss your families and become exhausted but it comes with the territory."
good,"I absolutely love working for FedEx"
good,"Good people around to work with and always happy co-workers."
good,"FedEx is a great company to work for. Days are long, but go by quick as a courier because you are constantly on the move with time commitments. The only reason I left was because I was let go for a vehicle accident. The expectations (stops per hour) got higher every performance review, and eventually caught up with my driving habits. Management is supportive, but upper management (In Buffalo Grove) wants things done according to what their policies and paperwork dictate."
good,Great workplace the management really care about their employees especially during seasonal they're very friendly and welcoming a little boring to me but if you like packages thats the job for you
good,Everyday at FedEx is pretty much the same. The only difference is the start time. We come in and load our trucks as fast as we can. Every body including management are pretty easy to work with. It is a very humorous environment. The hardest part of working here would have to be keeping up. Sometimes the flow or volume of the boxes you get for each truck can be a little overwhelming and frustrating. The most enjoyable part for me would have to be the people I work with. Seeing and working with them gives me a reason to go each day besides the point of getting paid to be there.
good,Loved coming into work each day! It was a family environment with positive attitudes and always something to look forward to each day.

good,"Worked part-time from 4:00 - 9:00 p.m."
good,"En un día ordinario, entraba dentro de mi horario establecido, preparaba mi lugar con mis bitácoras, y scanners saludaba mis compañeros, teníamos un horario permitido dentro del trabajo (brake) para poder relajarnos y platicar un momento y compartir un refrigerio con los compañeros. Lo que mas me gusto de fedex es que tenia todas las herramientas necesarias para tu desarrollo personal y laboral y eso te hacia sentir que no era un trabajo en realidad y lo hacías con muchísimo gusto."
good,I enjoy interacting with my co-workers while being able to scan and load packages. Management is really on top of things when it comes to getting well trained. I like to challenge myself or the top package handler to make things fun and also better my communicating skills and scanning results. The only time I may have a problem is when I have a lot of my packages come the belt at the same time. I enjoy working at FedEx.
good,"Good place to work, if you don't mind staying busy from the time you get there until the time you leave. Very physical  work. When everyone pitches in the nights go by smooth. Managers are easy to get along with."

Management was awesome, there was a full shift leader, and each group had their own leader. My time there included packing packages into freight trailers for transport and soon then scanning and organizing packages onto the correct truck route. My co-workers were all so awesome, it was such a diverse group of people and it was easy to get along with them all. The hardest part of the job was the physical labor, but with the correct amount of motivation, nutrients, and hydration it was all easily done. The most enjoyable part of the job was working in a warehouse where we were able to chose what we wore and just seeing all those people there everyday doing the same thing I was."
good,I was responsible for loading my truck along with 2 other trucks for route accuracy. I worked along side of people who helped support our main goal of delivering great customer service. I was able to safely lift up to 70lb boxes and more with help from my co-workers. I had a wonderful route where I was able to continually form relationships with my customers on both a personal and professional level.
good,"A typical day at fed ex was rough. I learned how to work at a fast pace and really fast pace. The management team was wonderful, they stayed on us tough they were always on the line making sure we did our work correctly. My coworkers were really cool..we always helped each other. The hardest part of my job was pick season lol...those boxes came so fast, loading those trucks never stopped and it was like we never got a break but i was on it though all i needed was my five hour energy drink and i was good. The most enjoyable part of that job was the friendly work environment."
good,"For the past four and a half years I have workd at Federal Express. Some days i load freight into cans that go onto the planes but, for the most part I work outside on the ramp.

good,It's was a little challenging at times loading and unloading planes. Unloading time was 15 to 20 minutes on each plane that came in we worked as a team loading was kind of hard at times we had an hour to load the plane they were on an schedule for take off. It's a great company to work at.
good,I’m truthful with my answer and my co workers are like a  family im missing.you can go to management for anything.they are always willing to help .we are always learning new things every day.

good,Fed ex was a great experience for me. Unfortunately i was in school at the time so i had to leave i worked 3rd shift and was very tired all the time but overall enjoyable job
good,Fedex is a tough job physically but your body adapts overtime. I do not recommend working here if you're injury prone or overweight as it will be tough on your body.
good,Fedex is a good company. They care about their enmployes. Great pay and salary . you can use your pto if you have enough pto hours. I was a unloader at fedex so it was fastpace but i had a great team member because we work together and great supervisors.
good,"As of working at fedex I enjoyed working as a tug driver the people I work with and team leaders and manger was all good to me."
good,If you want something fast and early to where you have your whole day ahead of you then this is the job for you because you go in while everyone is asleep and come out while everyone is at work
good,"There is no room for growth because management hire by favoritism not by merit and integrity. I have been doing the same job for 2 years and I know I have mastered this position, but due to management I haven't been able to move anywhere, because I am not one of their picks."
good,"I really enjoyed working at Fed ex in the Indianapolis International airport. The staff was great and also the management , everyone was hands on in working together. The only thing that was not great was that the shuttles to a little minute sometimes. But most of all it was a great working experience for me and a comfortable work space."
good,how to work with people it is a good place to work and it is a fun place as well.they have lunch also for their employees some times.the manager will let u know u are doing a good job. I really don:t have no bad things to say about fedex overall it is a good place to work.

good,It was the most amazing experience I’ve ever had. Managers  were so nice  and helpful with everything. Supervisors were the most kind people. Good coworkers. Perfect environment to work with. I just love working over there.
good,They make you post things even when it is shown that you don't have to post. It's a survey which should be anonymous and even voluntary. I get needing to siphon info but come on.
good,"I enjoyed working at FedEx, but it was too fast paced for me. I would recommend this job for anyone who can lift heavy boxes without a problem. The job is physically demanding but the work environment and benefits make up for it. Managers and coworkers are extremely helpful and compassionate. The benefits are also great!"

good,"Working with FedEx at first was hard, but when you give it a try for a week you sort of have a rhythm on how things work there. I have learn a lot working with the company of FedEx. For example, I have learn how to really pick up the pace in a fast environment, how to work a scanner, and also learn how to properly get in and out of a tractor trailer. The managers and co-workers were great to deal with, because it was like you had a second home and everyone was so friendly."
good,"While working at FedEx , I learned how to pack trucks and not only that but also learned how to use different type of technology such as a scanner and much more. I love the pay and they also have benefits."
good,This job was great except for the short hours. There was room for advancement but the hours were not enough. Co workers are very helpful and management was the best i have seen in yers.
good,"Package handling for this activity will only be 5 minutes; most actual Am sort activities last approximately one hour."
good,it was a fun job just to far away from home for the money I enjoyed the work if it was closer. management was good because they were cooperative eager to implement our suggestions.
good,Great benefits for employers with a great working environment. One can thrive and grow at Fedex and work. life balance is appreciated
good,i loved the environment and the people that worked with me. the hours was great and worked out. the managers was very nice and caring.
good,"Being new to DOT and Driving Delivery Trucks, I have absolutely nothing bad to say about the FedEx Express Management nor employees that i encountered, from Interviewing until the day i didn't pass the 2 Day Required defensive driving course. Needless to say that was my last day at the company,( I hit too many Red Cones lol) but in all honesty, having a driving course which only lasted for 2 DAYS, and Out of those 2 Days i drove a Maximum of 2 hours,...If that was all the driving training i was going to get, im not too sure how comfortable i would have felt driving alone on the road. When i found out that UPS DOT required driving class was 2+ weeks or longer, I didn't hesitate to apply."
good,I would work on my days of even put in over time never complained I love helping my coworkers out we had to load at a fast pace and willing to put n the work scan the packages and make sure they go to the right location
good,the hardest part for this job was when i had to keep scanning boxes over and over again less then 1 second. this company also is good with getting the job done!
good,Well rounded like family business. Everyones curtious and respectful. Great experience and atmosphere. Physically and mentally stable work and enjoyment with employment. Self motivated standards. Anyone would love to work with the ups in there area.
good,FedEx a fast paced delivery company was the best job I've ever had. delivering a million packages on a daily basis I was able to be apart of a great team very helpful and was a good experience for my life..
good,Enjoyed the staff and interacting with clients.  Unloading trucks and typing in the information of the packages for the customers.
good,"I liked working there the pay was good but after new years there wasn't much work, overall its a good company."
good,At work I sort customers packages. re-tape damages packages. The hardest is lifting the packages. I enjoy making it possible for the customers packages to arrive on time and secure.
good,"The first day, I learned was unloading and loading box in a trailer. I met some nice coworker and manager. November and December are the hardest day of work. The most enjoyabe about the job is teamwork."

good,"I worked here almost 15 years ago, hard to recall the environment"
good,"Good place to work, with pretty decent benefits. Some managers try to look out for you and others will throw you under the bus."
good,The best part about working for Fedex is the benefits that are available for you. The worst part is that you really dont get that many hours as a handler.
good,I worked as a checker sorter and also a ten key operator. The pace was fast because of getting all flights out on time. The perfect part-time job
good,"Part time job. very easy, alot of lifting. nothing to hard bout it."
good,"We go in around 4 am. The shift holds a meeting every morning to let everybody know how much we have coming in that day. The managers hold a stretch break because the job requires fast pace movement. I learned how to work hard, fast, and very efficiently...as well as keeping everything clean. Our management was always willing to help out especially when you get backed up on the belt and all the boxes that are assigned to you are coming down at once. The biggest reason I enjoyed my job is because of my co-workers...always kept the workplace enjoyable and fun. Honestly, the hardest part of the job sometimes was waking up in the morning.But once you got used to it...you'd be fine. I've learned a lot from this company and I enjoyed everything."
good,"A typical day at work is going to work and getting the job done. I've learned that everyone has to work together to get the job done. My manager makes sure that we (employees) have everything that is necessary to get the job done effectively and safely. My co-workers like to help each other out. Sometimes the hardest part of the job is working in the heat, but no one complains we just get the job done. The most enjoyable part of the job is that everyone works together as a team and do the best that we can do."
good,Great fortune 500 company. Trains all employees well and has a great vigorous management program.

good,"I had to unload boxes of a truck in a timely manner. "
good,FedEx is a really good place to work but they have fulltime and part time work.
good,"Yes just a typical day., I learned quit a few things, Management was good then some not so good, Love my co-workers there were many that were actually some all right individuals, Trying to keep my job by making it worth the reason that I go 9 miles out of Columbus for 3 or less hours a day 15 hours a week on a 3rd shift so I can take care of my kids, for 5 years. I learned a lot with out saying."
good,"Working for fedex, i learn to work the handheld computer, an to treat people packages with the same respect, that i give them, i also learn to be very accurate with my delivery times,i also learn that safety should also be a very important factor with my driving & people personal packages.i love what i done, but my job with fedex was not long enough to give people the true love , i have for life & the manners that i have for all people that comes in to my circle, the hardest part of my job was how to exept people critcism when your late with they package,But i also learn that it comes with the job. the most enjoyable part of the job, is when your truck is empty & all your deliveries have been delivered."
good,Worked by my self . So got a lot done that was needed to be done. Swept dust and cleaned the offices. Took the trash out. And what ever they asked you to clean. At night time job
good,this was a temporary seasonal job during the holidays and was contracted through Kelly services for fed ex and was a shift job that was dictated by the volume of parcels being shipped in and out as well as flown in by aircraft form various places all over the world.
good,It will be great to work with Fed Ex and no the home delivery rep. They are base on contractors and some of the contractors not friendly at all. avoid to work for home delivery.
good,i had to load trailors all night and make sure they were ready to leave the bay
good,A fast pace to work which was made harder because we were always short handed. The people i worked with were always willing to work as a team.
good,"Enjoyed working at FedEx Field, learn to deal with all kind of people and their personalities."
good,This was a company job that I really enjoyed up until the time I left. I learned a lot in my years invested through this company and obtained great leadership skills. The hardest part was making the decision to parts ways after the companies decision to cut budgets.
good,I like the people I worked with just the supervisor didn't no how to do her job rite
good,"Package Handler"
good,"Came in to the+ job site, started loading trucks, delivered to homes and business. "
good,"I worked part time, twenty hours per week. I learned a lot about the postal service, and how to handle stress. The management there was great. My co-workers were all different, with various personalities.. The hardest part about that job was during peak season, because it was very stressful. The most enjoyable part about that job was getting a raise."
good,The job was great however management was not doing their job. The managers would keep their attention to certain people more of a affection toward them. THey would favor others rather than give someone else the oppurtunity to show how good they are.
good,"Hours became short because there was no work.Able to work another shift. Good pay,Very friendly,nice and helpful staff and managers. Fast paced work enviroment"
good,other than missing a day of work and getting written-up was just the amount of attention I received. the language and treatment of co-workers is brutal.
good,"just like another day in paradis..get in the truck and drive 11 hours a day.from one state to another,what can you expect when your a truck driver being gone from your family"
good,"I was enjoying work with people but too heavy, too hot and too cold! NO AC"
good,fast iearning place. coworker are very nice and employee must be on time and knowledge of understaning of the codes. must have power pad handle to function everyday.
good,"A typical day at work is wondering if your manager is going to Instant Message you at any moment with random stats that your not meeting, meeting numbers is whats important in this company, not consistent policies across op-cos, managers seem to make their own policies that work for them."
good,"It's a great place to work if you have no kids, spouse, or personal life and if you're not easily bothered by other people's nonsense and don't mind working in departments filled with relatives who show favortism between their relatives and their friends and other department workers the entire place is like one big circus filled with CLOWNS!"
good,wouldnt recommend to be a contractor or owner for fedex period. too many negative consequences being an independent contractor with fedex. 16 hour days 5 to 7 days a week
good,very long day hours start from 5.30 in a moring to 6ish at night learn how to paint and decorate the magament is ok cus its my dad so get on well there are no co workers only me so cant say much about that the hardist part of the job is to stay awake and on your feet all day long hours drain you the most enjoyable part of the day is when i get to go home and most of all the pay slips
good,Fed Ex is a great company to work for. They are wonderful to their employees. The work day is always difficult and seems impossible but It always pans out and you get the work completed. It is wonderful working with entrepreneur conditions. I have always been proud to wear the Fed Ex lable.
good,I am 15 years old and I am still in middle school. I really like warehouse jobs because there are really nice people working there and I want to be a part of it. I can work Friday and Saturday because I love education and i don't want to miss school because i got a big  ELA  coming .
good,"you will receive great income and stability for a par time (seasonal) job ."
good,I was constantly learning new information as the company downloaded and upgraded their websites to assist the customers to the best of my ability
good,The workplace was very cold and hot. I learn to work as an team. The management was understanding. Co-workers were good as well. Unloading the trucks. The most exciting was clocking out.
good,"An interesting learning experience I’m glad to of gotten, I learned a lot more than I thought I could about technology!"
good,"Adorei trabalhar, me propôs oportunidades, e amava meu serviço"
good,Federal express is a good company to work for in financial situations & benifit situations . But the management is not how it use to be. It is really stressful being a lead now with no support from management.
good,"Hetic not supportive,always work for long hours , no help or support form the seniors , we have to struggle for own ."
good,"good job, good benefits. just the bad part about it is during the winter time it can get very very cold. If you can work during the midnight to early morning hours then this job is for you. employees are very funny and cool to work with,very team based kind of job."
good,The quality of life as an operations manager is a constant battle of balancing life and work. The corporation expect you to be at their beckon call 24/7/365. Wrongful termination is rampant but of course the public will not hear about it.
good,"You having to load your own vehicle and then to plan your route at the same time."
good,"Meta diária, Procedimentos."
good,A nice job to work and keep healthy if you wont to get your delivers on time.

good,"Pros- Time flies pretty quickly. Its feels like you are  Working out and "
good,"You had to be on your toes, a lot of hard work picking picking up heavy bags and late night work in the heat. Management was always there to supervise and help."
good,You are constantly moving at a fast  Pace . There are maps for you to mark where you’re going to be delivering. You have to be self motivated to push yourself to keep your great pace. You need to be able to carry heavy iteams as well.
good,I Loved working at FedEx it just wasn't enough money and  the older people who had been working there were rude and didn't assist with any training I wish i could have worked a different shift.
good,"Working for FedEx overall as a company is great, depending on the location. It's not the company, it's the management you work under and the people you work for."
good,"they recently went to a first come, first serve load board,  I don't  have much of a chance to access these loads before someone else can   leaving me very few loads per week"
good,"A typical workday at fed ex office is making sure the appearance of the center is customer appropriate, and that customer service is executed to the fullest extent. Making sure that every customer experience is outstanding."
good,I love my my job. I work in a very family oriented workplace.Because of that my work day is normally chill and laid back.  Management works swiftly to resolve any issues any employee may have. The most difficult part of my job is not having job security.
good,"Very poor management. The management aren't working as a team, the are always bumping heads. You only get 25 to 30 hors a week and trying to get on fulltime is a joke. You have to be part time for over 3 years to even be considered for a full time position. No matter how hard you work, the seniority always play the main role."
good,"Ótima, empresa, com vários cursos de capacitação para o funcionário."
good,good if you can run a lot of bills an hour if not the may cut your hours and call you off a lot other than that the job is good  good pay
good,"on a regular day there will be at least 10 to 20 people that may walk in and sometimes the we may have tours of the stadium ,we take a lot of pride in presentation and customer service to the company"
good,"Management needs to be overhauled. .too much Favoritism and it shows...FedEx Freight  will fire you first offense.15 years of service..never had 1 write up..FedEx policy says Verbal,Write up,3 days off...But they fired me on my very first alledged..offense. ."
good,"Goed bedrijf "
good,Loved basically being my own boss going on the road and making sure I did my job well. Took different routes to learn different areas of the Detroit metro communities. Enjoyed the customers and the interaction I had with them.
good,Great pay but very long ours.  A lot of the time management was very hard to deal with but learned to get through each day.  Co-workers were very good and would help out if needed.
good,"Uma empresa ótima de se trabalhar e também para desenvolver suas habilidades. Aprendi muito, pois entrei no setor da expedição rodoviário, e fui cobrir férias na Empresa Motorola, Dell, onde são os nossos melhores clientes."
good,"Go from stop to stop in timely manor, map my day from stop to stop ."
good,"Great overall company , Service, as well.  "
good,"Working for Applebee's was great, great people and always good to help serve others. No benefits though, and you have to really work hard to make good money. Other than that it was a good place."
good,"my job consist of being able to lift and sort through the mail, this job kept me busy. i learned how to read labels and use a scan gun."
good,Hectic at times. Learned key procedures to get what you need out of your employees. I was an effective manager. My co- workers respected the job I did and my flexibility. Hardest part of my job would be sometimes long nights. Most enjoyable was producing great results.
good,a busy and fast place always on the move friendly people heavy lifting very hot and cold
good,No work life balance in management ranks. Pays great for couriers and CSPs due to overtime.
good,FedEx is a productive workplace. I learned that there are a lot of rules in a factory type of job.my co-workers were very friendly and helpful. the hardest part of working for FedEx was lifting heavy boxes.the enjoyable part of the job was meeting new people and learning new job experiences.
good,"I worked for this company for about 6 months. I worked from 6 in the morning until I arrived home, sometimes I would not get off off work until 8 or 9 in the PM. Hours were very long and I worked six days a week. All this and I was a part time employee"
good,"A good company to work for, monthly safety dinner rewards. Hard work, very stressfull at times with deadlines and alot of stops.Sometimes long hours, leaving little family time. Decent communication."
good,"Fun and free. No walls making you feel trapped or boss standing over your shoulder. A great chance to meet with and work with a diverse crowd of people. The contractors that FedEx Ground hire or use to hire drivers can be hit or miss. Some contractors are honest and some only care about the money. The hardest part of the job is dealing with the few people that have bad attitudes on your route. The most enjoyable part about the job is the constant motion, exercise, freedom and smiling faces of the customers."
good,They put all part time supervisors on salary Then add to are hours.Lots more work less pay.
good,its good place. rewards for certain goals. not bad. keeps you busy.
good,I learned how to unload packages from trucks onto the sorting system
good,"Company was great to work for, but just the way management talked to package handler's was wrong and if a package handler had injuries, surgeries and so forth, management didn't really care about pay and their health while recovering."
good,employees work well together to ensure correct data is entered in the system; timeliness of information; open communication; very friendly. Management can be 'cliquish'
good,It's a good career choice. The pay is nice if you're a driver. And your day fluctuates depending on how many stops you have. But if you're good at managing your time this job is fairly simple.
good,"You finish your day when you finish your day, meaning if you hustle and get to know you're area, you can get done quick"
good,"They were ok, however this was my pt job and when it became more complicated that my primary job it was time for me to let it go. The pay and benefits were excellent though."
good,"É uma ótima empresa para se trabalhar, dependendo do setor de prestação de serviços, você conseguirá majorar uma vida profissional de grande brilhantismo."
good,Fed ex Great company with weekly pay . standby tickets for Flights 75 Percent off . Schedules are Tuesday to Saturday  Or Monday - Friday .  Depending on which station you are in . managers are cool but then you have the never been a boss type of people that dnt know how to chill they just always on ya back about lil thing like shoes not being black or having a nose ring
good,"Depending on what station you work at or the shift you work on, it can be stressful. Peak season, Nov 1st-Dec 31, is when the company really needs their employees to step up. After that, they want you to get off earlier or condense routes to save on production hours. The ebb and flow of this business stresses new managers and the moral of a station can be determined by a weak or overbearing Station manager trying to make a name for themselves."
good,You had to carry your own weight as part of a team. Very fast paced and somewhat unsupervised workload. Early morning work and not climate controlled.
good,"It's an okay job wanna lose weight get into shape this is the job for all of that. Overall good job.good environment,cool people and etc. If your not a people person then this the job for you."
good,"good workers fun times,  shame temp vacancy,  warehouse manager understanding good banter with the drivers, uniform provided, plenty of information to learn but someone on hand to help"
good,I have worked with datamark almost 2 years. I have gain so much experience while working with my department. I worked with flexible shifts and timings which I experienced and understand the new things which like most. I have a passion to gain new things and understand new things.
good,"FedEx is a very good company to work for. They have excellent benefits and always have extra hours. While compensation is decent, if you work more than 7 hours a day you don’t feel like the pay you make is adequate."
good,"Thought of being terminated due to son in hospital was not fair had nothing to do with job performance.point system should be based on performance Of job."
good,"Operationally challenging but with a degree of ""circled wagons"""
good,"As a leader you are tasked with a ton. Not overworked but a lot to handle. The issue is when there is a problem you will not get the support you need as a manager. Human Resources only works for the employees. In management if an issue comes up, they will simply let you go. Even after 9 years. They will simply send you down the road."
good,"awesome company to work for , management was spot on. The employees are great, the pay is ok."
good,very good work place but compensation and hourly wage is not the best they could pay more for the work that is done. managment is good and training is good
good,"Eh uma empresa Boa pra trabalha ""-"
good,"could use some more training on behalf of management, one manager will tell you to do something and another will come along and want you to do something else."
good,Being a driver for a contractor has it's ups and downs. Let's be honest! Any driver would tell you we're not an employee of FedEx cause that what are badge states. So with that being said the job security/benefits are my biggest downfalls speaking for myself but at the same time speaking for many more.
good,i worked for RPS and FedEx bought us so we were contractors my boss was awesome. i delivered by the beach. but when christmas hit that sucked some times 150 stops .worked in longbeach also the bad side that wast fun scary

good,"I don't like working at night, looking for first shift. The money is not enough the work is hard on me."
good,Fun place to work with awesome drivers. Holiday season was very busy but that why i got the job. I would recommend anyone to apply with FedEx.
good,"Long days are all I can remember while working at this company. Being that this is a warehouse job also, I learned how to work at a specific speed and how to use a pallet jack. Management at PFS Web wasn't professional to my advantage. They were rude, misunderstanding, out of order, and nonchalant. Coworkers were sociable, helpful, and friendly. The hardest part of the job was staying pass my given shift hours. The most enjoyable part of the job was clocking out and heading home."
good,"I loved working for Fex Ex, this was a choice job.  Hard but a wonderful education about delivery systems in general.  I had a great teacher, and was helped quite a  bit.  The operations manager was the one who hired me and she was just a nice person who treated me with respect."
good,I would load my truck up for my deliveries for the day. I would make different stops to make my deliveries. I really enjoy working for this company. Now I have more experience with customer.
good,"Most days were busy, others were dis-organized, In the beginning of the time I spent with fedex it was very family / employee oriented, later in the job it moved away from that and became a big business and focus was always about profit at any cost. Pushing for more results with less time."
good,Fun job that allows you to work at your own speed. Great source for income but no benefits. Good luck an shave patience! Good Good Good.
good,"typical day is to load my vehicle for the route and get the scanner up to date. The bad part is not having a permanent route as of now. Learning the routes are the hardest thing. My co-workers are the greatest, they will help you learn the routes and how to arrange the packages in your truck."
good,The most enjoyable part of the job is being able to send a package to someone half way around the world the next day. Another enjoyable part of my day is interacting with FedEx crew members.
good,"Hard work"
good,Work well with the team to meet customers demand. This was an experience for me to be able to work well with others. Management was able to work with me to complete all work task. The hardest part about the job was leaving early due to early completion.

good,I was a independent contractor with FedEX and they took care of their contractors.
good,"I had dreamt of one day working for P&G or a division of FedEx. I worked for FedEx Freight from 2010 to 2011. The lower management and office people are strictly professional and very fun to work alongside. The terminal boss(es) had zero respect for their assistants, office workers, drivers, dockworkers. Brown-nosers who unfortunately exist in the workplace. If you're looking for an office position (customer service / driver check-in), you'll be happy to work here. Seriously."
good,Great company with a good salary responsible for shipping and receiving

good,"I loved working for Fed Ex. I used a sit down propane lift. I loaded and unload trailers, to the next trailer. Sometimes I would move shipping items to pallets as well."
good,FedEx is a good place to work if you want to be physically healthy while at the same time develop money and time management skills.  The benefits are good also.
good,Worked the morning shift loading trailers for local delivery. Enjoyed the people i worked with and the supervisors i worked under. Hardest part would be the winters because it was open bays so the weather was very cold in the winter.
good,"Buena empresa, tienen buen equipo de trabajo. Y puedes acender si no faltas y sigues aprendiendo los procesos."
good,"FedEx have a friendly work environment, management help employees  to progress within the company.  on job training when procedures change hardest part of the job is tracking the shipment International."

good,My most enjoyable part if this job is servicing customers. There is nothing more important to me than servicing the customers and ensuring everything is great.
good,"I enjoy being a part of a supportive team. The typical work day simply consists of coming in, doing stretches and then starting to palatize the boxes."
good,working at fedex has its ups and downs. its a easy place to make money but climate plays its role. some of the supervisors would help and respect you then others wouldnt
good,"I really enjoyed working here. It was a challenging work environment with the heat and strenuous labor, but they recognized and rewarded hard work.  I was only there a short time due to my move to Frisco but I would have loved to stay."

good,I love working and meeting new people.Fedex have wonderful people you can meet everyday.I also love making our customers happy.I work really hard to make sure we meet the customers needs at all time
good,I like the idea of a good job with the best way possible for the job market to be able to get the best results in that process because of the way it works out and how much money is needed to make sure that the company is able to make a difference in that area of work in a way that's important to the customer and to make sure that they have a strong relationship.
good,While was working for Fedex i was a dock worker. Everyone at the job was very respectful and nice to me. Very helpful when need I couldnt ask for more.
good,Awesome environment to work in leadership is very attentive and responsive. Pay is great and leadership works hard to take great care of their employees.
good,The most enjoyable part of the job is when the peoples package are being delivered to them and they are happy to receive it. The hardest part of the job was when I had to get off the truck and run to the front door and knock and give the people their packages.
good,FedEx is a good company to work for. It’s a good company that has a lot of hard working employees. They also have a diverse working environment that is good for people like myself.

good,FedEx has good to me since the day I stepped foot through the door. I am able to work hours that fit my daily schedule. It is a job that requires hard work but at the same time you will not be left alone. You will receive help from fellow coworkers.
good,It’s a fast pace fun environment that I would recommend to anyone who is looking for a physically demanding job that is very group oriented. It’s a blast if your with friends at the job so I’d recommend getting friends to apply as well.
good,"I absolutely loved working as a route delivery guy at fedex home delivery. They had your route mapped out and once you learned the streets in your delivery area it was a breeze, your day started with about an hour of scanning and loading packages for the day then you would go out for delivery. A good pace was 20 packages an hour, but I would spring at all times because we were  salary. My route ended up taking me about 3 hours on a normal day. If you decide to really move you can do 35 or more packages in an hour and since you are salary the faster you move the more you “make” per hour since you are paid by the day so you have more time to do other things with your day. I would get in around 7 and be done by noon. After your packages are delivered you head back to the depot and that’s it, you just park and leave. Great job."
good,It's a good company to work for the only problem is that there is not a lot of hours but the pay is good they have good benefits and you can move up in the company

good,"Some days were very slow and I had very little to do, but while in shipping, you have many challenges to overcome: ordering supplies, maintaining the area, packing and shipping out merchandise, making sure the back room was organized for inbound and outbound, and making sure you could get through the close out express rush."
good,"great company to work for ,,good training ,,family first...equipment good working order ,,but its a fast paced company ,,safety first ,,a lot of hr to work"
good,Eu na FedEx Brasil eu aprendi a trabalhar com equipe sempre tem galpão limpo não tira brincadeira na horas de trabalho.
good,Great working environment. People working closely and collaboratively. It's a big company with great benefits and training programs. Only Memphis is a little boring.
good,Great management and co-workers in the IT project area. FedEx is highly recommended as an employer.  The Collierville Tennesee campus is convenient to major freeways.
good,"Enjoy working here, very fast paste environment, Loading and unloading planes, trucks, safety is a must. only the strong last. Many different things to do and learn working here."
good,This was a forward thinking company and made the employees feel empowered.  Great work environment and fast paced.  I would recommend working at FedEx.
good,management is unable to accept constructive criticism. I was forced out the door by a manager who refused to offer me help when it was their job as I was working in there area. I asked for a radio to call out certain instructions so we could stay on track as manager was never around. I enjoyed the people mostly management is more focused on talking though instead of being hands on and helping they kick back and hide behind paper work and take it easy. I'm one to believe the higher up the ladder one goes the more hands and productive you should be earn your keep and keep earning lead by example not by throwing your authority around which is done often. this is a fast paced hard working job I enjoyed it though. the down side is no locker space was provided for belongings and no lunch break was given and some days went on for 10+ hours when busy season hit. another problem like my experience in Kroger is only drinking buddies get higher up. I have seen people with little to no time there and a bad work ethic shoot up to manager or trainer position despite other people with stronger work ethics and a better knowledge of the building. all based on who they know and staying cozy to the manager. the pay is ok but if you plan on working hard and staying busy while on the job they pay is a little off I a few dollars more an hour would not hurt. I say this and acknowledge that people like firefighters and police have it worse so please no backlash on me. I did not want to leave however It was either leave or the manager was going to fire me and I did not want that on my record. I worked
good,Great place to start your career if you are just now graduating from college or changing career paths. Fedex has great benefits package that is sure t o be enough for most people
good,The job was good until I had a supervisor that was racist he had been reoprted by other people at the job. the work was good but the building was terrible to much south west air it gotmvery cold there. they did take care of their poeple with food and other gratuities. You had alot of farvorates there as will.
good,"productive and fun workplace"
good,It's a great opportunity to advance in a successful company and learn the ins and out of a well known delivery company. Helpful coworkers and an easy environment to work in.
good,Fed Ex was a great place to work.  Management was organized and co workers were friendly.  Work was fast paced but not difficult and conditions were fine and safe
good,"In my daily job, I sort all parcels, receiving all parcels and scanning them to different couriers. I really enjoyed working very much especially scanning the parcels."

good,organized work made it easy to get through the day. I would print online orders package and ship. I would assist with in store purchases package customer orders and provide excellent customer service
good,Overall FedEx Supply Chain is a good place to work.  They do give evaluations for raises each year.  Management has been told not to give anyone the max score of 5 on evaluation so they will only give you between 2 and 3% each year on a raise.  They are very flexible when you need time off for an appointment or vacation.  The chance of moving up in the company is slim unless you have a manager in your pocket.  They host tons of interviews but usually have someone picked before they even begin interviewing. The facilities are very clean and organized.  Management are not held accountable for there attendance.  So there is a good chance you will show up more than they will.  The VP and CEO of the company are very caring and give a lot of praise when deserved.  HR department is very easy to work with.  The workers there are easy to work with.  The insurance and benefits are medium.

good,"I process payroll for the Caribbean and Centro America, The payroll are monthly, semi-monthly ad biweekly. The bet part of my job was my coworker - we still are in contact"
good,They have flexible hours and they will pay for you to go to school. Fedex gives you many opportunities to advance in the company and they have good people who will help you get to the next level
good,"A typical day at Fedex would include loading and unloading of packages. Once unloaded the packages would get scanned and process for delivery or pick up. "
good,"My time at FedEx varied - one moment it was calm, the next it was crazy. The people were a real joy to work with.  I learned lots of new things there."

good,"Develops innovative strategies such as [example] ..."
good,"Even though I didn't work here that long, the company left an everlasting impression on me how important teamwork is at a work place. After scanning mail (letters, boxes, etc.), I would help load an airplane with items during the whole shift. The hardest part of the job was trying to learn all things and not letting the team down (which I never did), and the most thing I liked about working there was the positive attitude the fellow employees had towards each other."
good,Excellent friendly environment and great opportunity. I've enjoyed my time working here and have learned how to become efficient with operating a forklift.
good,"Very fast pace lots of moving."
good,Working at Fed Ex showed me how to work well with others as a team. We all had a goal to complete the shift together by 7:30 am for  delivery for home service. It was very fun and labor intensive. I met some great people working there.

good,"FedEx is a great company. My family has worked for this company for decades. FedEx isn't quite the same as it used to be, with changes in priority of money rather than doing right by employees. This is a great place to move your life in a positive direction. However, because of retirement changes and promises neglected, I would not give this company a 5 star rating."
good,"Its a very laidback environment, the word is fairly easy and my coworkers are very helpful and friendly. I would recommentd it to anyone who loves warehouse work."
good,"This job is for people who need to work around school or children.  All part time early mornings 4 am - 7 or afternoons 6 - 9, most of the you can work both if you want extra hours."
good,it was a good work out but in the summer time u will get super hot theirs only one fan on the floor but the managers was cool for the most part of working there
good,"Trabalhava como conferente e operador de cargar fiz um treinamento e passei para Currie onde exercia a função de motorista e entregador , onde fazia cobranças de alto e pequenos valores e procurava atender o cliente da melhor forma possível trazendo a ele uma no experiência com a Fedex Brasil"
good,Fed Ex is a great place to work with for full time benefits at the part time hours.  Where you can really do just about any job within Fed Ex.  From moving boxes to driving tugs and loading and unloading planes.

good,"Used to load and upload trucks, it was a hard working environment, but i used work hard and take on all of tasks associated with the job. Time management was very important in the process of loading and uploading the trucks. I also used to get alone with all my fellow coworkers."
good,I worked for many years and learned a lot about people and what people expect from the best shipping company in the world. That means stand behind your company and make it work to grow the most respectable and reliable company in the market. I thank Fed Ex for giving me the opportunity to serve them for so many years. The only problem I had was when I got injured I was not offered a different position to be able to stay with the company.

good,"Communication between loaders and drivers isn't very productive. Drivers get upset with their truck loaders, instead of politely talking to the loaders about said situation, they go over the loaders head to their superior. Which causes poor loads from lackadaisical efforts by the loaders."
good,"rushing to deliver packages was a typical day; I learned that the general public is very impatient;, that management tries to instill on its employees to be calm and do the best job that you can do.  Work place culture is not an issue, because the position was outside of workplace.  The hardest part of job was the heavy package that needed to be delivered to customers.  The most enjoyable part of job was payday."
good,"arrive early to work, half of drivers loaded our own trucks, very exhausting and then spent the next 10 plus hours delivering in whatever weather. very few days off. Zero bad weather days. 150 lb weight limit could get brutal. my Boss/ contractor was a very good leader figure and was very fair. The most enjoyable part, i was my own boss while out delivering."

good,"I love my job at FedEx but I work thru a temp agency and I don't get paid the hourly pay nor benefits that FedEx employees gets. If the work load is little the Express team members have to leave and this is why I am applying for a full time position. I have worked in several departments inside the FedEx building and we have breaks every two hours. The work is very easy but challenging and everyday is a learning process. The hardest part of the job is not knowing what time you have to be at work or leave. The most enjoyable part about the job is meeting all the people, learning different cultures. This has been a lifetime experience to work with this company."
good,This is a very tough job but it is fun and rewarding.  You have to be self motivated and able to handle rejection. It is great being able to make your own schedule.  The company has a great culture and brand.

good,this job was a temp that I have worked for several years. However the full time employees try to make the temps feel as if they are not important. They only work you for 11 months
good,Working here felt amazing never once felt down about getting up and coming in to work.  Within the duration of my time spent their it never really felt like work
good,Heavy lifting over to 200 or 300 pounds a day without benefits and less pay isn't cool and just having children with these job it will not work for single-parent employee.
good,"Working at FedEx is very labour intensive for the first few weeks then your body gets adjusted to the fast paced, competitive environment. Overall FedEx Is a great entry level job with potential to become a full time career with great benefits and job security."
good,"Fed ex was a good company, they had contractors who hired you and paid you.  this was good and bad because they could do what they wanted with nothing to do with fed ex itself."
good,uma empresa de grande porte gostei muito de trabalhar la uma empresa que nunca atrasa pagamentos de seus funcionarios
good,"Short days as a part timer with lots of hands on and reading. I learned that the holidays are the busies days and numbers of locations.Management was good they work with everyone well.The hardest part is bagging, scanning load in and out of the trucks and spliting mail and packages coming down the line also loading the trucks up.I enjoyed the surroundings"
good,Great place tobgrow wish I loved closer so I did not have to commute that far from home. But if I was not seasonal I wouldn't have mind. I enjoyed working there.
good,"Passei 2 anos na Fedex, e não tive problemas na empresa. O plano de saúde eu achava um pouco caro, porem era opcional. Refeição era realizada na própria empresa, aprendi muita coisa referente aos sistemas utilizados. A equipe, grande parte era formada por boas pessoas. Porém o programa de promoção que diziam ser por meritocracia,na verdade era indicação."
good,"Liberado de veículos para entrega e viagens , aprendi tudo que sei na área de gerenciamento de riscos,prefiro não falar sobre gestão,ótimas amizades,falta de instrutura , sala ruim , chegar no final do dia e ver que todos motoristas retornaram para base sem nenhum problema ."

good,"Provided primary support to the Senior Attorney handling all accounts in Latin America-Caribbean.  Updated and handled all existing files for the United States and Latin America-Caribbean.  "
good,"I enjoyed working at FedEx. I loved interacting with people and the diversity of the individuals with whom I worked with. The hardest part of the job was getting to the terminal and waiting for packages , loading your vehicle and waiting for missing packages all with no pay . The money was pretty good but because of it being private contractors there was no insurance , vacation, holiday or sick pay."
good,loaded and unloaded trailers had to scan every single Package to ensure the package is tracked learned how to work the computer and send more boxes to each trailer
good,"The job is good. Requires hard work and some perspiration. Management at the FedEx in Waycross drops the ball a lot. Very laid back. The boss texts you what time to show up and forgets a good deal of the time so you have to either text him or show up at the usual time and hope nothing has changed. Ran pretty well but does have some kinks in the chain. For example, the packages seem to come down the belt at a pretty good pace that slightly varies throughout the day until about an hour before everyone is about to go home. All of a sudden the belt is overloaded with packages with no way to sort through and figure out what is your's and what isn't in time before the box passes your truck or the belt has to be stopped for you to get them. Other than that, our FedEx is a pretty good company to be employed by."
good,work place environment was very nice and professional and most co workers were very nice and helpful
good,"You're responsible for production, shipping, and self service. Tenured employees take advantage of hard working new hires by leaving them with larger work loads that could be done during their shifts. Management is consistent, insightful, and patient. The stores are understaffed so more than often you end up covering other stores and working extended hours. The pay is really good. The work is tedious sometimes but very easy for the most part."
good,Job consisted of loading trucks in a fast pace and hot environment.  Co-workers and management were good to work with.  The hard part of the job was the stress of a fast pace and hot environment.
good,"As Independent contractor, I could work as much or as little as I want and take time off as it suited my life. I didn't miss any family birthdays, motorcycle rallies or holidays. I recommend it for anyone who is motivated and likes to drive."
good,Attempting to get shipments cleared through US customs and FDA while speaking with clients who were not fluent in English or able to provide the needed information.
good,No Comment I really do not want to talk about this company because the place worked does not directly effect the company as a whole.
good,Very physical job and it will take a toll on you physically and mentally. A Salary position which can be more harm then good in the shipping industry.
good,daily rutine drive and delivery packages on time. pretty fun meeting new people every day.. excellent way to know your city more closer.
good,"Great Company! Great managers, great benefits. Never a dull moment! I've learned a lot, bu would love t increase my knowledge and pay. Growth is mandatory."
good,FedEx Ground is a great place to work for.  When I going into work I usually check my box and e-mail to see what's going on with the company and get all paper work knocked out before I start my day. I then move on to the dock and  get my area set up for my workers. I've learned in managing the 5 priorities of loading and able to divert altercations between workers. I enjoy the most is when a package handler tells me that I inspire them to become a manager.
good,"Great place to work.  Great management team, great benefits, and great pay.  no complaints about the job.  Will go back but you have to love the weather."
good,Empresa com uma politica interessante tanto para os funcionários quanto para as ações externas.Solidariedade e compromisso para com a sociedade .
good,Started the A.M. shift. for over a year package handling. Became a huge earner eventually owning my own route! FED-EX home delivery. I was my own boss for over three years and gained wonderful interpersonal customer skills.
good,"Part time work is four to five hours depending on the work flow.  Depending on your position you are required to load the trucks or unload.  Typical days vary depending on the weather, the facility does not have air conditioners for the summer and heat is lacking during the winter since the building has many open areas for the trucks.  It is important to note that there are small fans for every loading areas but are not effective in extreme weather."
good,"good constant job. very consistent, good co-workers. heavy packages usually the worst part of the job."
good,"To unload trucks that come in"
good,"Working for Fedex Ground was a great experience for me. The management team and co-workers made a typical work day go by so fast with their can do  fun attitude. Everyone is nice to one another and does their work to perfection. The hardest part about working for Fedex would have to be the amount of work there can be a day with lifting , or stacking boxes on or off trucks. The most enjoyable part about the job is the benefits and rewards management would give out when the company meets its quota for the week/month."
good,"This is a good ""job"" but sadly still a ""job"" the managers under the age of 40 (and there are a lot of them) are leaders in title only, this is the new trend in America, instead of a generous raise you get a title like ""the apprentice to the assistant 1st shift leader"" and it seemed like passing the buck was a sport to them, But the upper management were great to deal with and usually took care of and problems that arose,"
good,"the job is ok but there is no advancement there you have to wait till somebody quits that's hire up or get another position in order to move up and that can take forever. The benefits are god and I love the people I work with at this job but I want to move up and I cant here, not in the time I want to anyway. the hardest part of this job is they do not have stable hours and I need a 40+ house job that guarantee your house so I can live conformable."
good,"very productive place to work, great coworkers! alot of labor. when its hot its hotter inside the warehouse, and when its cold, its colder inside the warehouse."
good,Great family business with a heart for the employee. great load pricing and on time deliveries.
good,"we had a lot of trucks to unload.It was a fast paced environment,And I ejoyed working there"
good,"I started early in the morning, by the time I arrive to the main office the packages were load and organize already. In here I learned the importance of paying attention to every detail, if not a package could be deliver to the wrong person, I also learn that I need it to move fast, because once night felt it was harder to see the numbers on the houses. Management and co-workers were very helpful and always willing to teach and explain any questions I asked them. The most enjoyable part was dealing with the customers face to face, most of them were very friendly and always waiting for my arrival (small business)"
good,super fun hours and met a lot of cool people. i learn how to load and unload trucks
good,"I was an owner of several routes, Made good money, managed people. Was good to not stress about managers and others"
good,a challenging corporate culture exist with in the organization the challenge was working with multiple groups remotely in different time zones
good,a fast paced work environment with crazed fans and game time delights. working here i learned to think on my feet and be patient and calm
good,I had a great time working for this company.  The management was highly interactive with all their employees.  I had and still have a great relationship with management.  If it wasn't for it being a seasonal/temporary job I may still be working there.
good,"Pulled mail orders in Shipping and receiving"
good,"Most days are the same. The shippers and customers are consistent. The workload fluctuates depending on the time of year. Not many holidays off but you get a few floating holidays in addition to your vacation time and sick days. Reviews suck usually but that's because they don't want to give out raises. No bonuses. "
good,"A typical day is to overlook over other employees work performance, to make sure that it is accurately and complyies with the customer and the company policies."
good,"Good with benefits, and always having something to do. Never a dull moment."
good,Good company to work with and for. Being able to help manage people work as a team is great. Nothing hard about working for Fed Ex Ground. Great benefits and workin environment.

good,You had your good days and bad days...I love seeing the smile on the kids faces when you delivered there Christmas presents.
good,Working at FedEx is different with is being a warehouse you are always busy. You get to work with a lot of different people and different cultures. It is very fast pace.
good,Protection de l'emploi et salaire convenable et possibilité d'évolution
good,The job that I have at fedex is a great opportunity to get your feet wet in the world of logistic transportation and linehaul. I feel that it has taught me the basic and essential skills needed to further my career in logistics.
good,"In my 2years at Fedex I found the Company being very diversified, and well as well organized. I would highly recommend all who qualify to apply. fedex benefits are awesome as well."
good,FedEx is a good company to work with excellent management. Face paced and an honest good days work. Hardest part of the job are the conditions which vary factory to factory
good,"FedEx Express is an awesome company  they offer decent pay overtime is paid daily after 8 hours -  paid holidays and good benefits  "
good,The work environment was pleasant.  I had a positive experience and learned a great deal in my tenure at the company.  I hope to work in a similar position as I work on getting my  Class A license.
good,I loved my job and was very good at it. Never missed a day of work as well as being very respectful to everyone and working as hard or harder than everyone else.
good,"Great Place to Work - Saginaw, Mi"
good,Good place to work if you looking for a part time or seasonal.good personal and management ...also ok starting paid...the job is very easy and the people that work there are very professional
good,"I delivered packages to customers. I was excited to work for fedex as working there we are responsible for customers packages & making sure they received their packages. But i would do my job just that customers would complain to boss that they didn't receive it but little did the boss know they had their packages at home with them. that would be the one thing i didn't enjoy working at fedex, & also lack of communication"
good,"Uh, when applying for FedEx it is NOT package handles!! You either load or unload FedEx trucks!! Such a challenge job!! Management/HR department all great"
good,"Ambiente laborar muy bueno y mucho apoyo entre el personal."
good,Buena empresa que da apoyo a su personal y apoya para crecimiento personal y profesional
good,"worked night shift, variety of duties, great place to work for. very welcoming Company with family atmosphere, ongoing training as well as helpful workers"
good,"productive and fun no managers pushing you around everyone had to load their own trucks so you know were your packers were on the truck, extra routes were available and paid as full days work."
good,"FedEx has provided a place where large numbers of employees lived-out their entire career.  Many of my peers have greater than 20 years, 30 years, and many remaining with over 40 years of service.  That's opportunity in the making for new hires as many are retiring."
good,Pay and benefits are good but management could be better. No communication about new procedures. Man power poorly utilized. Overtime most days without warning. Extreme heat and cold but overall a very good company to work for
good,FedEx was a great company to work for and all levels of management seemed to be very invested in the people and in making the people successful.  I have very few complaints about this company.
good,It is loud dusty and dirty but a good place to work for great benefits and time off if you have earned it would be nice if they knew what was going on more
good,"great company overall , these days you have to make sacrifices but this the best trucking company ive ever worked for as far as pay and other benefits to being an employee, you cant have it all but highly recommend fedex"
good,The job is easy but it would be so much better if we got more hours. Their management is cool but they need to learn how to practice what they teach TEAM WORK. Without team work the job could be frustrating because all the physical demands.
good,"working fast pace and seeing the end of the day be completed, 38 routes picking up packages for shipping, great people doing there best and then we process 20 to 25000 package per night what a rush"
good,"Typical work day consisted of inside sales a set goal of customer contacts per day.  Building rapport with current accounts and new accounts learning their business needs and wants. Selling in a consultative sales setting.  I learned so much personally and professionally in sales, leadership, consultative sales, pricing and meeting the customers needs and wants.  The hardest part of the would be meeting and exceeding quarterly sales goals to earn commission.  The most enjoyable part of the job is getting to know your customers and truly feeling like a part of their business and they know they can rely on their account manager."
good,I think FedEx was a great job to work is very very fast pace and if you don't like the walking might not be a good fit for you you can get plenty of hours there and lots of overtime if that's what you're looking for
good,"I packed and unpacked trucks, using the information provided to me by my supervisor.It was  fast paced, so many trucks needed to be packed per shift,the hardest part of this job was not knowing how many hours you were going to get per day"
good,"I enjoyed this seasonal job for 4 years in a row. Starts October 15 and I lasted until Dec.31 each year. Most seasonal drivers are let go just before Christmas. I was also training the new drivers and still pulling 200-300 stop routes per day. I often finished my first route and came back to get another route in the same 8 hour shift. If you show you want to do the job, you deliver the packages in a timely basis, properly deliver them, don't get into any accidents, avoid conflict, and you just do your job... you will be rewarded by increase in pay, asked to stay on longer, called throughout the year to fill in for vacations or when someone calls in sick, excellent working vehicles, and full uniforms when you need them. If you milk the clock, you wont last long."
good,"Een goed lopend bedrijf, met goede cultuur en voorwaarde. 10 jaar in dienst geweest"
good,This was avery fast paced and physical job that was offered to me to get by on until I found something office related.  If you are a woman it can be very hard on your body. It is your responsibility to make sure every package no matter how awkward or heavy is delivered.
good,A typical day at Fed-Ex was very fast paced.  The job kept workers very busy due to the holiday season. The time went by very quickly due to keeping busy and hard work.  Scanning for me was quite different and at the same time enjoyable and fun.
good,The job is very fast.I needed more hours to support my family. At times I would be asked to load multiple trucks because people don't show up to work.
good,"I think I was too old and/or out of shape for this position.  My body ached everyday.  My hands formed callis, become sore and hard.  Be sure to wear properly footwear.  Management talks to you like a dog. Management will speed up the belt unannounced.  Management will move you on the line to help a fellow co-worker as needed."
good,"Hard work, heavy packages up to 150lbs, load your own truck, have to work every Saturday. A good crowd of drivers,good working atmosphere.the new terminal is nice with a break room and numerous vending machines."
good,"Shifts are really short"
good,"Fan filled employees,  approachable management team. Company sets an atmosphere that accommodates both family and business setups. FedEx prides herself on her employees and services they perform to the customers."
good,Best of the best to work for. Everyone did their best to accomplish their goals. Operations worked like you would not believe. Personal has there heads in the right place. The customer is king and their performance showed it.
good,this is not a for the weak minded. Although fedex is a great place to work it will push your limits on how much you think your body can take. It is very physical but on the bright side it is like getting a workout in every night.
good,I worked at night which it was fast pace and I learned how to do a job with a sense of urgency and saw how the management ran the shifts also the work place was very organized which if they would hire full-time then it would be a great job
good,I love to work with FedEx fully supportive n you learned a lot of things  there with new technologies n new environment I got agile award there for my good performance
good,"is very fun place to work  and they have good management "
good,"Fast paced, hard work but if you like physical work, this is a perfect place to do it in.  The only downside is the work schedule.  If you are not a morning person you won't last.  I like going in early, getting done and then having the rest of the day to take care of other things."
good,"FedEx is a great local company to work for and has amazing benefits.  The culture is great,  however it feels like this is a way they can keep people around for a while considering the pay isn't fantastic. Career growth is very challenging due to over saturation."
good,"i really enjoyed working for this company, I feel I learned a lot, problem solving, time keeping and communicating with customers. Its unfortunate that I was working for the franchisee I was working for as he was not good and keeping contact with staff at the depo."
good,I only worked at this company helping g out a friend with medical needs and needed time off for operation and recovery.  Was a good job and would always go back if ever a job came avaible
good,I loved working there because I have had lots of driving jobs and I enjoy driving jobs. Also I am great with customers and customer service. I got to know my routine really well and my clients really well. The pay was ok. Im am just sad that they let me go
good,Empresa boa pois oferece benefícios pro funcionario
good,FedEx is a great job for someone starting right out of high school. I wouldn't recommend working at FedEx and making it a CAREER! But overall it's a pretty decent place to work.
good,"Great place to work ,managers listen to what you have to say ,or if you need time off. Room for advancement  . Clean working conditions . Hardest part of the job is dealing with the heat"
good,Fast paced work environment. depend on which shift  your working depicts temperature. Graveyard shift has best traffic on way to work.  Learn more than just forklift related skills.
good,"Its up to you on how fast or slow you do the route. There is many ways to load your truck. Management was very understanding, and cooperative with the employees and the questions we may have for them."
good,Friendly environment...gives opportunity to learn things easily...i have been working here for around 2 years.. Company hepled me learn things and grow fast..
good,"Good Place to work but Management didn't treat their employers right, only when it benefited them. I can't say it was a hard job it was easy, everyone work together got along got the Job done."
good,"placing order"
good,"FedEx was great, yes the work was hard sometimes but you would be rewarded at the end. If I was there for one more month I believe that's when I could of signed up for my college tuition reimbursement. So that's a big plus and they have a lot of Rafael for prizes and stuff to so there appreciation to the package handlers."
good,I loved working in this face pace environment meeting new customers and talking to drivers daily. Being a team and delivering 1000's of packages daily is very rewarding.
good,"Took care of its employees, great benefits. Too many policy's and procedures. Micromanaged employees from clock in to clock out."
good,At Fed Ex I was able to move around and work in various departments. As a Material Handler I was able to see different types of animals being shipped to different parts of the world.
good,Enjoyed my time at FedEx the only reason I left was was offered a job at smeg UK that I could not refuse. Made sone friends for life at all levels management included.
good,My days at work were a everyday excitement.  Every day had a different adventure and new people to meet. Didn't want to leave but no benefits were given or offered.
good,"Great Company of course, everyone know Fedex right? great benefits, including the healthcare, my part on Fedex was to open operations on Brownsville Tx it was fun and challenging."
good,it was a fun place to work but the only donw fall was getting told at the beggining that the job was totaly secure ther 14 month down the line to made redundant because a big company like fedex had to make saving cuts.
good,It was a good place to work I was just in school and had to quit because it was interfering with my classes. I enjoyed the job but there were times I would go to work dry and leave wet from the work. Management was ok but not the best. The co-workers were a little nosey at times but they were good at other times. The most enjoyable part of the job was getting my paycheck.
good,"Usually has you work as a contractor for 11 months, you get ok pay but NO benefits ""contractor"", management is very flexible and permanent employees are friendly, very hard to get hired full time, but very good place for getting the needed experience."
good,Fun place to work. Not much pressure easy to work with people. really good environment. Good for people looking long term stay and don't want to be hard working.
good,"A challenging environment where i am required to use strong analytical and managerial skills on a daily basis. "
good,Unload trails when they come in the morning. Load my delivery truck according to stop chart. Deliver packages in a timely fashion. Make pick up when scheduled. Assist customers in sending packages.
good,"Loved working for Fed Ex Ground I was able to not only get a work out from the physical job I was doing, but I was able to learn new ways of doing things, as well as Great people to work with"
good,"Everyone are very kind and ginuine hardworking individuals, they help build you by promoting you with higheer position, if your work ethics are to part."
good,The company is excellent and the only negative thing to say is that when working for an independent contractor your position is not always secure.  I was hired for a full time position to replace a gentleman that was leaving to begin his own route.  However when that plan did not come to light the manager allowed him to stay which meant I now did not have a job.  I have done some per diem as much as I can but I need a full time job.  I have a family.
good,"A very hard working experience , being a Package Handler seems or sound's easy but in reality it was hard to stand there in one place for 9 hours doing one thing. But it had it's good things about it ,lots of exercise and arm moving. The bosses were pretty strict , and they stayed on you most of time. My co-workers were nice and very inviting. But the most part I enjoyed was scanning and sorting the boxes also pulling the big wrapped boxes to their section."
good,"I enjoyed working at fed-ex it was fast paced and time flew by.Other workers goofed off and could be more productive. management was great in telling you what was excepted of you, but not so great with keeping others on task."
good,"Overall, great place to work, but looking for advancement which can not be obtain in current position."
good,delivery of packages on a designated route learning how to full fill customers needs with no management. the hardest part of the job is working late one week out of the month and the most enjoyable is the freedom to set your own pace.
good,"Showed great respect for there employees."
good,"Our work was around the development of a new platform for claims fulfillment and it involved many teams across the company."
good,"It's a fun place to work, grow and learn. It has great benefit like 401k plan. You'll be working with all different nationalities."
good,"A typical day on a sort will involve sweat, and lots of it! Hard working and physically active people thrive in this work environment. From beginning to end, job responsibilities include but are not limited to unloading packages from trucks, sorting them to the correct chute/belt, building walls of packages inside FedEx trailers (aka playing Tetris), transporting non-conveyable items to proper trailers via electronic tugger, and sorting smaller packages in a clamshell/chute layout. I met a lot of great people and learned a lot about teamwork in this position."
good,"During a typical work week, one of my biggest tasks is checking the  progress on various financial results . I like to meet my manager  first thing on Monday to discuss our priorities for the week, then meet again in the middle of the week to check progress, and meet once at the end of the week to discuss goal setting for the next week.  Interaction with my co-workers and team leader to assure a good team work I also attend a weekly board meeting where I present my results ’s progress to the executive board. On Fridays, once all these tasks are completed, I make sure I have completed all necessary communication for the week via email and in person, and create a list of priorities for next week."
good,"Very interesting opportunity for someone willing to work hard at long term goals."
good,"Tough Place to advance."
good,Fun place to work.  Management has its ups and downs but overall a good company that could no longer meet my needs.  The hardest part of the job is during the winter months when we get super busy and full time employees are required to work overtime.
good,I just wish there was more hands on training. When I arrived there was no proper training for billing clerks I was given a stack of bills and told to bill and ask questions. The company itself is a great company they could just use some help in the training area
good,"To be a courier is almost like being self employed.  Once you leave the building in the morning you are pretty much on your own for the duration of your work day.  The courier job isn't very hard once you learn your route.  Takes about 2 weeks and then it's a pretty easy thing to adjust too.  "
good,"Training was great, everything flowed very well.  Fedex had their stuff together when I was working for them.  Not sure about 2015, but 10 years ago it was a great part time job."
good,Overall a good company but they need to improve in management and leadership. Mostly Part time with FedEx very hard to get full time with the company.
good,i started working at fedex as soon as i got out of high school and it was my first job . this job changed my life . i lost 80 pounds since i got the job.
good,The company deserves to be in the Fortune 500. I have had a great time working for this company. Everyday I try and follow the moto that FEDEX has everyday.
good,"its tiring but i enjoyed working there."

good,"Very good pay and great 'family' atmosphere within workgroups. Great benefits but a very high stress environment. If you can get past the constant pressure from management to make your numbers, you will enjoy most everything else about the job."
good,"Great work hours, your own boss on road, great co-workers, nothing hard about the job, the most enjoyable part is being outside and meeting different people everyday"

good,"Manage all testing activities. Co-ordinate with lot of people."
good,"This is the best company to work for at part time you get excellent benefits at a low low cost. But I you want to go higher to fill time you have to be there for 5 years, no matter how hard or good of a worker you are. I did more bills then anyone and perfectly when I moved to Houston TX to work at that terminal, I was promised full time before I moved to Houston TX from Augusta Georgia when I got there they gave me the run around about the full time position.

good,"Drive my daily routes and pickups. Learned S. Tampa and direction well. Management there when needed. Worked alone on my truck. Making sure all delivery and pick ups were in a timely manner. Pay Day best part, plus the relationships you develop with people on your route."
good,A typical work day involves coming in and organizing your truck.  Dispatching at an appropriate time to get your deliveries done.  Make your deliveries on time between 8 -5. Return to the terminal in a timely and safe manner.  I learned that a good work ethic and consistency pays off.  The relationships between management and co workers have been enjoyable and educational.  The hardest part of the job is surviving the nonstop volume of the holiday peak season work load.  The most enjoyable part of the job is customer interaction.

good,"A typical day at FedEx would involve changing unsatisfied customers into satisfied customer.  This would be done by employing my excellent problem solving skills, using my great people person attitude.   Thus creating a favorable total customer experience.   I also enjoyed  keeping up my co-works moral by always staying positive and encouraging. I was affectionately known as the buffer, I would be called in to calm irate customers and defuse hostile situations. "

good,Nice place if you like the hustle but nothing bad to say here.
good,"Working with FedEx was easy for me. I got along with my co workers and the manager they were all cool, What I learned while working there, how to lift packages, how to wrap them and how to pack them on the truck. FedEx was my first actual job ever for me, and working there I didn't know if I would be good enough but as I got to learning things I became a great worker at FedEx."
good,"consists of scanning barcodes on packages to verify they are in the correct trailer, then packing them securely into their trailer until full so that the truck can move on to the next destination in package transport."
good,The job was an amazing job. It helped me realize that everything has a time limit and can be slow doing things that you need to get done. The hardest part was when the line of the packages pile up all at one time and you are the only one putting all the packages on the right packages.
good,worked at a fst pace to load truck with the packages that were suspose tobe delivered on that day the managers were pretty great they stayed on top of yoru progression for that nit just to make sure that u didnt get too far behind.
good,"A typical day at work is steady, I've learned how to load and unload freight.

good,"Good work life balance."
good,"A typical day at work is moving all around from one job to another, I like doing it though you never get bored. I have learned the zip codes for different states. Management is excellent they always motovate you. My co-workers are excellent they are always there to lead a helping hand when you need it. The hardest part of my job was learning all of the zip codes. The most enjoyable part of my job is to know that I help the customers get their packages on time without anything wrong with them."
good,Fedex is a great place to work when your young and only need a partime job.
good,"job not secure unless you own your route, but great pay for the job, owner is a cool person, people were fun to work with, no benefits, family is always important to me the long hours during the week were not so bad since i did not have to work saturdays."
good,Part time early morning job good hours good benefits quick paced work.
good,"At this job you learn to drive revenue, value sell and how to fill and close a pipeline. You are not compensated for your actions as a typical sales job, and therefore it may not be very enjoyable."
good,lifting heavy boxes all day to put them on the right fed x truck.. but overall it was ok..
good,I loved it. It was like putting puzzles together. But it was a part time job. I needed more hours.
good,"a good company, dock worker/driver how to load freight in a quality manner. management/ I have concerns about my future! My coworkers are  great people. Hardest part of my job/not knowing my position Most enjoyable part of my job is my coworkers. "

Nothing about the job was hard, I enjoyed it everyday. Even if I has to assist an angry client. Situations like those did not bother me because I always remained calm and did all that I could do to help them."
good,Fast paced from the beginning of your day till the end. Have learned spot on management in order to put out new problems when they occur.
good,Early mornings but good pay so it is work it! During peak (Christmas season) go to work sometimes at 230 AM so that part was hard. Managment was great and really helpfull
good,"Enjoyed working with the drivers, driving the local area and seeing new areas. Entering data was easy computer work. Unloading truck was my excerise for the day!"
good,I liked to work with people and bring customers packages that they sorely need .I learned that customers appreciate timely deliveries.
good,its a cool environment were you actually work but with great rewards
good,"My job is to make copy of AWB, scan packing,, and move boxes to big caged"
good,I love working for this company because it challenges my people skills as well as my ability to get along with my fellow employees.
good,The customers are fun to work with. Management is not very understanding
good,"very busy from the time yo arrive. I learned there isno team work there. Management team only cares about their jobs and no matter who they hurt in getting what they want. No union, so if any issues, as far as employment laws Fedex feels as if they are the only ones who run the laws of all states. Co- workers are friendly and good people usually. No part of the part is difficult, customers may not be too understanding."
good,i enjoy working at FedEx for the people i work with. its part time and early in the morning but worth-while. good management and fair company.

good,i liked my jod but it demands alot that i was having trouble keepimg up with.
good,Federal Express is a good employer with great benefits for a part time entry level job
good,Working here was fun. Very strict but fun. team was amazing and worked hard together. Building jobs for important events and new businesses was a very big part of the job.
good,I like my job. The co-workers are amazing. The management team is overall good. Like most places they have their pets. The thing I don't like is the changing of hours.
good,Our VP lives by the philosophy that he works for us not the other way round. My MD in ZA believes in me and pushes me to step out of my comfort zone and take on big projects. My Snr Manager is constantly looking for new opportunities and includes her team in decision making.
good,"Excelentes benefícios e salario."
good,The benefits are great they just need to open up more full time spots management is good but they need to more involved with there assists not just the females they should also help us get our CDL license as well
good,"A day at work is not easy nor hard, we have to work in a fast pace and we are very competitive towards each other. Management there is very good, they encourage us to do better and also let us share our ideas for a better environment and always requires teamwork. The hardest part of the job is caring heavy boxes at a fast pace. The most enjoyable thing about the job is the coworkers because everyone is friendly."
good,"Enjoyed working here "
good,"I loved FedEx, good pay, advancement was available. Management is helpful. O worked part- tome which was very good for my schedule for family and school."
good,"Ótima  empresa na minha visão e na visão do mercado de trabalho, recomendo a todos que queiram trabalhar na FedEx"

good,"Uma empresa a qual iniciei minha carreira no ramo de logística, e aprendi muito com o passar dos tempos e ganhando experiência profissional com os mais antigos de casa"
good,"Fun easy and fast paced, great environment for people of all cultures. Easy to learn and they also train you. Not a job for someone who doesn't like physical work."
good,As a part time forklift operator at fedex you are only allowed to work 29.99 hours a week.  You are not allowed to work more than that even if you wanted to.  However the average week there is about 20-25 hours. Some weeks you could work as little as 15-20 hours.  Overall it’s a good job.
good,Great career Opportunities.  Ability to relocate around the world. Diverse workforce.  Promotional Opportunities.  Pay could be more competitive in some opco's.
good,I worked there for little over 2 months and it was pretty good! They throw you right in and as long as you didn’t lie during your interview and orientation it’s pretty Easy. And they give you room for advancement .
good,Great job with competitive pay. They give you your assignment and left you alone. If given the opportunity I would return in a heartbeat. Compensation and benefits were outstanding.
good,"Deadlines to meet every day,  Go home, wake up, Repeat!!!"
good,"Adorei trabalhar na fedex,uma empresa muito agradável  para trabalhar.tá de parabéns  é  muito família."
good,I enjoyed working with FedEx. the customer service was excellent.  My colleagues were nice. My supervisor was great with communication and I was able to maintain work balance.
good,It’s easy for beginners but become more aware when there’s more accountable things going on in the area nothing that a person that could lift more than 75 pounds couldn’t do .
good,I learned time management because you had to unload or load trucks at a certain rate. When working for them I was able to gain experience for a big cooperation.
good,"Verify documentation matches freight and document incoming and outgoing freight."
good,As long as you have common sense and physically fit job is a breeze. Fun environment to work in and hardest thing to do is probably just constantly getting back on and off the truck to deliver packages.
good,Shift work( 3rd ) in my case was difficult on the body  rest/sleep it is face pace and most of the time team driven  great benefits package but you earn it
good,Aprendes a como lidiar con todo tipo de clientes en diferentes situaciones. Aprendes sobre muchas culturas y a indetificar las necesidades de cada personas
good,This position was a fast paced role that varied everyday. The position requires a lot of self scheduling and time management. it also involves a lot of travel.
good,"Smart, committed and creative co-workers.  Pleasant work environment.  Excellent core values.  Employee respect culture, in the office and in the field."
good,"Very fast paced, great group of people to work with. Lifting packages for your entire shift, It's like coming to work, and getting paid for a gym workout!"
good,"Great place to work and culture is excellent. One of the few companies left that offer pension with 401k company match."
good,Fast paste environment sometime I would recommend this job to anyone who is interested in working in a steady fast paste knows how to get the job done in a timely manner and follow close attention to written or verbal instructions
good,as a contract employee there are no benefits granted and there is no solo driving opportunities to be had.  they have a good staff in dispatch but overnight hours are less than stellar.
good,"Correcta y eficiente administración, operación coordinada en base al cumplimiento de objetivos"
good,"Nice people, great job unfortunately it’s not working with my family life and unable to change to an earlier shift. I have lots more responsibility than I had but I would like to earn a better wage."
good,i have been working at fedex more than 4 to 5 years but they have totally low management skills.i learned lots of things whats they doing on manual form. work place culture is also low.hardest part of job is timing and there was no enjoyable part of job which i done
good,great atmoshere they really catered to their  employees and they hire within the company great benefits great locker rooms and shower stals it was definitely an awesome  place to work i on the other hand work 3 to 4 hours at 13an  and hour for four days a week
good,"Good job, Good job to learn in pressure that how to work in festive season occasion and weekends. Good staff who support you any time. Shift flexibility."
good,Excelente empresa soy una persona que si recomendaria este sitio para laborar
good,"I worked as a delivery driver for Fed Ex.  You actually work for an independent contractor that is hired under the Fed Ex label.  Good job, kept you busy."
good,"great place to work, excellent work group and work group participation. Taking care of the outside vendor locations was a major responsibility for myself. being able to take a week a qtr and visit the locations and making sure I was getting what I was paying for. working with some of the best technician's I have ever encountered. We were proud of our fleet because it was the oldest in the company and also in one of the worst climates in the country (winter). when I retired we still were able to run a fleet with well over 1 million miles at an age of a born date of 1995"
good,It was okay to work at FedEx. The hours was not good and I did not like cold weather at all. The benefits was great and discounts was awesome as well. When you let the company know you work at FedEx.
good,"Foi uma experiência muito boa,nunca tinha sido operador logístico não imaginava o que seria.gostava muito do quê fazia as amizades que conquistei várias muito bom"
good,Unloading and sorting packages. The role this company pays in delivering packages. Management was nice. A good place to work. Gets backed up from time to time. When the shift is done and trucks are loaded.
good,"I worked as a seasonal driver... it was a great job for extra money, during the holidays. Management went above and beyond my expectations.  They listened to any concerns I had and fixed any problem that arose."
good,"This was years ago so I can't speak for the recent company. When the original founder retired and sold majority of the stock, the new regime wanted to go public with the company. In order to make the books look good decisions were made based on money instead of the best for the employees or the company."
good,well this company gives me a stepping stone to go further and giving me experience and I was thankful because this company provides me on day to day needs.
good,It was a good place to work if you are not looking for full time work. It is hard to get into FedEx full time starting out. It can take several years to get to a full time position. Most of the Employees were freindly and helpful but the background checking and hiring process is slow.
good,Work there for two years. Great work environment! Fast pace moving job. A lot of early mornings starting at 3am but they have other shifts. Do your job and they will appreciate you
good,Upper management never seems to know what they're doing at any given time. PTO is stingy at best and God forbid you have to call out sick or dying. Write ups for everyone.
good,"I worked for FEDEX on and off under a contractor. They treated me great and when I needed work, they took me back. They really can see who's a go getter and who's their just for the pay check. I loved working under my contractors and will always be there for them. Rick, Anthony, and Steve!!! You're the best!!"
good,Fedex was a great place to work until I had to transfer out to a different station (in particular the MCO Station). It seemed to me as if there was alot of favoritism. I don't agree with managers who ignore the fact that they have a HARD working employee but yet satisfy other employees needs just because they have been at that station for longer. I was a fedex worker for over 3 years and believe it or not they were paying a guy double what I wqas getting payed just because he had been at the station for 2 months longer than me. LETS NOT EVEN GET STARTED ON JOB ADVANCEMENT..
good,"Ive learned lots about my previous job, for example more knowledge about the computer, good typing speed.Right work conducts. we provide good costumer service, by giving good quality work . the hardest part of this job is you have to be focus all of the time. Learn to set aside personal problems from work."
good,"Very demanding job that required time management, ability to make sales and good customer service skills."
good,"The days at work were you would lift boxes and stack them up. "
good,"Fast Pace can be dangerous in Hub/ trying to move up into management. I would like to see the company train us more about the stock options, more benefit information during new hire training."
good,"I enjoy working here, it can be exhausting but if you need an easy job that has consistent pay its a good choice. advancing on in the company will take awhile though and to some its not worth the wait."
good,The job was not hard but you definitely had to work with a sense of urgency!! No two days were alike and you had to reprioritize constantly to reach your daily stops per hour goals no matter what obsticles or challenges your faced. Excellent benefits and career growth with the right leader in your corner.
good,Will always work there no questions asked very good company everybody work with you no bad vibes and team work make the dream work.very good schedule good times and good pay.
good,"FedEx gets their money's worth out of their employees. Fortunately, The do pay well, with incredible benefits. Some of the best managers I've ever had work there, are supportive and proactive to assist you in  performing your duties"
good,"The one thing that keeps FedEx from being an amazing company is its rotation of management. It creates a management culture that can be considered as ""climbers"" rather than people that are concerned with their direct reports and what they do. Of the five mangers I've had in seven years, I've only had one that was genuinely concerned with my co-workers and what we did."
good,"Probably the most relaxing sales work culture i have been around. Only allowed to work 40 hours a week. Hourly + Commission was the pay scale. The hourly was very low and the commission was not very high to make up the difference. "
good,"Just a really fast paced environment, that will require you stand a lot being able to left 50lbs or more. In addition,going to there job training is a must and being on time for the start of your shift."
good,Uma empresa ótima para trabalhar gostava muito mais por motivos tive que sair
good,"Conduct the loading and unloading of inbound and outbound freight using appropriate motorized fork lift equipment, verify documentation matches freight description using current electronic systems for destination accuracy, Responsible for proper loading and securing of outbound shipments to include Hazardous Materials, Comply with all Federal and State laws and regulations as well as company policies / procedures"
good,"FedEx offers good benefits, along with completive pay. Theres plenty of room for advancement in you're willing to move. FedEx offers a lot of in house training and very few positions require any out of work training. My five years with the company as a whole has been fairly positive."
good,A typical night at work; you come in start to load packages until all are ready to be loaded on a plane. Some people have to deal with micromanagement while others do not.
good,Its a good company to work for even through some times management isn't that great. The customer service standards are well met. Its a good paced energetic enviroment.
good,Good place to work it was stressful working in the trucks loading and unloading them. But it was a temporary job. I liked it and it was fun. met a bunch of new friends
good,"i come in at 5:40 am and put up my schedule  and then i go and get my truck and go to the airport and pick up the packages to deliver before 8:am to homes and businesses and i get signature. "
good,empresa muito boa com condiçoes de trabalho boas.com chances de promoçao

good,"The work was a assigned as a collective. Data entry was expected to be entered accurately and with speed. I had excellent reviews. "
good,"Great company to work for, pay and benefits really good.  Management could be better. Could be really stressful at times, requires lots of organization and time management."
good,leaned how to use a lot of difffent things . meet new people fast past hard work . decent hours decent pay. made the enviroment good to go to work to every day.
good,"obtive muito conhecimento em transporte, como nota fiscal, procedimentos de transporte, fiscalização, rastreio de mercadoria, rastreio de veiculo, orçamentos de preços, agendamento de coletas, interatividade entre cliente e filiais. um ambiente muito agradável de trabalhar, onde os colegas um coopera com o outro pra ajuda e auxiliar, colegas bem unidos."
good,I was overnight operation manager responsible for all overnight shipments extremely busy during work night and a lot of stress at that time facility was old (belts were braking constantly) and it was very difficult to work But I was sent to two operational colleges and I was trained well for the job
good,"Busy from the time you hit the dock. Hours/schedule tends to get changed a lot, weekly in cases. Did not do good for home life with changing so frequently. Opportunity for growth if an individual applied themselves."
good,I enjoyed my time at fed ex the work was simple and easy most of the work can be done unsupervised. I loved working here my co workers were very helpful and friendly
good,"Bom eu trabalhava com a maquininhas dá Cielo ,eu limpava máquina , também desbloqueio dá máquina passava cartão para ver que estava pegando , montavam caixa fazia de tudo um pouco conferia o código ,tudo um pouco"
good,Great place to work. Friendly environment and it gives you a steady pay check. Around the holidays it gets crazy and you get lots of business.
good,This is my first full time job. I am learning something new everyday. I feel that my management treats me and my colleagues very fairly. There's so much growth with the company and they listen to their employees and give us the resources to do our job successfully.
good,This job would be a great one for a college student or a home maker that only needs a few hours of work per week. The training leaves a lot to be desired. The billers type so fast that it is impossible to follow what you are supposed to do. The pay was average. The management DOES NOT want to be bothered with any problems...in other words if you have a problem you better figured it out on your own. No such thing as full time positions here!
good,"Extremely fast paced work environment, must work as a team, very good team morale. Veterans are strongly advised to be apart of the Fed Ex Ground team."
good,"Great company to work for, great wages and benefits. But just like any other large corporation, you have your slackers, and with those you have to pick up the slack to get things done."
good,"Loved the job, constantly moving, fast paced, very physical. Liked working 12 hr. shifts, and overtime through the holiday Peak Season."
good,"The best part, in my personal opinion is the fact that its fast pace. Everyone woks together to get the job done. I a never feaful of asking questions because everyone either knows the answer or gets the answer. The atmosphere is vey welcoming. The hardest thing about working here is to never lose your sense of urgency!"
good,I work as an associate of operations beside my reception duties all in all I would say that All okay
good,"Scanning each parcel or shipment for different locations & loading into ULDS."
good,"I worked for 15 years on the Airline Airfreight Team. A very long standing, cohesive unit, we were a total of 20 Nationwide."
good,empresa de grande porte multinacional onde tive oportunidade  de mostrar meu conhecimento so tenho que agradecer o aprendizado que conquistei . para passar adiante  numa nova experiencia onde tambem agregarei novos conhecimentos
good,"We had a Manager get us started each day, with all the duties, we had assigned for our section.  We could play basketball, and we won prizes.  This is a motivated company, that works the employees very hard.  Shorter hours and lots of work.  Why go to the gym.  I went home and took a nap, before my later classes at college.  The management were easy going and helpful.  The staff was kind and fun very helpful when, I first came onboard.  Everyone had a section to work at each day.  The hardest part of the job was lifitng heavy weight and moving very fast was a requirement.  I am a stronger individual, of working for Fed Ex, mentally and Physically, thanks Fed ex for working me so hard everyday. Management always had a job for me.   I actually enjoyed working there, but you better be fast and furious and in good shape."
good,"It was a nice job. I would love to work there again. Great people, good money and great benefit packages. I worked there for two years and they were really understanding about balancing my schedule with my military duties."
good,"Just enjoyed working at this company, the time just flew by, before you knew it, your shift was finished, people there were friendly. :)"
good,Hard work but that makes the time flies by. Good people to work with but the management is to aggressive when handling hourly employee's
good,"e uma empresa muito boa mas elas deveria dar mais oportunidades para os seus funcionarios, aprendi muitas coisas ,a parte mais dificil do trabalho e lidar com a emcarregada do setor ela acha que e melhor do que os outros funcionarios. mas temas os momentos de descontraçao."
good,Its a good company to work for. The company has room for advancement but all depends if theres and opening wich could take a long time.
good,a great place to work with good people and management. Great team players. It's an outstanding company to work at; great benefits & pay.
good,equal for everyone great management open door policy for HR. good advancement opportunity for every employee who is interested in moving up the ladder.
good,"Hard working people, fast pace working environment got things done on time sometimes before ."
good,"O dia de trabalho e o ambiente na grande maioria das vezes era bem tranqüilo. O ambiente de trabalho interno era muito bom."
good,"18 hours shifts, learned how important a parcel can be, great manager. great o-workers, hardest part not really, most enjoyable being santa claus for young ones"
good,"A typical day @ work is stressful sometime, i have learned a lot about people & tracking packages. mgmt here is excellent, my co-workers are down to earth people & majority is friendly, easy to get along with. The hardest part of the Job is listening to the people calling you names & cursing @ you. The enjoyable part is that I love people & i love helping in anyway that i'm able to"

good,"the job was very fast paced , the time frame was set very high but could be completed if you were familiar with it , the hours was ok it was 3rd shift but the management was very unorganized it was first come first served for everyday shift and when the company closed they did not notify employees"
good,responsible for loading and unloading conveyor belt in a precised time and fashion then after that i inspect the whole area for missing packages and that too ha to be done in a timely manner
good,"Fedex Ground  is a company focused on the bottom line. Although they do care about safety, making changes in policy and procedures that will improve the company in all aspects, takes an act of god. Takes way to long and not enough responsibility is delegated to the employees that actually perform the work and service."
good,"Fedex is a overall good place to work,you get several raises in the long run,in 5 years you can make alot even for a part time job."
good,"Start anywhere between 2 AM and 4 AM and end the day when everything is off loaded and sorted usually between 7 AM and 9 AM depending on the capacity of the loads. Anywhere from 10 thousand to 100 thousand packages (depending if it is during peak season or not)."
good,For about two and a half hours I would unload semi trucks followed by sorting packages to proper locations.
good,"Physically demanding and strong production driven environment. Great place for goal achieving person. While there I learned how to reach for higher standards personally and the importance of pacing one's self for a long term career. Management can be helpful or hurtful to the  workforce with the manner of use of their   power. All persons are not ready to be effective leaders of people. At the beginning of my career with the company the candidates for hire were screened much more diligently and co-workers seemed to much more in tune with each other than when I came to the end of my day to day experience with the company.  The hardest part of the job for me was dealing with a lot of the political challenges that were constant day to day. The most enjoyable part of the job was being part of a team who reached the goals of the day,,,those goals that were fairly obtainable."
good,"Unloading trucks with a forklift"
good,"Set daily cost plans and man hours needed to complete daily workload on city driver cost, dock hour cost , clerical cost, and road driver cost. Management was easy to communicate with via email or phone calls. Supervisors and other managers were very easy to work with and reach out to for knowledge. The hardest part of the job was getting the drivers to understand the direction the company was heading in. The drivers continuous felt that the company was working to just hit the numbers. The most enjoyable part of the job was having holidays off."
good,Awesome company to have worked the last 20 years. Learned and mastered the management of  a very diverse workforce.
good,I enjoy working at FeEx. I learned alot being with this company.
good,Its a fantastic company to work for with spectacular benifits
good,"Great Customer Service Interaction"
good,"Get there at 7:30pm everyday, clock in, have our daily safety talk and then work on the trucks that were already there. Get a break after 2 hours and then continue. Clock out around 10-11:30. I learned the management system, the quota that was expected. How to operate smoothly at a large warehouse. The management was fantastic,  never had a problem with anyone there and never noticed anyone else with a problem either. My co-workers were also excellent, varied individuals, learned from some and taught others. The hardest part was the first week there, had to adjust to increased physical activity as well as the heat. The most enjoyable part was the excitement, the pressure to work hard and do your job as smoothly as possible."
good,"Typical day at work would be scanning documents via e-mail to desktop and loading documents into workstation. Taking requests via E-mail form vendors and engineers. "
good,delivery and pickup of packages and customer interaction. fast paced physical work. safe driving. working without supervision. dot certified
good,Love the co worker and managers very caring and understandable.
good,"Positive feedback from upper management. (Hub manager and assistant hub manager) "
good,"A normal day on the job. Coming in at 3am to begin a four hour work shift of unloading a large truck. Time really is money."
good,"it was a good and fun work place,Fast pace job and you learn good things everyday about the job and coworkers an manger the hardest part of job when it got closer to the dead line and it would get heavy but we ALL would meet deadline but the best part of my job was my employees"
good,Easy going and hardwork.  Short shifts great place to work especially if you like to be physically active.
good,I placed packages onto different conveyor belts and ensured they arrived to their destination. I loved the people there. The girls looked very good and the team leaders were nice. I liked the company very much and miss it sometimes.
good,"It's a great company to work for, and it's more a stable working environment. But it has been changing in the past several years. IT is being outsourced and the resourced acclocated to IT is getting less and less. Life and work balance is excellent, but not seeing many opportunity for advancement and compensation increase. We have been through pay cut, benefit cut and many other cost reduction type of changes. But overally, it's still a great company to work for, especially if this is the type of working environment you are looking for. "
good,FedEx is a great place to work! Requires excellent discipline and Customer Service. Dedication and hard work is a must.
good,"On a typical day, I come in and help route load my trailer as a way to make my delivery time efficient by selecting which destinations come after one another. Sometime things go exactly as planned, but there are time when the timing at certain destination prohibit me from doing thing in sequential order. This job requires me to adapt to uncertain situations that may develop throughout the day. I learned how to communicate and be observant of the multiple cultures and business behaviors of the many customers on the daily bases because it was part of my job to interact with them to complete my duties. Co-workers can be an assess to helping complete difficult tasks because they may have dealt with certain situation that become new to me, which is also a learning part of the job. The hardest aspect of this jobe is the long hours that come into effect from time to time, especially when I make plans in my personal life. The most ejoyable part is being able to help customers negotiate which options would be best suitable for the shipping needs, and experiencing the positive reaction from the customers after the job is complete for them individually."
good,"I joined FedEx during it's early days and had the opportunity to grow with the company.  I started as a service agent in Atlanta, was promoted 4 times, and moved from Atlanta to Columbia to Memphis to Jacksonville."
good,This was a great job their for three years and loved it. But make sure when you work here you are ready for change.
good,good people bosses and employees and scan a lot boxes it was just seasonal work no benfits or full time
good,Working at fed-ex was very fast paced. I learned how to work at a fast paced and by my self.
good,"Good Place to work, Good Co-workers,"
good,get to work learn what route u running.  if u don't know the route u do for the day. workers help u if u don't know that route.
good,In the morning we expect to leave by 7am but about once a week a truck would be behind and it would take an extra 30min-60min before we could leave. The terminal managers were never social to drivers but my contractor was great he helped me a lot and taught me a lot. My co-workers were nice. The hardest part of the job was when there was deliveries way out of the way. The most enjoyable is talking to all the people we delivered to.
good,a typical day at work is getting their and receive my load and connect trailers. The hardest part of the job is leaving my family for days on end.
good,"Fun place to work, good atmoshpere but bad management. Unloaded and loaded trucks for about an hour and a half, so not a lot of hours. Loved the people I worked with except my manager, was just to young and didnt know much about the company."
good,I would like to work for them again. its a good job to work for and you progress in company
good,"I unload freight from large containers and scan and sort documents in a nutshell.We work as a team in an urgent manner.It is very physical and demanding,but I feel great being active."
good,excelente experiência que guardarei com carinho por toda minha vida
good,"Nice place to work, they have been willing to work around my schedule when needed."
good,Good companyto work for. Room to move up if you are willing to move around the US.
good,"Loading trucks with correct packages. As a lead package handler and trainer, I was responsible with training new hires with policy and procedures of the company. Also as an unloader, I unloaded packages from incoming trucks into the facility."
good,• Assists in the training of branch team members
good,Drive allover west lothian know west lothian well good work colleuges loading van hardest empty yuor van
good,It was a good job. I worked alot of hours and it was very stressful.
good,the job is great i love it learned alot from it and all the chances of moving up the hardest part of the job is its extremely physical and very fast paced if you are not a quick mover not a good job for u
good,When have unexpeted calls not to show up on duty from my group.
good,"Fedex bought my groceries for twenty-three years, and I could never bad-mouth them to any outsider. My last ""gig"" was a pick-up/delivery run with heavyweight shipements in the Lake Charles area, followed by consolodating heavyweight and express freight on a 53-foot trailer and shuttling to the Lafayette airport for ramp operations. I was in aircraft interfase throughout my career as a driver, ramp agent, dangerous goods specialist,load captain, and equipment operator."
good,Load an prepare truck for deliverys
good,This is a Nice Company could be better pay This is great for women or men that like to drive no CDL needed
good,"Some days can be long, Then there is there is the holiday season.."
good,Great company. Good management. Co-workers look out for each other.
good,I enjoy seeing the country and visiting different states but I have to be up all night and into the next day sometimes to get freight to a destination. There are absolutely no health or life insurance benefits and that is a concern of mine at this time. So in short I am on the hunt for a new job and new adventure in my life :)
good,"Fun fast paced environment, I learned a lot about shipping and package handling as well as printing. The management for the Las Vegas area was horrible, they did not seem to care about there employees, but i have worked with the company in Albuquerque and the management there was top notch. Aside from the management everyone i worked with was happy energetic and full of happiness and loved helping the customers with there projects and getting things done in a timely manner. The job was pretty easy cause i dealt with things that were pretty much second nature to me. I enjoyed going to work every day because the people were great and i loved being able to help customers and seeing them happy when i completed there orders and they really made my day."
good,"FedEx is the only place I know of that you work part-time, but recieve full-time benefits. Great atmosphere with job security."
good,Fedex is a great place to work. Im a customer service rep taking calls from customers to resolve issues regrading package delivery.
good,Tthe hardest part of the job was learning the routes. The most enjoyable part of the job was the freedom to make decisions and career development.
good,"I worked at FedEx Express in the International Clearance area, the job I did on a daily basis was, to set up areas for the night sort, gather information after sort, and either I had to scan incoming freight, or unload freight. The management was okay, sometimes it seems as if the employees weren't allowed to know everything that was going on, but we eventually found anyway. The most enjoyable part of the job was the money, paid holidays, 2 weeks vacation per year, and excellent medical insurance."
good,"Fast paced, transportation - delivery environment, great people, innovative place"
good,"I like Fedex Home Delivery which is part of the Ground delivery service, you are an owner operator, you buy the truck you buy the route, its basically youre own business, Fedex suppiles you with the work enough each day to keep you busy for 8 hrs easily, its mostly all delivery service with not many pickups which is nice because when you get done delivering you can go home, people were nice coworkers and management all to the most got along well, best part of the job was working by yourself and meeting a ton of people from all walks of life in a day, hardest part of the job I would have to say is learning all the streets in your area but you do the same route everyday so you catch on quick, vehicle maintanance and gas costs are all you, you pay all the bills and repairs when something goes wrong as well as all your own benefits and taxes, make sure you put money away for taxes or you will be in trouble at tax time, alot of drivers dont put money away and dont have enough to pay at tax time, pay is based off of each stop and box piece you deliver the more you do the more you get paid, Christmas time you can make some serious money obviously, I liked the job I had to sell my route and truck for medical reasons"
good,LOTS OF OVERTIME. but a great job. long work days. mangement is somewhat flexible.
good,it was a nice workplace very big.the managers were very professional
good,a typical day at work was very fast. i learned how to load a whole trailer by myself. management was excellent. my coworkers were sometimes rude. the hardest part of the job was having to deal with the heat. the most enjoyable part of the job was meeting new people and making sure the load was secure.
good,Call center was a little stressful at times. All in all this is a great company to work for. Would love to go back just not to the call center.
good,All you do is load/unload trailers by a propane powered forklift.
good,"Fed-Ex is a Fast passed environment, that helps individuals become more alert and more coordinated toward safety and individual care. It teaches one competitiveness , accuracy and team development."
good,If I hadn’t been diagnosed with cancer I would still be here. There are not any negative things I can say about this company and the people who work within it. I miss this job
good,"I worked for Fedex home delivery , it was great . At times can be overwhelming . The hours was long the pay was good. I hate peak season lol . It is a back breaking job a lot of lifting a lot of organizing and you have to start your shift early . But I love the traveling and doing my job solo ."
good,"Uma empresa que tem responsabilidade com o profissional é que dá oportunidades de crescimento, oferece um ambiente de respeito entre gestão empresa e funcionários"
good,Boa de se trabalhar. ...ótima convivência entre funcionário e empresa ....prestadores de serviços e solução rápida a ágil. ....
good,"my typical nite at work is getting he boxes on the planes by sorting them out where they go,scanning makin labels. I learned how to open and closed a can."
good,It was a great job. It feels like a workout at times but most importantly is work . Get paid every week on Friday good money good job location and a lot of good ppl.
good,"Easy job, easy money. They provide flexible hours that is perfect for stay at home parents, college students, and someone that's looking for another job to supplement their income."
good,"Good place to be at, working... I had a wonderful new experience working there. I learn how to delivered packages to residences  homes I got use the computer machine ."
good,"Foi uma uma ótima  empresa, no qual tive um ótimo aprendizagem."
good,"Great management, great people working their, work environment is great. Pay is well, definitely could use more people to work their. Even the experience workers help out the newcomers"
good,"You work for a contractor not Fed Ex.  They determine your pay and hours and whether you'll deliver home or ground routes.  Great training, supportive managers and coworkers plus free uniforms."
good,Delivery driver with same downtown route for most of career. Heavy customer service. Fast paced environment also very heavy lifting. Benefits are very good. I’m glad I finished with a spotless driving record!
good,Only positives came from this job. Learned discipline and teamwork.  Maybe should get paid more. Hardwork but the job has a lot of benefits.The work culture there is pretty decent
good,I love this Company I’m glad I found this job and when it switches to the other company and we get another raid I will be even happier I’m never leaving
good,Great place to work! Room for opportunity to grow within the company. Great atmosphere! Very nicely managed. Hard work but easy to learn. Fast paced.!
good,"Great benefits, great education/ on-going training. Great facilities, clean, great equipment."
good,"I was at FedEx Express 26 years. It is a solid company,  and I made a decent living there. I retired with a pension and a 401k.  It is stressful,  but one needs to expect that. Constant time commitments met is how pkgs. move on time overnight. The years went by fast, and you will never enjoy Christmas again. You will get a days extra rest Dec.25."
good,It was a great job to be able to work at part time but when it came time to being hired for full time. It took way too long for me to wait any longer. I was looking to grow within but I had to go look for the opportunity else where to support my family.
good,"I worked at Fedex only in a temp status. Great department, good people. Main complaint: nobody wants to hire permanently and pay what people are worth"
good,They're a good  company but they have owner contractors that Sub Contract and I was taken with$3500.00 the Contractor stole from me.Its based on lies.
good,"Best workplace atmosphere! People are pleasant, great company, great people, kind employees! People have been working here for years together! 20-30 years!"
good,One of my best jobs I ever had they really care and take care of their employees if you want to move up from package Handler to driver or to manager they encourage and help you to succeed
good,"I would recommend FedEx as a secondary job because of productivy you have to commit.As far as advancement it varies.I relocated from VA to Georgia because of opportunities,but they took advantage of what I could offer after  6yrs +3 months I quit !I have worked Ground and Home delivery for 6 year's."
good,This is probably the top paying company at Newark Airport. Is great if its peak season and there are tons of hours. After peak season is over they have very little work. The warehouse can be extremely cold in the winter. When there's lots of work it's fast-paced and stressful keeping up with all of your Freight. There are times you stand around freezing waiting for containers to come in off trucks or planes.
good,I really enjoyed my time at fedex. it was a fast friendly work place. Could be hectic at times but overall a fun place to call a job. very reputable company
good,Great management. Weird and not enough hours. Very fast paced. You were expected to scan and load 300 packages on an hour. Not everyone could reach that number so they would give you help. Gave us Gatorade and water. Sometimes fruit to keep you hydrated. The warehouse was not climate controlled. If I could have got more hours a week I would have stayed.
good,I enjoyed doing security there an I learned a lot. Only thing I did not enjoy was out supervisor. He had said a little racial slur and the investigation took to long so I left. I could not continue to work with him after that.
good,"Empresa boa para se trabalhar, que oferece oportunidades e cumpre com todas as suas obrigações."
good,"Its a very good place to work everyine there is very friendly and helpful, if you ask anyone there for help you will get help from someone who knows what they are doing. The managers are very professional and will hold conversations with you while you work and will check up on you and your teammates too make sure everythings ok and going how its supossed too and if need be they will be there right next too you too help."
good,I loved working there it was always a place where I feel comfortable. Hours are good but never enough only part time . But it’s weekly pay which is good and the people are always helpful so you don’t ever have to feel like you’re working alone
good,"Nothing personal, but FedEx was a second job for me. The handler position was not a living wage at the time.  I loved the fast paced environment, great workout and paid while doing it. Although I never made use of the benefits, the package was great. The ability to transfer almost anywhere in the country is a plus."
good,"the hardest part of this job is lifting and pushing heavy boxes. It is a great work environment to work in, most people are very outgoing and easy to get along with."
good,"Its was alright, but I couldn't work around the hours to maintain school and work. So I had to leave work in order to have enough energy to go to school."
good,"Do not apply to FedEx if you do not want to work hard! Most everyone must start as a package handler and climb up the corporate ladder but there are times those are hired at higher positions. The turnover for package handlers seems very high. Many won't last a week and some don't get through the first day. It's not rocket science but its fast paced and you must lift/move boxes quickly. Some weigh up to 200lbs although most are 10 - 20lbs or less. Another factor for the turnover is since it's the goal to move up the best PHs are usually promoted. Your line work environment can depend heavily on your manager and there are some really terrible ones but there are great ones as well... If you are stuck with a bad one keep your head down and do your job. They can rotate often and you're basically left to do your own thing after being there for a while. Another factor for work environment is where and how big the facility you work at is. Bigger facilities seems to be much better to work at and have a greater opportunity for advancement."
good,"Great Company, good training, excellent teamwork... For a sales professional you manage your own agenda have to hit the quarter company's goals. Sometimes it can feel like micromanagement with your boss and you have to balance the work / family time. Fun part of it get to know a lot of people which is excellent for networking."
good,"This job applied customer service skills, dealing with customers daily. I loaded truck to coordinate with route, drove a box truck or van to make deliveries to businesses and residential homes, and scanned packages."
good,On the go and high level stress line of work to do. Less room for errors and always have a 101/100 approach to complete work task. Safety is number one for the company.
good,"fed ex was greta to work for the pay was excellent, but no paid holidays, sick time or benefits you were considered sub contractors and you had to buy all your own supplies including trucks, oil, tires ,uniforms."
good,"Due to the expansive nature of the Fedex trade network and their hub and spoke model of distribution it's hard to beat Fedex when it comes to shipping or learning the trade. The culture is intensely productivity and safety centric which aids in developing the skills that one can use in any sort of job involving logistics or transportation. Corporate management is conservative and a bit monolithic, however, the local management has always been outstanding."
good,"A typical day of work is very long. You are on a salary, so you work as long as they need you; however you get free room and board, so it pays off in the end. You do anything from working in the office to going outside and teaching outdoor education. The management was good, I am a member of our leadership team as well during the summers. The hardest part of the job is the time commitment because you get can very burnt out from the number of hours you work. At this job, though, you will meet your best friends and build relationships with people from all over the world. I love working along side my best friends and getting to see them all the time."
good,I had a territory.  I made calls to bring on new business.  I went out in the field on occasion.  I resolved shipping issues such as lost packages or pickup/delivery.
good,okay. Positive work flow and output. Not enough recognition for job advancement. Management is okay but catered to. The hardest part was trying to get along
good,"working around good people if your a people person. the work is very heavy, but if your young you can do it all day.Good with training for advancement in the company if that is the direction you are wanting to go."
good,"I enjoy the work, it's not all that difficult of a job to do. I love talking to my coworkers when we get a break, it make the atmosphere better and it is easier to create better team work. I have also lost weight since joining. The only down side is I don't get enough hours. So it is a great part time job."
good,I only worked at Fed Ex for a week and a half. I helped with the huge influx of packages over christmas. It is a very fast paced workplace. You gain a routine. It pays well. All about being organized.
good,Everything about the company is great... but can be mentally exhausting at the rate new things are expected to be learned.  It already takes a good 2 years to get the initial job under your belt and they will add something and expect you to learn it in 2 days.
good,"You show up, put your belongings in a locker, and go through a security checkpoint to get in- no metal allowed, no phones allowed, and, if the scanner fails, you get a wand passed over you. On the way out, you get wanded and have to remove your shoes. As I never had any desire to take any item from their facility, this fell under the heading of over-intrusive. (I suppose that they do have issues with theft, but I never saw anyone do that sort of thing.)"
good,"check in to work and get instructions on number of trucks to unload"
good,"I really needed a fulltime job and this was only parttime good company which I could have had more advancement and chance for full time however enjoyed my time there ,"
good,"enjoyed working here, getting paid for a early morning 4 hour workout. fun work environment, busy from start to finish.  ...................................."
good,"Typical day at work includes: fixing others peoples loading mistakes. Bearing the brunt of unseen mistakes on your own. Driving through the busy streets of Kansas City making deliveries of often damaged freight to frustrated customers. Working with fair managers who are often overworked and over stressed themselves, trying to meet deadlines. Most frustrating: is co-workers who use you as their fall guy rather than owning their mistakes. Hardest part of the job is dealing with a particular dispatcher who is concerned only with their own career."
good,"Eager to learn, engages in conversation easily, loves working with a wide range of people, doesn't mind picking up extra shifts or filling in spots for missing associates."
good,A sense of accomplishment everyday. Satisfaction of getting the people what they want. Advancement is a continuous thing in the area your in or relocation.
good,"it's hard to get your problem solved when it's your check, or any other questions. I been trained on new job site that don't have to be  by seniority."
good,FedEx is a great be work place! One just has to be patient enough to put in time to move up in the company. Although it doesn't take long 25-30 hours a week wasn't enough for myself. But if you're looking for a great partime career this one is for you.
good,I enjoyed working at FedEx it was a temp agency they tried to get me on permanent but by the time paper work was finished peek season was over. they called me back 2 years straight for me to come back but i'd already moved back to Raleigh. there was nothing hard about working there because everything was in order. i enjoyed the job all around.
good,"Long hours, great staff,pay and benefits.  Loved the overtime as anything over 8 hours is time and a half.  I also enjoyed the family gatherings and cookouts"
good,the company is a corporation so they had strict guidelines to follow not much flexibility to handle issues for customers. As a whole the company was a great place to work for pre RPS merger. After that many local mangers were put in place that did not understand customer service drove business.
good,"Great Company to work for, fast pace but safe environment. part time pay can start anywhere from $15 an hour to $17 an hour. At this time of year they hire alot of part timers."
good,I loved the job but I didn't like the long days. When the weather was bad it was really bad. I still liked it but it was a hard job.The days went by so fast. I did meet some wonder people!!!
good,"i enjoy my position with Fedex, they are flexible in work schedule and  maintain a level of professionalism at all times. It is an exciting and fun environment to work in. Physically its taxing, but all in all a good work out."
good,FedEx was very fast paced and competitive. A daily exercise was always required so you didn't hurt a muscle. as we unloaded trucks we had to turn the label over so the other person can scan it. You had to be very fast and be careful with packages.
good,"I had a true experience working there. It was only for a short time, because I was relocationing somewhere else. My managers were amazing and very hands on. Although, my time there was short the work conditions can be something else and unpredictable."
good,It was a great experience working with multiple carriers and people from different cultures. The mission was straightforward and the environment was collaborative
good,"Stressful yet fun. Lucrative with many hidden paychecks. All consuming  and often overwhelming. Great people to work with, stressful business with hard and fast deadlines."
good,load and unload trucks for 4-6 hours a day as part time which consist of you putting up beams and boards to make your freight move safely to the next station.
good,"The quicker you move the faster you get done with your route...the more responsibilities you get. Driving is the worst due to traffic and weather. Overall..well paid, work by yourself!"
good,Worked the night shift from 11pm to 7am.
good,"The FedEx strategy to compete collectively and operate independently provides a competitive advantage for our company. Our broad portfolio of services allows us to meet the needs of our customers, most of whom use services from two or more of our operating companies"
good,IT was a nice place to work it was the same everyday you knew what you would be  doing you left the same time everyday rain or shine same place a good job to have
good,"Rotina bastante movimentada no processamento e gerenciamento de carga,aprendi muito no decorrer de minhas atividades como devemos processar e gerenciar cargas de diversos tipo de modais.Direção e gerência sempre buscando ideais inovadoras por parte dos colaboradores em prol da satisfação dos clientes.Cultura bastante comprometida e ambiente de trabalho bastante  satisfatório  para trabalhar.Não tive em momento algum dificuldade para apontar, no decorrer das minhas atividades pelo diversos setores por onde eu passei.Saber que você está contribuindo com milhares de pessoas em todo o mundo e bastante gratificante."
good,"Started at about 9pm worked thru til between 6-7am"
good,This position was great although I was driving earlier in the day my day was done earlier. I you have to load your own truck but the work was great. must be willing to work hard
good,Excellent place to work. Good benefits and fair pay. Advancement could be a litte faster. Work culture is great.Overall a good place to work. That's pretty much it.
good,Wish management was better and there when you need them to manage  but overall good place. Work life balance is great hours are good fun place to work
good,Muy buen ambiente de trabajo buenos supervisores y uniformes gratis
good,fedex is a good place to work I working with them for almost one years the environment is very good and they are well pay and they used to treat there staff very well

good,"muy buena buen ambiente, divertido el trabajo, aunque hay que estar al intemperie y en tiempo de frio es pesado"
good,"I am teamleader in my current position, I have learned never assume adult want to do a good job, all ages. Management is ever changing. The work culture is fast pace and stressful at times. The hardest part of the job is adding to your already overload job load. Good benefit are the most enjoyable about the job."
good,"my co-driver and I, both loved the job, due to my co-driver personal life.  Over the road did not work out. I did not know another co-driver.  And it was more difficult to get good loads as a single driver. so I terminated with  the company"
good,"I will love to say anytime that Federal Express (FedEx) is a company to be especially the cordiality that coexist amongst the members of staff and the management."
good,"Fast-paced work load. Physically demanding, but safety minded. Best practices employed. Positive work environment. Part-time work only - no  room for local advancement/full-time work."
good,"Great place to work , work hours didn't work for me at the time, but we parted on good terms , and they compensated me all my owed hours, I would love to work for them again."
good,"Long days. Learned multi-tasking, work place violence and  harassment training .  Budgets and goals. Managers worked together. Hard, policies and procedures."
good,"great place to advance in career"
good,"A typical day at work was arriving at 5 am and start scanning packages to load the truck. It was great, i love being an early riser for this job and i got a great work out running packages.it was great fun experience."
good,GREAT COWORKERS  GREAT MANAGEMENT  A FAST PACED JOB WITH  ROOM FOR ADVANCEMENT.  GREAT PAY. You start early in the morning and get out early to have the rest of your day to do as you please. Safety  is number one and staff works with you to acomadate your needa.
good,"Enjoy the fast pace of work.  The days were never dull or slow.  Work very long but rewarding hours,  Lots of overtime is mandatory during peak periods.  Enjoyed working with my team,"
good,"Success is solely up to the leadership of management. If you have a great manager--you will love the atmosphere, and you will succeed in your area. Come prepared to work."

good,I was a Swing Courier so everyday was different. I had to learn every route the station had to offer and we were two stations in one so that was about 100 routes. Its fast paced and you will work overtime especially around the holidays. The days are fast so you will hardly notice it. Payday is every Friday but your paychecks are usually waiting for you by Thursday. When I was there the benefits were pretty good which is why i rated them 5 stars. However I hear that the benefits are a joke now.
good,most of the workers was late showing up but getting the job done no matter what. work out of trucks as well but faster we have to feed the packages to the belts.another one where it was hard to wake up to

good,"A typical day at work would be 109 positions down time 12:30 and a 15 min. break. "
good,A typical day at work is easy but on some days it can be overwhelm at once but it is easy to get though that. what I learned is that you are never alone there is always help. management is a little bit all over the place but things get done one time. my co-workers are funny they always like to have fun. the hardest part is of this job is when peak season comes.

good,"I absolutely loved my job. The people were great to work with, most of the managers were ready and willing to help your improve in your job and help you advance. If you showed a decent work ethic, you were given chances for further and more important training. It is a part time job for most of the year, but it came with great benefits. The only bad part is that advancement opportunities are far and few between with in the terminal. In spite of that, I wish I could have stayed with this job, but personal things came up and I couldn't."

good,Getting the job done and making sure that all mail was sorted to the correct location. The hardest part of the job was doing the winter season and not receiving enough hours.
good,I would clock in and go to assigned truck. Once I'm on the clock I begin to unload or load boxes. Every truck is being timed. You have to finish in a decent amount of time or they will ask you to go home early. Co-workers were excellent because we all tried to help each other so we wouldn't be sent home. the hardest part of the job was watching out for falling boxes. The most enjoyable part was the friendship between the co-workers.
good,"Working here was definitely tiring. Heavy lifting, pushing, pulling, bending and stretching just about sums it up. No matter where in the hub you worked, you really worked! Managers push you to work as hard and fast as you can. Which I rather liked. Fast paced and busy busy busy."

good,"Fedex is what you make of it. A ridiculously huge complex, which takes up to 15 minutes just to get to your area of work. Managers are a mixed bag, some good some bad. Some of the best coworkers you will find, but also worst and lay coworkers yo will come across. The good thing about Fedex is if you do not like your manager or coworkers, you can go to another area easily. Overall Fedex is a good place to work."
good,Working at FedEx was very interesting. The only problems I had was with the benefits and Life balance. Even though the work was okay my overall experience with FedEx was great!
good,everyday was fun moving boxes off trucks fast trying to see who would finish the most trucks in a day while management kept track of it. the hardest part of the job was getting trucks with tires only. FedEx is jus a fun place
good,"Woke up at 2am to make it there by 3am"
good,"Great place to learn the difficulties of management.  Very tough environment, typically with high turn over and regular conflict management/resolution.  Making it through ""management boot camp"" will equip anyone with great skill sets to carry on to any industry; however, if you choose to stay, hard work and results orientated performance will produce a viable and steady career."

I worked with various managers and actually was put under tutillage as Lead of operations. I gained a mast amount of expierence as taking the lead when my lead needed help or was not in on a certain day. I never worked graveyard in my life until i transeferred into the Interational facility were i learned a vast amount of customer service values, data entry and forklift driving for 6 yrs. Then i decided to work as courier. Most of my management knows i like to get the job done in orderly fashion and safely. When I work with my staff, I always keep it positive and talk about things like a sport or something that person is into as we are working with no distractions. It gets the job done and work goes by faster. I realize that if you work with your team closely with personal interactions and strictly business your customer will value the company and want to come back."
good,"This is a great company that, despite its size, still has the feel of a start up. When I joined over ten years ago I knew little about the industry and was hired for my skills and not experience.

good,A typical day would consist of me loading anywhere from 300 to 450 packages onto my assigned vans. I learned how to use my time management skills because you couldn't spend too long working on one van because you had other vans that needed to be loaded. The management was not the best. Majority of the time we were understaffed and management felt we could handle the load even when everybody was performing poorly. My co-workers were fun to work with. If I needed help they wouldn't bother helping. The hardest part of the job was trying not to get frustrated when I would recieve 100 plus packages at once. The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting the executives from the corparte office.
good,"A typical day at work goes by very fast, we unload trailers and work as a team to load trailers, My co workers are great very friendly and easy to work with.

good,"Scan and load packages onto truck, then delivered the packages in a prompt manner. I provided excellent customer service to all my customers. I learned to utilize my time, and make use of my time more efficiently. I enjoyed all my co-workers, we each had the same respect for each other, we all worked as a team, to get the job done."
good,Wish I could have stayed working there but after a back injury I could not get my old job back. Great pay for a part time worker and single mother. Kept me in good physical shape until my injury.
good,I can say I absolutely loved doing my job. The only problem i had with this job was that the hours you worked were horrible. Their part time shift was a 2 hour shift and their full time shift was 4 hours. Its an okay job if you are looking for a little extra money but thats all its good for unless you decide to move up in the company.
good,working on the assembly line was a good experience and i had great co-workers who helped us reach our production goal daily
good,"Night shift, hard working, Productive, coworkers very helpful."
good,"A typical day at FedEx is well worth the work. The atmosphere while working is that of team effort. The hardest part of the job is working to closing shift because of the cleaning and reassembling of everything, but I don't mind it at all."
good,"I simply love it.. Great benefits, nice workouts every night"
good,"Fast paced and lots of lifting, great management but very little hours."
good,Working with FedEx Office is never a dull moment. You get to meet great people.
good,A very good job! Your hours never change unless the volume is decreased. Very friendly and relaxed enviorment. Advancement doesnt take long if you take your job seriously. You have to work hard but welll worth it. You get paid every week. Couldnt aask for a better job.
good,"I enjoyed the co-workers,management,and customers one of the best jobs I ever had plus the money was great!!!!!!"
good,Outside sales position. Worked from home and made 75% cold calls in my tty which was zip code generated. Top Performer in Sales every year and Top 10% World Wide in 2010(Presidents Club). Wanting to a better opoortunity to challenge myself and better my family. I love my job with FedEx but I need a new challenge. Best part of my job is meeting new people and learning about there business and winning there trust and buisiness.
good,"Sort letters, unload belt, load and organize packages for delivery for the day. Deliver packages on time with good customer service. Learned time is money. Management was good. Co-workers were great. Walking up 3 flights of stairs with a heavy box. Delivering everything on time."
good,"you would sign in, ride the elevators downstairs to lower level where you would then have a meeetiing discussing what had to be done that night. After the meeting was over we would proceed to pick up floor peices and load them onto a four wheel dolly and stack them up on top of one another. Proceed to cart the floor pieces out on the four wheel dolly and begin another process with the setting the floor down. Use power tools inorder to keep the playing court together so it would not leave any cracks or holes inbetween each hardwood floor piece. Such as mallets, screws, and etc. One of the great things working at FedEx Forum was that the teamwork was incredible. We were all hands on and had great communication skills."
good,This is a great company to work at. The Express department of fedex really taught me alot about time managment and productivity.
good,"Fed Ex was a great place to work for,some days your truck would be loaded by a loaders, and then there was other days where you loaded you own truck cabin. I learned how to map and set up my route to work on in a time appropriate manner to ensure everything was done correctly and safely.Hardest part of the Job was collecting electronic signatures from the customers. I enjoyed the customer service side and embracing the customers as we exchanged packages and signatures."
good,"Great Company to work for. They are willing to work with your schedule as long as it doesn't interfere with your work. I love it here, I am just working hard to become full-time"
good,Pick up and deliver freight between Service Centers & customers. Ask for additional business from customers and provide leads to sales for potential new opportunities. Monitored inventory paperwork and ordering.
good,"FedEx Office formerly Kinko's was one of my favorite places to work. The company culture was great and empowered Team Members. The company focused on building lasting relationships with not only customers, but with team members as well. Some of my best friendships were formed at FedEx Office and to this day I still consider them part of my family!"
good,volume was steady an busy all the time i learn my route real quick customers was nice they really got to no me management wasnt  bad they  kept asking question to see if you where ok.
good,"Wish I could have stayed on after holidays.  Super people to work with, very appreciative customers and upbeat atmosphere.  I plan to stay in touch with them. "
good,Fun place quick hours. Recommended if looking for a second job. Either early morning or later in the afternoon. They strive to stay in the top ten most desirable jobs globally.
good,"Empresa e funcionários ótimos sempre auxiliando o funcionário dentro e fora da empresa, Ana Cláudia do RH e Robson supervisor fazem oque podem para ajudar o funcionário dentro e fora da empresa"
good,Open and freeing environment lots of room for advancement many different responsibilities in the company amazing culture and people to work with lots of learning new things
good,I think FedEx is a good company to work for if you are an ongoing college student who is trying to work and be able to finish school. The company has alot of benefits that roll out as soon as you become hired.
good,So basically you need to be in time and if you get hurt you need to notify them and still go to work .when they give you days off and when  comes to the holiday and they say you only get one day off notify them before you consider to take a day off .follow the rules and you will be fine .They work with you day by day
good,Fedex was a fun job to have mainly because of the managers i had. They treated us fairly and rewarded us for good work. the only downside i can honestly think of was the number of hours they had available to work.
good,"A typical day at work would be arriving at start time, doing pre-work, signing in my scanner and start scanning packages. I have learned swap out, cons scanning, and different codes for the packages. I have also gotten a chance to works slides 1-7 as well as input downloading packages. The hardest part of the job is when employees do not show up."
good,"The place is hard work when sorting out mail of all sizes but a great workout overall. Management is great and the team leaders are helpful as well and give great advice. The only down side is the limit of hours you work but, there are opportunities to get additional hours in as well."
good,"If we think about company.Fedex is brand of transport and work environment is also awesome..For fresher FedEx is the best .."
good,Work at FedEx good n all colleague help each other. Then all area must clean too clear the job.. FedEx the international worl wide company.. so happy i
good,"I like work with frdex . Very friendly mangment . Benefits salaries and great and rewards at exellelt I will always be proud work with fedex .who I have worked withnd for ,a fantastic company"
good,It was a great job when I first started out it was temporary but then I went back and got a permanent position. Compensation was comparable for the work required but it was very physically demanding.
good,The job is not hard at all. Working 4 hrs a day. Typical for FedEx jobs as well as ups. Very helpful with the people and understanding. Would definitely recommend for young people if retired
good,"FedEx es un excelente lugar para trabajar, pero si eres alguien que no puede estar sentando hablando demasiadas horas puede ser muy difícil ya que las llamadas de servicio a cliente nunca se detienen y tienes una métrica estricta que cumplir. Sin embargo el ambiente dentro de las oficinas y la cultura laboral son muy agradables."
good,"All endorsements,  working as a sub contractor,  we were able to bid loads from the offered rate. Very competitive,  positive atmosphere,  made some life long friends there. Their load board program needs to be rethought but overall, a great experience."
good,great place to work for do alot of people skills i love working there and meetin alot of people drivin and doing your job day 7 to 3pm the mgr is great
good,Fed Ex is a very good company to work for.  If you work hard they take care of you.  They provide a more than a satisfactory fair amount of pay for the work.
good,"The only reason I would consider leaving is to make more money. The pay is decent enough, but I prefer more for the education and experience I have.  I like my job, the atmosphere, and the people."
good,"Lots of positive vibes and teamwork.  Very fast paced..the schedule is  tough. Think they have a lot of turn over do to the schedule and low pay. If you can handle the low pay\ part time status and the schedule, you will love it."
good,"Altough starting pay is minimal, pay increases come easily if a hard worker and can comply with company regulations. It is a stressful job and not easy work. Customer interaction can be what you make it, good or bad. Benefits are excellent."
good,"The hours that I work are early in the day, but it lets me get off early too. Then I am able to have more hours in the day to study for more education and work more on other jobs. They have very fair hours to be able to do other learning and works."
good,I have none to say at the moment it was a good experience and I would  recommend it to someone who wants to workout  and lose some weight  and have fun doing it
good,Great experience loading and unloading great environment managers are easy going great employees all around good job to work at I would love to work for FedEx again
good,"Cold weather made it hard sometimes on the dock,  but being prepared after sometime helped.  Other than that it was a good fast paced job with much room for growth. Raises every few months until you tap out at 26. And that's just for forklifting"
good,Great ppl and good down to earth managers help make this an easy job. Once you get through the training for the forklift you are ready to go and you will get hands on training and also  good starting pay. Recommend to anyone who has no problem working hard ( work is not hard in any way) in a relaxed atmosphere.
good,Company was somewhat organized I rated it based on operations and organization and safety. Management was organized office meetings everyday quotas being met
good,Boa tarde minha avaliação sobre a empresa Fedex era muito boa seus colaboradores era bom de trabalha uma empresa que trabalhava com ética no que fazia trabalho em equipe era bom enfim uma empresa que preocupava com seus funcionários
good,"I’ve learned a lot while working with this company and I am very appreciative for that opportunity. Though, while working for this company you cannot have much of an outside life because of how demanding the shifts were, they do offer great pay."
good,fast paced minimal mistakes. your first year you get like 3-4 raises. so its good its helpful if you have an understanding manager too. show up do your work and get out.
good,"uma ótima empresa pare se trabalhar, oferece fretado e vale alimentação."
good,"Depending on which shift you are on, the hours vary from day to day, depending on work load and if packages being delivered on time."
good,Fed Ex was fast paced. When you showed up for work be prepared to work. They gave you the option to work part time or double shifts which were full time. My overall experience good for a part time job.
good,It was a good job but not enough pay. I worked there for quite some time and I help my brother get on. O would have liked to have gotten more hours but I was only part time and I had to take a leave of absence because my girlfriend was pregnant with my twins.
good,FedEx is a fun company the management is very compatible and the security is always up to date and all the employees love the company and so will the upcoming employees.

good,Pretty nice job summer time it gets really hot have to drink plenty of water winter time have to make sure u wrap up according to weather may have to get use to the working it's a lot of moving and lifting
good,I'd still be there if it wasn't for having to leave because no one was there to put my children on the bus if I could come back and work second shift I would in a heart beat
good,it was a good job fast pace they have high quatos to meet so you stay busy people were easy to get along with you just had to do your work an not be lazy an you would be ok
good,I loved my job at fed ex it was hard at first but then it became easy the more I paid attention to my trainer. As a package handler you had to work very quickly.
good,"è uma empresa ótima para trabalhar, pois não dava oportunidade na area que eu pretendia."
good,"It's a great place to work and gain new job experience and be able to move up to better opportunities for advancement in the company,as well as the benefits."
good,"Good place to work. Hours very on how many packages come in for that day, and if we are short handed or not. The manager goes out of her way to make sure you have everything you need to do your job."
good,"It at place where you should be ready to work. It a great place if you get in the right work group. It is a place where you can make the experience what you want it to be. If you work hard it can be great. If not, you will not enjoy your stay!"
good,FedEx Express TSCS is the best to workplace. There is the to do work as per define SOP.•Dealing with Couriers/ Transporters and monitoring their performance by analyzing delivery schedule.
good,Working at the hub you will learn a lot u can advance pretty fast after 6 months to a year on different jobs. Also is a very dangerous place and must follow all safety rules and guidelines
good,"Productive day is busy, I've learned a lot of different duties working for them, The management is good in informing you of new events and whats going on for the month. The people you work with are friendly and have a lot knowledge that can help you get through your day"
good,"There will always be boxes to unload and load trucks. There is never a time you aren't working. Hardest part of the job is the weather. Most enjoyable part of the job is, you get paid to workout."

good,I had a great time at FedEx. I was very excited about the job and wish to work there again.the people there treated me like family and we came as a whole to get the job done
good,"Empresa de qualidade e incentivo ao funcionário. "
good,"Would go back if I have the chance. I had to relocate to another state. The pay should be more though for package handler. But if you’re a good worker they move you around pretty quickly. Not for lazy people. Majority of management there is very personable and great. "
good,Overall nice place to work hard times on your body I unloaded trucks so I would have to say I would love to would love to go back someday good place to work
good,Es un trabajo muy bueno el ambiente laboral súper bueno pero el salio muy mínimo
good,"This was a nice place to work, however my position was only part-time, with no offer for more hours.  It wasn't enough to live on, so I had to leave to get more hours."
good,Great schedule love going to work and getting a workout made me look awesome love my boss contractors are cool to work with would recommend to anyone.
good,"•	Team member responsible for executing and monitoring specific activities, dealing with freight, bill of ladings, commercial invoices, etc"
good,"FedEx is a great place to work. "
good,"This is a fun and engaging industry, with many fine details, and the experiences gained and lessons learned had a major impact on my personal interests. I really had the opportunity to learn from others about industry, while also engaging in and developing skills in technical trades.  While serving at FedEx I was able to elaborate and develop further my communication skills both written and verbal."
good,It is a good job all the people are great managers are great. My job was simple and easy hours were good they listen to what you have to say. And they pay good.
good,FedEx is a great company to work for and provides a great work environment. The company has a great culture and good diversity.  work life balance for its staff.
good,This job was a serious workout for those in the shipping and handling industry. This required a lot of hard work and constant movement in order to complete the daily tasks.
good,"Great place to work, I would recommend it to anyone. There is great opportunity to advance with the company, especially if you're willing to relocate."
good,"I volunteered with this company; and it was well organized and extremely pleasing to work with. The people were friendly and kind, and my friends dad told me about how great it was for him to work there."
good,Fedex has been a great job so far. I only seek a better position or more hours due to the face I live online and need more income. The work is hard sometimes but you become used to it after a while.
good,"A typical workday was fulfilling.  I learned to be a leader through a lot of experience and training.  Management was fair and honorable.  The workplace culture is really like none other.  The hardest part of my job was the stresses involved in such a massive fast paced environment.  The hardest part of my job was managing the different personalities and work ethics of so many management people is such a large organization (~ 5,000 employees ~200 management).  The most enjoyable part of my career was meeting so many good people and in moving up, meeting and working with executive management."
good,FedEx is a tremendous company and highly recommend them.  Due to life changes I am needing to move back to Kansas City and unfortunately current opportunities with enough pay to survive are not there.
good,I love working at FedEx.  Just was never able to be promoted into management. I have nothing more to say.  I love it here. Just wish I was in management.
good,"There is so much diversity and you get a chance to view life through someone else. The overall experience is the people you work with, your co-workers. They pretty much determine how your day will be. The second impact of your job would be your manager and it is very important to have a trusting and understanding manager. I believe in getting to work safely, do the best of your job safely, treat people with respect and leave your job accomplished."
good,"This is a great company to work for if you are looking for a job out of college to build your skill set Raises are great,but the company consistently hires amazing people and the culture is a great reason to stay."
good,FedEx is very fast paced. If you do not like to rush or walk or be on time schedule its not for you.It has great benefits and great employees. I would defiantly re apply in the future.
good,"Drove as a courier for FedEx. Processed, carried and delivered packages to different destinations based upon patron request. Met different people in businesses as well as residential environments."
good,"A typical day at FedEx starts with clocking in and getting right on your forklift to start moving freight. I am given manifest form which alerts me on what I will be working with that day and what is in the semi-trucks. Something I learned while working at FedEx is how to time manage in order to get my freight in a semi before cut times occur. The management at FedEx is fair can be better but overall really good people managing FedEx.  Workplace culture is very good equipment up to date and have monthly inspections. An aspect of this job that was difficult in the beginning would be that it was hard moving unique skids that in turn require a great skill to move, which I have now successfully learned how too do. I enjoy working at Fedex because it requires teamwork and communication which make the job very enjoyable."
good,"Very challenging high priority night-freight flying out of Reno, NV and crossing two mountain ranges in and out of Oakland, California during some of the most hazardous flying weather conditions found anywhere on earth."
good,"Working part-time is a great way to make a decent paycheck and maintain benefits, especially if you are in school. Management is overworked and has little time to take note of employee feedback."
good,I enjoyed working at FedEx.  It's fast paced and a workout.  Majority of it is outdoors in the elements of an open warehouse. Only issue is jobs are full time with less than 20 hours and no full time positions
good,"I loved working at the hub it was fast paced and always going. The folks out there are a mixed bunch, But overall its a great work environment so long as you can stand the weather"
good,They a fun compay too wrk  for until u need time off for thing other than job but in all they wont u too come too wrk sick and all even if u got clock in and go back home
good,"At Fedex freight, the forklift does all the work. Technically a laborious job but not at all strenuous. Easy and sometimes even fun. Definitely the Fedex branch to work at."
good,"Not exactly favoritism,  but senoirty only takes you so far. I would prefer full time to have priority over part time employees.  Job transfers can be denied for any reason, other than something in your file."
good,I love fed ex. They hire great positive people and embrace a culture that is true to what they advertise. Management is kind and personable with a real opportunity for advancement as well as extra hours.
good,The work days for package handler started at 3am for me and it was very tiring by the end of the shift. You lift a lot of heavy stuff and its all in a wearhouse at the airport. Might be different for other locations but it honestly sucked because of the weather changes from cold to hot and vice versa.
good,Uma ótima empresa lamento por a filial ter que fechar.
good,I was with fedex for 18yrs. I absolutely loved it and miss it everyday ive been gone. If given the opportunity to come back I would jump on it. The fast paced  on your own atmosphere made life easier
good,"People seems nice, I got consistent work and the pay was decent. I was allowed to take my lunch at my leisure and did not have to answer to a boss constantly."
good,"Uma empresa de grande porte,muitas oportunidades de crescimento."
good,Empresa com ótimo e benefício gestão compreensivos e altamente profissional
good,Overall FedEx is a wonderful company to work for there is huge potential for growth and advancement with an Excellent Benefit package for both part time and full time.

good,great place to work with good benefit. opportunity with in company . great retirement benefit.  Take safety serious about employee. great team work. overall its great place to work.
good,"Working as a Package Handler at FedEx Ground is often referred to as a ""Gym you are paid to go to"", which is a very accurate summary. Package Handlers, even those who are only part-time, receive a plethora of benefits. These benefits include dental/health insurance, Paid Time Off (PTO), regular raises, and tuition reimbursement. However, the job can be quite stressful, as time is of the essence there. Regular loaders have very strict speed requirements they must meet as well as equally as strict requirements on how thorough their work is."
good,"My typical day at work can be very challenging some days, and some days its goes vey smoothly. Ive learned the pros and cons on how to control and make sure all freight and product gets out in a timely and safely matter. Management is well structured. Workplace is very diverse no discrimonation is allowed in the field of work. It is against the policy. Hardest part of the job is when everyone is on the walkie talkie all at once having a disagreement and cannot come to the proper solution of a matter at hand. The most enjoyable part of the job is beating the time of sort going down and clocking out!"
good,"It's a nice job that has now gone remote. The career advancements are very few and the management could be a little better. The benefits are GREAT and you'll enjoy your position, depending on your manager."
good,"good place to work, multiple shifts, good pay, good teams, good management, paid time off, paid holidays, fun place .........................................."
good,FedEx has good work culture. Nice people to work with. Very flexible work hours. Employees are happy and you get to see nice people around you at work place.
good,Working as a part-time package handler at FedEx gives you the chance to help pay for school. As well working in a fast pace environment. It allowed me to get my school work done and spend time with family.
good,"great culture with focus on people first; best part of my day is working with my peers, colleagues and team; management is very supportive of changes and will do their best to support advancement"
good,"Contracted, temporary position consisted of handling cargo between trucks and aircraft in the warehouse. Typically loading, unloading, stacking, wrapping and scanning boxes. Management is always involved and the coworkers are friendly and helpful. Lots of down time between flights unless driving for FedEx."
good,"great place to work, great pay and life balance but the equipment is out dated and old, the tractors need to be updated, and their are minor mechanical repairs"
good,Many years were worked at FedEx.  I was a part of a company that grew and allowed growth for its employees.  There was a family business atmosphere. Worked for over 20 years there.
good,"Overall, great place to work.  The stress can be tough to manage sometimes.  While job security is very high, advancement is slow to come by.  Low cube walls for managers and individual contributors means the environment is somewhat loud."
good,"I enter employee timecards for hours worked. I run 3 managers reports reflecting work codes, also reports to senior manager.  I also, do the international packages  contacting custom brokers, emailing paperwork, and proper scans.  I also, do a quick check of the warehouse making sure all packages left should be there and all are out for delivery. I also, have other tasks I perform when needed but not dalily."
good,Great place to work and grow your career. The company believes in investing in their employees. Allowing you gain additional education and move to various to departments to grow your career. I would never have left this position without relocation opportunties.
good,"Clocked in. Went into the meeting where they discussed how much work we had, the time frame we had to do it and where we were going to be placed. unloaded boxes, sorted packages, loaded and unloaded trucks."
good,Fed Ex is a great place to work and provides opportunities for advancement along with mentors.
good,"FedEx Freight was a great place to work. Being in an on-call job position was annoying, since I never knew my start time until I was called, but he job was great. Good pay and benefits. With time you move up and have a better job position. I never planned to leave, but the economy got me and my job. Wish I could go back."
good,"It's a great company. I love working for them. They have great benefits and they pay really good. If it wasn't for my mistake, I would still be working for them."
good,on a day to day basis things run smoothly with your team or shift co -workers working alongside one another to accomplish the day work volume. I learned a lot about the ltl industry and shipping and receiving. hardest part I would have to say is dealing with those occasional lazy guys but overall team was great. most enjoyable is doing all I can to contribute to the company success and showing others how to improve and do the same
good,Make sure all the package are put on the right line for them to upload on the plan. As team member i learned to work with  about 15 to 25 people and placing them in the right prosation to make sure everything run smooth a possible.
good,"Very good health and dental benefits, including mental. External benefits, like discount travel. Good first job for young people (20's). Room for growth if working in key markets."
good,I typical day of work  I have to interact with different customers every day. I have learned that each person has different behavior and attitudes and I have learned to handle each of those situations daily
good,Our main goal is to deliver freight to our customers on time. Continuous freight status follow-up and feedback to customers improve customer's relations and help us exceed expectations. We deliver the purple promise which is make every freight delivery experience outstanding.
good,"The only bad part in my opinion is the hours of work. Extremely tough for a single parent to work the hours available. For example, 4:30am-8:30am as a material handler or 6pm-10pm... Got to pay a babysitter which cuts into your hourly wages big time! The flying perk is HUGE in my world. To be able to take my kid on vacation and our plane tickets only cost a little over $100 total!!! More to spend on the vacation."
good,"Paid very well, and management was very well staffed and fair. Very fast paced work environment on the dock, required you to always be moving, but for the level of pay you receive, it is definitely fair."
good,"Empresa ótima para se trabalhar, excelente plano de carreira."
good,"•	Physical loading, unloading and/or sorting of packages by hand."
good,"making sure packages were on right truck, loading and unloading. Using forklift making sure heavy packages were in correct spot. I leaned how to use forklift properly. No hard parts."
good,pessoas boas para se trabalhar ao lado. precisa apenas melhorar algumas coisas .
good,Working at FedEx Express was always something new daily. Moving incoming and out going freight in a timely manner was a true challenge but through collaborative team  effort the job  was always completed on time. Being the reason someone got their package on time was truly gratifying to me.
good,Good place to work. It can get overwhelming at times since your seeing so much freight and it moving quickly. You will get a little workout in working for this company.
good,Loading and unloading is like getting paid to work out. You're lifting boxes big and small. Weighing at different ranges. It can be a team effort but mostly working independently depending on your skills. Productivity is key.
good,Working For Fedex Was A Great Experience For Me & Was One Of My Favorite Jobs Ever. We Got To Deliver Packages To Different Places & Different People Everyday & Build Different Connections With People.
good,Fast pace environment. My manager is pretty awesome but the people above him can be a pain. If you are a loader it's all about numbers and how fast you loads trucks.
good,This job is one that I would recommend. The managers at the station I was at was amazing. Im so said Im not still working for them. They are great. Highly recommended.
good,Its overall a great place to work with great people. Only thing is that the shifts are early but the people make it worth it. Closer to Christmas things get hectic but it is still doable.
good,Hi my name is Julie and I am trying to get a FedEx drop I like working with different types of people in a space and environment I'm very fast pace and I'm always on task I make sure that I come on time
good,"My Manager was terrible, and racist. Very judgemental on a lot when it came to the urban upbringing.  Liked to play the victim alot and none of the shifts liked that."
good,"Essa empresa me deu a oportunidade de aprender algo q eu não fazia antes.Foi bom demais trabalhar na Fedex, só tenho a agradecer por tudo."
good,Fast paced environment dealing with bar scanners to scan all incoming and outgoing inventory maintaining proper paperwork and organizing material in a neat clean manner.
good,"I worked at FedEx as a part time job while I was finishing up college. Even though I only worked about half the amount of time as other employees, I was still treated with respect. The benefits were fantastic and the crew was always a blast to work with."
good,FedEx is a great company to work for. While it is very long hours on some days and especially Holidays.  They are great people to work for and they compensate well.  This was by far my favorite job!
good,loved my job at fedex but it was only part time just didnt get enough hours. felt there wasnt any chance of advancement . would have loved to stay but needed full time work
good,"I have enjoyed my career at FedEx Trade Services. I feel honored to be apart of the culture and leadership at this company. I wish nothing but the best for all of my peers, employees and Executive Management staff .."
good,"My day was very busy, very fast paced environment, good pay with no benefits. Unload trucks material package handler, assist other's with work in the distribution hub as needed,."
good,The environment at FedEx was very family oriented.  I enjoyed the ties that I made there and would go back if I could.  The salary isn't very competitive but FedEx made that up in benefits.
good,Good commentary great pay quintessential experience youthful peers and helping to load the trucks when needed always ask for help and seem to never pressure.
good,"Esta empresa é muito boa de se trabalha .a logística era impressionante, tudo tinha a previsão de entrega é coleta,o suporte da base de apoio era excelente."
good,"I enjoy a fast paced work environment. I like knowing what is expected of me, I take pride in my work and pride in that company I work for.  I want to be included in the problem solving process, I love a challenge. How can we make it better? What is the problem?  I know we can find the answer. The most enjoyable part of my job is that I have the freedom to make decisions. My boss knows that I can be trusted to do the right thing for that company and the operation. I enjoy working with people of all different backgrounds and cultures. I always find a way to make a job enjoyable for myself and the people I work around."

good,I started working here when I was !8 i was just glad i was making money.  But it was great start for me. i encourage anyone who is interested; apply.  I had some good times here.
good,"The FedEx ground I worked at was productive. The only times we ran behind were because of mechanical issues or shortage of workers. The main reason I didn't stay was because it was seasonal, and I needed something permanent, but at the time I just needed a job."
good,Enjoyed working for company. Employees are great to work with. Pay and benefits are good and employees are treated professionally. Leadership provided by management was second to none.
good,"Fast paced work environment, opportunity to advance in company. Benefits for part time employees. Working outside so you are in the elements. Somewhat physical job."
good,"This was one of my most favorites jobs. I worked as a customer service agent at the local delivery station. Although the job could be stressful at times, it could be equally rewarding. It was always a pleasure to assist customers with sensitive and timely deliveries. Being able to make smooth and seamless transactions was the best part of my service."
good,Great job for part time.  I really liked this job.  When FedEx National was closed in Wichita part time employees didn't get to move over to FedEx Freight.
good,"Long hours, no family time, not negotiable or flexible with child care. Schedules change without notice, managers do not hear the voices of the employees"
good,You stay busy and everyone helps each other out. Management is great. The hardest part of the job is there is a lot of heavy lifting and you are constantly on your feet. It is also the most enjoyable part of the job. I like staying busy and the people I work with are great.
good,Fedex is a productive job. As a college student it was easy to handle but some days it was exhausted. If i was to be looking for a job again fedex will not be my first choice. i do not see myself doing hard labor work.
good,"I love my job just need more hours.. the people i work are good to me"
good,"typical day is long, 10-14 hours. management doesn't really care about personal family issues. most enjoyable part was the pay check..its just a job in the end."
good,"I would load and unload trucks, paletize packages and maintain an organized work area. I learned how to use different types of warehouse tools. All of the managers were respectful, but they were demanding. I enjoyed the people there the most, my coworkers. The hardest part of the job was during peak season when we seen over 300,000 packages."
good,"Gostei muito de trabalha na fedex"
good,"Typical days were bearable, my coworkers made each day easier. Management did not know how to talk to employees, rather put them down and never rewarded us when we had done well. No respect for employees means no respect for management."
good,"Nice co-workers, management is alright, sometimes things would get backed up and it got tough but overall i liked having this job and i wish i could go back, but i had to move"

good,It was hands on and a very welcome environment. There are a lot of people and they're outgoing. Working as a team is a big thing
good,I enjoyed coming to work and facing new challenges everyday. A typical day was figuring out how much staff I needed for the day to sufficiently run the sort.  My managing team was awesome. They were trained to run the sort with or without. We came up with a plan and we ran to it.  I learned how to engage employees by getting to know there strengths and using that to trigger abilities that sometimes they didn't know they had. Unexpected freight was sometimes difficult however I always  prepared for the unexpected. I loved to watch an employee come in at and entry level position work hard and get promoted. That was the most enjoyable part of the job.
good,"My day starts with reviewing the previous day Operations in my territory.My job is to ensure no exceptions or delays impacting the delivery of shipments to & from the countries under my responsibility. I reply to support requests from the FedEx network to facilitate pickup, transit, clearance & delivery of shipments."
good,had so much fun to work for i really like every day that i work there in California by the beach in Pacific grove  every day it was so fun to work with my friends
good,"Everything about this company is perfect. Excellent co workers, a good productive management team and a fast paced environment. The hardest part about working with Fed Ex is all of the tests that we have to take to get certified for the position and to have more experience and learning more about the workplace as you continue to pursue. The most enjoyable part about it is listening to the company's radio provided to us while we work to get everything done in the correct way."
good,"This was by far the best company I've worked for, excellent management, training, great benefits and salary. Enjoyed my work & personal relationships that developed over the 6 years I was employed and have maintained those relationships to the present. I learned or should I say developed more were my customer service skills team building skills. The most enjoyable part of my job was my management team, awesome to work for they made it easy to come early and stay late if necessary. Some co-workers were great some were not but I was still able to maintain a good working relationship through the years.  The hardest part of my job was leaving, I relocated back to my home state. ."
good,"a typical day at work would include sorting, loading and unloading of packages that are ran down a conveyor belt. Heavy packages are carried on a tugger and transfered to a portable belt where im stationed to pick them off."
good,work is fast paced paid every week good workers unloading trucks are fun scanning products good benefits good mangment good products
good,"The structure and philosopy of FedEx is a key foundation for management.  This philosopy simply stated is ""PEOPLE - SERVICE - PROFIT.  What is means is that the people and collaborators of the Company are the most essential and valuable asset.  Their performance allows the Corporation to obtain profits from our customers based on value added SERVICE supported by the frontline employee through to executive management.  The performance allows for the PROFIT that in turn is reinvested into the PEOPLE to continue the cycle of advanced quality driven success."

good,"If you are self driven and follow instructions, you may find a good place here"
good,"The early morning hours might've been a turn-off at first, but I quickly got over that as I continued to get settled into FedEx Ground. Between the weekly pay and the amount of exercise I received over the course of the job, I managed to embrace the fast pace that the Package Handler entails. Along the way, I met some pretty swell people working in the office and the delivery trucks and get to know them better. All in all, it's a pretty nice gig for a 2-3 hour job.."
good,A typical day of work here was simple for the most part at least to me the only reason I had to leave was due to an injury . . . i didnt really learn much besides how to use the technology that they used for my job position the workers there was cool for the most part unless youre the type of person who dont like to talk to other but the hardest part of the job has to be keeping up speed and scanning methods but the most enjoyable part to me was the physical labor needed to keep this job going
good,Very Busy Days. Got along well with co-workers. Working hours were difficult because I had to work some nights. Didn't have a hands on Manager. Loved working with my Team
good,good pay even doe at times the work load seem to feel a bit much but overall its a great place to work  and you get paid every week the managers are cool for the most part the co workers are cool
good,"I honest like working at FedEx I was an college student plus you get paid every week. You can work any double if you wanted to. "
good,"A typical day included the review of the prior days RO's and the approval and clearing. Giving out the days work and performing pre-shifts. Continuing with the RO's and time keeping. Checking on the guys in the shop a few times a day with no clipboard or other distractions, just visiting with them. Making sure all parts ad been ordered and what had been received. Make sure the shop and parts room were clean a free of any hazards and that parts were put away."
good,"Essa foi uma das melhores empresas que trabalhei."
good,"I enjoyed working for Fed-ex it allowed me to meet very nice people, worked with no restraints, only duty was to deliver packages."
good,I like the job but it's very stressful dealing with hazardous materials can be dangerous. My co workers are handful sometimes. My manager is pretty cool.
good,"The only MNC which I want to work from my childhood, I was a great chance for me to work with FedEx, I got to know many things from this company. As if how to be professional and how to enjoy our work."
good,"Es una empresa muy buena aprendes muchas cosas y aprendes capacidades que no descubrias , desgraciadamente la administracion o gerencia no dan prioridad a la seguridad personal su pretexto es que no hay presupuesto, entre muchos detalles que te decepcionas de una empresa tan buena, y que la seleccion de personal se tarda demasiado, para al final renuncies."
good,the environment is very fast paced and exciting...the fellow workmates make my job easier and fun on a daily basis but the hour per day is very bad...they cut hours on a regular.
good,Fedex is a good company. They are fair with Work/Life balance and give you a great opportunity to grow and learn from the company. Good benefits and fair environment.
good,"Aprendi muchisimo sobre todo en comercio exterior, en  idiomas ya que la empresa nos pagaba y nos brindaba profesores nativos en la oficina. A medida que la economia del pais fue cambiando los salarios y beneficios tambien, asi que ya no era buena la relacion de presiones laborales con el salario y sin beneficios. Lo bueno es que me hice de lindas amistades"
good,"A Empresa é ótima para trabalhar, a equipe excelente,"
good,"Fast paced environment"
good,"I enjoy working for FedEx it's mostly independent work but you do have group quotas. It's a hard job to explain. I work Trade Networks which is strictly desk job and dealing with the brokerage aspect of things opposed to Express, Office, etc. The pay is pretty decent and the job is mostly easy (once you get the hang of it) there are next to zero social interactions other than the occasional banter with other employees (which has gotten me talked to quite a few times) But it has great benefits."
good,"independent freedom. as long as packages are delivered, you have no problems and free to do as you please. job is very easy, does not take rocket science to figure it out"
good,"Only worked here for a few months before my internship, but I liked working at FedEx. The work is tough and demanding, but at the end of the shift you feel a sense of accomplishment when all the trucks are loaded. If the job paid better I would have went back after graduation."
good,"Unload, Load trucks maintaining consistent pace. Learning the process it takes to become a great package handler. Very cooperative Manager as well as understanding. Co-workers that never mind giving a helping hand. Lifting consistently very difficult as well as rewarding gaining lots of muscle as well as keeping fit."
good,"A+ benefits package, low wages for hourly employees but great benefits and retirement package.  Great company to work for."
good,"great job, great people to with great management. the most enjoyable part of the job is going to work and doing a good work"
good,"Great Benefits but if you have a family or might get sick there is going to be a problem!"
good,Great Company Great Pay Great Benefits Training and work load was OK for area Great staff and overall great people a place to grow with in the company
good,"Duties include segregating, routing, and loading your truck for time sensitive deliveries.  On road routing for time sensitive pick ups.  Maintaining a friendly customer relations including helping each individual customer with their on sight Fed-Ex equipment 	providing more efficient shipping methods and costs. The maintenance of your assigned truck was also a priority. I enjoyed the freedom of being on the road and meeting a good deal of people.  Winter months were tough and summer months rewarding."
good,"If you want hard working environment then this is the place for you."
good,"Everyday is a new challenge, and everyday is different. Everyone here works well together and management is always looking out for what is best for you. There is room for movement and advancement, but too slow of a pace, you start out part-time, but it will take a while to become fulltime"
good,"I enjoy the opportunity to learn to work as a team, as well as strengthen my skills in a leadership role.  I'm proud to have enjoyed a positive career with a leader in the industry."
good,Freedom to serve your route while delivering packages.  Fun and clean work and super co-workers/drivers. You will meet new people everyday and have the opportunity to make someone smile
good,"A typical day jumping and driving consisted of picking up packages at the terminal and delivering them to the correct home or business. This job taught me how to mange my time better and to be a more cautious driver. I worked with an independent contractor, therefore I had no contact with management. The hardest part of this job was working during peak season because you have more packages and less daylight. The most enjoyable part of this job was the solitude."
good,"As Handler/Shuttle Driver I mostly park trucks in the morning before sort and help with sort when it starts usually about 6:55. living in South Florida the hardest part about the job is the warehouse and how HOT it gets even when sun is down. If you are out shape you would definitely have a hard time handling seeing how the belt don't stop until finish, and its about an hour of 4-5000 packages that go down that belt every morning; excluding peak season. "
good,"when I started in FeDex was Home delivery (max 50pounds) "
good,great place to work. I enjoyed meeting new people and the different challenges I was faced with daily at work. I love the job. My boss is awesome and my co workers are extremely helpful
good,"This was a good job, I worked 3rd shift loading and unloading trucks.  They also helped pay for my collage. Ended up having to leave the company because the distance was too far."
good,I really enjoyed working at FedEx such a high class company to be apart of. Great benefits and retirement packages also. FedEx really take care of their employees.
good,Great work environment and perks. On site cafeteria and gym. Questionable management staff. Easy to work up the ladder but low pay.
good,"Typical day started at 6am to plan the delivery route after loading the vehicle.  Loading the vehicle in such a way as to comply with the delivery sequence.  This served to speed the process.  The hardest part was in the winter months, when light and driving conditions intruded on successful package delivery."
good,The working atmosphere was excellent. The hardest part of the job was never knowing when the work day would end.  The co-workers really made the working environment enjoyable.
good,"Package handling,stocking,loading and unloading packages.Package inventory control. Completed daily given tasks in a timely manor before shift was over."
good,I enjoyed how we work together as a team putting boxes into the truck. I learn how to properly load a truck. The hardest part was loading heavy boxes into the truck.The most enjoyable part of the day was getting a free bottle of Gatorade to cool down.
good,learn how to effectively unload and load packages on a daily basis. You can learn different positions with little to no difficulty
good,My years at fedex were very good.  Ive had exstensive customer interaction  and communication skills.  The most enjoyable aspect of that job was working with minimal supervision.
good,"Route Planning and choosing easiest route to make deliveries time efficient. Vehicle inspections including lights, tires, etc.  Scanning of dispatched and received packages.  Collecting checks and money orders for merchandise sent out from different companies."
good,"I worked at FedEx for 15 years and it was an amazing place to work.  The company truly cares about its employees and I learned so much in my time there.  That being said, during my last 3 years at FedEx I was a remote employee.  Unlike most Fortune 100 companies today, FedEx does not have a policy for remote employees and is not capable of supporting a remote workforce effectively."
good,"A typical day at work is very fast paced.  It is hard work, but the benefits keep you.  If they drop the benefits I feel that a lot of the workers will not stay."
good,Fedex is a great place to work....  It takes some getting use to the hours and the working conditions of a warehouse.  Great manager to work for and co-workers are all amazing to work with.
good,"The job is a fast moving paste, type of job. Working there is okay, don't really get any breaks (which I'm not concerned of)  at all and sometimes, don't really get the help that i need."
good,It was very good working with FEDEX. I have learned many things which are very much useful for my carrier.professional co-workers and it is good to work with them.
good,A typical work night at fed ex was finding a time clock clocking in at a scheduled time going to your mainly spot that you are assign to in that month. I learned that together everyone achieves more team work is a must there. management I love my management team we were like family. my co-workers are just like the normal typical co-workers on any job of course you are going to have slackers but we pulled together  when we needed to in order to get the done the hardest part of my job was peak season when you are having numerous of packages coming towards you all at one then you might have someone that's in front of you that missed they package so you have to grab theirs so it will not get to the end of the line then you may have someone that will stop the belt. the most enjoyable part of the job was when the freight slowed down which was the end of the night that way you knew it was getting closer to go home.
good,"I was a package handler, so basically just come in for the pre-sort meeting. That was the first thing, lasts about five minutes – talk about what we’re going to do for the day. Then, we get to work. So, the receiving… trucks that have been there and already receiving would get unloaded and sent up through a series of belts and chutes, and as that would come across, it would get sorted into their different destinations that we’re going to be sending them out to. So as we sort them, they get sent to their own individual belts across a long line. We had at least 30-some doors. And as they got sent to their individual trucks, we would just have to make sure to use a scanner, a little hand scanner that would track the bar code and make sure it’s going to the right truck. It gets put in the truck and sent to the back. And then you have to do a good job building the walls, so you could get as much packages into the proper trucks as possible."
good,"being a forklift operator and loading and unloading truck was a blast had fun doing it, I enjoyed the people and the job of loading freight"
good,"Good salary, great hours, nice/friendly co-workers.  Great place to work for what I needed during that time of my life.  The Central Region headquarters that I worked in was in Buffalo Grove, IL at the time.  My position was being relocated to either Indianapolis, IN, or Memphis, TN.  I did not want to relocate, so I accepted an early retirement offer from FedEx."
good,I had very good results in the billing department as a part of my 2 year tenure with the company. I had 40 hour weeks. The least enjoyable part of my job was that it was not challenging enough.
good,This job was a job that would have been a great opportunity for me. I learned a lot... Had wonderful coworkers. The hardest part was leaving. The most enjoyable part was the job.
good,FedEx is a very fast pace work environment.  You have to be ready and willing to work.  You are packing and unloading trucks all night.  You have to keep up the pace in order for trucks to deliver packages in a timely manner.  I would have to say the hardest art of the job is working with people who do not want to work.  If they are not moving at a good pace it slows the entire team down.
good,"My overall experience at fedex was great its fast paste and your team members are as hardworking as you. At fedex , What declares a light job is called volume which means how heavy it might be. So when the volume is light we get to take brakes for example if you finished unloading a trailer(truck) than you can walk off to go use the bathroom or get a drink of water. Management is lenient to a very small extent. "
good,"Interesting job that never gets boring. Not your everyday warehouse job because it is at the airport. As long as you listen to your peers and follow safety rules, this job can be quite rewarding."
good,"Unload FedEx trucks and a safe and timely "
good,I worked in a very specialized group that dealt with out of country aircraft that came into our international area. We all had to have NSA clearance to work there. It was faced paced with the oppertunity to move around a lot to do different task. It never got borring. We did everything from pre-tripping the plane. Matting up all the equipment. Unloaded over a hundred thousand pounds of freight of each plane and send it to are specialized international building to be checked. I rose to the top spot as load captain with in 5 months. One step lower then team lead. If it wasn't for the need of more hours I would have stayed and shot for an opening for team lead down the line and worked my way up the latter.
good,every day is kinda the same very easy job not a lot to worry about. just stay safe and every thing goes great. there is lots of room to move up as well
good,"Great place for advancement if you do not have a family, or don't like your family."
good,"I would help with background checks on potential applicants who have applied to work for FedEx. I would call the schools where they got the degrees to make sure that they are actual graduates from the school in question. I would have to do criminal background checks also.  I love speaking with the public and trying to help them.  My co-workers were fun and I loved working with them.  The hardest part about the job was getting ready for the one stop job fair, but I enjoyed it. Management was great."
good,"Nesta empresa pude aprender muito e junto com os colegas de trabalho pude aprimorar ainda mais meu conhecimento, a direção e gerência sempre presente, um bom lugar para se trabalhar."
good,"My day would consist of unloading trucks with packages in a timely manner. I would supervise large items such as truck tires, car parts thru a scanner to get accurate rate of charge. Extra hours I would also help with the smalls package area collecting small boxes and placing them into a bag and belt for proper loading."
good,"Start at 5am finish around 8:30 am"
good,"I would get to the building around 6am, load and organize my packages for my route, after every package was scanned I would drive to my area, and deliver.  I had businesses as well as home deliveries. I enjoyed the job, and it kept me on my toes."
good,"I was involved in manual as well as automation testing. I am a detail oriented person, so I really enjoyed my job as a software tester. My co-workers were helpful and supportive. I have learned that apart from using software tools for testing a software quality, common sense and sense of humor is needed to really enjoy with the people around us, and I am glad that I found such environment in FedEx. I  learnt so many things during my stay and one of them is to communicate well i.e. to be simple and clear while communicating with my entire team."
good,Enjoyed working with young kids. It was a different experience for me.
good,"I worked in a sorting facility. You were exposed to weather conditions, loud constant noise, and continuous heavy lifting. Managers were good at motivating employees to work hard. The benefits package is excellent."
good,"Every day was the same so if your'e into tedious work this is it. very basic warehouse work, mainly shipping and receiving."
good,"A typical day required me trying to get drivers hired for the FedEx Ground Contractors. I learned how to complete back ground checks, verify employee history by contacting major companies and requesting the information needed. I wasn't interrupted by management because I was slow at my job I actually was complimented on by several FedEx Ground Contractors on how quick I got there drivers hired and driving a truck for them."
good,"Here at FedEx they got Standard that all employee must hit every single time. The minimum Boxes you should unload in and hour is 1,050 boxes per hour off the truck if your and unloader. "
good,"My work night started at 10:45pm. I learned how to load freight into different sized carts and how to pull freight off the conveyor. My co-workers were very helpful and described my work area well to my understanding, My manager was always there when needed with answers to every question i asked. the hardest part of the job to me was learning the citites for each cart. But in due short time i had learned where everything went."
good,Management here is great! They are really helpful in assisting you in achieving your goals.
good,"come in for the pre-sort meeting.receiving… trucks that have been there and already receiving would get unloaded and sent up through a series of belts and chutes, and as that would come across, it would get sorted into their different destinations that we’re going to be sending them out to. So as we sort them, they get sent to their own individual belts across a long line. We had at least 30-some doors.

It gets put in the truck and sent to the back. And then you have to do a good job building the walls, so you could get as much packages into the proper trucks as possible"
good,"I manage 10 routs part-time. I have people work for me. if there is any problem with delivery, i am the one taking care of the stuff."
good,Very busy and fast paced environment. Great management team and personnel. Non-stop lifting and loading packages but can be challenging and fun if you can handle the constant movement.
good,"If you can make it past the 1000 hrs to receive benefits, its well worth it. Great benefits, great people"
good,"A typical starts as such we all meet in the front of the building to review our last day and as a group we all stretch  to reduce injurys for all workers. Meetings usually held by 1 manager and 4 floor managers. They go over were we need to improve and honor those who do well."
good,"work load was manageable."
good,"There was no typical day"
good,"Overall a very good career place. "
good,Great company to work for and has great benefits as well. Atmosphere was great and direction was clear.
good,Honestly it was a great job to have while I'm in school! I have learned alot about being a leader and professionalism. Everyone was great. The job itself was not hard.
good,"A typical day at work was focused on the customer experience.  Over my 26 years with FedEx I worked in many different positions but each had a focus on our internal and external customer needs.  FedEx was a top ten best companies to work for many years in a row and given I was employed there for so many years, it was important for me that a company would have a people first philosophy and this made it the most enjoyable part of working for the company."

good,I served as a team driver at FedEx.  My typical day could begin at any hour of the day depending on when the loads were ready for delivery.  I had to learn how to work cooperatively with my co-driver.  It is important to get to know the person you are driving with and their personality since you are with that person constantly. We drove cross country delivering and picking up loads to various destinations. The hardest part of my job was getting the loads on time to clients.  Many times the loads were not ready for pick up and put us behind schedule.  The most enjoyable part was traveling to cities and states I had never seen before.

good,"Working at FedEx requires a full investment of energy.  You need to be able to think on your feet, move quickly, identify safety hazards, reduce the amount of wasted movements, and communicate effectively.  Management is very approachable.  They show the most respect to the workers who work hard, show up every day and in a timely manner.  Some coworkers are great people, but some are fairly prickly.  The hardest part of the job is keeping up in all environment types - cold, heat, humid, arid, wet, icy, etc.  The most enjoyable part of the job is knowing you did your best to get packages to individuals in the most timely, quality manner possible.  Also, it's a great workout."

good,Delivered packages for retail and residential areas. Great place to work
good,"Typical day at work when you clock in supplies are limited, you could wait at least 30mins or more for tools needed to complete your job function. Fairness with management is horrible. Some locations make their own rules to benefit the company and not the employees. There is no Union so the employees have very little support or security with fair treatment of employees."
good,It was another adventure for me as I was handling packages for FedEx at night before going to school in the morning. I always working out FedEx gave me the opportunity to stay in shape while getting paid. And my supervisor and the entire team I was working with were great people to work with.

I scan, stack, load planes, load trucks, help any area/team and get as many hours as I possibly can. I learned that working in the crazy FedEx World Hub you have to be fast paced, quick learner, and able to adapt. You have to actually know what it is you are doing because every job title there is extremely important. My co-workers are friendly , helpful, sense of humor. We are all able to get along, talk, laugh and still get the job done in the amount of time suggested. The hardest part about my job is not messing up on whatever task you are doing. The most enjoyable part of the job is the ability to learn new things and accelerate as quick as you want within title changes and pay increases."
good,Great opportunity to work independently and as part of a team.

good,"My overall experience working for FedEx Ground at the troutdale Portland hug is that the company cares for it's employees and does it's best to make any accomodations necessary. Management works with employees to keep the work interesting. The most difficult aspect of the job is that it is 7 hours of physical labor a day, like going to the gym and working out repetitively for 7 hours. There is alot to learn at FedEx and plenty of room to move up."
good,"A fun place to work that is great for a early morning work out, im constantly lifting and moving, and I never stop learning new and challenging ways to excel in this field. The management is hands on and driven to a quality environment for its employees. The hardest part of my job are the lack of hours. The most enjoyable part of the job is weekends, where I and my collegues can enjoy a nice breakfast and discuss Safety and Growth."
good,"I had a lot of fun working at FedEx. I worked the peak season during the twilight shift as a package handler. The work was hard, but the crew was fair and management let us rest when we needed it. It gave me the workout I needed. After my temporary position was over I was offered to stay on at different hours. However, those hours conflicted with the time when a shared vehicle was available to me. I had to decline the offer the stay aboard. Had I the vehicle I have now at that time, I would have stayed. I really enjoyed working for FedEx and I would do it again, if I could."

I loved the company and although I'm no longer working for the organization I continue to love the company and think of it with fond memories. My spouse still works there and probably will work out the rest of her career with the company. The only reason I left was very few lines for advancement therefore very little chance for any significant increase in salary.
good,Good Place to work at hard work but good management and the hours are flexible.
good,Great coworkers. Got my forklift certification at FedEx Freight. There were a couple people in management that could of used some people skills. But over all the best job I've had.
good,FedEx takes care of its People who in turn provide excellent Service that creates Profit for the success of the company. While employed I experienced a period of extreme growth causing management to implement cost controls.

Overall a great company to work for that promotes advancement from within while always keeping the customer at the forefront of their decisions.

good,"It is a very physical job. There is no heating or air conditioning in the winter or summer making it very challenging. But if you put yourself to it, it can be very rewarding by the weekly paycheck. Benefits are outstanding and in about a year to year and a half you can be a supervisor. It is hard, but rewarding. The typical saying of no pain no game describes it perfectly."
good,"Benefits are amazing. Even as a part time employee I get full benefits, minus long term disability."
good,Well working with FedEx Ground I learned so many thing important thing of all it taught me how to be responsible and reliable.
good,Fun experience with great sights of aircraft and benefits but you will never find a full time position and depending on position get over 20-23 hours a week.
good,Fedex ground fort worth hub taught me that it is to ask for help when u need it.. how to be s team player we are all doing the same job and if one area s numbers are down I counts against everyone.. great management and great hub managers.
good,It’s a great place come in work get paid listen to music. Easy job hardest part is waking up at 5:30am. But once you get in the groove of things it’s easy I also enjoy the free coffee.

good,"FedEx ground;-Smartpost, was the best job I've ever had. There actually are PART TIME shifts, not just an piece of an application that says, ""part-time"". Managers and HR are amazing people who actually care for the employees, and are extremely understanding of the fact that life is still happening beyond the doors if that warehouse. They really actually made me feel like I was part of something. Which is very important for me because  I don't get that usually from any part of ""society"". The ONLY hang up is the pay. You start at like 11.50 an hour, but the longer you work there the higher your pay. There are people there making 15-16 bucks an hour. They mean what they say and say what they mean"

good,"Nice staff , along with co workers. Team based employer aiming to satisfy each and every customer with on time delivery and safe arrival. Great recognition for hard workers"
good,The hardest part of the job is working over 12 hours and only being compensated for the daily pay with no overtime. Per hour gives you a better look towards your check.
good,"Great job, great benefits, great opportunities, very flexible when it comes to understanding something is wrong they’re very quick to understand everything entirely wrong with the situation."
good,they was a okay company to work for but that’s why i’m finding something else because they done be dirty in the end over attendance policy. but other than that a good place to work for with great money and co workers!!
good,If you actually do your job and are a hard worker this job is for you. The managers are friendly but bosses first. They take the time to recognize employees for their hardwork.

good,Graduated pay scale  to retain employees Fedex reds to away with the Graduated pay scale .............................................. Good place to work
good,"It was hard work, but I expected it to be. The pay was good though, compared to other jobs I've had. Had I a different shift and no issues with health, I would have kept my job there."
good,Their was a Manager that kept harassing me and i took him to HR. which he retaliated on me and got me   discharged and he was discharge 2 month after for the same thing. HR told me i can work back at FedEx but i will lose my 10 years status. That hurt me to my heart. But i would work for Fedex again as long as their are different managers.
good,"As far as management is concerned, I do think FedEx needs to crack down a little more on employees who take advantage of the company's policies and work schedule. There are many of my co-workers who do not show up to work on a day-to-day basis, and there are also many other workers who simply do not perform the tasks that are asked of them. I strongly believe that management should hold more people accountable for job performance and attendance. "
good,Relaxed but fast paced environment.  Great pay/benefits. Wonderful company. I would recommend  anyone working here. Great job advancement Opportunities
good,"Azienda dinamica e professionale, ottimo spirito di team working"
good,FedEx is a great company to work for and has potential for advancement. It’s a non union company and has great benefits. The pay is competitive and the atmosphere is fast paced but pleasant.
good,Fed Ex is a great company to work for. The management team is fair across the board to all employees. Your co-workers are helpful in helping new associates out. The hardest part of the position is learning different routes within a timely manner.
good,"good communication and not a lot of problems everything was on time and smooth. The hardest part of the job was getting used to operations, once you get used to that eve thing becomes empty ."
good,FedEx Freight is at the top of the LTL industry and a great company to work for. Safety is a top priority and you must be vigilant to avoid accidents. Pace is fast and customer service skills are a must. Management is supportive and Benefits are some of the best in the industry.
good,"Great benefits, long hours, very competitive pay scale, professional work environment, you are expected to be a professional , customer service skills are very important.  Great work place environment, team work is an important quality, along with communication. Newer trucks and trailers. Fedex Freight likes to hire from within and excepts transfers."
good,"I just think they could pay more for all we do. Great pay, dnt get me wrong but could be better. On point benefits. I feel like raises should be given every 3-6 months for people who had been there tht long"
good,"I’ve been with FedEx Express for almost 20 years. I am a swing driver which means I don’t do just one route everyday like the majority of other couriers. Im the guy that covers sick calls, vacations etc. so I do every route which means a lot more to learn. I never know where management are sending me on any given day. As a swing when asked can I do this? The answer always  has to be yes. It’s not for everyone but if youre like me and that’s something you would enjoy then it’s the job for you. Only real complaint I have is how long it took to make a liveable wage. I only was able to survive in the Bay Area, Ca. with FedEx was by being able to live with family. But I finally after almost 13 years am topped out and make six figures, although even this isn’t enough to live here and save."
good,The job is a bit of hard work but the support culture there is vere helpful when learn about different aspects of the job. Employees are honest to you.
good,"Spent close to 12 years at FedEx and unlike past career spots, I was unable to advance beyond an individual contributor, some of that may be me, but I believe most was that management positions were few and far between, unless you were working out of Memphis, the primary location. Had many different 'jobs' but all were lateral."
good,The job keeps you in shape making you learn special skills you also you Vance in different areas of the job by having different documents . But one thing I will say if you are not careful it would wear and tear on your body
good,A regular day at work was always busy. I learned my job position in a matter of day and got moved up quickly. Our management team were very helpful all the time and patient. The hardest part of the job was unloading packages from 1 truck alone when employees would call in sick or when we were short employees for a shift. I enjoyed working for FedEx because not only did I have great benefits but I learned a lot from our manager and employees. FedEx treated employees like family.
good,"FedEx is a place that doesn't discriminate, and provides opportunities for anyone that can handle the type of work involved. It is not for the weak hearted because it is very labor intensive work."
good,"FedEx was just a part time job for me at the time..it's is very very high paced place..."" It's sin too waste time"".That's is the underground motto of FedEx...It was also a great workout.."
good,Good company to work for.  Very structured. If I were able to secure full time hours... it would be a great place to retire. I am continuing to look for full-time hours.
good,FedEx was a very good place to work. Fast paced delivery company and had many aspects that were appealing. Transferring work locations basically around the world
good,Helping the guests fine there section to watch the game an greet them with a smile good customer service skills an excellent team player guidance asking others do they need help finding the restrooms are the club
good,"FedEx was the best company I have worked for. The pay was at the top of the scale, benefits were exhalent. Time off was very easy to get for family needs."
good,"It was a fast paced job and we were always busy. Never boring always active and when we needed help others would assist. Working overnight is cooler, temperature wise, than in the morning."
good,Buen lugar para trabajar solo no permitir que lo laboral se mezcle con lo personal
good,"The job is very fast paced and changes are made daily. You must be willing to adapt and overcome the stresses that come daily with this kind of job. The added benefits and great pay help make the job more enticing, plus the culture is great!"

good,The management team worked with you continueally. they pride themselves on safety. the company takes care of their drivers well. However there are times where it was slow.
good,I enjoyed working for FedEx because it taught me a lot about teamwork and how to handle unexpected situations. I could also tell that the managers were very well respected and not thought of as just “the boss.”
good,"empresa que honra o contrato, paga os funcionários em dia."
good,Excellent with flexibility and the pay is great as well. Very welcoming company with great benefits. Typical day consist of working about 4 hours a day loading delivery trucks.
good,Fedex is a fun and fast paced company that depends and guarantees deliveries based on time. Therefore you need to be able to multitask and solve probelms all in a timely manner
good,My day starts reviewing performance stats from previous day for local manager. Reviewing timecards for locations for accuracy and forwarding information to management.  Any incidents from previous day are discussed with courier and followed up on with customer to resolve issue.  There are many different programs I use to research package address to ensure on time delivery.  Our team of two locations cover a large area I enjoy making sure our locations are top of our district for 100% compliance.
good,working at fedex is very challenging at times and could be at a very fast pace but its cool and you have the option to meet alot of nice people. I have been only been here for 2 weeks so i haven't gotten the feel of things yet
good,"FedEx was a great part time job.  Worked the 4-10pm shift and the 3-9 am shift both taking hwy 70to99 to Sac and back. Witnessed many accidents around me, avoided a few. Management was fair but wimpy on safety. Worked 4 different stations for Fedex. Sunnyvale, Visalia, Santa Cruz, and Chico. Did over 150 routes as a swing courier.Earned 2 Bravo Zulus  and earned a safe driving award all 15 years I worked for FedEx."
good,FedEx taught me how to coordinate cut times and freight management. The way FedEx works is comparable to a bee hive. Everything goes smooth and proper. From the top CEO to the Part Time employee everyone plays their part.
good,Sometimes tough aggravating work day but its worth the $150 salary a day.  Overall im super dissappointed I got a speeding and seatbelt ticket or I would be there.
good,Great work life balance with option to work from home on an as needed basis without being excessive. Great place for working moms. Insurance benefits are not the best with high deductibles.
good,My typical day was usually a 10 hour day and I was a company driver that would deliver the product from the warehouse to the customer's dock.  I work in freight and it was usually heavy equipment that was delivered.  The hardest part of the job was the paperwork for returning a product that was unsatisfactory to the customer.
good,Great starting company for young people. Great incentives and ways to move up within the company. They make you feel like you belong there rather than knock you down.
good,"Great Environment to work.  The management and staff at this location are very helpful and friendly.  They are very inclusive, and the managers are very accommodating."

good,Worked at Fedex home delivery for 2 years and loved it.  I set my own hours did my own thing and at the time fore me was a great fit for what I needed
good,"One needs the ability to think on their toes fro this job, especially for area managers. Higher management always wants more from their employees. even when you meet company standards, always wanted more than what was asked."
good,"Excellent part time job, you can work more hours on different shifts if you are willing. Very laid back relaxing atmosphere and management is absolutely wonderful at this location."
good,"Wonderful work environment.  As with any place of employment, there are ups and downs.  It can be stressful at times, but the support team is awesome. The fact that everyone there is a team player and will jump in to help you is amazing.  So those stressful days are not so bad after all.  Management is also great.  They are always readily available 24/7 to help. Which is very nice, considering working with the government and with constant law changes and system issues - management is always available to escalate issues to get resolutions."
good,"A FedEx foi meu primeiro emprego no qual aprendi a trabalhar em conjunto , respeitando meus colegas."
good,Great environment that promotes growth.  Provides tools and training to advance within the company.  Can be very demanding during peak season.  Overall amazing company.

good,FedEx is a great employer with many talented employees that make it a great place to work. It offers full benefits and flexible scheduling as well as paid vacation.
good,"Really great company to work for. Nature of transportation business can be stressful, long days are a must. Capped commission in the sales capacity is a downer."
good,"Fast pace environment must be able to make hourly quota, lift and reassemble some messed up trucks that come in from out of state. Good pay but winters are extremely cold on the dock."
good,"in the begining i was loading and downloadin packages, later i was contracted out to several companies to process there frieght, then i was certified as a Haz Mat specialist / inspecting  and cleanup"
good,"A typical day was fast pace and accurate. Me and my team delivered and picked up, hundreds of boxes daily while keeping an intricate account of the boxes."
good,"I am a hard worker, Good Attendance, Dependable, Great Attitude, I've been a temp worker going on 4 years now but now i need a full-time job with benefits"
good,It was an overall good experience. They seem to care about employees. It is a grinding job can be taxing but I enjoyed it. There were though days and there were easy days.
good,"Work work work. All you do is work importing freight to clear FDA, ATF, USDA and Customs. There is nothing else to tell about this company for the job I  did. I worked in FDA and did reports, assigned work nothing else"

good,great place to work and great pay once you are full time every benefit you got it. management is great. relaxed place to work but in a timely manner fun
good,Even though you’re expected to work hard and efficiently you still have to pay attention to detail. Those things are important working for a company like this one.
good,"This is a good company to work for, it has great benefits for even part time and the co workers and management work well together. "
good,I loved working at FedEx.  They did so much for the employees.  I worked at the call center.  Calls came through automatically.  It was difficult at times when you get an angry customer but for the most part people are kind and made the day go well.
good,"Worked as a team player on an assembly line: scanning, loading, and picking packages. Placed packages on a conveyor line to be put on an aircraft for shipment."
good,"I load 3 trucks and I'm at the beging of the belt where all packages come down. I then have to split all packages and scan mine then place in the correct truck with vision number orders.  The large packages are hard to handle in a small area to remove from the belt and if missed it's really hard to get into your area."
good,the hardest part of the job was heavy lifting and the short hours I enjoyed the people was like a family and the managers were good to work with they were fair.
good,I loved working at this job unloading the trucks and putting the things in order was great the people always gave you respect and I was never late and a hard worker
good,Its cool working at fedex. It is easy make sure you are on time. I do data entry its easy. Manager cool give and take kinda day. The company is awesome to work for I love the insurance.
good,"At FedEx you have to work on your list(customers on your list) almost every day!  Customers ""fall"" off your list?  Big mystery!  They were always coming up with a new way that will definitely work!  You would put the extra time in and it would not fix the issue of customers falling off your list!  Even if you called on them 2 times a month and just did pricing on them, they still would fall off your list.  The ""list"" is what they pull your information from, so it is very important.  And if a customer falls off your list, you have to wait to get them back on your list!  You could get it adjusted if it was 10% of your revenue."
good,Working with Fedex it caught you on your toes. Very fast moving job.I liked this because it made the time go by quicker. Our Lockers were outside the building of which made it kind of difficult to get to and get back to work from lunch.
good,"Meetings before you go out to dock and start working"
good,"In local station work as a Senior customer service agent, I loved it. "
good,"As someone who loves hard work, I loved this company.  However, the regular injuries and overnight hours made school work and life quite difficult and stressful."
good,"I would have never quit Fedex except after many injuries I was encouraged to get my degree. I did so and then quit after 15 yrs of service to pursue another career. I miss Fedex as an employer. However, I have not worked for them in 15 yrs."
good,"Hardest part of Fedex Ground was the working conditions that made you feel like the pay was not worth it. Once past that, great room for advancement, and training. Not much time for work/life balance due to the hours necessary to run effectively due to transportation needs."
good,"Great company, lots of availability to pick up hours.  Great management team and options for advancement.  Fun environment and team atmosphere.  Great training provided"
good,Great Company to work for. Managers are well trained and good to work under. Fair pay and benefits. Needs to work up to job rate but understandable. Great company to work for
good,The pay was great. When hired i worked 20-30 hours a week. As soon as the saw my experience they offered me $2/hr more than the position was paying. I would still have been there had it not been for a specific supervisor who played favorites and i went from 20-30 hours a week to 5-10 hours a week to being on call. After a couple months of this I had to resign. Overall FEDEX treats there employees good. As with any company you have a few bad apples that they let get through the cracks who don't treat everyone fairly.
good,"Eu trabalhei muito tempo nessas empresas gosto muito do que faço são empresas muito boas de trabalhar sempre fiz meu serviço corretamente nunca fui de faltar e nem chega atrasado a empresa da muitas oportunidades para quem quer se aperfeissuar mais pra isso VC tem q fazer sua parte aprendi muito com eles bem mais do que eu sabia fiquei bem atualizado ,agora gostaria de novas oportunidades para pode mostra oq essas empresas mim ensinaram obrigado."
good,FedEx was an excellent employer to work for but the rural area in conjunction with heavy rains and a large delivery map were an obstacle for predictable time management.
good,uma empresa que da uma assistência ao funcionário faz que ele fique satisfeito em trabalha na empresa
good,"Working in the import departments can be very busy and you have to able to multi task.   Not only is the paperwork that have to been but customer service is the first a priority there are times when you have to put a shipment or billing aside because a customer has an urgent shipment that needs to be moved so I would stop and focus on that customers needs."
good,"Loved, loved, loved this job.  Good opportunity to advance and learn, and to collaborate on projects with others in my department, as well as with other departments.  Loved the people I worked with."
good,get to work in the morning check truck start a motor vehicle report do a pre trip get equipment together do our daily stretches and have our morning meetings. load our trucks and start the day with deliveries and later pickups.

good,"Enjoyed the people and love the clean bathroom,time goes fast and love the females and their attitude..I would love to stay there but had to experience new things in life.."
good,"There were a lot of changes in the 15 years with FedEx.  I had multiple cross training.  Drove a tug, learned how to de-ice airplane, office work, train others.  I learned I was capable of more than I ever thought at FedEx."

good,"Working at FedEx in a very hard but enjoyable place to work. Management is very helpful in getting the job done, the hardest part of the job is the work it self, but a good job has a little hard work in it, over all I can say that working at FedEx is wonderful."
good,"Agradável, motivador, aprendi muito sobre RH,  lidar melhor com as  pessoas, a gerência deixa muito a desejar porém o ambiente de trabalho me faz sentir-me acolhida, as pessoas são a parte mais difícil do trabalho, e ser recompensado e reconhecido por um bom trabalho é a parte mais agradável."
good,I enjoyed working for FedEx freight. The job was explained and they made sure you knew what you were suppose to do and not do. I't was a part time job with little chance to get on full time as a dock helper.
good,"Excellent company to work for, they train you and give you all the tools you need to succeed. The Company mission statement is true from top to bottom."
good,"Federal Express has a People, Service Profit philosophy that work well within the organization and they have superior service for management training."

good,"This job is fast paced, and it constantly keeps you moving and on your toes. If you need want a good exercise with great pay and benefits, FedEx Ground has an amazing position as a package handler. With the variety of weight in packages you are sure to get your energy burnt. Plus, the management team listens, and they constantly look out for their people. The wroking crew are constantly talking to each other and communicating, and the converstations we share helps pass the time away."
good,Aprendi mucho del servicio a cliente en FedEx sin embargo la gente suele ocupar el mismo puesto durante muchos años sin ascensos por lo que tuve que despedirme de FedEx para buscar mayor crecimiento laboral.
good,"Internal structure no so good.  Subordinates extremely resistant to change and move into the new century.  Cling to ""old ways"" of doing things.  Lot of staff turnover"
good,"would highly reccomend job to a friend,was a nice place to gain experience in a warehouse company willing to work with you and also has great hours wouldnt mind working there again in future"
good,Overall I would say the company was great. I loved there job performance. The work was fairly easy we lifted heavy merchandise and shipped products. great

good,求められる水準が高かったので、日々の勉強が必要でした。家庭と仕事と勉強の両立が大変でしたが、そのおかげで成長したなと自分でも感じます。
good,Fedex is a company that really looks out for its employees. The ability for career advancement even for a middle of the pack employee is high. Most people that I talked to at the location that I worked were able to receive a promotion in 2 years. Like every company it has its drawbacks but overall it is a great place for people just starting out( recent grads) or people trying to get back into the work force.
good,The employees and management were all very friendly. It was easy to contact the corporate office for any questions. The 401k and medical coverage were perfect for a growing family.
good,"Contracting Job, I wish it was fulltime.  It was a seasonal job.  This job required heavy lifting and moving at a very fast pace.   The pay was good though."
good,FedEx is among the best of the best when it comes to developing talent.  They are industry leaders that have grown by buying and integrating companies and people into a culture that is focused on reliability and execution.
good,"Friendly environment, great collaboration. It was difficult from a career progression perspective. Perhaps if they could add more layers to their career paths to give people more room to grow.  The amount of vacation was limited."
good,"I have been happy for 29 years until recent management change, flexible hours, good pay, good company to work for that has been around a long time with a lot of hard working people"
good,"The hardest part of the job were the drivers, very hard to find good people to work hard."

good,"I loved working with FedEx because I enjoy a fast pace work environment and the work is not too hard to do. You scan the boxes and load them either on the truck or on the pallets. None of the boxes were over 50lbs. It is very convenient locations and a JOBLINE bus will take you to the door, literally."
good,"I enjoyed my years at FEDEX and feel very fortunate to have been employed by them.  Benefits were amazing, treatment was fair and the company is very innovative."
good,This job is very physical because youʻll have to work at a fast pace to get the job done but also be professional on job meaning not just throwing the mail/boxes into the containers but to do it neatly.

good,"I loved working here. unfortunately it was a part time job with no benefits. there was opportunity to work with drivers and earn additional money, but unfortunately they didn't have a full time position available"
good,I would say that if you are looking for a good part-time job ...this is for you.Not a hard job..just layed back.Working with different cultures is something of a experience
good,"This is a very fast paced job, but makes the hours go by fast(depending on the season). Make sure to stretch before and after each shift, as it feels like a work out."
good,Quick paced environment and quite hectic at times. Dock culture is to have to the ability to work well with others and problematic solving skills to successfully load and unload freight as a team.
good,"your secured a job as long as you do a good job.  I really enjoyed working with people and I always felt appreciated by employers, colleagues and customers.  Very rewarding.  And they offer a pension plan and benefits to part time employees."

good,"alot of moving and lifting."
good,Loved the fact that I was out and about without a manger breathing down my neck. Meeting people everyday and working at my own pace. The benefits are the best.
good,Loved the job but it was a seasonal job.  During Christmas holidays and then it was over.  Would work there again if I get another chance.  The people was very friendly.
good,I really enjoyed the work and the environment lot of friendly people mean don't get wrong it all fun you have your lazy people's and verything end up pickingup there slacking but for most part it is a easy going
good,"Don't expect to much from this job, its very basic manual labor so you need to be in decent shape and can handle the heat. Water is an all time must because you will sweat alot, depending on location a uniform may not be necessary."
good,A typical day at FedEx would sometimes be long and hot. The most enjoyable part of the job was when we had to sort through the different mail and load the planes
good,"I am a route/home delivery driver.  Drivers work for/as an independent contractor.  I am not a FEDEX employee.  My contractor provides delivery vehicles for my use.  I am paid a daily rate regardless of the time required to complete all deliveries.  My route generally starts at 0700 to load my delivery truck and completed by 1300-1400.  It is a very healthy work environment.  We are given weekly safety briefings and customer service training.  Deliveries are accomplished at each individual drivers pace.  Safety is always first and foremost.  The hardest part of the job is, FEDEX requires drivers to deliver packages up to 149 lbs."
good,Ive learned many thiings  dealing with fedex from paletizing to yard check. the experiences ive had with fedex are amazing if I could do it all over again I would but unfortunetly around the winter time things start to slow down so they have to cut people .

good,This job was very productive and a great learning experience to show how hardworking structure can go a long way down the line towards everyone's career
good,Sort manager is great always willing to hear your concerns or work with you if you need schedule change. Fast paced environment not for the lazy most coworkers willing to pull together as a team.
good,FedEx is a great place to work.  Benefits are outstanding. I would recommend this company to anyone who is seeking a full time position with great benefits.
good,I was only there for four months on a contract. Wish I could get on permanent but you can not be hired until a 11 months after your last contract ends.

good,"Typical day to day job."
good,"A typical day at work, trying to be very quick with the things we had to do before we left the terminal. I learned that no matter what I will not always be able to make everyone happy no matter how nice I was to customers, some were still rude regardless but others were great. The hardest part of the job was accidentally forgetting 2 packages at the ware house and being an hour out and having to go back and setting myself back two hours that day. (only happened once) The most enjoyable part was getting to travel and meeting really sweet people."
good,"work here is very face pace and confusing, there is no written instructions so you must learn on your own.  If you dont know its ok, becuase no one really checks, and the supervisors dont care."
good,FedEx is on o e my favorite jobs that i worked.Thia job has great benifits and plenty of room for advancement. Highly motivated people and awesome work environment
good,The hours are good if you have children. The pay is ok.FedEx can be a career job if you are interested in aircraft and business.The benefits are good.

good,I like this company's policy of People-Service-Profit to which they look into the well being of their employees so that in return employees provide quality service that would make the company's customer happy that helps in sustaining the company's profitability.
good,It is a great job to have when there is enough work to go around for everyone. I really like the  job but the hours are being cut and routes have been cut meaning they have combined the routes to other routes.

good,"O serviço logístico é muito dinimico, se aprende muito na empresa, a gerencia é altamente participativa."
good,"Working on outbound, we always tend to be done with shift around 8 or 9, so my schedule hardly ever has to compensate for it. The downside is that it was only part time, which is the only reason I would leave."

good,going into fed ex make sure you do your own part otherwise everything will fail.Also be Ready To Communicate With once another making sure the boxes get delivered to the right place
good,My day started with clocking in and getting all the packages i could get sorted done before having another load of packages to scan. and transfer to the conveyer belts.
good,At times it is stressful because it can get fast paced. Not room for mistakes. Always have to make sure you do a correct load and correct scan on packages.

good,Me ayudaron mucho a realizar las tareas que se me pedían. Un gran grupo para trabajar.
good,"A dependable and secure place to work. I enjoy working at FedEx. "
good,"I enjoyed working for fedex, I started at the bottom in 2008 and under good management I moved up and got into management myself. The work is fast paced but rewarding"
good,I love what the job itself requires. Load and unloading without direct supervision and being effective and efficient allows me to show my passion for this job.
good,working for FedEx was a hardworking job and fairly easy. for a package handler you have to be able to lift anywhere from 25lbs. to 75lbs. if you needed help lifting something you could ask the other package handler.
good,"Empresa otima para se trabalhar, se tivesse oportunidade voltaria."
good,I learned a lot from working at fedex.. That job helped me grow and meet new people. I loved the work environment and i like how the managers can trust you and depend on you for anything.
good,"Im well aware of what the job entails ,yes hard work ,but it pays off  with the effort you put into it ,management is great😊😊😊!"
good,It was a great fast pace job that I had loved. One of the best that I had worked at but the Managers weren't the best. You could get hurt badly on the job and they would still want you to keep the fast pace going rather than getting you checked out. Well alot of the Managers especially on my side did that but not all of them
good,"Daily basis consist of download planes, transport freight out to various locations for delivery by couriers. Opportunity for advancement. Work with others with same goal and with sense of urgency."
good,Easy job with good pay for someone who doesn't have a college degree.  Be willing to work in a dusty environment and experience the harshness of seasons.
good,Basically I found warehouse work to my advantage.  I come to work wearing a scanner on my wrist so as toe scan packages and place them in totes for shipping.  The management was good and so were some of the co-workers.  The hardest part of the job was putting up with unnecessary noises from rude co-workers.  The most enjoyable part was the work.
good,"lost myself got hired there at a bad time in my life but if i had a chance to do it again i assure u i would take full advantage and care of that job. if only the world gave people second chances. i have learned for my mistakes but i still continue to suffer for them."
good,Great company to work for. The company keeps their employee's first and values them. They strive on making sure their customer's as well as their employee's needs are being met. Nice work environment.
good,"working here balanced the time between school and working, I was able to study and maintain funding for me at the same time while trying to raise kids"
good,you will need to know the addresses of the packages where they are going to. the hardest part about the job working during the winter and the summer because it is hard to stay focus. over all the job is easy and fun to be at.
good,FedEx is a great establishment with set values and morals. The company believes in the family aspect between management and coworkers alike. Benefits are great but the hours are not so great for part-time positions. Typical shifts run from 0330 to 0730 but leaves plenty of time for a second job. Also plenty of opportunity for overtime hours or additional hours.
good,I had to stock things and put thing in boxes. make sure everything is where its supposed to be before the box is shipped out. help others if they need help
good,Most days were good and I learned a lot about residential deliveries. The management was very professional and my co-workers also. the hardest part of the job was occasionally having to deal with an aggressive dog. The most enjoyable part of the job was that it was not strenuous and close to my home.
good,Great Company to work for morale is high from top to bottom. Good starting out wage and annual raises. Great supervisors all the way up the chain that care about the job and there workers. Bad part is not being able to move to full time easily due to very very low turn over rate and not very many full time openings.
good,Loaded and unloaded trailers. Scanned packages with RFS scanner for proper destination. Drove box truck to deliver miss sorts  to different facilities.
good,Well structured company. Clear cut expectations for every employee. Fairness in the workplace is felt by all employees.
good,"Great place to work "
good,"started at 6am ,unload first overnight boxes and envelopes,then i would go out to deliver them until 8am. ci would come back and offload trailers until the offload was over. after that i would goto my delivery truck and make deliveries for the rest of the day ."
good,"Trabalhávamos em equipe, éramos bem instruídos. Os superiores eram cordiais e atenciosos."
good,"Getting time off when you need it is hard. "
good,Fed-ex is a work environment that really cares about their workers. Lots of opportunity for a pay increase as your time working here continues as well.
good,Assist customers in seat selections to various events. My co-workers were very nice and professional. The most enjoyable part of the day was watching the events after work.
good,"I loved working here. i would recommend the job to anyone. A typical day working here would consist of loading my truck first thing in the morning, followed by about a 30 minute commute to my delivery route and after that it's completely up to you as to how long you are actually delivering. That's the part I liked about it you could move as slow or fast as you needed to get the job done properly."
good,"A typical day at work was hardworking and time consuming. The shifts went by pretty fast unless you were thinking about the time. I learned ""teamwork makes the dream work!"" Management was fine, nothing really to mention. Co-workers were great! The hardest part of my job was lifting something that weighed more than me, but that's what having co-workers are for. The most enjoyable part was when it wasn't a lot of heavy bags and it wasn't a lot of freight!"
good,It a pretty good place to work  very nice ppl and a good work environment . It is a little bit aggravating getting paperwork and you're scanner to start the day.
good,I've been a mechanic here for five years and for the most part like working here. We have competitive compensation and decent benefits. Management is very good as of now a lot better than it was in the past. Everyone respects one another and we get the job done.
good,"A lot of manual labor to do, just need a change in management. Sub par benefits, lack of hours as well. The company if you have seniority is the only way to make a good living"
good,Productive and enjoyable workplace.  Very approachable management.  Great learning and team environment.  The co-workers and management were friendly and eager to share information that contributed to my growth in HR.
good,"just get there, unload the lorys, compreensive co-workers amd manager.spread all the pacadges per destineted areas help the drivers load. clean the wearehouse and go home"
good,I like FedEx because they allow me travel and the pay and benefits are well worth the long days and weather.  The people are out going and work as a team.  The environment is very fast-paced so keep up. Safety is the biggest goal next to making sure we deliver the purple promise.  On time freight happy customers
good,FedEx is very good when it come to salaries. I like how they allow employees to try out any new positions.. Very fast paced. The mangangement personnel is on top of Their game. They have good communication With their employees. They have monthly meetings to fix any problems on the floor.
good,I like how the guys & I get along to get our work done. The Job is fun plus hard working. in FedEx you are able to grow & become more within.
good,this was an awesome job. The day to day was sometimes a little tiring & the hours weren't always there. the people were great as where some of the way things were managed were sometimes shocking.
good,working at fedex has been a great experience. i loved working here! you meet a lot of amazing people and get to work in the airport. i love working with the feeder airplanes and the fact that i had the opportunity to be a load captain was a great experience.
good,"Empresa excelente formadora de profissionais, dinâmica, alta gerencia acessível, possibilidade de crescimento boa, parte mais difícil e conciliar as diferentes culturas dos times multidisciplinares dos diversos países em que atua, colegas de trabalho extremamente prestativos e eficientes, ambiente de trabalho agradável."
good,I worked on an outdoor dock at FedEx so I did get very dirty every day but it didn't bother me much. The pay was great but the drive to work every morning sucked. I really liked the job and work go back to it if it was closer to where I live.
good,"Every day involved new projects, diversity, and happy employees/ customers. I am super grateful for the opportunity to work for this company."
good,"A typical day as a Federal Express Dangerous Goods Agent is muti- tasking job. You are responsible for maintaining the safety of the station by inspecting packages that contain chemicals. You also must help out where ever the operation needs you to be once you have departed the outbound dangerous goods. The hardest part of the job is excepting the responsibility of sending packages that are flammable, radioactive and other chemicals on an aircraft with your own seal of approval. The co-workers and managers get along very well with a few exceptions occasionally. The most enjoyable part of the job is the benefits. The flight benefits allow an employee on a part time salary to experience the world and stay at upscale resorts at an impressive discount."
good,"Has a family atmosphere and just a great place to work overall, would recommend it to anyone who asks about it. Really simple job moved packages to containers to be shipped out to locations around the world."
good,"Typical day is hook up your set, drive to a hub, work the dock for a few hours and then go back with your inbound freight.  I have done every different kind of trucking and never was compensated like this.  On the shortest run you should easily make $70k a year!  I should have started this 20 years ago.  If I had I would be easily making over $120k a year.  The dock can be a challenge in the winter, but if you make it through the first couple of years life will be great.  If your a hard worker and have been screwed over time and again by trucking companies, then apply now.  It takes a while to get going ( big companies move slowly) but you will be happy later."
good,To be honest FedEx  is not for everyone but it is a good job with great benefits if you have patience and drive it'll take you far because they promote by seniority and it's always someone who has been there longer than you. You get paid weekly and benefits roll in after your 90 day (3 months) mark.
good,"I love this company, but the only reason i gave them a 1 star for job work. i really wish the company would expand more on the west coast because I happen to live in Colorado. Thats really it other than that great people to be in business with."
good,love to work at fedex. get a work out and getting paid.very good co-workers.would love to go back..Hot in the summer and chil in the winter..but time goes fast when busy like we are..next thing u know you are done.
good,"I love the variety of the job, no day is the same."
good,unload truck and reload truck its good place to work for the workers are good too we get thinking done in a fast past we get along with each other
good,"Ambiente laboral tranquilo, en esta empresa aprendí muchas cosas nuevas aparte de la facturación aprendí los procesos logísticos. En cuanto la dirección de la empresa esta muy bien enfocada y le prestan mucha atención a las necesidades del empleado, en Fedex habían lideres que hace que te sientas cómodo."
good,"If you're able to withstand extreme temperatures, fedex is a good place to work.  I enjoyed working with the people on my shift.  Fedex kept me in shape and I loved it."
good,Fedex is a great company to work for. It's nice being on the road and being your own boss. You get to understand an area and meet some really cool people. Driving in the snow is not fun especially when it gets really busy. A typical day would be getting your paperwork and scanner. After that scanning your boxes and docs. Upload everything and do a pre trip. Start your route. You will have to do deliveries and pickups. I would say that it is pretty straight forward. If you ever need help with anything your co workers always can help. A lot of very friendly people at Fedex. Managers are very good about route planning and what to expect of each day.
good,"Overall very good company to work for. The benefits, pay and hours are awesome. The only thing that would make it better is to have a Union to protect the employee."
good,A great place for one to work giving you the chance to get out and see cities and towns that you haven't previously been to or seen before.
good,"Uma excelente empresa tanto para seus colaboradores, quanto para seus clientes."
good,"I would have to say this was the BEST job I have ever had. The people were amazing, the management always had time to teach you, and the culture at FedEx repaired a lot of bad habits that were formed from being a female scratching her was though a man ran industry."
good,"Time keeping"
good,we have good team work. good communication. the great it  pays. all benefic. we have the best manager on the dock. the only hard part it to be dear. nothing difficult any body can do it.
good,"Day to day working for FedEx as a courier, it's very fast paced and different. One day is never the same as the last, as conditions, customers, routes, volume, changes daily. It's fun and exciting as well as very challenging. I'd definitely recommend this company to anyone even starting out as first time job. Management as a courier become more of a guide than hovering over you like normal desk jobs because you become your own boss in a way, you can either make your day a quick one or long one. The hardest part about it is definitely getting to know your given area, overcoming fears you never thought you had, and challenging yourself to do better every day. The definite upside of it is it's never the same, it's always different, and also helps those who are not exactly the biggest conversationalists. It brings out of your shell and you come across a vast variety of people and opportunities all the same."
good,good company to work for fast paced good people hardest part of job driving in traffic always meeting new people never a dull moment always busy
good,they were very fair with everything they did and gave good benefits. The nurse was attentive to any damage any worker would receive. Management helped out with every problem that arose
good,FedEx is a great place to work.  It is a well worked machine that promotes team work withing to work environment.  The management does the best it can to make sure not one person is overloaded.
good,Only fun is work.One thing fedex does well iscompliment an reward there employees as one also in groups.It might be a hard frustrating job but teamwork makes it better .
good,"pre-work with my 40 drivers to start the day also we used to cover a safety topic every day.. used to control or managed 50 routes which covered from Santa Barbara - San Diego. excellent co-workers environment, we used to coordinate most of the movement of all the freight from Santa Barbara to San Diego"
good,The day to day operation could only be done as a team due to the many different operations going on in a 24 hour time period.
good,"Great company to work for where an employee has an opportunity to participate in self steering career program for advancement.  Deeply technical stimulating environment not only knowledge growth but career.  Respect and care for employee families and provide a secure, respectful and safe work environment with highly experienced people and have fun at the same time."
good,"Hard work, keeps you busy. open hours to work, good wages. great for those seeking part-time employment. easy coworkers to work with."
good,Days start with getting a trailer to break down while maintaining the efficiency of moving seven bill counts every hour. The sooner you finish your trailer the sooner you get to go home unless the day is pack with moving shipments like before holiday time.
good,This is a great place to work because you can get in alot as a Temp Employee but your time there is limited to about 9 months to 11 depending on Overtime occurred.
good,"Overall great work environment with plenty of diversity, opportunities, and great people to work with. You always learned something new every day from that place."
good,FedEx is a wonderful place to work. It is the people that are employed and have some authority that makes the job horrible.
good,"A typical day would include loading and unloading trucks, picking over sized  items and loading them.  They had an excellent human resources department."
good,"Friendly management, flexible work schedules and benefits to part time people.  You will top out on your wages in a year with quarterly raises."
good,I enjoy working around the people I am currently teamed up with.  We have have one common goal and always look out for the next guy.

Good atmosphere for developing communication skills. Physical job so must be willing to work in different environments and climate change. Overall great company to work for."
good,I really enjoyed working there because I worked alone with minimum supervision. I delivered packages in several areas making sure that I delivered all packages to the right addresses.
good,"pretty laid back job with advance always around you. set schedules and 4 different shifts a day. good benefits after a year. paid weekly, raises occur often."
good,"You do the same job/task but it is different day to day, There are some politics but that is expected from a fortune 500 company. Management supports you."
good,"Loaded and unloaded trucks into and from warehouse for packages, Maintained conveyer belt for processing"
good,"Worked as a Fedex Team Leader assigning duties to over 25 employees nightly. Freight handling mostly loading trucks and containers efficiently using the t-stack method.

good,"I work part time. A typical day is always fast paced. I've learned how to manage my time better because of it always being fast paced. My managers treat employees good and my co-workers are nice and helpful. The hardest part of the job is organizing things in a short amount of time, especially during the peak season. The most enjoyable part of the job is having two days off during the week. Other than that, it is a job."
good,"lots of entertainment"
good,"De toutes les sociétés où j'ai travaillé jusqu'à présent, Fedex est la meilleure entreprise."
good,"Company offers great benefits, not once in 25 years has there been any lay offs. Have to have good driving skills and always be aware of you surroundings. Must be capable of lifting 70-150 pounds. Most important thing though of all is working as a team to help each other out."
good,"I traveled a lot in my position and learned to juggled many things including time management. I would work with the hotel staff to ensure incoming groups had their needs met as well as build a relationship with the hotel staff. I also updated a finical tracker daily and sent out a report once a week. My co-workers were always upbeat and ready to work and they made work enjoyable and fun. The hardest part of my job was managing the relationships with the different hotel staff. As I could not visit every property every day, it was challenging to maintain those relationships at times."
good,"a typical day at work, fantastic each group work as a family ,we learn something new everyday from the customer , managers at the terminal don't really bother that much unless if there is any mistake made. i enjoyed every single day at work specially when i deal with new customer meeting nice people, gaining more experience on my field"
good,4hours forklift i learn forklift management got the job done co workers were always helpful hardest part of the job was the paste and just being a new forklift driver the most enjoyable part of the job was learning and gettin into the work enviorment of forklift driving
good,It is a fast pace day labor is not easy In love my boss he is a great leader & good co-workers. a big warehouse enjoy time there love the perks
good,Great Management and work environment.  Flexible as long as there is vacation time avialable.  Could be more focused on family.  Health insurance is terrible.

E a agradável era ajudar."
good,Working at FedEx was an experience that worked at a fast pace. My coworkers were great very friendly. The hardest part of the job was lifting the heavy equipment.
good,"Its a great place to work and the benefits are absolutely the best. FedEx is known for its great benefits and work culture, they are always looking out for the best of the employees."
good,"Plan, organize and control operational functions. Conducted daily workgroup meeting. Package handling, scanning of packages and driving various equipment. What I learned is how important it is for a work group to be on the same page, in order to maintain a safe work enviroment and meet production deadlines. Management has a responsibility to ensure the job is getting done and to ensure employees are following company procedures and policy. In my experience co-workers for the most part want to get along and do a good job. The hardest part about my previous employment was working the night shift. The most enjoyable part of the job was witnessing people of all types of backgounds working together as a team, And the health benefits were superb."
good,"Fast-paced environment, new experience. Enjoyed it overall. Hours were convenient, and safety was a must. I would definitely consider employment with this company in the nearby future."

good,"FedEx Ground was a great company to work for, excellent environment, and benefits, I was hired as a package handler, and work in Quality Assurance, working with the International packages, making sure all paper work was correct, and entering all information, into the computer, I also walked back an forth from dock 1 to dock 43 for approximately 6 hours a night making new labels that had gotten torn/ damaged, and taping damaged packages. walking on the concrete every night I had developed plantar fasciitis, and severe nerve damage in my left foot, I did have surgery, and months of therapy, and was told by both Dr.'s to change my type of work, at that time, there were no openings in the office, so I had to look for different employment that could accommodate my restrictions. and also was in need of a full time position which Fed Ex Ground was only a part time position."
good,"Nice place to work.A day at work was comfortable but fast paced. The more you show that you want to work, you will be introduced to a new area quickly. Management always would help if needed. Co-workers were easy to get along with. The hardest part of the job was keeping up with the ISS belt as you would take packaging to the areas it would attain to. It made me want to come to work happy."
good,"We punch in and we have a group meeting. Meetings are used to let us know what is happening for the shift. How many planes are coming in, who is doing what on the job assignments. Planes come in we work them and we move to the next. We do that for the night until they depart. Once there gone we go home. "
good,"Great place to work, I was a delivery driver so having the freedom of being on the road was great for me. The only reason I left was because I moved out of state, but if I ever move back to Maine I have a job waiting for me. I have remained friends with my boss and he calls me once a month asking if I am ready to come back yet, this has been going on for 2 years."

good,Fast pace.  Non production driven. Good benefits for part time associates. opportunity to grow in with positions open all over the country.
good,Everything is fantastic. Fellow drivers are helpful. Daily challenges are fun and exciting. Management is easy to chat with and attentive to drivers. Room to move around in the company and switch stations if you want to work in a different area.
good,This was an awesome job to work for.  It gave you a daily work out and a friendly environment to work in. The problem is it was only a part time job and did not provide much income to live off of
good,"Always promotes varied options for promotion within. Great place for low-hour, part-time jobs to professional and management careers. Sound benefits for all levels."
good,"I was in charge of the scheduling and bids of, at one time, over 200 customer service reps.  I was also on numerous teams to figure out more efficient ways of meeting the scheduling challenges. I was the first coordinator to successfully schedule and implement the remote representative program where customer service reps were set up to work from home...saving the company thousands of dollars.  I was the ""go to"" person for the other call centers that eventually went remote also.  The hardest part of the job was the fact that the demands were constantly changing and I had to adapt to those needs quickly and efficiently. This was also the most enjoyable part of the job since it was exciting and challenging.  I also loved the people I worked with both locally and across the nation."
good,"I really enjoyed working for FedEx. The staff worked very well together and everyone was easy to get along with. I didn't mind the physical work because it made the day go by faster. I also received great hourly pay. If the opportunity wasn't temporary, I wouldn't have mind staying permanently."
good,"Work is always a pleasure when working at FedEx. Each day has its unique challenges yet all the personnel make it a great environment to work in. The Management team is always there to help and assist personnell. Yet the extreme weather situations sometimes makes it a bit harder to do the job, but because of the great atmosphere and the people I work around make it a fun job as well."
good,"A typical work day consists of....early morning shift (3:30 - 8:30am).."
good,I would not recommend the package handler job to any of my female associates because it is physically hard. FedEx is an excellent company to work with great benefits and opportunities for advancement.
good,was a god company. i loaded packages but was to short to do the best i could. if i could have been a unloader i would have liked to stay longer then what i did. it was a great learning experience for me because i never did that type of work. would like to do something like this again
good,Scanning Packages and loading them into trucks while packages are coming down on conveyor belts.
good,"Fedex thus far is the best company that I have worked for. What I enjoy most about this company is that they help motivate and support individuals to pursue their career goals. They offer tuition reimbursement to all of their employees and with such a large network of people, it makes it easy for an individual to find a mentor within the company for additional guidance."
good,"This is a great job for those who like get your hands dirty. Everyday is a challenge but its a fun challenge, just like a workout."
good,"The goal is to deliver and retrieve the package in a race against time. I've listed in my resume most of the job functions, but just to make this a little less redundant and a little more interesting. My route consists of making a minimum of 15 stops an hour. Doesn't sound so bad does it? It's really not, until, you get to a stop and they have 30 boxes going out all weighing 75lbs each. Remember everything is timed at FedEx. You have to maintain the time allotment at and between each stop. Let's add a little more excitement to this scenario. They are all international shipments, which means it's up to the courier to make sure the contents of each packages is accepted in that country. Then ensure that the proper paperwork is filled out completely and correctly so as to avoid delays and fines in customs. My job can be easy and relaxed and hectic and challenging. It's up to me to figure out the best solution to keep pace on my route all while maintaining a healthy happy professional relationship with customers, as well as ensuring safety comes 1st."
good,I load truck and deliver packages to customers I have a set route in a good location where I drive

good,"8-12 hour work days ."
good,"Everyone is eager to help one another. clean work place."
good,"A day at FedEx can become extremely busy with customer request,  but overall the work ethic and moral between the co-workers and management is what keeps me enthusiastic about coming to work"
good,Its a good place to work you would meet likes of people on the road at work places....But there are no benefits that sucks....
good,You learn the importance of package handling. How to load every trailer using the purple promise guidelines.  The unloadd is very fast paced and is easier than loading.
good,"A typical day started off with that days operational needs, and how much or how many customer pickups that was ready to be picked up! Management use to be more laid back, but has grown into a micro management operation, which now makes it hard to do your job efficient to satisfy the customer, co-workers are sometimes team players depending on if they thought would need you for something later, the hardest part of my job was management fixing things that was not broke, most of those decision came from corporate! when we was out in the field's, and had first hand info on what the customer's needs where. and our knowledge was never taken into consideration? the most enjoyable part was once i left the building, i was my own boss!. and out driving taken care of the customer like we are suppose to do."
good,"I enjoy working with FedEx Ground, because everyday is a leaning experience and I continue to learn and grow within the company."
good,"Dinâmico com responsabilidades muito grandes, pois estamos lidando com o faturamento direto da empresa relacionado as cobranças dos serviços prestados nível Brasil."

good,Great company to work for that takes care of its employees. Anyone would be proud to be hired by this company.
good,"Definitely and enjoyable and relatively stress free place to work, FedEx Freight is a great place to build a career in. Branches usually have at least two alternating shifts of drivers and dock workers, and are often reasonable about working around things. Good benefits and 401K"
good,"Productive place, great management.Very fast paced enviorment. Must get 300 packages out every hr. I accomplished getting 400 packages out every hour."
good,fedex is a great copmany to work for.  it is very well led and managed and they do some exceptional things
good,"it is very challenging and a very good work out, you learn a lot and experience so much. The managers are very kind and will work with you to the coworkers will some time need help sometimes team work is well needed. The hardest part of the job really is the weather, But the best is working together and getting the job done and to hear your manager tells you as a whole you did a great job."
good,there is never enough to learn there is always something new to absorb. once you learn you begin to understand and once you understand you can use that knowledge. typical day was busy but made time go by when your working with friendly co workers the most enjoyable part of the job was leaving knowing that you've done your best.
good,"FedEx me dio la oportunidad de crecer a ser Gerente de Operaciones que me ayudo a desarrollar mi liderazgo ya que el tipo de gerencia que desarrolla la empresa es mu completa por que va desde como gerente proporcionar claves a empleados, hasta cuidar indicadores financiero, de servicio y sobre todo la operación"
good,"Responds to complex customer inquiries, resolves problems"
good,"A typical day at work would allow me to talk with customers that were displeased with the service the company had provided. I learned how to take control of the call, and provide the customer with details  of what I could do for him/her. I worked as manager assist and handled all call that would have been transferred to the manager. My co-workers would thank me for assisting the customer that no longer wanted to talk with the agent. The hardest part of the job was to inform the customer that due to policy, and customs regulations there was nothing more I could do. I enjoyed getting to work early and leaving early to be home for my children."
good,My day at Fed Ex stared off with a meeting to tell what would have to be done that day. The amount of packages that would need to go out on that day. I also learned that if you work as a team that you are able to get more of the job done than working alone sometime. The hardest part of this job was the standing but it had to be done to complete the job. I enjoyed the fact that you would always be rewarded for your hard work..
good,It is very active. You have to deal with the weather. When its cold you're colder and vice versa.
good,My day consisted of planning fun learning for the kids to be apart of and teaching them various educational material.
good,i love fedex because it fits my schedule ..morning shift.. ihave the rest of the day to relax or even get a second job if i needed to.
good,"FedEx is not only my first job, but a great one. Guards search me and ask how I am doing at the same time. I clock in with people who are positive and ready to get work done as much as I am. Learned how much I can influence others in a positive way everyday making work environment tension free. Fedex has came a long way, but still has improving to do as far as equipment. That is not a problem, managers and co-workers take that as an opportunity to solve and improve the mind. Managers actually get involved with you. Most were package handlers like myself, which makes it easy to relate. Hardest part of the job is to find something to complain about. Everyone ""makes it happen"". Another thing I learn was how to make and accomplish goals. Fedex always sets goals. If we succeed or fail its together, but we move on together! FedEx is a great place to start, and stay if chosen to."
good,I met the most interesting people. This place was on of the best places to work. Everybody treated you well and joked around a lot. The management was really nice and informative. You could go to them for anything. I learn all about switching trailers and what delivery was all about.
good,Loaded and unloaded freight shipped via air transport and tractor trailer. Responsible for making computer tags documented with information pertaining to the destination of the freight.  Also trained and operated the airplane loading platform.  I was a small aircraft (feeder) captain responsible for loading and unloading freight into and out of the bellies of these planes.
good,I regret resinging from FedEx and choosing UAL instead. I was then furloughed by UAL in PHX for 5 years.
good,"Typical day: Consists of repairing various technical equipment such as RF scanners, handheld computers, desktop and laptop computers, electronic scales."
good,"I enjoyed working here. I learned a lot of new skills from this place as well as a good day to day workout. My co-workers and management were very understanding and willing to help and not look down on me as I was the only woman working on the dock, pushing freight."
good,Fedex is a great company to work for if you like working with alot of different people and you can handle a lot of criticism. Although fedex dose come with alot of problems with messy people. the benefits at fedex are really great. excellent food and and great and clean cafeteria. Management really depends but i do say there is a big problem with favoritism.
good,"FedEx is a great place to work, the hours are flexible and it comes with holiday pay. The great part is that they work with your school schedule or your other job if one have one. the pay is stable but not enough to live on. However it is a perfect second job."
good,"A typical day at work consists on auditing return for surrounding service centers, preparing all the paperwork for each city drivers routes, and providing customer service to those who call in. All the co-workers are very friendly and easy to get along and work with."
good,Load back of delivery trucks and semi's by hand which is the hardest part physically and the weather as well otherwise its good pay and a excellent part time job with benefits etc.
good,Great hours and a lot of room for advancement within this company
good,i would come in to the building and clock in with my badge. i would go to my assigned trailer and start to load it. some manager would call for help and im the one they would send over. i learned that FedEx is a job that don't really care for your issues on the outside of work but they do teach you hand skills that can be used else where.  management was nice. made it worth while to be there. my co-worker was very excellent and willing to make the time worth being there. their was not hard part of this job.the most enjoyable part of the job is wen your management points out how great of a work you are.
good,great company if you are looking for a career. there are always opportunities for advancement especially if you are willing to relocate. Good managers overall but sometimes you could encounter a manager that it makes you wonder how they got to the position.
good,Excellent management.  If an employee performed as expected they were amply rewarded and not hassled.  It almost seemed like self employed.
good,"Fast paced, productive, and high speed company.  Accomplishing daily task.   Management supports and directs workflow.  Co-workers are usually humorous.  Great group of people to work with,  Co-workers are skilled people who put their best forward. Hardest part of the job when the mission is not accomplish or considered priority.  Enjoyable part of the job is team-work and goal accomplish."
good,"Everyday was mentally and physically challenging!  I learned that when you learn good habits and procedures, they help you tremendously from making mistakes. Had the best co-workers, even though we ran our route by ourselves, we also had to communicate and work as a team. The hardest part of the job was dealing with the weather. We had no control over the road conditions or how timely we received our freight. The best part of the job was meeting new people and seeing different places every day."
good,"Fast paced job that was very interesting.  I was never board. The hours were different, but I got use to them."
good,i worked at 4pm to 9pm.  that i can lift up 40-50 punds how work fast work with box's. i liked to work with the managers they were relly good people. all of my co-workers were good to work with them they helped when i needed it. the hardest part of my job was when i frist stared that i had to learn how to work with the big box's and how to work fast to keep up.  the most  enjoyable part of my job i got to have weekend off to spend time with my family it was fun.
good,"Typical day at work for me started with reviewing all emails from previous day resolving anything that was needed, to pricing disputes,invoicing issues and any documents needed. Also processing payments via credit card as well. Every Monday I reviewed a folder I had for anything from previous week that was pending any corrections, I would then forward via email or fax to customer the updated corrected invoice or advise why was declined for correction. Also on Monday's I ran my weekly approved in writing payments. I had several customers on payment plans that were automatically ran every week on their credit card. "
good,"FedEx has many different Operating Companies that encompass all spectrum's of the transportation industry. A very large company but one with people, service and profit as its mantra."
good,"I would have loved to work for them, but i was only picked up as a contractor."
good,"good place to work, good benefits, depenting on management they would sometimes find you some overtime.  management was available,  workers were nice"
good,"A typical day at work is very stressful right from when the planes land to the time the drivers are on the road to make their deliveries. There is a very short period of time to ensure the package reaches its destination."
good,"a well oiled machine."
good,I was in charge of auditing all sales tax generated throughout the continental US.
good,Everyone is very nice and I have not had any bad experiences in this position.  I  download merchandise on the scanners and to then upload to computer.  The job is not hard and the most enjoyable part of the job is knowing you are making a difference in someones life.
good,Day to day work would be shipping and receiving boxing coming from different location and distributors and making sure they go in their secure belts. Used a scanner and computer to track and locate boxes. Management was excellent with helpful information always. Team work was a big asset as you could deal with a package that was over 60lb and would ask for assistance.
good,The only reason I left I needed full time employment because my living arrangement changed or I would still be there.
good,its a bit hectic getting used to night and the quick paced enviroment but very enjoyable and good money .
good,"My 29+ years at FedEx has been rewarding, a learning experience and most productive for me.  I have worked in different departments and have learned so much in different areas of the company.  I wouldn't take anything for my experience here."

Ability to work with other departments. Ability to adhere to all FedEx and FAA regulations and policies to accomplish the time sensitive task of an on time departure of the aircraft."
good,"great company, great benefits, only thing is its tough getting full-time and in the location you want it."
good,"Everyone there is very friendly, most of the managers and trainers have been working there for 10 plus years.  They always have safety meeting to make sure everyone is lifting correctly and that there isn't any accidents.  The most enjoyable part is the networking that goes on, and the hardest part would just be the constant lifting."
good,Great benefits and excellent pay! This is a great company to work for.

good,FEDEX is  Great place to work. a very diverse company. Very easy to work for with good benefits.
good,Built strong business/personal rapports with coworkers (on-site and field operations) and customers/clients.  Culture represents servicing the customer using quality tools all while making sure employees have the right training and support from uppermanagement.  Usually not micro-managed and freedom to make decisions based on sound judgement. Very flexible company with outstanding work/life balance - it alone makes one think twice about leaving company.  Very challenging yet rewarding.
good,"On a daily basis, you never know how your day will turn out.  You learn about yourself on a daily basis.  Management is very cool. Management gets the job done and know how to have fun at the same time.  Co-workers are the same as management, they work and still know how to have fun.  The hardest part of the job is when employees don't come to work and you have to do their work and yours. The most enjoyable part of the job is when you help someone to accomplish the end result."
good,Great management team to work with. Close relationships with managers. I have learned many things such as different types of computer programs from Excel to PowerPoint. Most interesting thing about the company is their strong belief in providing opportunities for employees to advance their careers in the company. I have had the joy to manage at FedEx for 4 years and I want to take the many set skills that I have learned and expand my horizon and ability to take on new tasks. The hardest part of the position is the ability to have the courage to make the difficult decisions knowing that employees will not favor all decisions made. However communication is paramount and my strong people skills give me the ability to explain the decisions that are made even though it will not go well with employees. The most enjoyable part of my position is the ability to know that I can make a difference and play a big part ensuring that my business decisions will ensure that employees have a job that they will enjoy.
good,Company benefits are great competitive salary and maintain a great standing with customer services
good,"Provides a lot of work life flexibility and the culture is very relaxed, yet customer oriented. Didn't provide a lot of security as at the time the turnover was kind of high- mostly due to people looking for experience to further their career experience."
good,"I learned a lot in my time here.  Trained for management in addition to every last job in the building.  Co-workers are the best, really became a family."
good,"I work in internationals(ship packages out to canada) and QA(qaulity assurance) both can be very stressful but the management seems to be able to put together co-workers who express team work. I ship packages out to canada when I come in at 6:00pm until about 10:00pm or whenever we're done. I come back in at 11:30pm and work in QA fixing packages,cleaning spills,and making sure packages get to the right trailor. The stress is probably the hardest part of the job but I get along well with my co-workers due to the team work I mentioned earlier. Even though I'm considered full time we're not allowed to work more than 36hrs so if threre is one thing that I they could improve on it would be more hours. Overall I'm very satisfied with my job."
good,a place to grow learn and managers were great people and co-workers were had workers a jobs jobs  perfect job
good,"we have to have everything off the line within 30mins but we do it in 20 or less. "
good,fedex was a really tough job. you really have to be strong to work their but its worth the benefits. your co workers are horrible. most messed up attitude. managers be really on you. the hardest part is working on the belts having million of boxes thrown at you. the most enjoyable part is your be extremely in shape.
good,"I have learned how to work with team members in a high pace environment, with several dead lines. "

good,"Fast paced enviroment, great communication within coworkers and management. "
good," Atypical day at work involved setting up and greeting, directing, and serving where needed. And, always keeping a smile and good, positive attitude at all times. I learned that  some of us are not always in a good mood but don't let that stop me from having a positive outlook on my behalf. I love working with my co-workers and we worked together not against each other. I don't have a hard part to do. Sometimes, it get so hot, it's unbearable but, if you work hard your day is done before you know it. My most enjoyable part of the day is when the guests come in and give me a hug and tell me job well done and give me a big hug. And, especially, when they come in and ask for me by name. It makes me feel great, "
good,"Great job for part time needs, no room for growth due to the basic needs of the subsidized corporation of FedEx Ground. I displayed an aggressive approach to learn more about the company with hopes of advancement. Yet due to the needs of this part of the company positions are not easily available for advancement. Overall loved the company and the goals. Job requires heavy lifting and ability to be self motivated for productivity goals. "
good, My co-works are very helpful. They understand that we have to function as a team in order to complete the day successfully.
good,"Friendly an understanding people, work conditions an the maintenance was well kept  "
good,"This was a great work environment. I loved my job, had excellent co-workers and management. "
good,Work was fun when you get happy customers. Had a few bad apples but besides that it was great. The hardest part was watching your back for dogs when entering a property. I enjoyed the freedom to be out in the road since i used to be in a lab all with no windows in my previous job.

good,I made the biggest mistake with this company and it still follows me around till this day.
good,"The environment tends to be fast paced. There are many customers, needing assistance. Equipment have glitches, paper jams, people are in a hurry. all these conditions make up a typical day. The difficulty is deciding when it is acceptable to leave one client and prioritize another. The skill is to be able to remain or switch attention successfully."
good,"Always needed a game plan,sometimes things were routine,but always different.Needed to know how to handle each situation.I learned there was a lot to know about running a business.It was tough keeping records,doing the job,and keeping up the maintenance on my vehicle.Management and co-workers were willing to work with me,and I with them to get the packages delivered.The hardest part of the job was dogs,and peoples driveways in bad weather.What I enjoyed most was getting out driving and meeting people."
good,Loved fed ex ground but I worked for them years ago I don't know how much things may or maynot have changed.

good,"Started out as a temp driver for peak season of Christmas and got picked up full time by contractor. Great job, work is a good steady pace. This is the type of job that I like, you are not staring at the clock all day just waiting for 5pm (or whatever time you get offwork). I'll look at the clock and then glance back and another hour or two has passed. Management is great and co-workers are awesome. Hardest part of the job is locating addresses of certain residences that do not have numbers on their house or streets with no signs. Not really that hard!"
good,"My day was extremely busy working with couriers also on the phones with customers. I learned a great deal about dealing with customers how to calm them by doing everything I could do to solve their problem. I was very blessed to have very good managers and co-workers, We were a team, The hardest part of my job was keeping the equipment maintained and in good operation for the couriers.

good,"Working at Fedex was a very difficult but gratifying experience. I've never worked harder at any job but never worked at a better one. Demands and expectations were high, but the employee benefits and fairness in company management were/are superior. That kind of environment will gain the discretionary effort from employees which is the key to Fedex's success. People, Service, Profit is the company motto and it works!"

good,"A typical day at fedex is just going to work working, associating with hundreds of other workers, and going home. I learned how to work as a team and cooperate with others. As far as management my manager was disrespectful, and the hardest part of the job was throwing the heavy bags onto the belt. The most enjoyable part of the job was laughing and talking with other co-workers."
good,"The shipping business can be a very high pressure , get it out on time, no matter what the weather kind of job. I've done it for almost 22 years & personally I am ready for a change."
good,"This was one of my favorite job, fedex showed me really quick that with hard work that it was easy to move up in the company. The people were fun to work with and the work was very fast pace but i liked that. I learned alot being with this company for 2 years. They taught me how to drive a switcher and motavate me to excell in this field of work."
good,Fedex is a very good job to work for the pay is great and management always strives to help customers and employees in any way possible.
good,In a typical day I would serve customers with outstanding print projects. I would discuss options and give them the solution that would best fit their needs and make them look good at the same time.

good,"Pros: Hard work is appreciated, some of the managers are great with helping us out when busy."
good,Work environment is always busy. Peak-season volume is brutal if you are a new associate. There are tips and tricks to scanning quicker. If you stay ahead you'll be ahead. Management at my location is awesome. The diversity is top notch.
good,Laod packages into truck so they can be delivered. These are the smaller trucks that come to your house. Everyone there is nice and helpful. Downfall is the company hires just about anyone. So you sometimes have to work with completely idiots who cant match labels

good,Very team oriented fast Pace enviroment the managment Is Great. Hands on training also where what you want just can't wear sandals. I loved it the pay is good.
good,Interview went well. Was a great job offer. Job wasn't very hard. Easy work and good pay for the few months that I worked there. Didn't really get tired throughout the day.
good,"FedEx is a good company, but people have been working there for many years and they do not care about their future inside the company so they do not try to get their skills better and do not try to improve the company results. In general, the management wants to put the packages on the belt."
good,"I enjoyed working for FedEx Freight, and were it not for the fact I moved out of a hub area I would still be there! The supervisors were attentive and listened to driver/dock worker input and safety... that was really an important factor in my working there. The company is very serious about safety. Which creates a work environment that is fun to work in."
good,"I learned to work a new accounting software, improved my Excel and outlook. "
good,Great Company awesome benefits! Management is top notch and the training is great. The insurance is some of the best. Would recommend working for this company. I like the flexibility and ability to grow in the company
good,I love the team atmosphere and managers noticing my hard work. Pay could be more for such physically demanding work but otherwise the benefits are good.
good,"Triple check all addresses and zip codes, a very brisk walk or jog is best to get done before dark, easier to see the numbers on the houses. Try to place the packages out of view of the street so they wont get snatched."

good,"A typical day:fast and efficient route running done easily"

good,"Great place to work, team oriented, fast paced, high turnover rate due to people not caring to work. Will sometimes get loaned out to another area but everybody is alwaya friendly."
good,"I've never worked for a broker before, so this environment was very different for me. There are so many things to learn about this job, you will never know everything. However, it is manageable, the hours are great; 7:00-3:30 am, the benefits are great as well."
good,It's a great job the position I applied for and received ok like 3 hours need more hours it's something good pay but will b even better if you could gevat least  6 to 8 hours a day.

good,"Overall Fed-ex was a great job. The facility I worked at went through a lot of managers, some good, some mediocre. A fed-ex station is a great place to witness how a good manager can help a business to run like clockwork and a bad manager can cause a near shutdown. Fortunately, most stations have seasoned employees who are willing to do their jobs despite the hiccups."
good,"I only worked there for a short time but when i did it was a good place to work and i was treated well as an employee, i would definitely work there again"
good,Very competitive and fast paced and a great place to work with advancement and different positions.Should never make a person feel that his job is more important than his or her family.
good,Decent place to work with decent people if you’re thick skinned. Everybody was chill and cool I’d work there again anyday. Paid weekly you get what you put in.
good,"every day is a challenge, good management ,and multicultural world,"
good,"Set up my appointments for the day. make the sales calls. check emails for immediate customer needs. Pull up computer to assist in my daily sales calls.

Work my pr icings for future business, enter requests for customer issues and or new automation set ups, account set ups and incentive requests. Schedule PU for daily customer packages."
good,I really enjoy working here probably the funniest and most laid back job i've ever had. my only complaint is that the work times aren't that great as they require you to be up at 3-4am in the morning depending on how far you live for the hub.
good,I have been with FedEx Freight for almost five years now and it’s definitely one of the best places I’ve been able to work at! Would recommend to anyone.

good,"As a part time job the pay and benefits were great, but be warned this job can be pretty fasted paced and demanding, especially since you have certain time deadlines and benchmarks to meet."
good,"I've been at FedEx for 20 years and it's been my only job since college, so my basis for comparison is limited. 10+ years ago I felt FedEx was too slow to react to market changes and too relaxed however in the past 10 years I have seen immense focus on renewal, speed to market and innovation. Right now with world economies changing, the rising expectations of on demand 'everything' and increasing competition make it a very exciting time to work at FedEx. I'd say in the next 3-18 months would be an excellent time to join FedEx as we're in very exciting times."
good,"My review is written from the viewpoint of a 50+ male with a family to support.  YMMV as the saying goes.  "
good,"I was recently let go due to conflicts with my schedule,  which was on me for trying to put so much on my plate. Even though with that being said,  Fed Ex took really good care of me,  and I will always be thankful."

good,"It is a great place to work, however it is very hard to get full-time. I enjoy the pay and the workplace however needing more hours. Bosses are great too."
good,"Working for FedEx Express during peak shipping season is hard work. Shifts start unloading hundreds of pounds of freight, and the days consist of delivering it. Management does what it can but the fate of the day rests with the couriers. Employees carry the heavy burden of customer satisfaction through timely delivery. The hardest part of the job is the job. The most enjoyable part of the job is the job."
good,FedEx was a job that included many different skills such as good social skills and being able to keep track and on schedule within your time limits which would make you more determined to achieve

good,Verry fast pace work inviorment.Management was great.The hardest part of the job was unloading heavy packages.The most enjoyable part of the job was getting to the last package on a truck.
good,Fedex was one of my most favorite jobs. Until management is involved. I left with a two week notice to work at act for more hours and then i left act i went back to fedex and was fired for not hearing my manager tell me to clock out and to top it off he fired me over the phone. He was also rude and not professorial in anyway even flirting with other women employees
good,"I started off as a part-time Package Handler at FedEx,  I learned how to properly demonstrate a structure of effective working strategies and techniques to execute daily tasks. I worked  as a loader and quickly excelled in work productivity. I enjoyed the result-oriented management that I received at FedEx along with all the great trainings. FedEx enabled me to take pride in my work productivity, which helped me learn and grow as an employee. I became an Operations Manager for FedEx about ninety days after my hire. I worked a few short weeks as a Operations Manager before I resigned for an opportunity in a different industry. Overall, I learned many work related skills and enjoyed my time as a manager."
good,Great place to work. The hours were flexible. the pay was good and management was impeccable. I would recommend this job based off the job culture. I had a great experience.

good,Enjoyed working with everyone.  Always learning new things.  Kept you busy.  Can work as many hours as you can handle.  Fair management.  Just an awesome place to work.  Where else can you work PT and get FT benefits?
good,"FedEx was a great place to work.  It was the people that I enjoyed most.  I left for personal reasons, but if given the opportunity, I would return for future employment."
good,The only reason I left FedEx is because I was only working part time. Fedex is an awesome place to work but at the time there was no advancement. I would love to work for FedEx again if the opportunity arises.
good,I was in job training with another person for the job we both were up for to fill. He won I lost which was fine to me. It still is a place i enjoys learning and working and would do it again if I could

good,"A typical day would begin with the sorting of inventory to be delivered.  The sort was divided by priority packages and by end of day packages.  The day usually began by 7am and ended when all the packages were delivered.  During my tenure with FedEx, I learned that customer services is a key attribute in being successful.  A happy customer resulted in future business and recommendations.  My management team was very supportive and hands on with the daily tasks.  The hardest part of the job was ensuring that the priority packages were delivered by the set time.  The most enjoyable part of the day was the return to the hub where I got to interact with my co-workers."
good,Great Brand recognition.  Service to customer is  best in class and customers enjoyed doing business with FedEx and meeting with employee's. Charitable contribution and the exposure of the Chairman and Founder was widely recognized around the world.
good,My review has been great thus far. Plan to see an upgrade in the next year. Moving up an a Senior Analyst and seeing BZ as a Circle Of Success in 2019.

good,The company values people and work ethics. The work environment is secure and quiet. Colleagues are great and try to help/cooperate one another throughout most departments.
good,Working at FedEx was fun at times but somedays when I worked for 10+ hours some days it was rough. The pay was really good miles higher than the states minimum wage. There were some bullies in the fellow workers but where is there not bullies of some nature. The environment is playful as long as you keep to your task you are allowed to talk to your fellow workers.
good,A challenging work place very productive place to be the work place and managers are very Perfesional.  The training was a big help because I knew exactly what to do when I got on the floor. It's and very respectful and perfesional business place.
good,"Great benefits I have worked there off and on 21 years, it is great company to work for  wonderful benefits, sometimes the employees are very hard to work with, I have now been there since 2015 until now."
good,kool place drink plenty water dress right work on time nice people clean warehouse bathroom to. I would like to work amazon to better my salary benefits
good,"a typical day at Federal Express at the Burbank Ramp."
good,The company was great to work for.  I loved the hours since they weren't 8-5 M-F. They offered PT employees benefits too which was nice. Not many companies offer this.
good,"Work was what you made it. No matter how many stops you had. You could be on a route in the middle of Peak Season, and still very much enjoy your day, because of the people you meet, and you get great exercise."
good,Great place to work for a part time job.  I didn't plan on staying as long as I have but you just find yourself not wanting to leave.  Great benefits and fun place to work.

good,Fedex was a great place to work at. Very fast pace and exciting. Great team environment. Learned great team work skills and time management skills. Expectations were clear and they always got done. Management was great and would always talk to you if you had any issues. The hardest part of my job was also my most enjoyable part. The holiday season when the pace is multiplied but 100. But the days went by so quick as well.
good,being able to have a part time job that still offers pension and all the other benefits is a good fit for someone like myself that is willing to work a few more hours in a day
good,Work was great up until our manager retired. I would load and offload aircraft from 11PM to 4AM. The hardest part of the job was getting use to new management who had no idea what he was doing. Most of the people on our team were older men who had been there for years and taught me how to work not only smarter but also faster than all other teams on the ramp. The most enjoyable part of the job for me was being the smallest girl with less experience and having the manager tell me that he wanted me to be in charge of one of his planes.
good,Overall a great company to work for. Not a lot of opportunity  to move up unless you move to another state. Great hours and OT. Some good managers working for Fed ex

good,"Salário em dia, ambiente bom, colegas de trabalho bom."
good,"I loved my job at FedEx SmartPost because I loved my co-workers and management.  I worked part-time as a parcel assistant as well as in quality assurance.  There is a meeting at the very beginning of the shift letting us know of new procedures or just general information about the company.   We had BBQ's during the summer, particularly 4th of July but sometimes just because.  The holidays were extremely busy, this is the when everyone works 8 hour shifts rather than the usual four hours as it does get extremely busy with excessive parcels being sent for Christmas.  It almost seemed to go on forever at times, it started in early November and really didn't stop until just after Christmas.  Many of those parcels were extremely heavy as we had boxes of fruit going through, they could have been up to 50 lbs.  It was easy to make it fun though, when my co-workers started getting tired I would be the cheerleader to get everyone going again.  We all got along and worked together as a whole in order to get things done in time."
good,"A typical day at work is a lot of heavy lifting and to be on your feet for at least 4 hours. "

good,Entrei como auxiliar depois promovido ao cargo de assistente
good,"Managers were very stressed which caused them to become angry at employees, lots of heavy lifting required more than the average person is use to on a daily basis, you get wrote up just for little things as well as big things that may have not been your fault, and if something went out late or something was forgotten you would have to stay to fix it regardless if you have kids or other important things to do. Fedex wanted you to dedicate every minute of your life and time to the company and nothing else."
good,"Shifts for Couriers vary while the AM shifts begin first thing in the morning 630am, the PM shifts around 3pm. The AM shift is very fast paced for the early hours, depending on the load of the route. Gradually the day goes smoothly if you are able to stay focused and set a nice consistent pace."

It is an excellent job, working with people who have all been there years and are willing to help if you have a problem. Very helpful floor managers, and you are trained well before you are set loose to work by yourself. A very safe work place."
good,"FedEx is great place to work. What's so great to work for FedEx is that will be paid weekly, full benefits, paid vacation and sick pay. Plus, most employees as I see them work together as team.  Not only that, FedEx provide some fun events such as a theme in for holidays, Special guest visits, and other celebrations with great food and drinks! Unfortunately, I wasn't able to stay with my job due to physically injured and health reasons.  For your information, please make sure you are able to lift more than 75 lbs which I couldn't and was part of the reasons as well. This was my first time working in a warehouse and didn't realized how big this job was."
good,"My position with FedEx Freight was in a fast paced Customer Support Environment.  I enjoyed working there.  We had a supportive Management Team that wanted us to succeed.  I started working in the Call Center and was later hired in to the International Services Dept. where I learned about Cross Border Shipping.  The hardest part of the Job for me was speaking in front of large groups.  The most enjoyable part of my Job was building strong Broker and Customer Relations, and providing them with a Superior Service."

good,"The only down side is when peek season ends the work hours just fall off. Working 30 to 35 hours a week from 50 plus just does not pay the bills. If your looking for steady hours this is not the place for you. If your looking for great benefits and a nice retirement then these is it, just keep in mind your weekly pay will very."
good,"I am a material handler where I drive tugs at the Hub and I move cans from and on to the airplanes.The management is ok, I feel like I don't get a chance to learn as much as I would like to even after asking from management. The hardest thing about the job is working in the extreme weather conditions.  The most enjoyable thing is working outside when the weather is nice"
good,"The job was very enjoyable.  The people I worked for and with were very productive which created a fast paced fun environment.  There really was no hard part of thr job, it was just pretty face paced yet not overwhelmingly fast.  The most enjoyable part of the job were my colleagues."

good,"Very professional and they provide training into every aspect of the company. They want to see and help you grow, although the managers love their jobs so much that it's not likely that you'll move into customer service Management at the call centers but all of them are excellent. They focus a lot on work life balance within the call center."
good,This was a great place to work. Very strict guidelines from how you performed to how you wore your uniforms. You were trained extensively so when you did move into your job you were comfortable with what was expected. The trace dept that I worked in was one of the most stressful positions in the company. Your communication with customers was not an option it was a timed assignment but once you get good at it you are just busy. I was able to train other employees in the correct way to do this job and was very successful.

I have been there for almost 3 years, and also had to work a part time job in the mornings.  I have two children and this type of schedule can be tough.  I have been working towards my bachelors degree in accounting and I think it is time to work in the accounting filed.  Its time to work only one job."

good,"Here I enjoyed the freedom of working outside, it was entirely practical using logic, we would come in the depot and organize the packages from box’s with our individual delivery routes, the time you finish work depended on how well you planned your route. You would work the furthest drops and local drops to the last and I would make my last delivery close to the depot. You were responsible for the packages as they contained some important documents, you would take a signature from the receptionist, log the time delivered and log the tracking number. This required customer service as you would meet receptionist and business owners daily, you would know the area as well and eventually build a rapport with the receptionists. We work to a deadline, if the packages were delivered after 12pm for free but this would never arise due to the importance of planning before hand."

This station was started as an experimental spur from Shreveport, La.  It was challenging during my 20 years there to build and grow the business and employee base.  I was awarded several times and most notably recognized during my career.

The culture is very positive; their are many people who have worked at FedEx for decades and are very comfortable and happy within the company. The benefits are wonderful and one of the main reasons I sought employment with FedEx."

I learned new skill like how to use a triage system and how to complete employment verifications. management was not as great as I would have expected. there was just not enough of a human connection. Co-workers were great! They seemed to very knowledgeable and willing to assist in any way to make sure that we all exceeded as a team. The hardest part of the job was not being able to resolve the issue. I love customer service and being the advocate, so this was he easiest part of my day every day. Just being available."
good,"Unload all types of size and weight packages from freight trucks."
good,Take and fix any damaged packages that can be still be delivered if only the box is in need of replacement.

good,FedEx is a all around great place to work good benefits job security and and good pay. management care about the needs of there employees
good,"So a typical day at work consists of an average of 2 to 3 hours of intense labor. It starts with a general summery of what the shift will consist of, how many packages, review of previous days performance, and any problems we might encounter through out the work day. We then stretch and report to our stations. lately I have been unloading trailers witch is a very physical post, but I enjoy it."
good,Great place to work and  challenge yourself mentally/physically.   The best part was pushing myself to think outside the box in taking the job.   You learn a lot about team work.

For the job only being part time the pay is good as well as the benefits Everyone from the material handlers to the manager works extremely hard and are dead-line focused day in and day out.  its a good place to work and great working environment to work in and a great team to be a part of. Everyone gets along with everyone and since joining that location I have developed a better work ethic. Lastly, the manager that runs that location is the best manager I have ever met and work with. He comes prepared to work everyday and he makes sure we as a unit are prepared for the task at hand. Whenever we have a question or problem his door is always open and he always answers our questions and if he doesn't know the answer he always finds it and gets back to us later. Just a good overall place to work at."

good,"Working to my best ability to insure the quality of the merchandise.To make sure everybody enjoy from Manager, Coworker, and mostly the Customer."
good,"Wake up early and go in about 5am and pretty much start your unloading and loading trucks. I learned how to drive a forklift which was great, never got to ride on of those until I worked for FedEx. My manager was the best, he was always running around and helping out and he was very patient with me especially being a new member of the team. He also would help out, meaning that he would get down, pick, lift, etc. Which to me is great and also he was always about safety even though you sometimes had to be on a time schedule. He was mostly about safety. My co-workers were great it was just pretty much a boys club, we got to joke around for a bit but also took our work very seriously.

good,"At FedEx Ground I would usually unload truck trailers and sometimes load trailers if there wasn't much work to be done in the unload docks. The management was pretty good, very nice people. Most of the times it is very easy to get along with all of the co-workers here. The only time it really gets hard here is on Monday when we get all of the trailers filled with packages that came over the weekend. The most enjoyable part of this job is when your dock does the best in the entire building during a shift for a extended period of time and you're rewarded with either pizza or snacks for your hard work."
good,"Great place to work at, everyone is a team player and does what they are suppose to. They have a great management team and CEO that is very involved and hands one."

good,"I've worked for a few different trucking companies, liked some, hated others.  Everett, WA. employees are some of the best guys I've ever worked with.  The management works with you and your life situations, whenever they can.  They seem to genuinely care.  In general, the group is fun, good sense of humors, everyone seems to get along great (for the most part!)  If I hadn't been offered a better paying job w/less physical/hands on work, I would absolutely never have left.  I'm going to absolutely miss the people at Everett, WA FedEx Freight."
good,"my day starts with loading the truck, then i go and deliver the packages to my route. "
good,Great job and people to be around. Hardest part of the job is driving all day if youre really tired but time flies and so the day goes quick because you stay busy all day. Customers were always friendly too.

good,"Great coworkers that get along with one another. Perfect work environment and flexible hours. Best part is no mistake is carried on to the next day. Each day is new. I like getting to meet new people and facing different situations each day. The pay and the benefits are great. The only downside is that it can get really stressful, and the work is very physical. There are moments of miscommunication between managers and workers, resulting in some workers facing double the work load. I have learned a great deal at FedEx, like the fact that its ok to ask for help and others are willing to help. Manage time wisely and try your best not to fall behind."
good,"Great job and courtesy was wonderful and appreciated the employees.The management staff cares about the employees and always made sure the staff maintain a safe environment in and off the lot. Calls and make sure your safe, and when directions were wrong made corrections and made sure you were in the right place."

good,A day at FedEx is easy. I learned how they do shipping. the managers are very nice and concerned about their employers. They take time to notice our hard work by celebrating us and giving us a night of food and fun. The hardesdt part about my job is peek season with its long hours. The most enjoyable part is we get to eat when we finally get down time.
good,unload and load delivery trucks and tractor trailers. very strenuous and fast pace. high stress at times not enough hours

Management is always checking on our safe, we work on a platform off the ground. The co-workers are always having fun with each other and everyone is willing to help each other.

Co workers are more than willing to help with any issue you may have. Good team environment. There are days you have to deal with unruly customers however is all in a days work. I had no problem getting out of bed to go to work. I will work there again.
good,"The best place to work! Supplied everything but tools to operate and maintain but everything else provided. I worked both sides in my department and was promoted twice! I would love to go back and work there and maybe in the future try to get back in but due to tsunami we had to work 7 day weeks which turned to 14 day weeks with one break and only breaking towards a Holiday. I missed everything in my life events but had money to my ears that was just sitting around. "
good,"I really enjoy working at FedEx because it gives you a chance to meet a lot of great people and on top of that make some decent money with benefits. A typical day at work for me is mostly driving because I'm good at it and I'm very get straight to the job that's needed to be done.  My manager is the best, he is very down to earth but he still will write you up if he has to.  My co-workers are okay, it's just working with different personalities can be challenging.  The hardest part of my job is working in the different weather conditions.  The best part is meeting new people."
good,A typical day at work is fast-paced and your constantly moving. There's always something that needs to be done. The biggest thing FedEx has definitely taugt me is time management !

good,Great company to work for and receive excellent healthcare benefits
good,"My days started with me arriving work at 5:00 am. Reading through my emails and starting my work immediately. Depending on what tasks i got assigned to by either management or the Team, i went straight to working on them in order to keep the chain moving. Depending on what shift i worked and what day of the week, the jobs rotated. One thing though that management was always proud of me was that i started working the bottom and found my way up gradually, so i could do whatever job there was regardless of which department it was. This can be confirmed by all the managers i worked with and all the station managers in Europe who had me in their station for training or came to OSL Station to train workers."

good,clock in and be ready to work. wear some good shoes because you will be on your feet all day.
good,I liked Fedex I worked as a GSE Operator my responsibilities consisted of me transporting equipment to and from airplanes in a timely manner.
good,"I enjoy working with FedEx the people really make the job enjoyable. I have worked here for 7 and a half years and I have learned a lot during my time here. I have been a handler, team leader, and material handler in the course of my nearly 8 years. The hardest part of my job I would say is the weather because you are asked to work in all conditions. Over time I have learned to adapt to the weather and learned to come prepared."
good,"A very productive and busy workplace. Safety is always the priority,along with being on time,of course. Making sure that every package arrived in its proper place,going to its proper destination. I love working in a face-paced environment,constantly doing things to get the job done and make the customer happy. The customers are #1! Their packages are in the care of people like us,we should be trusted enough to take care of their property as we would our own. I love working with like minded people who care just as much as I do when it comes to making people happy. To me,that's the best part,the customers receiving their package,whatever it may be and for whomever,that person is the happiest human being on this planet when their package arrives! The hardest part,I think,was losing/mis-placed packages and running behind because it would cause our flights to go out late. Losing packages or having one be misplaced is terrible because that package,whatever it may be,could be for a child or a father,that needs the package by a certain time. It could be life saving! You never know. It could be something for you or one of your family members. I take care of others things like I would my own,the right way. The only way. It's great having co-workers that feel the same,though. It helps when everyone can work together and get along,get the job done right and go home with a smile on your face at the end of your shift because you know you did a great job! I was in the management program at Fed Ex,I took many classes,learned many different things,enjoyed being apart of the management group"
good,A great place to work; that has a diverse population. Here you must be a team player and can adapt to changes.
good,My day began at 4:00 am with a quick briefing on the pros/cons of the day before and how to make the day better without the same issues. I learned that being a warehouse worker was not easy. The management team was awesome. The hardest part of this job was transferring packages from the conveyer to a low pallet. I enjoyed becoming stronger and sliming down form the constant movement.
good,"The job had good perks as far as compensation, but there were a few disconnects with management."
good,Sometimes I was on to work 4hrs. I would get sent home in 3hrs. Not enough hours working there.
good,"every day i carry heavy building material, tools, and boxes of home owners products for the build, always  back and forth from site location to zoning area."
good,"Planning, responding to emails, researching new technology, coordinating resources for multiple ongoing projects, conference calls, self development"
good,"I unloaded trailers overnight. I got my work ethic from FedEx. They showed me how to truly work hard and be efficient in the work area. Management was great. My co-workers were also great, very fun people to be around. I loved working here I can truly say this was the best job I had."
good,Responsible for supervising 25 to 40 employees. Responsible for complying to FAA regulations and safety standards  in reference to weight and balance of aircrafts. Management of daily ramp and sort operations.
good,This job taught me the importance of punctuality because this job really relied on the entire team and if someone was missing/tardy it really hurt the operation as a whole that day. It was continuous movement and a lot of critical thinking for 3am in the morning but it was rewarding. Worst thing was the fact that it was a graveyard shift that really altered how you go about your day.
good,"Good people, good place to work.  Pay is relative to industry but I personally needed more money. FedEx SmartPost is an excellent company otherwise."
good,Constantly changing work requirements. People friendly culture.
good,Good work environment. You get taught any and everything you want to now. extremely hot in the summer and cold in the winter. typical warehouse
good,"Its a pretty cool job! It gives me a break from customer service and lets me do a mans job, No offense to other jobs! I also get to work by myself and at Fed Ex Freight, The only thing that can hinder your work ethic is your self. Its a good job and the pay is awesome!"
good,On the road everyday and interacting with customers.  Picking up packages and delivering them
good,"Just Need More Hours "
good,"I worked at night loading cargo bends and trucks. I also sorted freight.  I learned to work on a timed schedule, things had to be done by a certain time, so that the planes and trucks could leave on time for delivery to appointed destination.  The management was fair and very helpful.  willing to work with you.  Overall my co-workers were great.  I enjoyed interacting with so many different personalities.  the hardest part of the job was loading the freight, required lifting up to 75lbs alone.  not so bad after you became conditioned for the tasks. The most enjoyable part of the  job was the team work.  If you needed help, you didn't have to ask.  If someone saw you falling behind they would jump in and help so that the time table would be met."
good,I made address corrections to packages that could not be delivered. I repacked boxes that broke open. I learned how to multitask. I had a great management team and co workers. The job had a physical strain. I enjoyed the working with the people.
good,"we are dealing with shipments all over the world, making sure they are sorted in the right zip codes so packages are getting shipped to the right locations. unloading, loading trucks and labeling are some few other things a parcel assistant is consist of doing on a daily basis Monday thru Friday."

good,"Learned strong ability to multitask and work without supervision, while working under pressure and operating a  hi-low. Working well with others and maintaining a professional and friendly relationship with co-workers and management. Enjoyed working hard and keeping work area safe and clean while maintaining a positive attitude."
good,"So many different companies under the Federal Express banner, but I absolutely LOVED Express.  Only real issue was that advancing to full time work was very difficult.  I was there 6 years and I couldn't get to that next level, so I had to leave and go with a different company in order to advance my career.  However, it was a great culture, fun environment, difficult work but basically a paid work out if you looked at it that way, and pay was regularly increased.  Excellent benefits and the opportunity to work and go to school was very possible.  I would recommend this to anyone who isn't sure what they want to do and are looking for a solid job while they figure it out.  "
good,"fedex is not a back job to work at, just need more hours thats all"
good,"Fedex is an excellent company to work for, but there is no room for growth. I have my advanced diploma in business management and would like to use my knowledge."
good,"pick up and drop off package "
good,"A very  fast paced place to work. Have to be a great, fast and yet safe driver of a sit down forklift in order to get the job done. Management is there to help out but mainly co workers are the more helpful. Company lunches are the best part."

good,"Your are on the go from the moment you clock in until the moment you clock out, I learned the importance of following safety protocols, management was great and always willing to help those who needed it and my co-workers did the same. The hardest part of the job was the constant lifting of different sized boxes and the most enjoyable part was being on the go and working with great people."
good,"A typical day at work is full of sweat but fun none-the-less. I learned that once you have a good job, it's best to do all you can to keep it. I liked my 1st and 2nd manager. I didn't care about my 3rd manager too much. I had excellent, helpful, and fun co-workers. They were overprotective of me because I was the youngest of the group so I got pacifiered alot. The hardest part of the job is the heavy things that you have to pick up. You have to be able to lift 75lbs by yourself. The most enjoyable part of the job would be my ex co-workers, the benefits, the long hours, the money, and the laughs."
good,"Started working there as billing and data entry part time after 11 months went full time to imaging. Loved working there. Later I did customer service, Receptionist, Driver apprentice, Dock assoc, OS&D "
good,"to many boxes to loud and unloud .. i learn everyday how i can make fast my job, alwyas talk with my managers and supervisor"
good,I have to say I really enjoyed working for this company and the hours on the job was well worth it. There was enough work to last for the day and the workload was always something you could bare. Always given an opportunity to excel within the company. I also like the fact that I was trained on skills like forklifting and other things that I could use to carry on into another job and with me for life. Would of stayed if it wasnt for my sudden relocation.
good,When get to Work area in warehouse I greet my co workers. Set up Scanner and printer equipment. When shift starts check where my assigned work area is. I've learned how to work very well with others. Learned all duties on unload section of warehouse. Have very down to earth managers. Everyone gets along very well with one another. I enjoy Scanning the dock doors more than anything.
good,"fast paced and exciting, great people to work with, would very much like to work for this company again. had to leave cause they didn't have any full time positions open."
good,My typical day was unloading packages from bulk rucks. My co workers are very helpful and friendly. I've learned alot about my physical strength and also mental. The hardest part of the job was the hazardous materials.

good,making 8 sales calls a day. weekly conference calls about goals and new business. Most co-workers were helpful.
good,"One of the best jobs I have ever had. Constant moving, good manager/employee relationships. Everybody knows your name from the head guy over the region to the person working across the warehouse. Great benefits package, health, holiday pay, tuition reimbursement, etc...Amazing work environment. The hardest part of the job was getting your speed up to meet the daily quota. Most of the time there's assistance with lifting, and if a service manager or someone from upper management had to help you, without question they would. The most enjoyable part of the job was when you got off Saturday at about 7am you didn't have to report back to work until about 3am Tuesday morning."
good,"Typical day was highly involved and constant, load and fill shelves with multiple reams of paper, gather orders via, phone, in person and FTP. Produce orders, deliver orders."
good,I worked nights i use to work days all day shifts were closed i have had great experiences being in a leadership role working closely with my mgr and coworkers the hardest part is going from days to nights learning all the new faces and mangers i am glad i still have a job even if it is nights and partime
good,"Work can be physically exhausting and you sometimes feel like you are a cog in a big machine. But if you are tough and hungry, FEDEX is a great place to work! Benefits are outstanding, considering I am part time."
good,- Good work life balance
good,Certain groups have more talent and certain lack in this area. So one could choose to be in areas and gravitate to their strengths and/or have the ability to move into areas that could help grow new skills.
good,This was by far the best place I worked for. They have a very supportive team to help you along as it can be very stressful in the Customs end where I was in. The only downfall was that once you got so far up the ladder it was then like being back in high school and a lot of immaturity going on.
good,"fedex is a very fast paced fun filled enviorment. atypical work day involves loading my truck with packages for designated area, getting started at a reasonable time, and delivering in a fast paced but steady and safe manner, my favorite part of my day is when my truck is empty at the end of the day and able to take my truck home with me. i work with a great team of people who are always there to lend a hand when my truck breaks down or i am falling behind schedule."
good,FedEx Smart Post overall is what I consider a great job with great benefits
good,A typical day at FedEx started with a meeting of all the managers and workers. I would then have a meeting with my manager and co-workers on the dock. I would unload or load semis and help sort when needed. The managers made sure they knew all their employees on a personal level. The hardest part of the job was lifting and fitting the odd and end packages at the end of the night. The best part of working at FedEx was the fast pase and never sitting around doing nothing
good,Laid back work environment with a family like community that provides support and help through out the work day. The most enjoyable part of my job is the time and flexibilty my job provides. Which allows me to attend school and work.

good,The most enjoyable part of my job is seeing the value we add to the daily operations of the company.
good,"My workday at FedEx TechConnect is very interesting, it consists of simulation and scenarios of customers shipping using FedEx services, what I do is test to assure the pricing logic is billing the customers correctly and the customer is getting their correct discounts. In the testing division, I have learned about business requirements, expected results and recognizing and locating defects. The Managers here are mostly project managers due to the fact that they oversee large projects that bring in huge amounts of revenues for FedEx. I love the co-workers with whom I work, because we all work together to complete a common goal which is to satisfy the customers. There are times when we relax by having pot lucks and group gatherings outside FedEx environment. There is no hard part to the job function of testing, it’s just lot to learn due to the many projects assigned to the testing department, but once you learn the basics, you can validate test cases with ease. I enjoy this job because due to FedEx constant international expansion, my knowledge of international shipping and international business rules has been profoundly broaden."

I feel my co-workers are the best I have ever worked with and around. We all enjoy each other's company and have fun while working. The hardest part of the day is when all the managers and above come in the area asking several questions at once while we are still maintaining our operation. I enjoy being able to serve all customers from across the globe since we are an international company.
good,Lot of great people you work with and interact with outside of the company as well.

I worked with approximately 24 people. I processed all the mail, purchase orders and purchase requisitions. Tracked all the invoices and purchase requisitions. Worked closely with our Akron and Hudson OH facilities servicing and assisting their team with their needs. I did record and time keeping for our department employees. I organized weekly, monthly meetings and special events. Management in my department were great. The entire team was great. I never worked with this large of a group where everyone got along which is odd. Everyone was friendly, helpful. This was the best job I ever had. Best group of people I ever worked with. Hardest part was to leave. I was laid off March 2009 because I was a temp and because I was there for 17 months they were audited and were told I had to be let go and bring another temp in.

good,This job is a stable place to work but is very face paced and very stressful some day. You most be able to handle dealing with customers and there request

good,The benefits are great. It is very fast paced. You just get the work done every night and leave. The at and benefits were really worth it. I did not enjoy the others I worked for. They would get upset because I made more than they.

good,Um ótimo lugar pra trabalhar pagamento em dia respeito a os colaboradores oportunidade de crescimento é um bom ambiente
good,It is a great part time if you go to school or have other business to attend to. The pay is decent for the work you do. The people are great. The work itself is a little harsh on the body but keeps you entertained. I would recommend to others.
good,"The work was easy and the pay was good. However, you did have to deal with working in an environment that isn't climate controlled, hot summers, freezing winters. Dock workers got paid well, truck drivers got paid even better. Getting full time on the dock is more difficult than it should be which is why I ultimately left. They need to offer more full time positions instead of hiring 1,000 part time employees."
good,I enjoyed the work place environment management was helpful understanding and reasonable my coworkers were like family and the benefits were decent all in all I would work for them again
good,FedEx offers great benefits and many programs to further education.  There is always an opportunity for career advancement if you choose to apply yourself.  Great culture with a family feel.

good,They expect you to do your job for the great benefits they offer like quarterly raises and paid vacation. I do exactly what they tell me sometime I feel I had gave my all . And that's when It's time to slow down  and not upset anybody. Just remember that the work can be done. And it's people willing to prove that.
good,Professional environment with processes and procedures well laid out. Experience the full life cycle of software development. Involvement in all phases of development from talking to business architects to production support
good,My experience at FedEx was really great. Challenging and stressful at times but overall it was a great job. Its extremely hard labor and unfortunately my body couldn't handle the job anymore.  I had a great salary and amazing benefits for a position that required hardly any experience.  I miss my job at FedEx but I had no choice but to leave.
good,I love it here my manager and associates make it worth being there. The customer are very understanding and once you get the hang of everything its smooth selling.
good,Good and not stressful..Work is very productive. It is a great place to be. The people are friendly. I can get hours if needed to with no serious issues.
good,check delivery board and get the job done friendly place good to learn productivity and physical customer service traffic sometimes was a bummer but all and all a fun job
good,FedEx has a People/Service/Profit culture where it takes all 3 aspects to be successful.  Work/Life balance is looked at and initiated by managers and discussed by upper management.  I was always proud to work for such a great company with a worldwide brand recognition!
good,"It usually started with preventative maintenance on assigned equipment.  If there had been any breakdown of the equipment, I would work on repairs of that equipment. I would order parts that  were needed to operate maintenance and the facility. Then the rest of the day was used to work on more preventative maintenance pf the facility."
good,There are many opportunities for advancement. They have great benefits. They offer many discounts for many places throughout Memphis and tend to give out sport tickets. Overall it's one of the best qualities in Memphis.

good,FedEx fast page high volume place to work. Got to unload airplanes and load up airplanes in a timely manner for 10pm departure. Everyone got along and work as a team.
good,A typical day at work is clock in and you either are stalking boxes to be shipped out putting boxes or a belt to be moved. The hardest part of the job was lifting heavy boxes the right way so you don't injure yourself. The fun part was you are always working with someone and you can freely talk laugh and enjoy your time
good,Excellent location and place to work. Military Friendly environment everyone works together to obtain the completion of the mission requirements and objectives.
good,Convivência entre a equipe e a gerência era ótima!
good,"Great place to work.  Great work environment. Medical insurance, overtime pay, flexible working hours available.  I was allowed to contribute to the overall organization of the company by putting in place an organizational system that allowed me to arrange my work so that I could better sort, scan, store and retrieve packages"
good,It was a good place to work but you have to be ready to sweat every night. unloading the trucks are a lot of work and then it eases with each position.
good,Working with customer service and solving pkg problems everyday making sure we get the pkgs delivered on time every time. working with the delivery drivers making sure they have correct address and working with customer at the counter sending out pkgs or picking up pkgs.
good,Mutual Respect is the cornerstone of this great company...supervisors being overly assertive and disrespectful to drivers is not tolerated.  The CEO and all managers in the entire company flowchart realize drivers are the lifeblood of Fedex being a well respected leader in their industry and treat them with the dignity and respect they've earned to be part of the Fedex team.
good,Relaxed work environment. No strict dress code. Lots of free company memorabilia. Payday every Friday but the checks are usually in on Thursdays. Lots of different personalities and a great company for employing the elderly.
good,fed ex was a lot of lifting so back brace was will needed specially if your working icu which is heavy box movement and unloading had to be done on time so its a fast pace type job
good,It's a lot of work but it's fast paced and makes the time go quickly. It is part time so it's not a lot of hours but it's a pretty good place to work. Great environment good management that rewards their employees for doing great work.
good,Every location is different I am in the Miami area  pay is good just to be part time and you get benefits you not got find to many jobs that give benefits part time.  If you want to move up in FedEx you have to do at least 3 years or more as part time to be able to get a full time position in the Miami area. Unless you transfer to another facility we’re you can get a full time position. You get flight discounts for your travel  you have to to be married for your spouse to fly with you. Kids fly free also it’s on stand by tho!!!!!
good,"The company management is great. People are friendly and helpful. It is a clean and safe working environment, and flexible work hours. I like to work here."
good,"Simple easy great pay. If anyone passes up an opportunity to work at FedEx freight they have made a mistake indeed. Great pay, great benefits, all around solid company to work for."
good,Excellent company committed to their employees. Very good opportunities for promotion or moving around into different areas to learn new skills. Very high job security when you do a good job
good,Different ways on doing things but for the benefit of the employee as well as the effiecentcy to accomidate with the minimum bills per hour requirement.
good,"I wouldn't be the person I am today if it wasn't for everyone involved and no longer involved at FedEx, I've  learned so much about myself and how to be a great person that strives on excellence and I thank everyone that had a hand in helping me along the way!"
good,"It was great working for fedex. But you have to be"
good,"You will encounter the most bizarre, funny, and heartbreaking calls in this job.   It can be stressful around the holidays but there are downtimes.   The hours per week are variable, but i dont think i ever came in under 30."
good,"If you are looking for a company in which you can advance and grow as an employee, then this is the company for you. Paid training gives you all the resources and tools that you need to succeed."
good,"The people here were great and were willing to help teach you to be a better person. The pay was on the lower side, but still it was a great place to work."
good,You need to be in great shape to work here. You start your day unloading planes and trucks and then load all freight in your vans. You route all your own packages. From the minute you get there youre running and youre running all day especially in the morning when you have 40 deliveries to make by 10:30 and you don't leave station until 8:45. But you have to be able to manage your time because you have to do all deliveries and pickup and have to be back to the station by 6:00 in order for plane to leave on time. Once youre back you have to unload all your freight and load up truck and plane too. So you need to be a good multi  tasker and be ready for a long exhausting day.
good,"My supervisor worked with all of us to make sure we understood the work. If there is ever an issue, they come to you directly and calmly. Everyone wants everyone to succeed."
good,Typical day included sorting boxes conveyable and non-conveyable. hardest part was reaching the end goal. Fun part working with others. The work environment was pretty diverse. Management wasn't too bad. as long as you worked they pretty much didn't bother you unless it was the start or end of the shift.

good,This job is a very good job it’s fun fast paced and relaxing a little. I have nothing bad to say just that you don’t get a lot of hours so your check is not mind blowing
good,"It's a great company to work for. They are located all over the world, which makes it possible to transfer and relocate.  FedEx continues to strive to make sustainability possible for its employees"
good,You start your day at around 0600 and unload containers for the next 2 hours. You then have to organize your truck which you are given about 30 minutes to do. You range from 50 to 120 stops on average everyday. Then you leave and deliver your packages.

good,"Great company to be employed by.  I will, however, not be commenting further in this regard, and consider this ""required"" field to be asking a bit too much."
good,Top d heure de travail pour un salaire qui ne suis pas (6h du matin jusqu’à 20h)
good,"management has some miscommunication but you don't have to deal with it."
good,"actually looked foward to going to work every day... great co-workers, and the manager was really very nice... would go out of his way to ensure there was nothing left for questioning about... had many cook-outs when returning from the days work... everyone, mostly, had a smile on their faces... everyone, mostly, got along and got the job done and done right!... if it wasn't for being injured the way i was, i'd still be there today..."
good,"I worked there for 3 years and had a great time working there, good people, good pay, and great benefits. I highly recommend this place if you get the chance to work here."
good,"compañerismo, excelente ambiente de trabajo, buena comunicacion y apoyo de los superiores"
good,Empresa fantástica que proporciona ao funcionário todas as condições para um ótimo crescimento profissional e pessoal

good,The best company which gives best values for its employees and customers. Feel like home. Its very good for aircraft maintenance people. company gives priority to safety of the employees
good,Wants hard just had to stand for a long time. We get paid fairly every week . It used to get very busy with packages on some days . We didn’t get any breaks

good,Working at FedEx was a great experience. It was a cool work environment and I would have no problem working for that company again. The shifts are reasonable and the workload isn't too strenuous.
good,"Worked for FedEx for five years. Pay could've been better, there was a lot of micromanaging but the benefits were great. I would recommend it to anyone"
good,"I enjoyed working at FedEx very much.  My management was extremely compassionate with my personal health problems with constant doctor appointments, sick leave, and allowing flex hours where and when possible.  I appreciated that so much.  I unfortunately had to leave my job with my chronic back pain but I would still be there if not for that.  The only thing I felt somewhat concerned with was some bias I felt against ""Secretary"" employees.  I felt some of the management literally looked down on the Administrative employees and their jobs, almost as if they were not equal and didn't deserve bigger increases in pay.  Believe me, as working in Admin for over 33 years I know that the Secretary positions are very important.  They deserve a little more respect for the work that is expected and the pay that is considered.  Bonuses should be a little more thought out for the lower paid employees."
good,"Worked remotely, constantly learning new methods and applications. Management is very involved and supportive. High volume of calls. Mandatory overtime during Christmas time."

good,"Very structured and organized company.  Their PSP policy is one of the best work policies I have encountered.  They take care of employee and family even after career is done."
good,"I love this job. Fast pace and friendly environment."
good,"Empresa dinâmica, gosta de deixar seus funcionários atualizados de tudo que acontece na empresa por exemplo faz todos os anos uma avaliação com os funcionários sobre as mudanças que acontece na empresa."
good,Rehireable at least...This is a. Plus...I enjoyed. Working here....Cool building...Comradarie and work place fun...Mgmt some timses bboo slow....Must go and see to work..Money is great with ...
good,"Nice and comfortable job environment. Best facilities, no boundation. Fedex is supply chain logistic and best in internatioanl diameters. "
good,The Fedex family is a great hardworking team. Working at fedex gives a person a feeling of achievement and accomplishment. There is no greater feeling than unloading about 30 trucks and getting the job done.
good,i love working for fed ex the pay was great the hours was great my coworkers were amazing the wasn't a day were i didn't want to go to work unless the weather was horrible.
good,"For people who can do physical work, FedEx will be perfect for you. They train you to do everything. The job in general is just a really good place to work at."
good,"Come in around 7 A.M , load up the trucks and scan items in. As a driver you are assigned a helper if you have over 125 stops. Generally work for about 10-12 hours but sometimes the job requires OT. OT is fairly easy to get with no problem or hassle."

good,Very great company to grow into if you want to grow with somebody. I would recommend somebody else applying for it also. It’ll all be worth it in the end of it all.
good,"Basically the typical workday is a screenshot of the FedEx freight whom I worked for due to a merger with National closing. Typical day was fast paced with no time to waist. Supervised over 50 drivers so I learned how to be very diverse when dealing with each employee. Also learned all technology programs which were used daily. Windows, excel, word, and numerous others. The managers at FedEx were great and I would have ran through a wall for the managers I had the luxury of working for which isn't always a common thing with logistics. The hardest part of the job was dealing with so many  personalities while keeping everyone's morale high. Accomplishing your daily and monthly goals while being recognized was the most enjoyable part of the job."
good,"Every day at FedEx was fast paced with minimal time to spare. Time is of the essence literally when you're dealing with parcel and freight deliveries. During my time with FedEx I learned most aspects of managing a successful company while keeping your team happy and being diverse with how you deal with each individual. Also learned hazmat, safety, payroll, forklift, os&d, cheetah, accops, and many computer programs. Culture at FedEx was a no nonsense type of environment where each employee knew what expectations were. Working long hours was the only hard part of the job but that's expected with salary and logistics."
good,"It is amazing part time job. Especially if you are looking for a second and or going to school full time. It also provides health insurance for part time employees , and paid time off."
good,"wonderful career choice."
good,"A typical day at FedEx would be moving packages into trucks, and stacking them inside to fill the entire truck. I learned how to stock semi-trucks. The hardest part of the job is the constant heavy lifting."
good,Great place to  work if it wasn’t for that safety guy from New Orleans i would still be at this job up until today i can’t believe i let a safety guy rush me into an accident me i will never for get that guy they need me to got rid of him
good,"This was probably one of the best jobs I ever had, I would still be working there if I wouldn't of Gotten Laid Off. The people who work there are very good people. The equipment is top of the line, and they do care about safety and do care about your personal needs and take very good care of you.  If I could go back I would, but only God knows what is his plan."
good,"Ótimos lugar para trabalhar,  aprendizado e respeito."
good,Good job and great management team. I had to leave because this was only a winter job delivering stuff for the Christmas holiday. But it was an excellent experience.
good,I check out equipment such as a tug or belt loader. I drive either of the equipments for the night. I operate the loader to the aircraft. I load and offload the material to and from the plane.
good,"Every day of work at Fedex has been a very pleasant experience. In addition to serving clients, they coexist with people who give everything they have to achieve the goals that managers set for their work groups.

good,"Very good company with exceptional benefits and above average pay. This is a very fast paced environment and you have to have a good work ethic to survive. Management is constantly under pressure to improve performance and that trickles downhill and get frustrating. You earn every dime they pay you but there are a lot of opportunities for those who want it. Most likely you will be offered a part-time position which you may have to keep for years before a full time opportunity comes up. Everything is based on seniority and until you get to the 6-10 year mark you are still going to be considered new to the couriers with over 25 years and still on the road. So if you have patience and a goal go for it. If not, take the good hourly rate and exceptional benefits and add it to another part-time job."

Hardest part of the job had to be consistentcy, because you had to unload planes back to back to back."
good,"I enjoyed this job a lot, however I found my management hard to deal with.  They had one view of things and I found company policy to show it should be customer first not bonus for the upper management as important."
good,"FedEx was a very productive and fast place to work at. I had a lot of fun working at FedEx in the beginning but the last couple of years, the company changed. They quit employee appreciation cookouts and it was very hard to get any days off. Overall FedEx is a good company to work for. I do wish they would pay more per hour and give more hours to employees  but FedEx Ground only hires part time package handlers in Wichita,ks"
good,When I joined FedEx it was like a family and everyone looked out for each other and the company. Several years ago many of the VPs and SVPs left and their replacements don't look out for their people the same way. Fortunately the managers and Directors still take care of the personnel. The poeple in the trenches are what makes FedEx work.
good,great place to work. relocated which is why i am leaving company. I am not sure why i need to fill all of this out for advocacy in job seeking and find it inconvenient that Indeed.com requires this.

Out on the road we needed to work as quickly and as safely as possible to meet customer service times. In this line of work I learned that there are many different ways a job can be done and there isn't a wrong way in doing any job. My management team did the best they could to help us with our job and made sure we were working safely on the road and in the warehouse. My co-workers knew how to do their job and have many years of experience to teach new workers about the job and what is expected of a courier driver. The hardest prat about my job was having to cover a delivery route when another worker called in sick. We were expected to do the route with no training on that route.

good,"FedEx Main Hub is an excellent place to work. I did not work in any of the sorting buildings, I was on a team unloading and loading the planes. Most of the positions are part-time, as I do not think they offer anymore full-time positions off the street. The biggest benefit of working there is that you're guaranteed 20hrs pay a week, but if you get on an offload team, you'll get 30-35hrs a week easy, and if you work for FedEx, you get full benefits! Highly recommend working here."
good,Great job but not a lot of hours. Mostly hiring for part time work. Benefits do come with part time so that is a plus. Great people to work with.
good,"I honestly think FedEx is a great place to work.  Shipping and Logistics aren't going anywhere so if you are looking for job stability, this is the place to be."

good,"A typical day at work consists of a motivational speech to promote workplace safety, and then we're sent off to our work areas. There are many departments, the basic two are load and unload which are self explanatory. I've spent most of my time in smalls though which is packages under a certain size and weight that are grouped together for safe shipping. Coworkers are all pretty cool people, everyone has a different story. The hardest part of this job is not having a set schedule, and this is only because of uncertainties like the weather and the amount of packages that will be received in the upcoming week. But its most enjoyable that you won't have to pay for a gym membership because pf the physical aspect of the jobs and you don't get bored because you can always move to different departments for new challenges."

Most people cant handle waking up at 3am every day but you get use to it after a while. The time i have to go to sleep is difficult because this is a parttime for me but it makes me tap out early. I love being able to have extra money to catch up on bills, the benefits are worth it."

I enjoy working with my colleagues for we work well together and thrive on helping one another. We do not enjoy when the trucks are late because that means our numbers may be off if we are unable to make up the time.  I enjoy the fact that one can job search anywhere in the United States, if so desired. Great company to work for."

You actually get promoted by your job knowledge and skill. The co-workers are great people who care about you and will help you thru anything. The hardest part of the job is sometimes working very long hours and working in outdoor conditions on the dock area. My most enjoyable part of the job is the people.
good,"FedEx is a Fortune 10 company that is growing exponentially.  The opportunities to advance are seemingly limitless if you're willing to work hard and incorporate learning in your tasks on a daily basis.  The hardest part of the job is surviving the first 4 weeks as most individuals are not in shape physically or they're not accustomed to the early hours required.  Once acclimated however, the work you do and the camaraderie you'll establish with your peers makes working at FedEx a blast."
good,Very enthusiastic work place where one can learn and then grow in opportunity.  It builds team cohesion and allegiance.

good,A typical day at work is a happy one. All of my customers are rather happy to receive their package. I learned that timing is important and you have to strategize to move at a certain pace. My co-workers were great because we moved as a team and sometimes would have a time set to achieve a certain quota. The challenging part of the job is not knowing what time you'll clock out during the day. It's a challenge because it all depends on how you strategize. The most enjoyable part of the job is interacting with different people.

The culture of the organization created a win-win for the workforce which fostered a FedEx family environment that was very refreshing.  Although the job was very demanding at times, it was also very fulfilling and rewarding for the most part.  The support and leadership was second to none and was very much appreciated.  FedEx did a great job of taking care of me during my tenure there and I as an employee did the same in return 200%."
good,"Em um bom ambiente de trabalho, minha rotina era tranquila, funcionários focados. "
good,"I could come in anytime between 5:00am thru 5:00pm Monday thru Friday, any hours as long as I worked 40 hours a week.  That was great.  It was basically data entry all day and then the last hour I would contact customers that I had billing problems with.

I was able to grasp the code and learned the challenges the previous developer had. The people I worked with were great! We are friends even today. The hardest part of the job was the oracle triggers the were developed. The best pard was when we were told the tool is functioning well and the person i trained was felling good about it
good,Fedex is a hard working job that demands physically labor. I like the fact that I got paid every week and the pay was good.

Throughout my experience while working at FedEx, I learned how to be determined and focused. I appreciate the management team for being patient we someone like me, considering my lack of knowledge about the working industry. They were patient with me and they understood that I'd never been employed since graduating high school. My co-workers had the same attitude and made it fun to work with. The hardest part of the job was maneuvering packages that were in awkward shapes. Either way, I enjoyed my short termed experience with FedEx because the staff made the job easy to understand."

I learn about Flights and air planes and weight and balance and I load the air craft with freight from FedEx.

good,"A typical work day at Fed Ex is working with a team, to unload trucks, and get packages ready for delivery. Rather i'm unloading trucks, scanning packages, or sorting them. I have learned that it actually takes a whole team and everyone working together to get things done. The management there is pretty fair, and understanding.  My co-workers on the other hand are just like family to me. The hardest part of this job is we manually move and lift heavy objects, like tires and big 100+ lbs packages the whole time. The most enjoyable part about it though, is when everyone is working together, and joking at the same time."

Working here helps me work faster and it prevents me from having to go to the gym because everyday is a workout. I am yet to come across a hard part of my job. To me, the job is what you make of it. If a person doesn't like to work then quite naturally the job will be hard for them. This is a fast past job and it's not the job for everyone.

My typical day starts with a smile and greeting my fellow co-workers, I then set upset my work station and head out to the floor to check my trailers for FedEx freight loaded with the proper ""Bill Of Loading"" attached. I learned to manage my time evenly when calling trailers in to the dispatcher. I also learn how to communicate with my co-works to get the job done in an appropriate matter to have all my trailers picked up before midnight. The hardest part of my job is sitting in a chair waiting on freight, i'm so hands on it could get a little frustrating. The most enjoyable part of my job is that i get to lead a group of people through a successful day."
good,Everyday at work is a hot hard working day. I've learned many things from loading trucks and loading vans and many other positions with-in the warehouse.

I learned the importance of being able to do what one says one can do.  If I was unsure I could provide the customer with the resolution the customer wanted, I emphasized that I would try.  Most of my co-workers were excellent at the job, which was very demanding.  Someone who worked often with a certain specialized agent & had come to value that person's work ethic would ask for that particular representative specifically.  The hardest part of the job was learning to use new programs Fedex would buy & introduce, since the techs had problems with the monthly updates to these programs & for the first week after a new download, the computers wouldn't function correctly.  The most enjoyable part of the job was the customers, most of whom appreciated the help we provided."

good,"Every minute count at Fedex, it's a place where I understood the true meaning of Time value money (TVM) concept."
good,"A typical day at work would consist of loading/unloading packages on/off of trucks o be shipped out. I learned alot more about team work at this job, because just about everyday I would have to work with about 2-5 people to get certian task done. The hardest part about this job would be that you get no breaks and the most enjoyable part of the job for me would be constant moving around and always having something to do because I like to stay busy while at work."

good,I would recommend the company to anyone. I have learned to be my on manager. The management staff really step up to the plate. I really enjoy my co-workers.
good,"The typical day at work in FedEx is easier than a typical day in a office job. You can really organize and work at your own pace. Once you get to know your own route, the day would get easier. Also, once your customers get to know you better, they can work to your own benefits by sometimes helping you carry and sign for your packages. Over the years my customers are the reasons why there are less problems in communications prior to any of my deliveries."
good,"Work inside of trailers building walls of boxes for over a year before being asked if I wanted a promotion. The work was very hard and hot during the summer but the people would always help when you needed it, plus you get a fan to help keep things cool.

good,Lots of lifting and sorting boxes and packages
good,"Fed Ex was a great company to work for, especially for the small time working with them. I was a Package Handler, i helped place packages onto a conveyer belt so they can be processed for shipping. I learned to be very quick, and learned to lift items 0-70lbs. This job was very physical but it was also fun. The management was really thoughtful and great, anytime someone needed a break, the managers would come on the line and relieve that person. Items that were to heavy, other co-workers would come and help me carry the item onto the belt carefully. That's when i learned that team work is very important and i feel that it gives you a sense of completeness knowing that if you need help, someone is there to help you complete a difficult task. The hardest part of the job was defiantly lifting bigger boxes and freight. But working with others that love their job surrounding you out weighs the hardest part of the job."

The hardest part of the job with moving the heavier items and making sure that we as a group met the daily deadlines that were given to us."
good,Wake up early at 330am to work. Go in and do some stretches then I would sort boxes to their designated side of the belt. At the end of my shifts I would help other belts distribute their boxes to belts or their trucks as needed.
good,-Typical day: Easy going smooth environment
good,I was responsible for learning multiple routes and delivering packages and letters in a time sensitive environment. FedEx is a very fast paced work environment and drivers are responsible for maximizing there day. I processed outgoing packages and dealt with customers in a professional and courteous manner. I would deliver and pick up 80 to 100 stops in a day. The mangers were good and let responsible drivers do there work.
good,"Hard work, unloading packages from trucks (900 - 1,100 per hour as average). Management was very motivational, the fact is that a lot of energy was wastes from employees in this environment, but it build character at least for me."

good,"I have been through countless jobs, and most of them have horrible management, bad pay, horrible benefits (so much comes out of pay) or Even bad environment. Everything I just said, is the complete opposite at this job. The management 1000% cares about you. They give you PTO and benefits the first day of hire. Benefits are only 6 dollars a week that comes out of your paycheck. The environment is so bubbly and happy, it makes come back everyday. I have no complaints about this job and position. I have never been through a good job before. Great job FedEx."

The hardest part of the job is when the loaders on the other side of the warehouse gets backed up and the belt stops so they can get caught up slows everything down. The most enjoyable part of the job is when its almost time to go home or when things are running to slow and not enough people there that night then we would get sent home so we wouldn't have to work that night.

I was in a position to write and train new material for one of the largest companies on earth (at the time) I was training all the new hires, which was a two week process.  During down time I would work on a team developing new material on new subjects that our society was facing.  We were always forward thinking.  Unfortunately, the economy took a turn for the worse, gas prices skyrocketed and large companies had to cut back everywhere they could.  Unfortunately, that meant 90% of HR across the US was slashed.  That dream job I loved so much was gone in just 11 month.  Not a total loss, I learned so much!"

good,Timing flexible. Easy job for me. People there is friendly and helpful. Manager over there is friendly too. Overall everything is okay for me. But too bad they don’t need people already.
good,"*FedEx does a good job for its Customers."
good,The company is a great place to work I've been there so long and feel that my time and body donot want to work in inclement weather no longer.  So I'm down sizing my position

good,"I have learned to drive a 10"" truck while earning my CDL class B license. Loading ensuring space while also making sure the customer's order was in good hands was kind of challenging. I would say the most challenging tasks about this position would be the quantity amount of deliveries during peak season/ being in all types of weather while delivering. A great thing is while on the route, driving and finding different paths to go come easy to the driver. Overall, a great job to work."

good,A typical day usually started at 3ish Am in the morning. The down side of the position was it was only part-time/seasonal. there was mainly student from the fox valley area working with you and all kinds of individuals that worked there..
good,"A typical day at FedEx is fast pace. I learned how to deal all kinds of people. The management is hands on,workplace culture is good we work as a team. The hardest part about my job is not getting hours.The most enjoyable part of the job is Safety cook outs."
good,"It was an overall good job, just certain things would happen and we would have to stay overtime some nights and mainly on Fridays. The jobs that they have you do is not at all hard it's just the people you have to work with that will make you want to go crazy at all times."

good,"I worked in the customer service call center. As far as call centers go, there really isn't anything better than FedEx.Guaranteed 40 hours per week, with the option to leave without pay if it is slow. Full benefits, great insurance and retirement options. Most of the calls are people looking to track shipments or schedule package pickups, and I'd say you would look at maybe one or two irritable customers per day. Peak season is a nightmare, with mandatory overtime, longer shifts, and non stop calls, but FedEx tries to give little parties and other things to keep morale high. Overall, it's a great job that pays well, and you can move anywhere within the company."
good,FedEx is all about building not within just company but within your self . You can move up pretty quickly well after your 6 months are up . It’s a great company to work for I can say genuinely they are truly for there customers and worker benefits are terrific .Never had a job where all the benefits are on point . 401k is lovely as well .

good,"FedEx provides the opportunity to start in the warehouse and move up quickly in the company depending on determination. This is good because it does not matter how long you are there, but determine your self determination."
good,"productive, stressful but a nice place to work, a lot of discounts, i learned to work under pressure, the management are very human relationship with the employee."
good,This was probably my favorite job of all. It was a fast-paced operation that was extremely time sensitive because we were loading and unloading aircraft that had to make it to the flight line in time to make their departure time.

Then once were done disburst to to start unloading and scanning the packages.Its tough if you try in over work yourself but just make sure to go at a steady pace you can handle for 4 hours."
good,I love my FedEx Hagerstown family it's a great company to work for I came in as a package handler moved up to Tucker and then ended up being a switcher I worked as many hours as I like I made a lot of money and a lot of friends I would work for FedEx again anywhere anytime.

good,FedEx Freight was a place where I grew as a worker. I learned how important it was to deliver the customers orders safe and on time. I learned how to handle heavy freight and fragile freight. We would transport the freight using a forklift therefore I learned how important it was to be careful not to damage anything. FedEx Freight made me a responsible man and it taught me how to work in a fast and safe manner and I also had a great time learning the process of distributing the freight and making the customers happy
good,Check truck was in good running condition load packages into three different trucks. deliver and pick-up packages. I learned to deal with customers problems. Managers were there to help us.

good,"I would show up to work early, ensuring my assigned tractor was there, to do my pre trip inspection.  I ensured everything was in proper working order.  If not, I could go to the shop to get the necessary items fixed.  I would then go to dispatch to get my shipping papers and manifests to check for any hazmat items on either of my trailers.  Made sure all the paperwork was correct for the hazmat items, as well as the placarding.  I would check the weather conditions ahead to see if any alternate routes were needed. I would then go hook up to my trailers, completing my pre trip inspection, before leaving the yard.  I would leave the yard to drive to my meet point, watching the roads, paying attention to the motoring public, ready for any unforeseen incidents along the way. Upon arriving at my meet point, I would complete post trip inspection on my set, and then swap out my trailers with my meet driver, performing my pre trip inspection, checking shipping papers for accuracy. Lunch break would usually be taken at my meet point, before heading back to the terminal. Upon arrival in the yard, I would complete my post trip inspection, and contact dispatch on where to park my trailers. After unhooking, I would fuel my tractor, and turn in my paperwork and driver’s log into dispatch.  I would usually see some coworkers, and chat with them for a few minutes before leaving the yard to go home."
good,FedEx Express has great benefits and a solid work environment. The management knew what they were doing and what everyone else needed to be doing. Both head managers would work on the floor with everyone else when they could. my location had a small workout room that proved useful to me. The hardest part of the job was during peak season. I worked 12 hours straight and then came home and slept only to get up and do it again. six days in a row. but I was good money. I would recommend this job to anyone who wanted to work in a warehouse type environment.
good,FedEx is a great company to work for. Even though you are out there alone there is a very team oriented feeling at the base with other drivers and support staff. My favorite part of the job was the independence of being out on the route with the combination of forming personal relationships with my clients. I highly recommend this company.

good,"A day at FedEx usually started fast with the bulk of the production happening early in my shift. It would wind down in the afternoon with a post sort facility check assigned to me specifically by my team leader or manager. I could rely on my co-workers for help lifting if I needed and vice versa. Strong teamwork was key to a safe, productive day. The most difficulty came with the weather, but I enjoyed the feeling of a long tough day at work."

good,"I come in in the morning, clock in and have some time to get myself set up while the package handlers come in (they are union employees so they all come in at the same time) and start their jobs, which is what lets me do my job. when I start, my whole job is scanning boxes and putting them in the truck with their proper sequence number, and in proper order in the truck, low to high and separated odds on one side, even on the other. I do that three hours a day, five days a week and the only downside is I'm usually there 4 a.m. every morning. other than that my managers are great, we get to joke around while we have small moments of down time, i work for my cousin which is great and all the guys i work with are all hard workers and we all get time to joke with one another while working. and the best part is every now and again, my boss goes out and gets breakfast for the guys (usually consisting of a sandwich or wrap from either quick chek or wawa). There are only a few other guys who work in our little bay and we all get two trucks and i split a third with another guy every now and again, and overall its a great job"

good,This job is very fast paced. The management is very understanding and easy to be around including the co workers. This company gives you opportunities to move up and do other things.

That shows the maturity of the job and the people who run it"

good,Every manager started from package handler so it made them more humble. The hardest part of the job was the actual work; loading trailers. My co-workers were very helpful and if i needed help all i had to do was ask. Sometimes i wouldn't even have to ask. I would have loved to stay at this job but my body couldn't handle the stress.

good,There is only part time work (maybe will have full time). I learned to know exactly zip code in each states (first three digit but sometimes full 5 digits). There is good management. There is good and friendly co-workers. This is not hardest part of job for me. I have been enjoy is keep me busy.
good,"Great benefits for those that stay long enough to receive them. Benefits however don't start until after so many hours of employment. For some this takes too long, simply because you start as part time working 4 to 5 hours each day. "
good,"The work hours take some getting used to as package handlers can be up as early as 2 am. During peak time, the holidays, you'll find plenty of hours available. Don't rely on this as a full-time job opportunity as the grand majority of positions are part-time. Management tends to be solid and have typically worked their way up from the bottom."
good,Loved working at FedEx.  Great Managment and Great people.  excellent opportunuties
good,"Once , I arrival to my job site,I come in print off a yard audit  go outside do inventory on my yard. See what I have and don't have for the day. Then I come in from my yard audit, I set the volume for the day to see how much we can ship and run for the day."

good,FedEx was operating a daily basis of company trucks that would bring packages to the hub to be unloaded scanned with labels one each individual package. Ive improved on mult-task with different I also adopted the safety policy and incorporated each policy on my daily responsibilities. I've had really fun hard working co-workers everyone worke as a team which made the tasks easy to perform. The hardest thing about FedEx was there were heavy equioment that they did not discriminate against that I had to lift from one place to another. The most enjoyable part of the job was the food they would provide for the employers and also rewards.
good,I love the atmosphere and the people who work with me. I believe that this company will be suitable for any one ready to show ambition. It take dedication to do this job and from my standpoint. That's exactly what I have.

good,"A typical day of work included overseeing a small group of loaders to ensure safe lifting and loading procedures were being followed to ensure max efficiency and max safety and manually sorting around 6000 packages in a 4 hour time. Management and co-workers were all amazing as in order to get the job done, the group needs to work together. The hardest part of the job was memorizing zip codes to efficiently sort the packages to the correct trailer the first time so that the loaders could efficiently do their job without having to walk out of the trailers to place the package on the ground. The most enjoyable part of the job was testing myself and trying to get less ""mess-ups"" than the previous day."
good,"Disciplined"
good,"The job is a lot of fun, I was able to see a lot of America.  The hardest part of the job was being away from my family, one to  two months at a time.  Other than that it is a great company  to work for."
good,This was a work out while getting paid! Management never knew what was going on but if you work the job gets done without them.
good,I have been with FedEx for nine years and in those years I have been allowed the time and opportunity to grow within the company.
good,Vast multi-tasking skills had to be utilized. A friendly but very productive atmosphere.
good,A great company that invests in their employees. Great management and work atmosphere.
good,great new career move; could not ask for a better transition
good,"Really enjoyed my time there.  Great benefits and pay, only problem was getting full time."
good,"Sorting packages"
good,"I worked at FedEx for almost 10 years. When I started in 1998 FedEx was the place to work in Memphis. I worked in just about every area in the Memphis World Hub that you can imagine. I work in the secondary sorting boxes, I worked on an outbound flights, I worked in trucks, and I offloaded airplanes. I even de-iced airplanes during the winter. I was also FAA trained on just about every piece of equipment that FedEx owned. They most enjoyable part about this job is the friendships that were made while at work because depending on where you work sometimes you saw your co-workers more then you saw your own family. The hardest part about working at the Hub is the toll it takes on your body because you are working raining or shine. It could be 105 degrees or 35 degrees and raining and you are still work. Your body eventually tells you you have throw your last box and pulled your last can."

good,"Since my job consist of communicating with external and internal customer daily, I have to be able to think clearly, make quick and precise decision and meet deadline.  A typical day at my work is being able to be energetic, being challenged while maintaining a positive attitude.   The management team is not hands on, they allow and give employees the tools they need to make decision that are good for the customer and are in the best interest of the company.  The hardest part of the day would be to ensure that time lines are meet and that the outcome is one that puts the company in a positive light.  The most enjoyable part of my job is when I know that I have made a satisfied customer."
good,"Run driver routes and prepare make address correction to mislabeled packages. Some times there can be over 200 corrections to make before the sort crew come in to work.

The managers were really great. Always had open door police, i could always bring any discomfort or any issues i had on the table and they will always look for a solution to any of my concerns. The hardest part of the job was to understand and to pleased every single individual, but i managed to do that just fine as i am an easy going person. The most enjoyable part was when we all sat in any of our manager office just to hang out and get to know each other, share our good days and bad days."

My me and co-workers always work together to keep our area clean and to keep the trucks well organized. The hardest part of the job is lifting 100+ pound package. The most enjoyable part of the job is getting free breakfast from time to time and getting gifts for hardworking."
good,"Working with FedEx was a great job. I did full-time for 2 months during their peak season (thanksgiving through Christmas) and was paid an average $350 in the span of a week.

good,Working at FedEx has been a pleasant opportunity for me as a young man.
good,-show up
good,"this place was organized and actually my favorite job i have had, it was fast paced, almost no confrontation and if there was it was handled accordingly, you meet people with widely different backgrounds, the communication was great, if i needed help others were able to help me and vice versa, if there was a problem at all it was dealt with in an orderly fashion, the managers were friendly and showed in their performance that they deserved their position the hardest part was identifying problems and the best part was the group effort to get the job done"
good,"I worked steadily on tasks and projects. Typically loved my team. We backed each other up any time needed.Meeting deadlines was sometimes tough when there were obstacles but working with a group who were teamplayers made us all successful. Not only did I learn about managing and leading project management teams, but I learned to balance work and personal life too. I've worked at FedEx for nearly 31 years; so FedEx is family to me."
good,"FedEx was a busy and somewhat stressful work environment -- all about the deadlines. I started as a receptionist, then moved up to secretary fairly quickly. I was able to move up to operations manager three years later, which is not the norm for FedEx. You very seldom see secretaries go into management. The compensation was good -- but the benefits were the key for the part-time employees. They had full benefits even if they only worked 3-4 hours a day. With an operation that big, there will always be employee issues, but I always got along well with my co-workers. There were some upper management who operated from a power-trip method of leadership, but mostly the managers were good people who were just trying to make sure the job got done on time and correctly. Overall, it was a wonderful place to work and provided me with great opportunities to advance. The hardest part of being a manager was having to discipline employees. My favorite part was getting to know so many different personalities and getting to recognize them for their efforts."
good,every person came in contact with from hub supervisors on down to fellow co-workers were amazing!!! i didnt consider any of my job hard nor stressful..loved the interaction with every1 throughout the course of the shift that i loved the most...
good,"My years at FedEx were very good. Although the job was very challenging, the compensation was excellent.

This company actually cares for their employees daily. 2 x 50 cent raises within one year, benefits are great, employees are always happy and stress free when they don't need to be. Lots of different types of jobs from csr to pilot. Management helps you succeed always. Love it. Only problem is that everyone loves their job so much nobody quits!

The hardest job that I have obtained was a entry level manager here at FedEx and what I enjoyed the most was positively effecting my people as we solved every issue as a team."

If there's a problem or if they need help I'm always there to lend a helping hand. My goal is to one day have a higher position but for now I'm just trying to learn what I can.
good,"One of my first jobs, by far one of the best jobs I've had. The only downside is that it is not full time and only part time jobs . Great benefits for being part time."
good,"I usually unloaded trucks and loaded/unloaded heavy packages on and off ""tugger"" carts. Out of any job, this one has taught me the most about team work and communication. I also learned a lot of about time management, proper dieting, and exercise. My managers were very team oriented, and cared about their employees concerns and also rewarded hard workers. I myself received employee of the month twice. My co-workers were collectively active in communication and team work. The hardest part of the job would be lifting the heavier packages that ranged from 100-150 LBS. The most enjoyable part of this job is the culture and employee benefits."

good,"I enjoyed working with Fedex Trade Networks. It offers great benefits - health, 401K and pension plans. With FTN, I learned how to use tariff numbers in classifying shipments that are coming in the U.S. from other countries. Always learning something new all the time but it's easy because management and co-workers are always supportive and helpful. It was a privilege to be able to work and be a part of a worldwide freight forwarding company like FTN."
