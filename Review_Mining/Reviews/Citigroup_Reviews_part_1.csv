rating,review
bad,"Management will claim that they care for you, but it is all nonsense. Directors behave like they own the staff and pay for their salaries. No transparencies in career progression. Never join this place."
bad,Unrealistic expectations. Except you to do the job of 5 departments for less pay.  Systems never work there are always system issues clocking and a lot of other issues. Underpaid
bad,"Workplace Culture was not innovated. Supervisor lied on a regular bases. "
bad,No reasonable pay. Company stuck in the 90's. They collect on Sundays. Scumbags. No advancements. Stay away from this company. Onsite cafe is nice but no arms found throughout San Antonio. Stressful work environment.
bad,Account services operation/ unit is a joke.That department has the most turnover you will ever see in any organization. Do not I repeat work for that company or dept.The men in that dept is sexist. The new director is horrible he thinks he is making changes but in actuality he is running the dept straight to the ground. The new systems are so DATED everything is manual.
bad,"pay is horrible, management only thinks of themselves, you are scolded and treated like children if you do something wrong .   hours are horrible. they just don't care."
bad,"Pretty much everything is improvised.  No training whatsoever.  Things have to be figured out on the fly.  Hitting shots in the dark.  Throwing spaghetti at the wall.  These are some of the ""techniques"" employed at Citi.  Worst experience EVER is 25+ years."
bad,"Review contracts, use data systems for the appropriate client to analyze verify and enter."
bad,This was the first time I worked in an environment where I felt the racism. The lack of unprofessional behavior was stifling. The disrespect from management down to associates.
bad,poor management. poor direction as to career progression..  Constant layoffs and restructuring.  Most jobs being moved to lower cost cities down south.
bad,"I had high hopes in the beginning, then you start talking to the customers, they start cussing you out and berating you. You find out you have very little support from managers. Reps are a dime a dozen at Citi, you can be replaced in an instant, and no one would care. It was a miserable existence while there."
bad,"I processed 3 reports and reviewed them daily with SVP and VP.  The SVP and VP had no clear instruction, did not have guidance, constantly berated employees.  The SVP was so horrible 6 employees left the company after being yelled at, under minded, sabotaged, and degraded. Then the SVP met with upper management to orchestrate the firing of a manager that was following protocols. This department was responsible for ISDA agreements and is a very toxic work environment."
bad,This place only cares about themselves and their money.  They cut our pay just so the CEO could get a big raise.  You only advance if you are friends with the right people. One base agent gets to do whatever he wants with no punishment because his mom is a Vice President here.  They fire people for missing 1 day over their sick time and they only give you 48 hours for the full year. And if you work 10 hours that's only a little more than 4 days
bad,"No room for growth. So much politics in the work place, and very very incompetent managers. I was not too thrill with the work and people and managers. I would not recommend CITI to anyone."
bad,Good company to work for your skills and ability can take you to thenext level within the company if you build inside relationships is even better opportunities increase
bad,Very hard to get ahead in this company. They constantly hire in from the outside less experienced people that you end up training for positions above you.
bad,"A toxic workplace with no regard for human lives."
bad,"This place is not for a person that wants to be treated fairly. The pay is horrible  And you are lucky to receive a 5 cent raise a year, unless you are someone important. Do not apply his place!  No matter how long I tried ( for 12 years) i never ONCE was able to learn what i wanted to excel and move up in."
bad,quantity of calls coming in was not balanced with the quantity of people on one team. not really a chance for advancement. the supervisors let power get to their heads and micro manage
bad,Their managers are inexperienced and don't do their jobs. Atmosphere is stressful and they don't take responsibility for anything. Change policy's daily with no communication to employees. They mess your paychecks up and don't want to pay you for your compensation. Your not moving up in the company unless you know someone or are doing certain favors.
bad,The job was very stressful.  The managers were very rude. Training wasn't good. They didn't want to work with you on your schedule and Citi workplace had too much drama
bad,"Just don't do it, as easy as the job is, you'll never be GOOD enough to work there full time. Great workers are there, but they are not trying to hire any permanent people."
bad,Empty promises. They bring you in and make you do whatever they ask with ridiculous expectations. They do not care about losing you because they have other people to fill your role.
bad,Lack of support from leadership. No work life balance. It’s all about their money and not caring how employees are feeling. Very very poor leadership and discrimination and Racism from management.
bad,"This place used to be good and fairly decent. The company has went down as well as it's stock price. The bigger a corporation get, the less they care about their employees."
bad,I worked with an employee that was crazy. And I mean like screaming in the office throw things at you when she was in a mood level crazy and they wouldn’t do anything about her because her sales were really good. Went as far as going to HR as my manager was scared of her and the district manager didn’t care because her sales were so good. Still nothing. I left and they went through multiple people after me until she was finally let go.
bad,"Disgustingly penny pinching organization that has a high turnover rate, especially with NEW employees."
bad,Even though I was tied at our site for 10 out 10 for customers surveys and constantly would get no less than 10 EVERY month!! I was let go due to a complaint!!!! One complaint because I misunderstood what the customer was saying. Also was told we were NEVER tell we could transfer to our sup unless they specifically as for a supervisor!! Had 1 sup that was rude and refused to take sup callsbecause he wantes to watch movies on his vompiter
bad,Management was more like a dictatorship where it was their way or the unemployment line. Complaints to HR were not taken seriously either and management was able to continue harassing and bullying employees. If you even got a raise it was minimal and the only way to get promoted is if you kiss up to the right person.
bad,"nothing to say, a lot of work, you must know  some one there to get promoted, lack of ethic, most  of the people there that get promoted lack of knowledge"
bad,Citi Lockbox is definitely not an ideal place to work.  If management likes you then you good if they don't like you are doom.  Its too much micromanaging.  Its like you are in prison.  I wouldn't recommend it no one.  Not a good place to work.
bad,The worst HR position I’ve ever had. Poor management that had no clue what they were doing or how to even begin coaching and developing employees. Extremely long hours and if you even thought about leaving early you were looked at like you were doing something wrong. Very poor work life balance and flexibility. No mentor or anyone to guide you along in your career.  A lot of turnover... you will always see positions posted. Generalists are under constant stress with very heavy workloads. Don’t say you weren’t warned!
bad,They are very bad at hiding favoritism. Its not what you know Its who you know Would not  recommend. The work culture is unbearable. No support from management.
bad,Management ONLY cares about exceeding goals and metrics.  The senior leadership team implements constant changes for improvement but fails to teach or train managers on them.  Then they are held accountable for goals and metrics not being met.  How can a company hold any agent or manager responsible for something they have not been educated or trained upon?
bad,"This portion of the bank was troubled, and I believe it no longer exists. I was brought in to help fix it. However, the SEC had other plans. The stress of trying to fix the bank was rather large."
bad,"I do not feel they are customer focused as they used to be. This company use to be a great place to work for, and while I will always appreciate having a job, they use to treat their employees better."
bad,"The supervisor treated me unfairly based on ethnicity.  Inappropriate jokes, too many insults and asked inappropriate questions about child care arrangements."
bad,The job and the role itself give you the experience and exposure to move onto a much better role and work environment. or if you want to be micro-managed in a very patronising way this may just be the right place for you
bad,"Citi overall is not a good work environment. My division actually started as AT&T Universal Card, which was a wonderful place to work. Once it was acquired, everything went downhill pretty rapidly. Everything became stressful and demanding. Commercial Cards particularly was awful, and I was unfairly targeted and I believe deliberately included in downsizing due to an error by one of my client companies."
bad,This is very frustrating as I never worked for Citi. I worked for the Copeland Company as their nationwide Inventory manager. I was laid off very suddenly with no notice.
bad,"If you are African-American and looking for upward mobility within a job position, Citi is not the place for you. There is a small handful, and I do mean ""small"" handful of African-Americans in leadership positions, despite the many qualified candidates within the company. There is also a distinct difference in the ways in which certain ethnic groups are managed in comparison to others."
bad,"Not suitable for single women."
bad,This job was by far the worst job I ever had in my life ever  Walmart was by far and even convergys I hated this job from training to the day I quit .!
bad,Toxic culture.  Anyone who lasts more than 5 years is a true survivor and would be a top performer nearly anywhere else. Employees are of the lowest priority.
bad,"Toxic work environment, no work life balance, hard to get time off, very few good managers,  some leaders, lots of managers unqualified to do their job"
bad,The company doesn't value you as an employee. They will take advantage of you and management is all about favoritism and only allow promotions for people they like.
bad,For the amount of stress and the amount of your time that you invest this company could do better at paying a living wage to the employee. It is a stressful job.
bad,Management does not care about employees.  It took me 15 years to make what I make at my current job after just one. I only stayed because it was convenient.  They get rid of people all the time.  They tell you your job is safe only to come along 6 months later and say goodbye.  Then they drag out that process. All these people talking about how great it is are lying.
bad,"To begin with, they schedule you for 10 days of “training” which consists of an actual 6.5 days of someone reading their “procedures” aloud. In reality it was all theory. Nowhere in those pages were there actual procedures such that any part of the job could be reasonably be completed without assistance with a modicum of confidence that it might be correct. And your go-to people (team leads and seniors) know less than you do and are unprofessional, rude and attacking in a sad and blatant attempt to hide that lack of knowledge. Even worse is the fact that less than 50% of the work you complete will be counted when calculating metrics, so unless you’re not really doing the job correctly and simply rushing through to make the numbers, be prepared to be let go. And you’ll have to commute in and do the research yourself to find that out (not only humiliating but frustrating since you’ve been locked out of all systems). But the leads and seniors will know nothing (yet they see and have input regarding the metrics!). They merely hand you a number to call and cravenly walk away.  Oh yes, and you won’t get paid for that time either so don’t put too much effort into it. I stupidly wasted an hour because I expected management to have the integrity to notify my agency as their contract requires. "
bad,"It was good at first when you start working, and you start training. Later on you just one percent to the company. They really don't care much for their employers and would hired some one else with less experience and paid them dirt cheap. Over all their management was out dated, and did not feel like they wanted me to advance in the company."
bad,"I feel Citibank is not a great place to work for for the following key reasons:"
bad,This culture was only about the bottom line.  If you do not care about being treated like a number than Citi is the place for you.  Banking is only about the bottom line.
bad,Citigroup was a job full of opportunities and room to grow and advance. I worked for Citigroup for over thirteen years until my Department was downsized and jobs sent out of New York
bad,"Failing, overbloated company. Unprofitable, cost-cutting rampant. Talentless and unmotivated employees. No vision or structure. Ethics are non-existent. Politics over merits. Unfathomably high turnover."
bad,Working with the company can be stressful. However their mission is in line with the consumer. Environment is friendly depending on the office. Should be better managed from home head quarters.
bad,I hated working here.  It was too stressful.  Management was always threatening to fire you and the communication with changes in policy was never communicated clearly.
bad,They are so bad . I have been here for 5 years and they treat everyone different which is not right. Some department for customer service are a total FRAUD. They don’t care about employees.  Ops manager is a horrible person and only cares about money
bad,This job was a seasonal job for me. I didn't enjoy this job that much. I really don't have anything good to say about this job at all. I worked during 2nd shift.
bad,"They hire mostly through staffing agencies and provide very little realistic room for growth. My experience was terrible at this job, but it might not be like that for you. The facilities are very nice. Everything else was just a dead end road."
bad,"I did not like working here.  The local maangers had WAY too much power, and there was a huge disconnect between HR and local management.  Collections was all about how much you were pulling in and quickly became way too hostile."
bad,My biggest concern for citi was the lack of actual development from training to the productive floor. I would only get spoken to by leadership when i was in trouble.
bad,"The associates at EVERY BRANCH are unhappy due to the lack of ""real support"" and transparency by upper management who tends to hide somewhere in space playing Bridge with Marvin the Martian."
bad,"Management Is awful!!!  I was in Billing disputes. People ALWAYS call and yell at you about money THEY spent. You have to write down what you’re doing every second of the day. (Seriously, you get up to potty or get a drink you have to write down when you leave and return. Same for breaks.)"
bad,Stay away from this company unless you like being micromanaged and put in stressful situations.  Management concerned more with numbers than employee well being.
bad,Life like cut outs where provided as incentives??? My manager was a very unapproachable person. Meetings held in the tiny L shaped lunch room was an experience.
bad,"Fired because I was following policy.  My manager didnt like me obeying the rules that I was told to go by.  He gave me a warning, I did the same thing a couple months later, and got fired."
bad,The management was the worse the company as a whole was so unorganized. They also are on fixed hours and when you request vacation depending on the dept you can't even go because you most likely will not get approved.
bad,I held various positions at Citigroup from new hire customer service to intern help desk to Sr Technical Support Analyst . Citigroup is a company where you can move upwards. They believe in lots of training and refresher training. Quality customer service was their number one core responsibilities to their internal and external customers.
bad,"LEft company in may 2018 working ten days  ask to leave early but never provide salary in lieu for the remainder of the notice period."
bad,"For a multi billion company, the company was frugal with pay increase. The company took away referral bonuses, incentives, and promotions. the job was so mundane."
bad,The location in O'Fallon MO is a warehouse location housing closed documents of loans. The primary purpose of the job is to track incoming documents and file them accordingly. Zero structure and very poor management.
bad,I would not recommend working here they are outright prejudice.  People of color hide behind their computers and the folks in the office give orders via email but when you ask for a face to face they are MIA.
bad,I think my time here was good time. But I also didn’t gain a lot of knowledge. I wish citi bank offered more. They demanded a lot but constantly cut us of our hours
bad,"talks a lot about their transformation and helping employees be their best. I'm pleased to see that they are really making an effort. From their focus on work/life balance and compensation, to their brand new workspaces - i couldn't be happier working here."
bad,staff and employees are rude. so much stress from the company itself. then the employees are awful. one could hope for a better work place there. that remains
bad,This was not a great place to work.  You were given a 9:00 ending time in the middle of the day which will not work if you have small children or are responsible to take care of loved ones
bad,"No change of being hired or advancing in IT, Unless you are a female  Indian. They've outsource all jobs so the executives can get bigger bonuses.  Almost no documentation because people don't want to make it easier to lose their jobs. :("
bad,"I did not work there long enough to make an actually review of this company"
bad,Its not a good place to work. A lot of favortism and unnecessary management. They don't pay you enough to deal with rude customers calling about money that isn't theirs. Waste of time. Don't do it.
bad,"Citibank pays well, but due to many AML violations, they have a very slow and tedious process to get things done, with the reduction of FTE and the rise of violations you can easily get caught up in a stressful environment. The leaders I worked with had absolutely no idea how to manage people or establish a healthy culture. The worst job I ever had!"
bad,Not an employer I would recommend to anyone.  They do not promote within.  Salaries are low and benefits are minimal.  They prefer to use contracting agencies.
bad,Toxic environment.  Leadership is not nearly familiar with customer service principles or talent development.  Leads and manages employees through use of fear tactics.
bad,Citi is a joke. Management is a joke. You only get a better position if you know a senior management and you buddies with them. If you are a woman forget it this place is not for you. I have two degrees working on master and a I speak three languages and my skills are worthless at Citi.  Most people stay because Citi if the highlight of their life. If you have more than a half of brain RUN ! horrible pay by the way.
bad,Morale in most functions is very low. There is little opportunity for advancement and the benefits are not comparable to peers. It is a sad a depressing place to work.
bad,Any person wanting a job should stay away from this company as much as possible. The immediate management is usually pretty good however any manager in charge of a department or floor is always real hard to deal with. This business is here only to make money and they will run over or ruin anyone in there way to that goal of success.
bad,There are no words to describe the years I had spent working for this company. It broke me as a human being and forced me down a road of depression that had me taking an absurd amount of anti-depressant/anxiety medications in order cope.
bad,"i heard citi bank is nice bank and frirendly teller , and i want an office hours duty and the management is good and the the co workers is friendly.And im really willing to be trainee in your company"
bad,"Low Paid, Overworked, and treat employees bad. They have awful hours and they do not care about their employees. I am currently living in poverty and I have been there for 9 years."
bad,First job and as a part time worker. inflexible team and manager. boring team and long working hours. Pay no good. not willing to give opportunity to junior entry.
bad,"Management was not very fair to everyone, treatment wise. I didn't feel that the work place was a self work environment. That is the most important to me"
bad,"At Citi you have to stay with a position for one year before you are able to advance, I did not like the job but I do love what I learned.  Make sure that you negotiate the salary and not just accept what's being offered."
bad,"Very cheap compant to work for. They love to outsorce which is not good for the company business. Thery do not care for their employees who havew worked for them fo 30 years,"
bad,This is the worst company to work for. They treat their employees poorly and most employees need government assistance even though the company is a billion dollar industry. Zero professionalism and an embarrassment to our country for immigrants looking to bank.
bad,Not a very good place to work.. Very unprofessional.  The people you work with are not professionally trained.  I would not recommend this job to any one.
bad,"I hated working here!!! No culture, no job security, and they are not flexible. The company is very unorganized. It's not a good environment to work in if you want to grow and develop in your career. Also, it's 2018 why don't you have a work from home program??"
bad,A typical day is micromanaged you must document everytime you leave your computer down to the minute. The turnover rate is high there is always intervewing and hiring year round. Promotions arent given on merit but personality and in order to recieve a raise you must apply instead of it being based off performance.
bad,"Didn't like the job, just wanted to much from the workers, but didn't offer much money. Didn't care about work/life balance. Not a good place to work. They need to change."
bad,Estuve 1 mes pero me enseñaron mucho a cambiar la manera de decir las cosas y de como actuar frente a conflictos de intereses.
bad,Stressful. Overly strict quality standards. Very small margin of error allowed. Low level of professionalism. Unfair compensation. Unbalanced work load.
bad,The managers need diversity training there is a lot of racial tensions due to the lack of diversity more class on empathy less on cruel intentions rac
bad,Hiring process is flawed. Planning is poor. Too many politics. Stay away. Stagnant work place. Bad commute as well. They have a shuttle service though.
bad,Good company to work for family oriented cares about their workers. The campus is very nice and have a gym available where everyone can workout and stay in shape.
bad,call center just answering phones. must have thick skin to work for them.. must like to talk on phones you are on the phone for 10 plus hours a day...
bad,"They pay very low salaries and they dont increase on a yearly basis, it is very political environment and very little to learn, you will  never get boss"
bad,"Grateful for opportunity "
bad,company culture is horrible.  staffing turnover is 100%. Bank obsessed with widget account openings.  Must achieve 130% to goal or you are a failure. terrible place to work
bad,The company should handle things better and in a timely manner they also let anyone work for the company without fully checking backgrounds until halfway through training
bad,During y time at Citi bank i was poorly trained and never received all of my training before they put me on the floor. Once i made it to the floor everything was very stressful due to my lack of training i rarely knew answers to customers questions and hardly knew how to use the system.
bad,"too many unqualified peoples, anyone can get a job and can easily get growth if he or she has a good reference inside Citi otherwise either you will not be hired or you will be kicked out through a layoff or some other way"
bad,"Worked there for 9 years, they called me on the phone to lay me off. When I went in to pickup my things, they did not even say good luck, after 9 years they even denied my severance pay. You are just a number, not a human."
bad,Burned every bridge on the way out and don’t care. Was hired into a marketing posiuand then job description was “revised” prior to my signing on and starting the job. Reviews are a joke- only one person in a department of 50+ can receive a top score and multiple will receive the bottom score. All review scores are broadcast within the department. Existing employees do not want to assist new hires for fear that new hires willl receive a higher rating at review time.
bad,Nothing to say in regards to citi bank. Disliked the negative work environment. Always seemed there was drama everywhere you turned your head. No room for advancement
bad,"I left high paying job for inflated promised sales commissions position. The base pay is barely above minimum wage. You must work 50-60 hours per week to make the managers happy. Managers are only concerned with numbers, complaints and compliance. To make commission each month you must close enough loans, other wise you get zero commission for the sale. Then when you do get commission it is pennies compared to what most loan officers make. Managers stressed that all sales reps make 6 digits, when only 2 make over 100K. Those work 6 days a week 10-12 hours a day. Beware, the managers do not tell you what your commission is until after you finish training. The technology doesn't work correctly, the call screeners from the Philippines, processors who don't do their job and constant number expectations makes this job unbearable. You need to get 10 applications. Just to get 1-2 to close. There is no consistancy between the processors and under writers. They are constantly changing providers. Every call is monitored and your audited all the time. Sell, sell, sell and you can have a cracker."
bad,"Only a job company,not a good company to work for."
bad,not a good work place always wanted to push all employee around and doesn't appreciate employee. I will not return back why it not a good environment place.
bad,Not good culture; not advancement and the management does not have skills to manage people or promote the culture.  HSBC was great and diversified and well rounded.
bad,They only hired or promoted from within.Poor training atmosphere. No true room for advancement.The wages were around $10.00 per hour The shift was a long standing shift
bad,Very slow paced work environment. Very little growth within the company.  Good place to start and learn banking experience. Great people to work with.
bad,Citi group was a very fast paced environment with shady upper management and a lack of initiative. Citi is very reactive to things and it is apparent.
bad,"Worked as a teller but pushed us to sell their products. Annoying to us the tellers and to customers. Worst environment. Slighest mistake, the employee is fired. No opportunities to grow. Lot of people have their same positions for decades"
bad,Division was in the process of being sold. Management changed everything from the bonus amount and structure to the number of weekends required each month. Hours also included days and nights every week making work-life balance difficult.
bad,"People are paid too little to get yelled at for too many hours. You will take in 80-100 phone calls a day, and you sit there getting yelled at. They aren't flexible on breaks, lunches, or time off."
bad,"This leads to garbage lead generation and inefficient processes"" "
bad,"It was a first job and more as a learning stage."
bad,"I stared from the ground at this company.  I basically created the entire contract underwriting process to have managers go behind my back without noting anything they had approved, had to move desks 10+ times, then give up my SME knowledge to someone else who was not a manager and had no idea of any of the process.  I was then laid off with 50 other people."
bad,"The management is not organized. They don't have a consistent requirement and things are always changing and it does not benefit the company,customer or the employee."
bad,"I was fired for something that occurred outside of work. Had nothing to do with the company, did not have their logo, uniform, and did not happen on any of their equipment. F that place."
bad,"It has been a long time since I worked at Citi. Things may have changed, but there was a lot of pressure on the phone associates to make sells and I feel that customer service was an after thought."
bad,"The company is a revolving door if you work within the call center. The pay is bad, most of the hours are terrible, and you'll quickly lose the motivation to work."
bad,It is out dated and lacks training for it employees. Departments are never on the same page which cause a bad experiences for client. Sales goals are very high and based on your salary so never expect to get a rise.
bad,100 plus calls a day.90% were angry abusive calls. Managers were bully's. Security guards thought they were real police officers. Low pay. Not worth it.
bad,It takes a while to move up in the company. It all about who you know in the company. They job is very repetitive and unorganized. it is very hard to grow in this company
bad,This was the worst job I ever had throughout my life. The Management didn't care about we never worked decent hours and there was always a problem to make everyone get off early
bad,"Worst work life balance.No work life balance. Too much of bossizm. Due to the same, attrition rate is too high. Higher managment not doing anything to improve the work culture. Top most management is good. But middle layer managers are worst."
bad,* different cases of discrimination against my unit manager. HR refused to contact me. Job was threatened with termination many times for other call center reps violating policy. Tried to resolve with manager. She took a phone call from son and waived me away instead of handling situation.
bad,To much unprofessional people very dysfunctional manger does not know how to control his employees. Work place is clean . I would not recommend anyone to work here.
bad,was a call center but is closed down now was a great place to work while there when I first started worked for Sears but then citi bank took over the sears credit cards.
bad,"Management and HR treat lower level employees poorly. There are officers and non-officers. If you are a non-officer you are treated like scum basically. It does not matter your IQ or education, people move up by brown nosing. It's all politics. If you complain to HR about ethics HR will side with the manager and not the employee."
bad,No work-life balance. Clueless management. Pay and benefits are not competitive. They are not honest. Avoid this place unless you are desperate and have no other options.
bad,but still. second tier employees all around - all hiding info from each other. all doing double and triple work but working in silo.  everyone working to undercut the person next to them
bad,"Citibank has major issues.  Please don't even waste your time working for this company.  As an experienced banker for many years, I can tell you this bank has extreme system issue, personnel issues, and support issues.  The moral at Citibank is extremely low, and people are quitting and dropping like flies.  They promise high bonuses in sales, but you do not have the support from the systems, or management to make your hurdles. Citibank markets itself as a digital bank, however, it is anything but.  Poor customer service, and support, sales campaigns that are falsely promoted to the customers, it is not a good situation to be put in the middle of.  The first thing you should always ask yourself is:  Would I bank there.  Can I feel good about the products and services l am selling.  The answer is a resounding NO!  You are better than working for this company!!  Everyday I worked there, I felt like taking a shower to wash off the unprofessional and scams perpetrated on the customers.  Look elsewhere!  There are plenty of banks that will treat you and the customers better."
bad,"I hated every second of CitiGroup but as they say the bills need to be paid. The micromanagement is unreal. The managers suck, the schedules suck and change periodically, and the pay is garbage. awful place to work"
bad,"I will start with the positive.  The health benefits are great.  The way they treat their employees is terrible.  Set up for failure from the start.  Extermely hard to bonus and if you are successful at you job then you are looked down upon.   I could go on and on, but I won't."
bad,"the employees are treated like a number and not a person.  I don't remember the benefits, the pay is horrible.  They do not offer a work like balance."
bad,"Staff devote most  of their shift to texting. personal affairs and socializing."
bad,They didn't see the typists working in the lockbox as employees more like bodies that could be easily replaced and the margin for advancement was paper thin
bad,"I became sick while working at citi and was terminated.  while in good health i worked over 100 hour weeks toe help Citi, but when they were no longer able to use me for their benefit, i was released."
bad,"Unfair management"
bad,"Do not work for Citibank, ever!  They work you to the bones, pay you very badly, and give you huge titles, with a lot of responsibility.  If you would like to work as a slave, then go work for Citi.  If you value your life as a whole, then look for a human company.  Citi is worse than slave traders."
bad,Very stressful work environment for employees. Minimal investment in systems and employees. Training was minimal for the job and did not treat customers fairly.
bad,"Its all about favoritism at Citi. The managers could care less about your personal life and emergency's. I worked for Citi for 3 years and they fired me due to a family emergency although I was working well over 50+ hrs a week, I DO NOT RECOMMEND!"
bad,"Day to day work, conducting meetings, resolving user's issue. Participating in meetings for cross module to discuses issue related to other consultant. For example Stock Transport order."
bad,The entire day was based on pushing products on clients that they did not need or ask to have. Terrible management team and culture with no opportunity to grow.
bad,Everything with Citi Bank was extremely unorganized. No one knew what they were doing and I got laid off with only four days notice. A lot of people were getting fired for things that had happened in previous weeks so Citi didn't have to pay a bonus that was promised.
bad,"low salary and There salary is not suitable in our daily needs, but make our works done early before the deadline. When somebody resigned, they make laugh of them or talk about them.and dont forget the power tripper tls and manager .. politics everywhere..rude HR as well.."
bad,Unhealthy Environment to work with no opportunities to grow and very minimum salary. The amount of work you put is not sufficient with your salary and your efforts are not being recognized.
bad,"Would not recommend to anyone.  It is too much like high school with cliques, favoritism, game playing, and other childish antics.  There is little organization and no structure."
bad,It started as typical customer service/sales. I was happy the first three years. Management was not the best. I left when the company closed and laid everyone off.
bad,"Metrics Driven company that Productivity Driven"
bad,The give you very little resource of the job. The job is not open to much change. The sups have very little insight on what they are handling so they cant help much.
bad,Workplace culture can be improved. Learned a lot of banking and have different point on the deposit/loan systems - from the bank side instead of consumer.
bad,"The company is very diverse and has people from all around the world working in the company, something so incredible."
bad,"Spent 7years at this place. They only tell u what u wanna hear, they never give u straight forward answers. They make it nearly impossible to meet goals due to the fact of suppressing sales opportunities when they feel it's busy, but at the same time we are waiting 5 minutes in between calls."
bad,"Very demanding, very stressful, too much volume, management had a bad attitude towards employees and did not appreciate them"
bad,"just good place to work for."
bad,Do not respect there employees that dont have a degree..you can work for this company for 20 yrs and they will have you train the next person coming in to take your job because that person has a degree and it don't matter what the degree is in. It could be dog walking and you would lose your jib after doing it for 20 yrs.
bad,"The Management team at Citibank is very unprofessional and extremely unorganized. This has to be the worst run banking operation in the United States. Their was so much criminal activity that was overlooked by Citibank, committed by their subsidiary Bannamex that I thought for sure someone would have been cited and convicted."
bad,"The atmosphere is horrible,Some of the managers are really mean. They are alway hiring and firing. They don't look at all the hard work you put into the job. They look at numbers."
bad,"Worked for them for 5 years. In retention department. They are going to say you will make pretty good money in doing sales plus begging people to not close accounts. However when it is time to evaluate your performance each month your bonus will depend on the scoring that will be applied to your call by your manager. Those ret....ed  managers make their best to  put the worst score to your calls just to prevent you to receive any bonus from the company. The managers are not qualified enough to judge those calls.... my manager always had to reverse his score all the time after I disputed it... I had to go through dispute every single month. His name is Mark Lee. Make sure you are not getting in his team. ..."
bad,Terrible Company do not work for them of do business with them. They only care about making the comapny money and not the employess that help keep the company going.
bad,"Management would love to push work down on junior employees.   I mean big decisions.   In addition, management had no idea how to solve problems.  Results were horrible.   Evidence to this is the other banks stole market share from us almost every year."
bad,"Excellent benefits and compensation structure"
bad,"I worked for Citibank as a Fraud Analyst III. The group was account takeover. We did anything but account takeover and eventually just became another phone team, but with a lower pay grade. Management kept taking work from one fraud unit and giving it to us and then forcing us to take calls. All of the extra work and no increase in pay.The raises are a joke and management caters to females and minorities.  For a student this would be a good place.  There definitely isn't a career opportunity here unless you want to live on low wages."
bad,"They only care about customers with more than 50k and if you don't have at least 50k you receive nothing free and there are no perks. They do nothing to help the middle class and instead charge for anything at ridiculous rates. Management and Upper Management do not care about their team or fellow employees. They let Gallup rate their customer service instead of taking care of that in house... more politics behind that. Extremely shameful company and culture. Managers are always getting away with harassment. They don't give everyone the tools needed for success and because they are so cheap they never have adequate staff. They are even so cheap that buildings are poorly maintained, need paint, carpet, new computers, etc. Disgusting example of an enterprise that is greedy and corrupt. No hard feelings as I left on my own terms but these are just facts for anyone looking to do something good with their life instead of a career with Citi!"
bad,Poor leadership. Unorganized. Back-log of work. Inability to leverage existing employees. Managers lacked interpersonal skills.
bad,the lead was constantly interrupted by instant messages that would pop up with an number of questions regarding previous calls in the middle of your calls. Seemed that people were being weeded out since this department soon was closed down.
bad,Supports a work life balance environment.  Promotes teamwork as well as individual contributors.  Strong support for Women's programs to promote the advancement to senior roles and involvement in strategic initiatives.
bad,"Company went through many changes, which created challenges, both good and bad.  Lots of opportunities were available, if you wanted to advance your career."
bad,They are sub contracted by SYKES Lakeland and it is a horrible place to work. They treat you horribly and pay you horribly.
bad,"i learn how to use a machine that uses electricity to seal matrial, i like how one week we had friday day off, and the next we didnt. we got paid every week"
bad,"Dont apply if you have bad credit. They will hire you then after 2 or 3 months they let you go for bad credit. They never let you know you have to have good credit when applying on their website. This is wrong. They waste your time and effort. Plus you have to have the EXACT dates on your past employments. If you are off a month or date they also fire you for it. By the way if you apply for CitiGold make sure you ask for 16.00 hours or more. You will do to much in this possition for little pay. They have an old program called CWS that only does half the job  and is still in black and green. Their new program is called Eclipes an is limited  and does not do much, it is not fully in used yet. They need a better online program to do simple task. That is only 2 out of to MANY they use to do simple tasks. You will get tired of switching back and forth between programs to do your job. If you want a career in Banking its best to apply at Wells Fargo they have the best online program in Banking I seen. Good Luck"
bad,"Temporary positions are offered constantly at Citi Bank. Honestly, its not worth the stress and aggravation they put you through as a temp. They will promise to convert you if you work really hard, but honestly, that is a complete and total LIE. Once your contract is up, your gone. The Global Loans department is by far the worst department to work for at Citi. Those who get hired only get hired permanently if they know someone who already works there. Management only promotes if you are part of their ""clique"" or you are related to them. That's the honest to gods truth. "
bad,"Proactively source, acquire, and expand customer relationships by maximizing sales opportunities and ensuring customer retention.  Probe within customer database for needs and opportunities to cross-sell to other business segments."
bad,"Citi Group / United States Auto Club. Provided roadside assistance for Ford, Jaguar on a national level. Spoke to a lot of really nice people."
bad,"uncaring management that only created stressful work enviorments while they sat back and planned weddings, played golf and cracked the whip"
bad,This is a terrible place to work. The pay and stress are terrible. Management is awful. Turnover is very very high. How they stay in business I have no idea.
bad,The working environment is pleasant and the employees are great to work with. The day-to-day challenges is an experience in itself.  Consistently attending training classes and also they provide hands on training with the computer.
bad,"A good place to get started if your coming out of college, other than that there isn't much opportunity especially if your ambitious. Get your experience and then get out."
bad,This place is the most stressful environment I have ever been in and they pay much less than businesses like First Data and Wells Fargo.
bad,"Citi went through a tough time in 2008 and despite $4,000,000,000 in profit last year, the bonus pools and overall career advancement is non-existent."
bad,The work environment was good and friendly but suspicious and long working hours we had which made us frustrated and also they took a long time to make me their permanent employee
bad,"Please do not even consider working in this wicked place. The managers and directors care more about their paychecks than anything else. Absolutely no respect for employees. I can't believe I lasted a year! The compensation sucks and management is obnoxious. "
bad,"management really dont care about employees, most workers are leaving or plan on leaving long hours, low pay, no support from management team."
bad,"I learned to use computer software a this job i.e., word & excel. I bought my first PC & learned to use AutoCAD at home. Until then, I was handwriting letters & meeting minutes, using a calculator & creating drawings using pencils. This was possibly the most beneficial education available for an Architect at that time."
bad,"Job allowed me to learn about computer world by maintaining SICS system on IBM mainframe, assist in reconciliation of general ledger, and control travelers' check archival center."
bad,I applied for a customer service position. However it was a collection job. They micro- managed their employees. They seem to cared very little about their customers.
bad,"If you want to work for a company that 1) Cares not one bit about you as a person or your family 2) will force you to skip NYS mandated breaks? then this is a great fit."
bad,This company is filled with micro-management.  There is no comapssion or empathy for the customer.  The hardest part of the job was calling customers on Sundays in order to attempt to collect the debt.  The best part of the job was when I was able to help customers who really needed assistance.
bad,the site closed. lack of growth potential as previously stated and the driving distance was too great for all that time.
bad,"Its a slave culture. The worst, I've ever worked in. Just 4 months, couldn't last any longer, Wanted to get out of this rat hole every second of it. There are a few good people but they have gotten used to the culture. Forget about ping ping or coffee or tea etc."
bad,No upward mobility. Intense collection practices and high rate loans. Pressure to collect and do high monthly loans. No stability company is for sale.
bad,to find the customers for credit card financing. that was  hard to motivate but enjoyable part of the job when got business.
bad,"My co-workers were very helpful and hard working.  "
bad,Citibank was not prepared to work in the Texas culture and did very little for the customers and employees. They left the state in 2014.
bad,"Not an ""employee friendly"" culture. The employee population is either legacy employees who have been there for over 20 yrs or new employees constantly leaving. The environment is highly segregated and does not promote team work at all. Worst place to work!!"
bad,"Citibank, contrata a una empresa EXTERNA llamada VentasK, y asu vez quien nos pagaba era Real Force S.L, pero nuestro trabajo era para Citibank, cogen a unos 20, y cada antes de que puedan cobrar comisiones los echan, vuelven a coger a otros 20 y así sucesivamente, y para rematar decir que tuvimos que reclamar nuestro finiquito porque no nos lo pagaban. Fue horrible."
bad,"Typical day at work: Multitask and Fast Pass"
bad,Allowed to take on assignments and go with it with skilled team members. Allowed to be on Governance Council for Release Software Performance (as a consultant). The physical working environment was conducive to productivity.
bad,This company is all about making money and not concerned about their employees
bad,"HR Specialist assisting 1 VP, 2 HR Generalist, 1 Recruiter."
bad,"HR Specialist assisted 1 EVP, 1 VP, 1 Recruiter, 2 HR Generalist, and 1 Systems Analyst.  "
bad,I learned the in's and out's about being a teller in a few months. I realized the field was not for me. I did not like banking or the office politics.
bad,"too much favorite people n family members"
bad,"•	Analyzing the requirements of a new project by understanding the requirements posted by the clients."
bad,"worked everyday with no direction, under people with differnet agendas. Not for my benefit but as place holder for others to advance."
bad,out of business! No longer open bad management. No longer open so that really speaks for its self
bad,"this has to be one of the worst jobs I ever had. It does not matter how good you do its never recognized. It does not matter how high the tier is you get at the end of the month, you are never appreciated. Your managers tell your business to other employees as well as other managers. Managers talk about each other and have the collectors on the floor involved in the gossip between the 2 managers. Nothing is held to standards and the production floor is out of control."
bad,"Let's see where do I start:"
bad,"Upper management does not care about loyalty, support, and concerns of the employees. The focus is on who has what title, and "
bad,Very impersonal and corporate centered. Poor training and high expectations. The employee morale is horrible. A life draining experience.
bad,It was very frustrating working at citi in that particular department with nothing being set and when input was given no one acknowledged it.
bad,"Doesnt believe in promoting their staff from insides, doesnt not give any raises"
bad,"Very stressful and demanding.  No matter how hard you worked or met goals,  they were never good enough."
bad,"A typical day I Handled all accounts from due current month to 60days delinquent on automobile loans."
bad,it was a new Staffing agency which never got going. While it was in business it was a Good company to work for.
bad,"Hired for a position "
bad,"laid back environment, senior management dont have a clue as to what they are talking about, Growth is almost impossible, poor morale. Compensation sucks, too much politics, lack of structure. incompetent culture."
bad,CitiFinancial was bought out by One Main Financial. I have never worked for One Mian Financial.
bad,Citi is a very good company but don't apply for RETENTION!!! You will be sooooo unhapppy take any other position except RETENTION!
bad,"worked with great people and bad people"
bad,a good learning exp.GUD Organisation to work with.gud manAGEMENT.
bad,"En el CITIBANK se labora en un ambiente agradable y el aprendizaje es dia a dia, mis directores me retroalimentan sobre como la compañía quiere que ser posicionada y pienso que no hay momentos difíciles si cumplimos los procedimientos y lo que mas me gusto es la estabilidad y tranquilidad"
bad,"era muito bom quando tinah aquele pique"
bad,This is not a good place to work. the co-workers were very nice but the work is not very customer friendly.
bad,"A busy and noisy work place as we are always on the telephone to do collection."
bad,"unfair management, and forced overtime. Moving up within the company is nearly impossible."
bad,very minimum support as it was a temporary job. Fell like a step child with in the company
bad,The ability to handle each client in a timely manner.  Working with highly sensitive documents.
bad,"Compensation is low, about 20% less than what is should be.  It is difficult to be promoted.  Management is disrespectful and unfair."
bad,"A typical day is nonstop phone calls."
bad,"Because of the turnover of personnel in clerical positions, my typical day at work began at 8 am and ended at 7 pm! Was responsible for greeting clients in person on a daily basis while trying to answer phone calls and issuing interest checks to be mailed and picked up. Wiring funds from several accounts to outside accounts. There were several aspects of this job that were time consuming and the demand from management was unrealistic."
bad,"Same company as the telemarketing job, same there as it was at other side of the place."
bad,The absolute WORST company to work for especially in the collections department. Very micro managed and they do not care about there employees nor customers. Managers and team leads are especially useless . Not paid enough for the harassment and verbal abuse.. Never again.
bad,They moved all the jobs to India so tons of people lost there jobs. 
bad,"All the working days in my ex-employer'  were tough and each day you face new requirements with tight due date, but frankly it is considered as a very good school where you interact daily with very talent people and you can capture smart ideas and skills. The hardest part of the job is the interaction with the regional division and the tight deadlines. Regarding the management, a big problem of subjectivity when evaluating many important and sensitive topics."
bad,A professional environment to work with with strict compliance and excellent systems. Human resources very strong to motivate the employees
bad,Citibank underpays their employees they also do not care about them. they are dishonest and unloyal to their staff. citibank is one HUGE revolving door. if you work here don't expect for it to turn into a career. theres a reason they are one of the lowest ranked banks in the United states. if you want to learn about how selfish corporate america is work for citibank!!!!
bad,"low employee morale"
bad,"Poor management. This place works like in ""Clans"" so if you are in you are ok but if not you are lost there."
bad,"call center, you sit on the phones all day, have team meetings, talk about what's new and if things are changing "
bad,Hard to advane alot of management changes while I was there . No one took ownership of conflicts.
bad,challenging work envoirement to achive the daily target given by bank to each individual and by team.Learn to be indepent to handle the sales call and create a team work among the collegue when it is necessary. Very good and strong management. Doing cross sales trought phone calls tranfer by customer service. When received inbound call from customer regarding thier free gift.When time we achive the individual monthly KPI and when we received commission pay out slip.
bad,Merit raises. Work 50 hours a week or more. 30 minute lunches. No Training.
bad,Human resources is useless and management is even less useful. As a result of this experience I know why the banking industry is in terrible shape!
bad,The environment was very negative with a forced positive. Great catering.
bad,"sorting, receving, and processing mail into envelopes and working posting machines with supervision."
bad,Project did not work out. I was hired to do a job and unfortunately the product and strategy were in a state that it really required the the management shut them down.
bad,Hours changes alot
bad,They dont give raises. They do not promote within the company. Whatever position you start at is where you will end with no merit increases or incentives. If you are not one the chosen favorites you will constantly be harassed by management.
bad,"Although I enjoy working accounts, I don't like working around childish management and ghetto employees. I thought when I took this job in Irving back then that it would be professional and rewarding. Unfortunately I was not happy when I parted from this job. I worked hard for months and never received my bonuses, after collecting a lot of money for the company. They always came up with a reason not to give it to me."
bad,I have nothing good to say about Citi. They hire and fire quickly. They try to tell you that you can get promoted and do good things. Not true. They just move your job overseas.
bad,Citi is an unethical and despicable company. They grossly mistreat and abuse their employees and customers. Avoid them if you can.
bad,"just after your money and meeting high, high quotas, management are so sarcastic and racist. Worst place ever worked for! and pay is horible!"
bad,- They don't care about management
bad,A typical day includes a mush-mosh of antiquated systems that neither interface or message each other. Productivity is hampered by these archaic systems and a long list of nonsensical edicts and training regimens. Senior executives react and do not have proactive plans. The plans that they have usually include divide and conquer and send off shore. Only the favorite departments are allowed to hire staff and the morale of the rest of us is extremely low. We work long hours and are scolded for our overtime. Most of us work very hard (not smart because of the systems) and get nothing for our efforts unless we are a favorite. We are really fed up. Work Life balance only exists for a few select departments and not for the rest of us. More than half of my team is looking for jobs outside Citi and outside GTS.
bad,A typical day at work includes constant reminders that you are expendable and can be replaced.
bad,"Horrible company to work for, I never received pay for work that was done."
bad,"The supervisors were pencil pushers with no authority. ""Employee had to wait a week to get back on the system when returning from medical leave. The Greensboro office had no controls over anything. The bonus structure and vacation planning were completely outdated. The only thing you could count on was that they could not tell you how to determine if you earned a bonus or how much."
bad,"Just received incoming calls, daily contest for incentives"
bad,Not a good place to work They make you sale to people they have to say no two times they change the wording all the time
bad,"From the top down management does not value their employees at all - they pile on the work, make you work weekends and holidays and dont give raises or bonuses. They are of the mentality that you should be lucky to have a job and don't acknowledge any sacrifices made by employees to meet the deadlines. This company is in a CONSTANT state of unnecessary change and is due to poor management and business decisions. This creates an abundance of unnecessary work which, in the end, really only masks the problems. The overwhelming number of systems, sub-systems etc. that don't integrate with eachother is unbelievable for a corporation this large, it wreaks of chaos. Overall, the expectations are unrealistic and it has been the most ungratifying job I've ever had and the most depressed environment I've ever worked in. Come on.....why do you think you see so many job openings on these career websites for Citi?"
bad,A typical day at work was stressfull from the moment you walked thru the door til the moment you signed off for the day.
bad,They change the plans all the time. They also have no structure. If you want to work for pennies please find a job here. You will regret CITI.
bad,If you are fresh off the graduation floor this is a great place for you to begin your collections or customer service feel. For any individual who deems themselves to be grown you will not last long here.
bad,I would not recommend this place for anyone who values family and/or personal time outside the company. They make salaried employees work 60 plus hours per week with no compensation or appreciation.
bad,"I worked with Citi for over 5 years. during my time I have come across several leaders/top managers who have no clue of what they are doing. They promote politics and favoritism and only thing that matters is if you could use flowery language and fluff. substance and work doesnt matter."
bad,"In the last year the morale and work environment at AZ site has decreased, mentally draining and job is not worth the stress and toll on mental health."
bad,The company expected (demanded) weekend work and long weekday hours with the same story every year about wage increases saying we arent earning enought to pay you more but senior management was always recieving bonuses and higher earnings. Management was quick to remind you very often that you could be replaced anytime if your productivity wasnt high enough. As for cuture it went from a mixed race company of good people to 90 percent workers from India and in that proccess worker colaboration was not shared for all other races.
bad,"CITI at one was a very friendly and positive place to work. There was a reason why CITI was listed as ""one of the best places to work "" it was true. But then CITI changed and it is now a dumpster fire."
bad,"They will bring in new people and pay them 10-20K more a person that's been there for years as a dedicated employee. They are constantly outsourcing their jobs to other countries and will get rid of an entire department within a matter of months. They do not treat all employees equally or fairly. Ethics and HR will not address anything brought to them and once you report something,  upper management is all over you about doing so."
bad,"Watch out for department layoffs and not following through on discussed pay/bonuses.  The laid off at least 3 different departments when I worked there as a Elite Customer Service Rep.  They promised our incoming class an opportunity for bonuses and never implemented them.  They promised me so much an hour and then paid me less when I got in the door.  About every 1 in 4 customers would scream/yell/cuss at me, which happened more than when I worked in collections.  The customers we served were their high end clients.  I didn't agree with the standards they used to grade us on each month, they didn't truly want us to help the customers (poor dept phone transferring system-hang ups, server messing up on almost every account, foreign reps cold call dropping customers on our dept b/c they're lazy and Citi doesn't fire them, Citi would rather outsource to a rep that won't do his job then pay an American rep that can fix a customers the first time or an American dept that can do the paperwork in 1/6 the time, etc), and they didn't care I was trying to retain their multi-million dollar customers.  It costs at least 4 times as much money to attract a new customer than it does to retain one by fixing their issue, being extremely friendly and courteous, and calling them back as agreed.  I would have customers leave messages on the my bosses phone on how I helped them and how friendly I was to them but my boss didn't like me since I refused to lower my call times by cold transferring them to other departments and allowing the phone system to disconnect them."
bad,"*Mgmt sucks...micro and HR is for the company NOT for the employees..."
bad,Management had no clue on what was happening with the new employees. New manager were so darn off knowing how to direct the CSR. WOULD BE A LONG TINE BEFORE I WOULD WORK THERE AGAIN.
bad,"I did no like the people, culture and management at Citigroup. It was one of the worse jobs. I will never return to any type of job at Citigroup.  It's very competitive and management made it worse."
bad,"They have a high turnover.  if you are really able to hit all the marks set for you, moving up  can be done over a few years. But in my opinion call were not easy and the majority of the people who work there were under 25"
bad,"I've stayed at every job I've had for a minimum of 2-3 years. This is the first time I've started looking elsewhere in less than a year. I thought Citi would be a good place to advance my career after working for companies like PWC and NYL. Unfortunately their culture is similar to that of Raymond James. Work all day, all night, all weekend. They also are moving away from their work from home policies which is something really important to most employees. The office politics here is worse than most governments. Too bad. Maybe things will come around, but I'll never know."
bad,"I can only speak for the Retention department since it is the only department I have been in.  Unless you are the type of person who can sell a refrigerator to an Eskimo, it is a challenge to get people to keep Citi's Cards.  Most of the card benefits or basic at best.  The accounts which Citi has identified as ""gamers"" ( the cardholders who really don't want to close, they just want the retention offers ) are mostly sent overseas.  Citi has a bonus structure which, even if you do have the gift of gab, you mathematically couldn't ever get the maximum payout. Working in Citi Retention cause most employees to go out on disability, due to stress.  Every day is just dreadful.  Citi is paying more than working a McDonald's and that is the only positive thing about working there."
bad,"Had you call the same number three or more times a day even after you've already talked and set up a payment. Had a fake number on one of the lines that would come up American legion hospital to fake out the customer to answer the phone. The last manager was horrible. To busy chasing the ladies in the office and guest. "
bad,NIvel dirección de bajo rendimiento. Poca actitud de servicio
bad,"It was great when we all first started the last few years had been high tense layoffs left and right and the company has just changed, they don’t pretend to care about the employees anymore, there is no company morale anymore."
bad,"Employees are not treated as Humans. They are considered machines. No Job Security at all, even as full time. I will not waste my time working for a company like citi."
bad,I worked for Citi as a temporary to hire after 90 days. I was optimistic when I started my assignment. I quickly realized there was a morale issue and the issue seemed to be that Citi had deceived temporaries regarding hiring them after 90 days. I thought surely there was a reason Citi hadn't hired majority of these temps. I was certain that wasn't going to happen to me but I was wrong. My manager quickly realized I was a hard worker and did my job well. I was given more responsibilities than most permanent employees. I thought learning everything I could and working hard was the way to become permanent. I was wrong. I watched as other temps stroked managements egos were hired. I've been told I'm old school for thinking hard work will get you what you desire. The conclusion of my 9 month experience is if you're willing to kiss A then this is the place for you. Otherwise don't bother! They will work you to death and your best is never enough. I think management doesn't actually view temps as people but robots. Citi Passport management sucks from the top down! They need to wipe the slate clean and start again.
bad,"I really wouldnt recommend this company to my worst enemy. Terrible corporate culture, terrible management, just a bunch of people plugging along doing the minimum they have to do to keep under the radar to keep their jobs. I never seen a larger bunch of dismal miserable people in one place at a time. Nothing but negativity and people constantly on the edge from threats of losing their jobs. Training, if you could call it that, was terrible and management was completely clueless, relying on other staff members to do training for them as they had no knowledge about mortgages after they were transferred into that position from another department that was closed down. The worst decision I ever made was applying to and accepting a position in the underwriting department. Honestly, I have no idea how the company as a whole, stays in business except for the constant bailouts that they get."
bad,Organizational changes occur on average every 6-8 months.  Totally erases any momentum for the good processes that were put in place.  Compensation is based on bell curve and it is nearly impossible to achieve even modest increases (2-3%) for the highest of performers.   Highly suggest career elsewhere especially for Millennials.
bad,"Unless you are a high-school student or even a college student who needs some extra funds, I would not recommend Citibank as a place of employment or as a ""career"" goal. The pay was low, hours were odd, management was competitive and only viewed their employees in terms of ""numbers"" and goals""."
bad,"closing branches and laying off long time employees, shrinking staff from 18 employees per branch to 6 with 1 manager expecting to 6 days a week with no lunch breaks."
bad,"The firm is in a major revamping, sending jobs overseas, cutting positions, merging jobs.  There is no room for growth and people are on pins and needles waiting for the next shoe for fall for layoffs.  "
bad,the management was disrespectful to there teammates. they had the higher than mighty attituide and if any thing went wrong it would never be at fault of a manager. Employees often left feeling worthless and that no other employer would want to have them. When the location closed I chose not to apply within and take my money and say good bye..
bad,"The temporary people get treated with very little respect.  There is a lot of favorites and some people move around where ever they want and it doesn't matter if you have quality work.  The managers are have bad attitudes and do not want to help you in any way.  They are only out for their paychecks.  It is a bad environment and no promotions unless you are a pet.  "
bad,"Worst employer I ever worked for by far.  Incompetent, self centered, all talk.  All they care about is the stock holders - certainly not their employees.  A lot of management turnover due to the this."
bad,lots of stress and pressure from management. witness a branch manager have a nervous breakdown on the job from stress and pressure from upper management to meet goals.
bad,"Company has got worst managers and work culture. It spends little on employee engagement and extra curricular activities. Work life balance is fine but the quality of work is pathetic. You will find excessive politics in promotions and appraisals. Never join this company if you like to learn and grow. This company is for those who likes to do nothing and still get salary. Please note that this review is particular to CSIL (GPC, Gurgaon)."
bad,"Citi does not value its employees. There is no job security. The workload is too demanding, expecting employees to complete 50+ hours of work each week in 40 hours."
bad,"My co-workers was great and very helpful."
bad,"Extremely busy, no work/life balance. Great people. Busy and understaffed office. Low Morale but supportive co workers willing to help with the learning process."
bad,"Although I was with the company nearly 5 years I was passed over for raises despite the fact that I had really great reviews, I wasn't making nearly as much as I should have been."
bad,Very unorganized with co-workers that lack professionalism and the concept of teamwork. The management staff is not interested in training of improving their subordinates. The job was stressful with unrealistic expectations
bad,"Not a great place to work if you are looking to advance. The typical day is like any day at a typical call center. No structure in good Management skills. Very high turn over rate, which management looks forward too, that way they don't have to pay higher wages to long term employees. The best thing about this job was the people you work with. That is what made the job less stressful. The one thing that this job taught me is that top bosses and their investors are the only thing that matters."
bad,"Management is inexperienced and unprofessional, resulting in no opportunity for career advancement or personal growth.  You'll be mired in politics (if you like that sort of thing).  Steer clear."
bad,Worst management team. Location is super slow and there is no work life balance. Too much is expected and not realistic goals. Hour changes had raisen issue with making hours. Weekends are slow and useless.
bad,"Starts of with support issues."
bad,"Not a good company to work for, the job that you do is not work the pay and management sucks. Able to build good relationship with coworkers"
bad,"taking phone calls from abusive clients, taking constant criticism and ""not good enough"" attitude from mgnt. Management is totally disconnected from what the business is actually doing. You can't go to your mananger with help with an account because they don't know what changes/implementations are going on. Just blankly stare at you. Back office does tell customer service whats going on, management doesn't care. I've never been on more medication due to this place, then in my entire life..........Horrible!!!!!!!"
bad,"learned what HR meant this past year. Hiding the truth."
bad,"Good place to get exploited - apply if you have an H1 visa.  If you are a permanent resident or US citizen look elsewhere as this is not a company to be happy, make money or go places."
bad,"Morale is very low do to the downsizings.  You are expected to work day hours, and be back online to manage your projects by 8PM.  Some work until 1AM each night.  "
bad,"Worked in both Customer Service and Collections."
bad,Too many mid layers of mgmt. In many cases employees are not placed properly (not possessing needed skill sets for job).
bad,Crazy
bad,Management does no foster professional growth in most areas.
bad,Citi the time frame I have been there they have closed down ten branches and laid off a lot of people.
bad,"Job sold under false pretense, Customer Service turned into sales sales sales, not what I was looking for"
bad,"Typical big company. Expect long delays in advancement, long hours and little recognition."
bad,"NIce job if you need a job. If you want to live a stressful life and have family time don't apply. Very demanding, District and Regional Mrgs make you stress and get on your employee's and call customers numberous times everyday. . Plan on working late and Weekends with lower wage employees in your branch. I had to leave the area because of the stress. Owned by Citigroup, just changed name to be able to cell One Main Financial. KR"
bad,"Don’t waste more then a year in this cesspool.  F**k these people all the managers are money hungry a**holes. You are just a number, no one cares about your name shut up and do your work. If you want to make it get ready to kiss some a**."
bad,Citi changes policies and procedures almost daily. If you are having a problem and ske for help you are likely to get a figure it out for yourself attitude response. Management gets away with passing the buck to the agent when that screw up. They seem to know how to preach but not how to coach.
bad,"I was not told the truth ever about promotion ability or benefits or even job description until fully on with company then they tell you, and the truth is you are stuck for a year regardless and benefits like vacation is given to those who management push through system because the system never approves anyone for days off or vacation or shift changes, if you submit without being a favorite of a manager it will never get approved. Jury duty will not even get approved in time and days missed wont get fixed in their system if your supervisor does not like you."
bad,Place is so poltical and very facial orientated....in other words if your face fits then so will you. Extremely political and HR could care less. If you raise issues no one really cares...they go through motions but with no value.
bad,"If you don't enjoy sales and pushing credit products on people that don't need them, this is not the job for you. Predatory lenders, sales goals mean more than anything. The area manager would call very branch 3 to 4 times a day to get sales numbers."
bad,I was the newest member on my team and they made it obvious that I was a diversity hire. It was a very uncomfortable situation. My every interaction with colleagues was scrutinized relentlessly. My manager has created a toxic work environment.
bad,"Management by bullying and by disaster.  Managers who have a serious problem try to disguise it as long as possible.  My manager would stand in his office doorway and pick someone to scream at.  Much of what we were ordered to do was not on behalf of the firm, nor was it to ensure we followed vendor contracts.  Senior managers from various businesses competed for each other - cooperation was an exception.  HR would encourage laying off someone when a business down the hall could use that person's knowledge."
bad,At first it was great then over the past few years the morale and caring about the employee went down hill fast  oh and we are the most underpaid bank around
bad,"PTO is non existent you have to fight to get a scheduled day off. "
bad,Neoptism was a widely accepted practice. It was difficult for people of color to advance or be promoted. Many mangers felt threatened by individuals that were smarter which prevented and or delayed growth opportunities.
bad,"Ive been with Citi for 3 years and I have seen many managers come and go. The only thing they have in common is that they are all terrible. I recommend not working in Queens east section. Terrible management all the way up to the area director. No room for growth. Wonderful co-workers, a lot of responsibility and low pay compared to neighboring banks(chase, bank of America, TD, etc.)"
bad,Other associates were helpful and nice but don’t expect your computer systems to ever work and you’ll be falsely reprimanded when the systems continue to drop. Phone times are huge here and when they give you severely faulty equipment they then blame you! Also the new time tracking system is horrible and even once you update all of your hours your unit manager goes in and changes it!    Do not go to your unit manager if you have a medical issue.. confiding in a UM letting them know you have depression issues and need to see your doctor will not turn out good.
bad,"I loved working or Citibank.  Unfortunately, Citi decided to pull out of the NorthTexas area and close branches.  Their management an d training programs were amazing and very informative.  I thoroughly enjoyed working for them."
bad,"Citi is a place you'd fit in if you are okay with being tossed about. Constant unrealistic changes to goals everyone has to meet. 90% of people cannot meet without skippung the breaks theyre given in which the managers have no problem with but cannot tell you to skip them when they know you'll have to. Very pc and passive aggressive enviornment. You have to watch what you say to your friends. Peiple will listen in and if they dont like something youre talking about, they will call HR. This company is very liberal and give special treatment to those fitting in minority groups. So if you are republican or share republican views, its best to hyst not talk."
bad,"Management is a 'good ole boys' system and only those at the top have any job security. The rest are let go at whims because of personality clashes, management differences, or because your shoes are green! BEWARE!!! 14 years of management and was terminated because of management style after 19, though it had been touted the previous ~  12 years ~ go figure! Good luck."
bad,"I have never hated my life so much than when i worked at citi. The management does not care about you or health, as long as they get their numbers they do not care how it affects you. People will take advantage of you to get ahead and your dedication to the job means nothing when it comes to advancing, it is nearly impossible."
bad,expect you to take responsibiity for issues you have no control over Such as software that does not work as needed. When supervisor misses something mandatory and does not allow you time off the phone to do it you get written up for. Lot of micromanagement. training is lacking substance.
bad,"There is a reason this site has such high turnover, and its because management does not care about its employees there. Reaching out to HR and pushing for changes to help better the environment does nothing but put a target on your back for further abuse. Benefits are decent and pay is better than most jobs in the area, but still underpaid for the responsibilities and stress of the job itself."
bad,"The company keeps laying off people. There is no such thing as employer loyalty. They hired people and then laid them all off like nothing. Senior Management are full of politics. Incompetent people are all promoted to senior level and none of them want to do their own jobs. When something blows up, it's always someone else's fault. People spend more time thinking of who to blame than doing actual work.  If you want job security, you should try somewhere else."
bad,"They start you out with the help desk answering calls providing phone numbers. Three weeks later they put us in training For Accounts Payable not knowing any of the other applications that they were using, other words they trained us backwards which was extremely difficult and annoying. When you ask questions they tell you we went over that in class. Management definitely plays favoritism and even joins in with Citi employees talking behind other Citi employees backs. I was contracted to work for Citi and believe me when I tell you segregation is alive and well. Even if it's a simple potluck they do not want contractors eating with them! If they tell you there's a chance for permanent placement that's a lie the last time anybody was placed in this department was just over two years ago!"
bad,"If you want great benefits then this is the place to be but if you are counting on the training they provide you to get your job done then look elsewhere. It is a very stressful environment, it was very slow and a lot of time they would let us go home because there was a lack of work."
bad,"Citi used to be a great place to work, but this is no longer true, in the last 2 years, it has been going downhill. There is no work life balance. Work hours consists of a minimum 45 hours, but you will probably end up working more than that. Understaffed and refusing to hire more people, they are desperate to hire but doesn't provide the proper training. Management also has unrealistic expectations and is micro managing. You are underappreciated and will be treated like a work horse; you will likely have to do the work of 2 or more people since they are understaffed. The teams here are very helpful and you will work with great coworkers but at the end of the day, management sucks and no matter how amazing your coworkers are, you will be driven away. Systems are outdated and manual, so you will have to spend unnecessary time doing stuff that normally should not take long with up to date softwares. Everyday there are issues with the system and something will need to be patched/fixed by the Technology team. You will also have to multitask alot and go back and forth among many applications, as Citi is super backwards and not much has been automated. We are living in the age of A.I. and automation, how are you still using old systems. You are a top tier bank, spend some money and invest in real technology. There are not a lot of smart people working here so all the dumb ones end up getting promoted to VP hence the terrible management. If you don't want to be managed by people with Psych degrees, or people who graduated from unknown universities, then don't waste your time at Citi,"
bad,"Constant layoffs during the entire time I worked there. Morale in the toilet. Unless you suck up to the right people and they take you under their wing, no chance for advancement, and little hope of actually keeping your job long term. Citi does not believe in retaining talent. Staff are just numbers, and if you don't fit their bottom line, you're out. Not recommended."
bad,The training sucks they do not teach you anything.i was promised a day shift got stuck with night shift even when I told them at the beginning I had night school.i got really sick had the hospital papers and they wanted me make a claim which took forever when I had the hospital note with me.the manager don’t know anything and never was their help.The company boring and no one ever helps you.
bad,This place is a JOKE LEAVE WHILE YOU CAN . Bilingual customer service will treat you so bad they pretend their in Mexico. I would not recommend this place to anyone
bad,"The Citi Shared Services operation has a long way to go to be considered world class.  They talk a good game but have no follow through.  They ask for employee feedback but do little once it is provided and attempt to identify the origin of negative feedback. The Shared Services culture is awful at the senior level and it led to tremendous staff turnover, unwarranted staff terminations, and numerous ethics complaints."
bad,"A potential friend was going to apply. I told her not to. We're in the retail part and we work holidays, which means Christmas etc., away from your kids. You're even scheduled to work on non scheduled days around the holidays. You have no say so. Thier timesheets are EXTREMELY confusing for your pay. I bet I've been shorted out of my pay many times. The supervisors do NOT address your concerns. They're not even trained in the calls you're getting. If you enjoy sitting down for many hours, and when you try to get up to use the restroom, by all means, apply at Citi. The pay is not a LIVING wage."
bad,Citi was like a shark tank.  You must be on guard at all times and put forth the maximum effort to stay afloat.  The environment did not instill trust.  People are not encouraged to speak their mind.
bad,"Employees are not promoted as per the achievements or potential."
bad,"Citibank is a miserable place to work. Everybody hates being there and creates a negative hostile work environment. Management acts as if the cane from Taco Bell, no idea what’s going on or how to fix an issue. Always sent to someone else for help. If you want time off they look at you stupid. No sympathy for a bad call or death in the family. Was told if I used one more hour of my sick time that was given, that my job is at risk. Management is very close with the operations managers so if you have a concern with your manager forget it, you’ll be clowned and mocked. Better off elsewhere."
bad,"I worked in a very small team, there is not much job security with this company. Layoffs are the norm. A lot of hired temp work from agencies which most do not end with a permanent position being offered."
bad,Management is very harsh and not understanding at all. 
bad,"If you want a job where you dread coming to work, this is the place! Managers don't help you. Your bound to the dialer and make you feel guilty about using the bathroom or calling in if you're sick. System issues all the time and no one is ever on the same page. When you quit they say they overpaid you and if you don't pay it back they will send you to a collections company."
bad,"We do not get paid nearly enough to do all of the things that we do. We should get paid more, we deal with the most nonsense from customers and managers alike."
bad,"The environment is not the best,  The products and quality of the people are not very good.  Their operations and service are old and not lined up with current quality"
bad,Really poor management providing little to no direction.  Will steal your hard work in a second and claim it as theirs.  Culture of working you to death and telling you your not getting the job done.
bad,"When hired I was hired as collection agent but class was put into a different department with an 1 hour of training of the new work we would be doing we were taught new things and helped other departments with there work but with NO PAY RAISE, or chances to advance, too much office drama it was like high school, compliance wasn't followed and was always changing, mangers had too much work, to be able to attend to agents on the floor, Mangers did not have any leadership qualities and set there teams up to fail, they were in there offices and in meetings all day they couldn't really help agents with question and always pushed off agents inquires to someone else who had no clue of the specific work we would be doing. I would not recommend this type of work to anyone who wants to be able to grow in a company because this job wont give you a chance to."
bad,"I was there for only a month. The training was 6 months, and  I made it through a month. I could not catch on to the job and I did not like it. There were too many government rules. They catered to the rich."
bad,"Prior to 2008, CitiFinancial used drive-by appraisers that would ensure the values of homes came in where the office needed them to be, in order to book a loan. Scum"
bad,"I was brought on a a contractor to write new procedures and reconcile invoices. An internal audit was done on the previous employees work while I was there, this lead to findings of months of unbilled invoices that I had to catch up."
bad,"Citi is truly committed to fostering a diverse work environment and cultural celebrations/events were common.  This was fantastic. "
bad,Great benefits and opportunity for growth. Opportunities are endless in finding new ways to improve the business. Hardest part about the position is the amount of work that needs done.
bad,"A very sales driven organisation, this is an organisation  for performers and hard working people."
bad,Family had to be put last.  Work was first no matter what you had going on.  I missed my daughters school play as I was not allowed to leave until certain numbers were met.  Forced to stay and work or your position was threatened.  Extremely stressful.  Verbal abuse at times was used.
bad,"I worked at Citi for 5 years, working in the basement was good loved it, but I decided to move to the warehouse and that was the biggest mistake of all. The micromanaging over there is insane.  Awful place to work. My life is so much more happier now that I don't work there. The management at the warehouse is awful! I mean awful! Do not work for this place find something better. If you know What's good for you, you will!"
bad,"Different answer for the same question depending who you asked, management had communication issues and was overall very unprofessional, Workplace policies were not enforced."
bad,"I worked at Citibank for 3 years, I have never worked with a company where thee management was so unwilling to help the reps on the phone-AWFUL! STAY AWAY."
bad,"It's ok far as the pay but if you're looking for advancement in the company this may not be the job for you depending on what department you get in. The management is terrible and at the end of the day that has a big impact on where you go in the company. Another downfall about the job is that you have to manual key everything like the old days far as your timesheet, breaks,bathrooms and everything which becomes very stressful. As well if you are having personal issues, family issues they really don't have much of a support system when it comes to that depending on your manager. As well they really never know what's going on and its very unorganized. So if you like being on the phone 8-10 hours a day constantly talking to people and getting yelled at then this may be to your liking regardless good luck with your path in life and job searches I wish you the best!"
bad,"If you get a job offer run, they needed to be bailed out in 2008 and many of the reasons which put them into that situation still remain.  But hey it could change same management, same board.  DOUBT IT!"
bad,Company expects you to learn a bible in 10 days expecting that everyone learns the same way. They expect you to learn the system the first day you get put in from of computer. News flash Citi... learning takes time.
bad,Great wages with a large firm however managed poorly and personalities often override logical choices. Don't work here - its a mess but the staff are nice but badly managed.
bad,always being threaten they are going to walk you out if you don't meet there high standards of call production. Cannot talk to co worker between calls.
bad,most managers are inefficient and lazy. no room for advancement. job security depends on your location. management and job culture is a joke.
bad,"It is deffinitely a challenging company to work for. If you can put up with senseless politics, egos, lack of training and lack of decision makers- go for it. On the positive note the canteen staff is lovely and the location is good."
bad,"I've currently been at Citi for about 4 weeks. I was hired on as Data Entry, but I've spent only about 20 minutes of my entire work-time being trained on it. Most of the time I'm sitting at my desk doing nothing, or being used as a DCP - which is essentially being a staple monkey. I grab the letters that enclosed the checks the tellers are processing, rip them open, and staple them together. They clearly have no intention of actually training me on Data Entry. I'm just there for the occasional DCP. The rest of my time is spent at my desk, wondering why I was hired in the first place."
bad,"accomplished communicator excellent organizational, decision making, time management skills proven track record consistently meeting. I work excellent from home."
bad,"A typical day consisted deposits, withdrawls, counting the atm, interacting with customers, etc.  I learned more about banking, the different banking and credit card packages the company offered.  My co-workers were a great joy.   The most enjoyable part of the day was helping clients with their financial needs.  The hardest part was in those cases when i couldn't help the client that day, but i always told them what they needed to do so I would be able to help them in the future.  There was no support from management."
bad,"- On a typical day in Citibank I open the branch, aid in the training of new employees, take care of safe deposit, provide customer service, open accounts, complete daily logs, help scan work to BCQC, give overrides, do all wires for the branch, take tellers down to the vault, audit staff, etc."
bad,"Working with Citibank was a great opportunity and learnt so much."
bad,"leaving work crying everyday from phone abuse from customers is NOT a typical day and after begging for over a year for a relocate management turned me down which would drive anyone further into the ground. A ""good manager"" would recognize their very long time employee needed some different job duties to not be burned out and driven into the ground. Sure didn't expect to loose my job I planned to retire from a life's rewarding job. I and had a great 20 out of 23 years there for the most part. Loved having many fulfilling opportunities that I did have like training, customer service and collections, fraud detection, specialty training, boarding new clients all the way to decommissioning old systems to new improved systems, compliance and banking auditor and always took pride in helping others"
bad,"Long work days.Management doesn't care about employees."
bad,"stole my compensation of cash in worthless stock. Lost 40,000 retirement income with Enron fiasco in 2002-2005."
bad,The season in which I work there was quick and they were not organize for me. I did not work for this company for long period of time.
bad,Easy job. Do not provide any upward mobility. You are just a number and a fill of a chair. They were supposed to give bonuses for meeting sales quotas and they constantly changed your quotas based off of their New York market. They also expect you to lie to your customers in order to meet sales. No lie was big enough. Management was constantly gone and nowhere when needed. They would change their customer policies so you had to deal with angry customers and clients yourself.
bad,"not the best work/life balance, since you are in a call center environment. Micro managing is evident in this company. Salary range is acceptable for a call center environment"
bad,Hired for Citi tax incentive purposes.  Citi will hire and fire you back as long as you'll let them.  Upper management is a bunch of bone heads.  Unfortunate they are to big to fail and still owe the American Government and tax payers billions in T.A.R.P.
bad,"Wanted LO's to work 7 days a week"
bad,"My experience at Citibank as a processor was one of great disdain. The company offers no room for professional development and looks at their employees as replaceable and has no regard for what their employees need to be healthy both physically or mentally. I felt repressed in every way by management from the way they speak to you to the rules they give their individual teams. For example, the ""Signature"" team I was transferred to after 6 months of working there had ""higher expectations"" for the employees and we were not allowed to talk to other co-workers on other teams or be caught doing anything that was not Citi-related. It was an awful experience in every sense of the word. I do not recommend this company unless you do not care about being repressed and are just in it for the money, which is not that great anyway."
bad,"reviewed conditions on previous loans underwritten, underwrote new loans by review assets, appraisal/collateral, 4506t, tax transcripts, calculate income, reviewed tax returns, respond to emails from processors and managers and updated loan amount when deemed necessary.I learned numerous things on a daily basis. Management frequently provided useful tools to help with day to day job functions. My co-workers were great to work with and was accessible the majority of the time. The hardest or the most challenging part of the job is keeping up with the email requests and staying with a 2 hours window of meeting the requests.  Being a Traveling Underwriter was the most enjoyable part of the job and working for an Awesome manager."
bad,Every thing done there is of a punitive nature. I have never met a more unhappy group of people.
bad,"This place has no interest in paying you for your actual skills and experience.  If you have a degree just stay away because it's not a place that actually cares you have a degree.  When I first got hired, the HR rep seemed extremely happy to be telling me I was going to make $11.50 an hour, degree and all.  I lucked out and got to transfer out of my department because my manager had no interest in having a team onsite and wanted to continue working from home.  The transfer gave me a 0.50 raise.  When it came time for my yearly review, I received a .30 cent raise and news that my department was moving to India. Awesome.  I then got to transfer to the back office department and work for a nut who had a mullet and started lots of drama at all times. "
bad,My intentional job were to assist customers seeking to verify/correct issues with their credit card accounts but I was also required to sell some products and services to sometimes unsuspecting clients who were not always well informed of what they were getting into and I was not required to give more details than were necessary to sell the products.
bad,"You would go in to work and be places at any desk available, performing different duties each day."
bad,"•	Customer Service/Call Center Operations"
bad,"Fair, honest, realistic, excellent in every way."
bad,"Everyday each one of us bring our Breakfast such as coffee and Bread and we all shared. Have learned about, How Armored Truck Drop off being Process as well as after hour Deposit, Loan Payment being drop at the Automated Teller Machine. Co- workers are very friendly, courteous and respectful. We report directly to Front Teller Supervisor and Manager. I would the only hard part is you can not leave the office alone, at least two Representative should stay and cant live the money unattended. Most enjoyable of this job is we got to go home early, but every 15th and end of the month we must stay late at night to assure all statements are all done for the next business day to mail them."
bad,"I felt like a little tiny fish, in a big, HUGE pond!"
bad,The only reason I gave compensation and benefits a three is because the benefits are great. the compensation is lacking and so is the management.
bad,Did not know who to be more angry at. The corporation who offered low income people huge lines of credit or the customers who became unwilling or unable to pay their obligations.
bad,"Very friendly environment. I never felt intimidated to ask any questions. Overall, some of the nicest people I've ever had the ability to work with. Current technology and product introduction, many opportunities to learn if you are self motivated and highly driven. Learned a lot!"
bad,management was not to good. you went in did your job and went home
bad,Over worked and under paid with no apprication. Managers promising help and not following through. Lied too about future changes. Moral in the office was very low... Company has changed dramatically. Used to be a great company to work for.
bad,"Specifically, in equity research, the management team was atrocious. They had very little concern for developing talent."
bad,IT staff very stringent on policies and procedures. Bank attitude not friendly.
bad,"I did not feel that Citibank NA as a whole put their customers first. I am completely customer service oriented and had a hard time with the way customers were treated. Employees were micro-managed and managers were not leaders. The company seemed to promote based on popularity, and not on knowledge or leadership skills."
bad,"Huge turnover and uncertainties. No room for growth and advancement. "
bad,"Too many departments that didn't communicate with each other. "
bad,"Managers (SVP's) in FRSS have absolutely no integrity. They use their authority as a manager to put dedicated, intelligent employees down irrespective how well the employees produces. Managers misrepresent  and choose not to help employees succeed."
bad,The only positive thing about Citi was the benefits program. The environment is extremely toxic and full of gossipy childish workers which includes the management team. The progression was solely based on who was friends with the right people there were people who were on paper a low grade employee but would become a manger or crt in a few months because they were friends with an Operational manager or someone in the training department. I also found out that I was being paid way less then other employees with the same background/education but when I questioned it I was advised there was nothing that could be done about it but they recognized the error.
bad,I worked here for 3 years and I did not advance. Many benefits but terrible management. The travel distance was very far for me. The best part of the job was the bonus. The moral is low and no one really cares. It served its purpose but I'm glad it's over.
bad,I got out of there as quickly as I could after I realized how backwards this place was. I was a call center customer service rep in the Hagerstown location. They pressured us for sales and threatened our jobs if we didn’t get balance transfers but then turned around and laid off the entire department. Luckily about two months before the lay off I got a new job elsewhere and was able to quit. However they promised job security an that they were not going to let people go and turned around and did it after the worked us like slaves and dogs during the Costco citi merger. Don’t ever work here they expect you to give the job your soul drain you dry and then toss your  used body to the side like a sead animal
bad,"No autonomy; micro-managed; no opportunity for growth; secrecy about projects; paid below minimum of position; no shared goals; no clear procedures; etc, etc."
bad,"Managers generally only recognise when you make a mistake; managers pick their favourites and that is who they promote and allow to take on extra projects/responsibilities. They do not recognise the talent they have within their areas, only their favourites. If you have a disability, medical accommodation, or use the short term or long term benefits, you’re nearly guaranteed to be on the chopping block when as soon as they can lay you off (or fire you outright). If you make a mistake it’s thrown up to you over and over, while if you’re doing great things for your teammates or exceeding goals you get nothing, not even so much as an email saying hey great job!! Plus they seem to lay off tons of people in AML as a whole. HR is NOT there for the employees, they are there for Citi managers. Even if you have proof a manager handed you something that caused you to fail and they give you a PiP or written warning , HR will NOT fight to have it rescinded. No one wants to take the action back because it makes them look bad , so the employee suffers. Citi has also been sued at least three times and had to pay out likely millions in settlements to employees. In many areas managers allow employees to yell, belittle, Throw fits, etc right in the work area and the managers do nothing. You can show on paper and prove to your managers that you’re capable of X and they’ll still pick their favourites. I’d say avoid this company , especially the FIU."
bad,"Management abuses power. Talks down to employees. Forces you to work 60+ hours a week. There is no concern for people. Layoffs left and right. Information sharing and inter-team communication are horrible. The benefits are expensive, and networking is awful."
bad,"Simple job. Low skill level required to accomplish tasks."
bad,"After putting my blood and sweat, sacrifice, by giving my everyday best, going above and behind for 21 plus years, this corporation turns around and destroys my future by taking away the only source of income for me and family, by giving my job position to an offshore staff, all because they just want to pocked up more money, leaving you struggling to get another job, taking away not only income but health benefits needed for existing condition. This place you just a number not a person, i felt betrayed, specially when President Trump gave that tax cut to all corporation with the intention to improve the U.S economy...."
bad,"management is the biggest reason any one leaves the bank...  they don't care.. to big to fail is the perfect title for Citi.  they have a voice of the employee every year , and every year the voice says forced rankings are the biggest problem ,  guess what doesn't get addressed ... nothing like working hard all year and your direct tells you how great you are doing , only to be told at the end of the year , by someone you don't work for that you are forced in to  3 ranking  (rankings are 1 thru 5)"
bad,"Where should I began? Management, Culture, Systems, Training,Breaks,High Turnover, or Human Resources. This institution by far is the most unprofessional workplace I have ever been in over my 10 yrs experience with banking. You will enter the workplace and expect to know your job on the first day without guidance. The managers have no clue as to what is going on and if you ask any questions good luck. They are currently going through a migration within the Asset Servicing Department and because know one knows what is going on people are leaving. Their trying to embed a system that cannot handle the work flow with the migration and changes. The employees and managers are young with no experience as well. You work virtually global with people in London which makes it difficult for answers. Within my tenure there was an employee leaving every other day, week, or month. Very unprofessional bank that I regret wasting my time with and very misleading as well. Very micromanaged by people who don't even know the process.. Employees barely take breaks due to the lack of coverage versus work volume. They expect the unexpected. DO NOT DO IT you will totally regret it..Ask many specific questions about job duties if you consider during the interview process as you will be told one thing yet doing another when hired.It is unbelievable what their putting the employees through and management is very high stressed causing stress on the employees making it TOXIC.."
bad,Even when you followed their policies  the blamed you exclusively if a customer had a complaint.  One such policy was you are not allowed to put customer on hold and the limited abilities you had to solve customers issues.
bad,I love working with employees and customers. Company is numbers driven and lacks the needed focus on it employees who are busting there behinds to achieve the numbers
bad,The workload is insane for contractors and expect to work for free lots of free overtime hours. A revolving door policy only a few make it past a few short weeks.
bad,"This place is a madhouse. Coming to work feels like going to the DMV every day. Layer upon layer upon layer of processes that get nothing done and only hurt clients. Managers will not back you up. The environment feels old and stale and your day will be doing mostly compliance. Oh and if that isnt done correctly the client's account gets blocked. So between that and boilerroom style sales calls, thats what the job is about."
bad,Not a great place to work as a consultant. Had a good experience working there but was laid off over night. Hope to never go back there again. Very unstable.
bad,"Training was horrible, teaches you nothing. Good luck advancing, you have to be in your role for a year with little help or assistance if you have any questions."
bad,"The job environment is one that is very stressful. Between having to upkeep standard to keep your job, to having to keep dealing with the stressfulness of every caller, and having to worry if you have a good manager or not."
bad,"I loathed this job.  The management created a culture that took advantage of minorities, and I was actually fired because I was labeled a trouble maker because I adhered to the Fair Labor Standards Act"
bad,"Operating Branch, handling all areas of Branch. Working with Customers daily. Responsible for accounts payable and receivable. Managing Audits and Auditors with a Federal and State guide lines. Working with Distract Manager set and achieve primary goals. Maintain customer portfolio, account ledgers, data input on customers, perform account reconciliations, trained employee, daily cash summaries, payment records maintenance, supervision of employees, manage multiple priorities, account balancing, keyboarding, daily cash reconciliation, accounts payable and receivable monthly."
bad,"RUN FAST Money isn't everything."
bad,Management micromanages everything you do.  If manager decides they don't like you they will find a way to fire you.  Claim to be family friendly but are most certainly not.  Most of long term associates are on short term disability for various mentally and physical conditions brought on by stress working at Citi.
bad,"I worked there 10 years. There was alot of favoritism, drama, gossip, socializing and laziness. I learned alot about production, and how to handle many behaviors."
bad,"The worst company to work for.  "
bad,"The job was stressful....you was forced t up sale to customers as they called in while answering their questions."
bad,"Ethically challenged"
bad,"No offer of advancement, everyone is replaceable. Bonus opportunities are highly advertised but criteria to receive is virtually unattainable. If ending a 10 hr shift makes you ashamed of yourself, then Citi/Collections Department is NOT for you. They only use the word empathy in ""training"". Afterwards, they prefer you get that all mighty dollar no matter the circumstance."
bad,Does education and experiences really matter? 
bad,"The hardest part of the job was taking calls, trying to do what is best for the customer, which in some cases is just explaining their options, or how their credit card works. "
bad,"Managers would do anything to make their employees look bad so they would look good.  They stress about being ""One Team"" but did not follow it.  Management had a history of talking negatively about employees to where others could hear."
bad,"It depended on what position you held and what department you worked in but overall, the managers were not supportive of your desire to advance, any new position would be lateral if any new positions were ever available. The job descriptions on their employment site were long and complicated and had very little to do with the position that were offered. The longer I worked there, the worse I was treated. Moving from collections to Payment Research was a bad decision, I was not trained properly, treated as though I was uneducated and forced to move ""on site"" for 3 weeks training that turned into over 3 months. I was frustrated and the manager who has since retired was not concerned about my needs."
bad,"hours are very flexible, can work early mornings-if you pay the right person, shift bids, very hard to move departments, management either doesn't care or has no knowledge of office practices"
bad,"Substantial opportunity for improvement in regards to compensation, work/life balance, and investment in technology and being competitive in the 21st banking landscape"
bad,"Its a great place to work in, surounded by amazing people to work with. I had an amazing experise an year while working there."
bad,"Citifinancial was a great place to work early in my career there, however Citi went through a senior management change and the culture changed and the company changed."
bad,This company hired me as a part time teller and is demanded to work full time hours while receiving only part time benefits! Citibank does not make it easy for me to advance in my career.
bad,"One of the most interesting places i have ever worked,,,,never again please be aware of the numbers and the unreal goals.. you must sell yourself to meet these numbers...think twice...of accepting an offer..."
bad,"Very good benefits, however work environment is very stressful because of unrealistic goals and management. Too many employees were hired and they took it out on the employees."
bad,"A tough place to work, due to a siloed approach with management.  In addition to being a large retail bank, they have trouble supporting their employees properly.  "
bad,"Ambiente difícil de desenvolver trabalhos profissionais e maduros, devido aos grandes egos a serem considerados em todas as ações desenvolvidas."
bad,Let this be your last option. Senior management treats employees like peasants. Company sued by DOL for labor practices in the AML field. Google it. This company is the devil's best friend.
bad,"I worked for Citi for 12 years.  In that time I was laid off twice, continuously told I was a great asset but consistently rated as average, looked down upon by other departments for being in the ""outcast"" department and reminded often by my manager that I was lucky just to have a job.  Citi does not value its employees.  Each is just a number that is expected to be used until they burn out and are replaced.  Experience is not valued.  There is tension and aggression between divisions at sites as the different businesses are not co-mingling well and management makes no attempt to reconcile that.  Employees are constantly told to do more with less, often picking up for eliminated positions and underperforming employees.  The hardest part was telling my team they were not getting raises each year because the company considered them overpaid for their grade level just because they chose to stay in the same position for 10+ years where they were successful, and then to have to tell them their work was moving offshore to a team that knew nothing about the industry but was 3 times cheaper.  I don't recommend Citi as a place for long term security."
bad,"It is an average place to work as an Investment Rep and can be rewarding as a Financial Advisor, but it ranks below any other customer service rep position that actually pays actual cash bonuses for performance."
bad,"Worst place I have EVER worked!  Since I would not have ""relations"" with my boss & was very professional about it, he was out to get me.  Within 60 days I was terminated for reasons he made up as well as stating he did not get my message when I called off so showed me as a NO SHOW.  Upper management & human resources does not support you either.  I cannot wait until their work environment finally bites them back.  I'm just not one to sue although I probably should have.  If you have options, use them, don't work here."
bad,I enjoyed the people I worked with and built great relationships with them. The job itself changed in a negative way faster than I could believe. The commissions we could make were set higher and higher the more we actually met them and that made it nearly impossible to make ends meet.
bad,"Changing Policies, very very low work moral, insane goals and thats on a good day. Working for thos company, you soon realize that working for this compnay isn't the greatest out their on the job front. Very stressful and crazy expectations....not too mention, the company closed up shop on the international level.  Great Short Term pit stop."
bad,"•	Express Test Center"
bad,Worked for Citi over 20 years and wanted to branch out in the Mortgage industry so resigned on great terms. Wanted to come back a few years later with added experience and they won't even give me an interview. Citi has very poor inexperienced managers running the call center in Jacksonville Florida. Do not waste your time with this company. Check out the rep turnover rate it is extremely high.
bad,"Sweatshop atmosphere, Management doesn't stick up for employees"
bad,"Unrealistic expectations, ever changing direction, very back stabby, they continue to reduce staff and require the same amount of work to get done with less people."
bad,"Not The best Bank to work for, they didn't care much about the employees."
bad,"Company is too big, culture is non-existent. Just a body shop"
bad,You have to work weekends!! ALL the time!! The policies and changes dont make any sense!! No opportunity for advancement!!!!!!!!!! If you have goals and want to be happy in life... RUN!!! NO salary increase that YOU can actually SEE!!
bad,"Sad case. Could not get me to go back. Daily anxiety/torture. Benefits were okay. Was excited about the job until I was there for a couple months. I can go on, but to others, this may be their place to work."
bad,HR is not willing to handle situation for fear of upsetting management.
bad,Citi Mortgage is not a fair company towards clients. Most management is terrible and unknowledgeable. Not willing to assist team in learning and helping clients but more so to earn a bonus and not even help clients in the correct way. Citi lays off the best employees and managers to keep people who will push the other good employees away.
bad,"A typical day at Citi involved a lot of work with little recognition. Most employees had to wait years to get a promotions while others certain employees were given promotions when undeserved. Management gave a hard time about taking days off even though you had days in the system. Management would call on your day off and ask why you didn't come to work. Co-workers were mixed. Some were great people, but most would go behind your back to get ahead. One of the hardest places to work."
bad,This company has changed tremendously over the years.  Senior management constantly has you on conference calls during business  hours and after.  They have unrealistic expectations.  They expect you to just spend all day and night working and could care less about your family life.  You always feel like your job is on the line and to top it off they belittle you and throw sarcasm your way.  I would avoid this company at all costs!
bad,Citi was a highly competative work enviroment and I have a learned a lot.  I have learned how to handle high stress / pressure and multi task multiple applications while managing a team of analyst.
bad,"Sales is the most important thing here, they lie and say customer service. If you are not a great sales person don't work here because eventually you will be terminated "
bad,Higher management was horrible and you felt like you were just there to make their lives easier. The environment was bad and the people were childish.
bad,Citi has outsourced so much of their technology that it is impossible to advance. You could work 10 years in the same place and not go anywhere
bad,"The micromanaging here is TERRIBLE, as well as the quotas, most people cannot meet the requirements set and will face discipline as such. They do not value their employees, you feel as if you are NOTHING but a number to them. They don't listen to employee ideas and input and offer nothing during breaks or anything outside of work. AWFUL COMPANY TO WORK FOR!"
bad,most enjoyable part of day was leaving.
bad,"Below average working environment. There is no work life balance. Technologies are far behind the current."
bad,"Citi was a great place to work until a couple years ago. Tampa site leadership is incompetent. The building is in decay and so infested with rats that the onsite cafeteria was closed by the Health Dept. Work spaces are loud, crowded, and dirty. Technology is so inadequate, basic job functions cannot be performed. Leadership in NYC is completely disconnected. Productivity and morale have declined dramatically in the past 2-3 years."
bad,"Mediocre training.  You learn quickly how disposable you are after training completion.  Not family friendly.  In fact, if you have a family, you probably won't succeed in this position.  Oh, and if you like to  help people, you may get fired."
bad,Citibank was an good employer with good benefits and perks for the employees.  The salary could have been better but on a hold I was pretty happy with my job.  Then we were bought out they came in and laid off  everyone.
bad,Fear is not a great Management tactic but the OM supports it. The managers go behind you to the bathroom to rush you. was there over 15+ years. You must produce or you are out
bad,"great place if you have a team, if not you are doomed. The workload is astronomical and they make sure you drown every day. HR does not care if your managers don't treat you well. You are forced to cope with the circumstances."
bad,"Citi was on of the absolute worst companies I have worked for. You are overworked and under paid. Management is trash , they would rather hire an outside manager who knows nothing rather than pay one inside what they are worth. You do not get time off when you absolutely need it. They expect you to stay seated 98% of your 8 hr workday and micro manage. Worst management team"
bad,"Lack of feeling valued, constant change with lack of communication. Site focuses on sugar coating real issues by adding things like a game room or on site food trucks. Employees take a survey but their opinions are not taken into account when evaluating the survey."
bad,"After over 25 years there, my job was discontinued due to them getting out of the mortgage servicing business. There was zero appreciation or assistance to place me or my associates in a different position.  It was obvious they wanted all 1500 impacted people at my site, GONE. Would never ever suggest to anyone that they should work therem its a tanking and toxic company.  DON'T GO THERE"
bad,Yes you heard it... YES...stay away... go to anywhere else.  If you need a job quick to get some experience then OK .. go there but it is not (in my experience) a good long term environment
bad,"Not a good place to work.  Too much favoritism."
bad,A wretched job i wouldn't inflict on my worst enemy. Brutally bloodthirsty sales culture more suited for a boiler room than a supposed customer service center.
bad,"Untuk ukuran pendapatan citibank memang sangat bagus di bandingkan dengan bank lain,  akan tetapi waktu yang di berikan juga lebih banyak di kantor dan di lapangan "
bad,"Awful managers, systems shut down all of the time. The things you are graded on are not fair and rarely overturned. (they have scorecards and listen to your calls)"
bad,Working hard and giving your all doesn't mean anything. You're just a number and easily replaced. They drive you hard for what Citi needs without consideration for the individuals they are driving
bad,"Trabajo aburrido y repetitivo"
bad,"********DO. NOT. WORK. HERE.******"
bad,"As a universal banker I wore many hats and I was able to contribute to all internal departments. I was able to do teller work, customer service and personal banking. I was able to build my customer service and sales skills. I also learned about all the products and services the bank offered and how all departments collaborate to make the company sucessful. I "
bad,"Bad management and district managers. Favoritism is ridiculous here. Heavy knowledge in operations in required even as a teller. Audits are every quarter and they literally make you miserable coming to work. Everything has to be done a certain way. Nothing is simple here. At the end of the day, tellers can't leave until bankers come and ""inspect"" our drawers. If a banker has a customer at the end of the day or is clogged with work, you'll never leave and go home at a decent time. Close at 5PM to customers but you leave at like 6-6:30PM every night. ZERO staffing. No help. Management does NOT move you up."
bad,Hours hard to work with family life cannot find a daycare open evening hours. Pay is good seems like it's easy to get a raise and the location is in a good spot for 30 minute lunches
bad,I spent the day processing atm transactions and watching for fraud and non-negotiable items.  Made nightly reports pertaining tot he productivity for the day.
bad,Citi group used to be a good place to work.  They termed me due to my past which was provided to my employer at the time of employment in 1995.  They choose to wait almost 23 years before they termed me due to FDIC rules and regulations regarding past criminal history.
bad,"As a former employee in the Operations and Technology sector; promotions,  raises, and benefits were difficult to come by.  Every year, you have to fight, beg and plea for more money but none came.  The salary was good but below other banks."
bad,Jobs moving overseas. Job security is low. Culture is stale. Public image of company is strong but morale of most employees is low.  Back office operations is ignored and treated unfairly.
bad,"I don’t know about every Citi location, but where I was at everything’s your fault. A customer can call in already upset and cursing, but leave it to them to blame you for it, even though you did you job at servicing the customer. Constantly degraded and called out your name, no type of support, and don’t get sick. They claim paid days off, you have to work and make up your sick time, new rule they had at our location."
bad,"My experiences at Citi reflect only on the group which I work with/for. Verbal abuse, threats and retaliation for dissenting view points, fraudulent reporting, redundant and overly manual processes all have made for an overall poor work experience. Other groups within Citi appear to be more ethical and provide better working conditions. My experiences are typical of others in my role."
bad,The training did not give enough practice cases to get an understaning of the job role.  The manager was never there to give assistance and you had to rely on other teammates who rarely wanted to assist you.
bad,"Only a good place to begin your professional career, once you become the professional that the business and you deemed to be, one should move on. Really."
bad,"My short time at Citi Margin Ops can only be described as a living nightmare. To start there is quite clearly minimal communication between HR and the department as there had been no indication of my start date, I spent majority of my first month awaiting systems to be put in place for me to work with. "
bad,"If you are in it for only the money, then it's OK anything else your require such as good managers; go work somewhere else! This survey wouldn't let me out unless I added more information about this company. However, I have nothing more to say about them."
bad,Too many layers and too many confusing directives. Most are odds with each other and to get anything down you have to beg and pray. On top of all this there is zero growth track or plans to help you advance with your career.
bad,If you are young and want to advance or develop a professional career. Citibank is not the place. They just need monkeys in seats to answer the phones. You can't even go to the bathroom if you have to.
bad,"Citi is not a great workplace. There is constant back stabbing, much like a high school environment. You are underpaid almost 30% compared to similar jobs across the United States. If you show that you are reliable and can accomplish tasks, you are not compensated, only given added responsibilities. Unlike colleagues who give half the effort, who in return get half the responsibilities and the same exact pay."
bad,"If you can help it don't work here!! Terrible training, no management, the management that is there doesn't know anything. you basically have to teach yourself how to do your job in this department. NO ONE wants to help with issues within the dept. Management acts like they care but they really don't. Lots of young people employed so lots of drama comes with that."
bad,"Falta formação adequada para os gerentes e gestores, pois não trabalham em equipe e a cultura da empresa é impedir o crescimento profissional e nenhum investimento ou incentivo para formação do profissional."
bad,"The hardest part of the day are the customers screaming at you over websites and calling you names because they cannot understand how to register online."
bad,"Employer will pay great, but when it comes to the ""culture"" it is a double edged sword, they strive to be the best and take care of their clients, but they do not take care of their employees unless you are one of lucky selected."
bad,"cab facility is not good, working hours is 9.5 , work environment is not good , there is no transparency in IJP's , management is not interactive ....."
bad,Told to go out on Unpaid Leave of Absence and never came back or received a dime in support from the company. Would not recommend this company for employment as they lied to me
bad,My division was constantly changing their rules for processing paperwork. It was an inefficient place to work at. The work culture was horrible. The cafeteria food was horrible as well.
bad,"Citibank of course has banking hours which is a plus. the management is horrible, the stress is not worth it, the culture is a more mellow but can also turn into a hostile one really fast because if money is missing, if you take in cash to much money, if you forgot a procedure, they can fire you on the spot."
bad,"I worked here for 5 months and it was pure misery "
bad,i cant stand this place. managers dont understand that employees have lifes out side of work and that sometimes get in the way and not every one can handle big changes.
bad,"point balance carry broker accounts. define & resolve trade & cash breaks between customer accounts & carry broker accounts. "
bad,"Worst place to work period.  You are never told what you do right but slammed whenever you do something wrong.  The management team is never available to help and when they are, they make you feel like you are intruduing,  The moral at this work place is so low you can feel it when you walk in the door.  Its all about the numbers and the money and who cares about the employees.  absolutely horrible.  To top everything off, you can't get a pension no matter how many years you work there"
bad,"A typical business day is managing your time between walk in clients and making sure your sales calls are done as well as training, operations, and making your monthly sales goals. Also, need to be well liked by management."
bad,"Unethical work place hostile enviormaent, work lost mitigation for three and half  hardest part of the job is deal with management"
bad,"I was excited, really excited about working here. Not only was the pay amazing but so were the benefits. Sour not was co-workers having a ""I'm better than you attitude"" and management not doing a thing about it."
bad,"I recently worked as a teller for Citibank N.A, where I accurately kept records of money and negotiable instruments involved in a financial institution's various transactions. The teller meets the needs of customers by providing quality service."
bad,The job was very stressful and managers like to throw alot of responsabilities that do not belong with your job title.
bad,"Citi is a great place to work. As long as you are political and in with the right people, you will do well. Don't work harder than your boss; don't believe your hard work or saving the company millions today will mean they will keep you tomorrow. You are a commodity; an asset while they need you, a liability around bonus time. Citi is at best a job, don’t think of it as a career. Just get in and get out and then find a career company that will appreciate you and your work ethic."
bad,There is no life work balance with this job. Low pay for the high stress of the job. Need to pay more. No growth opportunity that the job you are currently doing. Do receive bonuses but have to jump through all kinds of hoops to be able to keep and receive the bonuses. No job security.
bad,"Very poor treatment of staff. unrealistic goals, tyrants, threats, fear, unstable, no opportunity for growth, reward based on tenure not performance. new employees get raises old ones are capped out. rude, unprofessional and abusive practices. no support for management. very high turnover."
bad,"My father just passed away so I called the 866 number and was routed to my old manager.  (They just changed all the teams around in highline Dept.) I left a detailed message with my phone number, advised I wouldn't be at work the rest of the week. This particular manager already knew the situation because my father had stage 4 lung cancer. The funeral was on a Friday and when Monday rolled around I still wad not ready to go back to work. I called in again, this time using my planned/vacation time. I was then sent a letter saying to contact my manager because I abandoned my job. I immediately called my manager,  gave him all the info on my dad's obit and funeral and advised that my phone bill does indeed reflect where I had called in to work. He then advised me that my job was terminated because I didn't use ""proper call in procedures"". To say I was completely dumbfounded would be putting it lightly. I called the labor board and they advised me I did indeed have a case and that they will be opening an investigation on my behalf since I have proof of calling in everyday. I can't believe they have the audacity to do this to people."
bad,"I have wokred at citibank for over 3 years now, Ive finally been able to have the money to start school and advance my education, citi was not will to work with me for a 32 hour work week. They would only allow me to stay full time. I have to start school it is not an option. Im sad that i can not stay for much long but I need to find a job that has better work.life balance."
bad,"When you first start the position, they will make you all the promises in the world. You will probably begin in the collections department, until they run of money to collect. If you happen to take a certain amount of days off from work, n they will give you the option of migrating (or be terminated)to the customer service department. This is really when you want to start looking for another position, as you will be rushed through the training (minimal navigation and no substantial sales training)program. I learned how the right to work laws (NC) cripple the chance to obtain valid opportunities in management, as Citi creates a revolving door effect for its' employees. Every October and November they hire for collections, while they shorten their customer service workforce (which is replaced by previous collections workers). After they release you they will attempt to get out of the unemployment insurance claim. If you run into this problem, make sure that you extend the process longer by changing the ESC appeals date as much as you can."
bad,"In the 21 months at Citi, Senior management was virtually non existant. Being a new manager, this support was critical to learning to manage."
bad,"This was supposed to be an amazing place to work until I started working here. Sat for 2 months watching someone else work and not do anything because that is their ""training"". Then get reprimanded for not knowing stuff I was never shown. Was told hours were flexible and could telecommute. Never happened. Schedule is set not flexible and hours are very early in the morning. Let's just say before the sun comes up.. There is not a telecommute option. Never would have taken the job if not falsly advertised. Management is awful, awful, awful!!! They definitely play favorites. Micro manage to the max. Rules dont apply to them . Will yell at you for stuff you have never been trained on, dump stuff on you that they should be doing. They penalize you for doing stuff that is ""ok"" for them to do but not for you. Talk down to you like you are 2 years old and the list goes on. TAKE IT FROM ME-THIS PLACE SUCKS!! I AM A CURRENT EMPLOYEE BUT AS SOON AS I FIND A NEW JOB I AM GONE!!!! Worst Experience in my life!!!!"
bad,1) culture of nothing can change except if regulators required
bad,"I've worked at this company for over 9 years and have seen the culture change from a company you would want to work for to a company you should avoid working for. Yearly reviews are meaningless as Everyone gets the same review, from the person putting in 12+ hour days to the person who should have been fired.. advancement is nearly impossible. I picked up and moved my family to Tampa florida at the companies request only to find out 2 years later that the company's focus has shifted to Texas, needless to say i received my first bad review in 9 years for the sole reason to Lay me off and move my position to Texas. Loyalty to long term employees is not one of their strong suits."
bad,"My typical day at Citibank was arriving a half hour early before start of shift and getting prepared for the day. Shift started at 8;30 AM and spent the entire day on the phones assisting customers with their questions on their gas credit card account. I learned that when people get nasty on the phones, that you have to let it roll off your back. Loved all of the people that I worked with. The hardest part of the job was selling, but the most enjoyable part of the job was the compliments that you get at the end of the phone call."
bad,"As long as the work gets done, management doesn't care about how bad the work atmosphere is. Everyone is out to get everyone no matter whos feet they step on or how many lies they tell. The noise level on the production floor is so loud, but not because of all the machines running but because of the 65 different radios blasting 65 different music. Nobody takes their job serious. The site is run so backwards that they keep and promote the worst poeple and out and get rid of the people that try and make a difference and take their job serious. I was the top producer, but that didn't matter. The pay is meager compared to other silmilar jobs. I make more now at the company that I'm currently employed than I did at Citigroup. I worked at the Dallas, TX Card Issuance site, so stay away from there"
bad,Citi rolled out with a new pay system and still today they have not paid workers ot and sick pay. Citi has poor communication and dont even write you up. They fired me for something stupid but i didnt sign write ups so its basically hear say. Citi is so unorganized its insane. Managers dont value you and if you dont have time to take off you get in trouble for it. I dont recommend anyonworking
bad,I am an African American woman who has worked at Citi in Buffalo for 6 months and am already searching for another job.  African Americans are not valued in this company. This company talks about diversity and inclusion but they have a lot of work to do. Their focus is more on the clients than employees but the pay is ok and the schedules are flexible
bad,Terrible place to work.  Management is horrible.  There is no job advancement opportunities.  Layoffs happen constantly and if a job below your previous position becomes available you are not eligible for it.
bad,"Right now they’re trying to get rid of as many people as possible, they’re making harder and harder restrictions that even their tenured agents can’t keep up with. They’re taking away some benefits that kept a lot of people there. And you’re doing more work for less pay now."
bad,If you like being told to do this or that one way and 2 days later  you get wrote up for it then get a job at Citi. The confusion is off the chart at this place the right hand doesn't know what the left hand is doing and thats management.
bad,Citi is really a bad organisation. My manager and his manager comes with short vision. They had no experience in my domain and compare with other technology always. Being hired as a Senior BA always forced to work on java. Ended up quitting the organisation because of bad culture.
bad,This is a global company where you will come across with many and different management styles.  The key is to adapt to those styles and constant change.
bad,"This job gave me more anxiety than any other job. As an agent you are required to adhere to a strict schedule, you have to track EVERYTHING. If you log off for even one minute outside your break it has to be tracked and sent to your manager at the end of the day. I didn’t even feel that I could drink water too much throughout the day because I would have to track my bathroom visits. The company does offer great benefits and that’s the only thing that kept me there. They pay just enough to keep you there because you feel like it’s a higher pay rate than most. You are offered incentives in most roles, and sometimes I would get it, but they continue to raise the standards constantly so the goals are harder to reach. The micromanaging was ridiculous. Not only that but the abuse that you take from the callers really tears you down. It’s constant. It makes working in that environment even worse. I would get there just to hope I could leave early. Was not worth it."
bad,"Citi excuses the hostile  work environment found in some departments by labeling it as a ""culturally diverse"" workplace. Tempers are allowed to flare in unprofessional ways because it is just ""cultural differences"". More worried about how long you are away from your desk than employees who create a negative environment. Bully mentality and gossip is rampant. Oppressive culture due to unchecked employees."
bad,There is no chain of command everyone from the projects team to the scanner repair man is telling employees what to do. No follow through and a complete lack of any disciplinary repercussions. If you want to skate through an 8 hour day doing whatever you want Citi is the place.
bad,Citi is a great place to work.  The culture is in invited and team oriented.  There is a heavy focus on moving jobs out of the US and into Mumbai India.
bad,"It was an alright place to work. When you do the initial phone interview you need to think about the shift that you need to get into before you speak with the person interviewing you. Otherwise you will have to fight tooth and nail to get into a shift that works better for you, or start looking elsewhere. "
bad,"Poor management, low pay, lots of criteria to be judged on and compete over regarding how much money you can suck out of struggling people. Mangers are unavailable or not knowledgeable about the products and the amount of verbal abuse you will suffer through on calls is wearying."
bad,"Citi was under a cease and desist, therefore working conditions were awful, back office did not work, no accountability. Processes were under development and did not seem to work."
bad,"Politics, favoritism, and forced to sell products that is not competitive to other banks. Pay is way too low and the technology is out of date. We still us DOS here"
bad,"Be prepared for constant change, with unclear oversight.  Employee must improvise dramatically and be able to work independently with no clear path for resolution"
bad,"In training they hype the bonus potential, on the call floor, if you deviate from your schedule more than 6 minutes ( bathroom breaks etc), take a day off (even paid ), or fail two calls for the month, you’re  not eligible.    "
bad,"Management does not know what they are doing, and it's not a good environment to thrive in unless you can take inconsistency and stress. You have to have a lot of patience to deal with the rude customers who scream, curse and treat you like anything less than human to get what they want with no support of the company. If the customers don't like company policy or just hate the company but love you, Citi holds you at fault for not better handling something beyond your pay grade. The turnover rate is extremely high, there is a new training class every week. I have had 5 managers in one year. The best part about Citi is the vacation/holiday time/pay, benefits and leaving at the end of your shift. The most enjoyable part are the events and family nights. Citi does know how to treat your family, just not the employees. Protocol changes on a day to day basis and communication between every level needs serious work. It's easy for something to get lost in translation, it's basically a d**n if you do, d**n if you don't type situation."
bad,"The management is forever changing and all about their bonus, not the employee or customers. We are constantly under scrutiny from the federal government. Doing more with less has become our company slogan."
bad,Even the top performers have no job security.  Senior management is inconsistant and constantly changes procedures that are perfectly fine.  That is all I have to say about this company.  I never liked working there.
bad,The managements do not know what is going on. Politics play a big part in your success. It all depends in the area you work and who you know. Make sure you ready to kiss some behind if you want succeed
bad,"Great place to work, your basic phone service work place.  With the nature of its type of work they do perform an occasional ""purge"" since the rules for its type of work are in a constant cycle of change."
bad,"This is a very stressful job I don't recommend Citi. Don't work at Citi. The best thing about Citi is the benefits for health care, dental and vision. They don't work with your every day life."
bad,"Process health claim 50 a day learned how the research claim and request documents need to process claim ,enjoyable part was speak with the client  and insurance companies"
bad,Management is all over the place. Not worth the hassle or stress. There is a lack of opportunity for growth as they insist on hiring up from within but has not been prevalent during my tenure.
bad,this job is very stressful and mentally draining.  The cardholder are not nice and management is terrible.  Management is unwilling to work with you and get better hours for you.  They only care about themselves and not the employees that they micro manage
bad,"Dramatic changes over the past 5-8 years have taken a toll on Citi. What was once a pleasurable work environment has become very stressful and demoralizing. Although part of this is attributable to the industry's evolution and regulatory burdens being faced by all participants, a large portion is also due to poor management decisions, inconsistent leadership, lack of foresight and the never ending legacy of the S. Weill/Commercial Credit /era."
bad,"Citibank is a job that requires you to become a slave sitting in front of a computer for the rest of your life and doing ""dirty work"". You collect money from people who owe it, yet the constant stress and horrible customer makes the job very hard to stay at. Also, there has been at least one suicide by workers there each year, for the last ten years. I would say that should be a good indicator as to how horrid the job circumstances are."
bad,"I worked for many banks before and Citibank is a terrible place to work. It is very stressful."
bad,"Absolutely zero job security; Management turnover is so frequent that there is never a clear direction on where the company, or any functional department for that matter, is going.  They have to pay above market rates to maintain or draw any level of labor pool talent.  In 25 years, worst place I have ever worked unfortunately."
bad,"very cut throat business, right and wrong is entirely decided daily based on whether someone made money or not, strict and ongoing outside regulation is an absolute must for this industry"
bad,"If you are legitimately looking for a stable job/career and are a parent, please do not work here. I really like the fast paced easy work and diverse culture when I started. "
bad,I worked in many department here and they all sucked. they don't care about u or what your going through. ur a number. they put your stats on the wall so every one can see the mistakes u make.
bad,Collect on personal loans and set up payment plans to bring account current. Assist in the best way possible with the client. Made sure everyone understood their roles. Very helpful and friendly co-workers.
bad,"Management very cold and have their own motives they will keep who they like and can anyone with they don't like.  "
bad,"Very stressful, they don't care for the client, their only goal is sales."
bad,Interaction with regional sales force. Always the top one or two representatives in monthly sales. Allowed me to train other representatives
bad,"Citi is up for sale, have been for years.  And that is the way that they managed. I loved my job and loved working with my customers. However, you could tell that the company did not feel that way about their employees.  We were always micro managed and would excessive hours for now reason."
bad,"Co-workers are great, Just from a business perspective very unorganized, employees get the run around, never follow through with whats said."
bad,"worked midnight - 8am, batched passports for processing,"
bad,Not a good experience at all. Get mostly copy and print tasks.
bad,"After dedicating 6 years of my life to the company I was walked out the door because its cheaper to hire new people than it is to keep the loyal ones. Would not recommend even to my worst enemy, if you like being used and walked on go ahead and apply"
bad,I would like to see management listen to those who understand what drives the numbers on the spread sheet than to to make up answers.
bad,"If you are a person who likes to be bullied and scared to breathe when at work, then Citi is the place for you. Particularly First and Bullard. Previous management was fine, but the new manager not only bullies staff, but clients as well. A client may come in to order a new replacement debit card, and the manager will try to force you into a credit card and a mortgage application. I felt terrible watching these poor customers get pushed into things they do no want or need. Also, if you do not kiss her rear, she will find a way to get you fired. And she is patient. In the last 6months, I believe 4 people have been let go. There are only 5 tellers by the way. If you try to ask for help, Corporate will try to push it under the rug because they don't want the bad representation."
bad,"It is a great company. I believe the site un San Antonio was much more organized and consistent with their processes and communication. In Kansas City, there was not very many opportunities for advancement."
bad,"I was at Citi 10 years and always rated Consistently Strong The bonuses aren't much in Collections. I got approximately .50/yr raises. They just started paying 15.00/hr, so now I'm earning what a new hire will earn. I was working 4days a week,  32 hrs. Then they changed everyone's schedule and now have to work 5 days a week part time"
bad,"Possibly the worse company to work for. My first day I was staff would not allow me in because no one had told them that a new employee was starting. My first month i was told i was told horrible things about company from vet employees. 3 months into my position manager goes on vacation while ""assistant was left in charge"" so what does Assistant do? He takes his vacation too and leaves me alone new ba"
bad,Stay away from here ! Too much buddy buddy system.....Management needs more training and promoted on friendship  not ability . Only few good managers at the Ft Mill location.
bad,"From broken promises to a broken culture, this was easily one of the worst places I have worked. Promising opportunities and hours and quickly realizing how none of it is true is what you have to look forward to here."
bad,they do NOT give you the training or support or skills that you need to do your job and expect you to do unrealistic numbers and expectations for the job with no training or skills to do that job and they do not support your work life balance at all they give you all this time to take and then penalize you when you need to use it for that work life balance.
bad,"The department I worked in was very fast-paced and hectic without much managerial support. Low morale was a constant issue, especially when all the people of color began to be fired."
bad,"Management sucks in the Credit Department. The management are all about Favoritism. If you don’t work overtime then you are threatened with your endly raise. The building is ate up with fleas and bed bugs!!! They never close not even for ice and if you call in or are late because of weather, it will count against you."
bad,"If you’re ever looking for a company that will promise you the world and only give you a pebble, this will be place to work for. The management is sub-par at best, with the lesser managers playing favorites and what-not. There is a lack of training and inconsistency is apparent. You’ll find that no two individuals know the same information. Everything that is learned is heresy.  The people that constantly work hard are credited or rewarded for the work that they produce. To work there would be just for the paycheck and benefits, nothing else."
bad,Management is not fair.  Oblivious to things happening.  Managers rate their employees low so their employees cannot get a raise.  Management fires people.
bad,"Working environment is great as long as the numbers are way up - if they are not there is abuse from upper management that doesn't promote professional growth.  "
bad,"no social interaction"
bad,"I worked full-time, 8 hours daily, 40 hours weekly so it was good at first. I learned a lot from in-house banking, learned many facets of the business. The management was good, up until I was transferred to another location, then everything went down from there. My co-workers were ok w/ me, up until I was sent to another location. The hardest part of my job was dealing w/ the pressure of a certain ops. manager who became a pain on my side until I was released from service because of her. I loved getting paid weekly what I was making an hour on this job."
bad,"I worked as a sales executive in Citibank for two years and convinced the customers for credit cards and cars,i worjed very hard with this bank for 2 years"
bad,"I would not recommend seeking employment at Citi.  Senior management is not informative, guiding or encouraging.  It is a very silo environment which does not promote growth or learning about other lines of business."
bad,"inbound call center for Sears.  I learned different products that Sears offer.  Management was not very helpful, my 2 yrs was very ill at that time, so I had to resign.  I enjoyed working will different cultures .  Hardest part of my job was not being able to work like I would have wanted to due to my child being ill all the time."
bad,"Tthe environment is fun, its busy all day and never a boring moment. everyone is treated with respect and the dwell on team building."
bad,The company had alot of issues and it was close due to the fact that the loans were being processed
bad,Environment is too much of a call center environment. Employees are mirco managed. Is not a place for professional growth. Little to no input from employees.
bad,"Was a lot of fun, until i did the right thing by reporting fraud by another employee,  then it went bad for me.  I did what was right, but the manager and district manager turned on me"
bad,I witnessed some horrible actions by managers. They lacked the knowledge of RESPECT for there employees. Your lucky if you come across some good people. If you need a job apply. If not look else where. Especially if you don’t know your stuff. I witnessed a harassment and nothing was done to the manager if anything the area manager backed him up. And if you call HR just makes things worse fo
bad,You can make the same amount of money picking up toys at Walmart than here and deal with the stress of getting yelled at or failing a call for something really stupid where you don’t get a bonus for that month
bad,"I have been in the investment and financial services industry for 15 years and worked for some large professional firms in my time like pwc etc."
bad,"Working at Citi felt empty just like managements empty gestures. The Good Mornings and Great work comments were empty and felt forced. What I learned was Citi knows how to play its card without getting caught. "
bad,"I really gave that company my all, and in return, they took it and demanded more. The layoffs were sudden and harsh, and left many people who had given 5+ years of excellent service to this company with NOTHING."
bad,"The voice of the employees does not matter and micromanagement is rampant."
bad,"I worked there way to long and to be honest, I'm ashamed that I did. The management there was horrifying and mostly from England where hygiene is bad and the behavior displayed to American employees in particular was biased AND racist."
bad,"busy branch and bad management. I will not recommend to work in this place if you would like to work in a good company culture. However, you will learn a lot in this branch since there are alot of the customers in this area will use the window service."
bad,"Working for Citi was a valuable experience for me and I learned a lot.  I hope to never be so desperate to have to be employed there again.  Although I worked with some really wonderful people who I will remain friends with, the management in Macy's Collections is seriously lacking.  They are very disorganized and lack accountability.  For anyone with a sincere interest in building a career on integrity, I would have to advise them to move on.  This place is the epitome of toxic."
bad,I love working for Citi but my passion was working with chideren that's the only reason I left.  They have great benefits and I would recommend this job to anyone looking to get into the mortgage field.
bad,Great place to work If you are in school. Hours are flexible and great opportunity as a startup to built valuable skills .
bad,"A typical day at Citi was very stressful and didn't receive assistance as promised."
bad,"If you do not mind quotas and high sales targets, then this may fit your style.  The work hours are decent, and the benefits are good. But be prepared to meet some pretty high stress and sales targets."
bad,was a good learning experience enjoyed working with people and helping with their needs
bad,"I enjoyed my job as a collector II, because I could help residental customers get out of debt."
bad,"For the most part their is no work/life balance with Citi Bank. The greatest part of the job may be some of my co-workers that I work with. I've learned that everything sounds great when being hired for the company however, when actually working for the company things change very quickly. Athough personalities are things that must be dealt with, many on the management team are very rude and difficult to work with. Compensation is not the best based on the practices Citi Bank uses in order to make sales. tellers must refer products at all times, however, personal bankers and managers are the ones that reep the benefits of the teller referls financially."
bad,Working at Citi in the personal loan dept was a horrible experience. The managers were terrible.
bad,*A typical workday was doing the accounting for my managers expences and doing a report.
bad,"This was without a doubt one of the worst jobs that I've had the misfortune of having. management behaving like high schoolers and gossiping in front of employees as well as employees gossiping about each other and management. Nothing stayed consistent, policies were constantly not followed and the employees were blamed for mistakes made by unknowledgable management. During my time there, which was under a year, I was assigned to 4 different managers (all of which were clueless). The people who moved up in the company were the ones going out after work with the higher ups and getting drunk. Overall, this place is a absolute train wreck."
bad,Este lugar esta lleno de vivoras y en especial los manegadores de espanol. Son bien TRANSAS no lo Agas. Busca in trabajo menos estresante!!!! Te estan amenasando a cada moment Y so buscas allude te corren. Corre antes de meter te con esta bola de vivoras
bad,Let me put it this way . Spanish department for customer service is the worse place to work for. I had been working for them for 4 years and the moment I asked for help the manager had me fired to avoid me. I absolutely regret working here. don’t give your energy and work to this company and if you do just remember you don’t have a word or say here. They do whatever they want full of CROOKS
bad,"Easy to get lost in the shuffle, It is a numbers game, don't really care about losing customers. However they focus heavily on Customer service surveys and employees have no control over scores only to completely kiss customer rear ends and hope that one doesn't leave mad because Policy will not let you help their situation."
bad,"Two things that were absolutely horrible about this job. They have nothing in place to assist people who are new to having assistance with a disability. I had to leave work early for doctor appointments that were for my disability and it was eating all my paid time off and my manager threatened that there maybe repercussions if I had to take unplanned unpaid time, even though it was all for my disability. Then all throughout training other agents in my class kept harassing me and no matter how many times I spoke to the trainer aid nothing and I mean NOTHING was done to stop the behavior. It got to the point I had to go to the ER due to anxiety attacks!"
bad,"They will lure you in with the benefits, but the environment is extremely stressful.  They give you days off to be able to use right away when you start if needed, but you aren't supposed to use them and will hold it against you if you need to.  Your performance is strictly based on what you can collect and bully the customers for and set them up for automatic payments.  Anything else they tell you won't really matter.  That's 70% of your performance.  The bottom line is that they don't pay enough to get yelled and cursed at by customers and work the horrid hours."
bad,I use to be so proud that I worked for citi . However over the years it has gotten worse . I hate working here  There are poor choices in the management they hire most have no knowledge of daily operations but act like they do which is Terrible.  Too many chiefs and they treat the temp talent terrible they work a full 18 months with promises that they will be hired permanently and never get hired they use them until there 18 months are up and bye bye . Its so many horrible things I can say but I'll stop there . You do not want to work here the turnover is overwhelming.
bad,"High stress jobs at all levels. Payroll often miscalculated paychecks by amounts of more than $100. Impossible to reach Payroll by phone to complain. Team leader stole my idea for improvements, which created an entire new department. Team leader received a major promotion for work done entirely by me and another employee on our own time. We received $100 each for ""helping."" We were not allowed to work in the new department we had created. Management refused to hear our complaints. Greatly enjoyed the work, but the site management stinks. Pay rates low when compared to other companies doing the same work."
bad,Understaffed not a lot of locations so always overworked I don't not recommend working here if you are a student especially at certain branches most branches rarely have the full staffing worked 6 days a week full day as a part time employee because of staffing
bad,the customer service unit for citi is very poor over a 70% turn over in that department is not a good company (especially customer service) to work for
bad,Basic the working experience till now is good but the salery is very low as well as the incentives are not comming
bad,"Reviewed customer accounts to make necessary risk assessment to determine whether to initiate contact with card members by direct phone or to proceed with variable protocol to ensure the lowest level of fraud"
bad,"I learnt lot time management, team work,work accomplishment"
bad,"I have never found a more negative place to work. All about the negative. Should be corrected or alerted to errors, but in the department I was Custordial Operations that is what it was about."
bad,"I underwent extensive, fast-paced training that lasted three weeks.  Once the training period had ended and I had begun working at my desk as a Personal Banker, I was no longer ""allowed"" to ask questions, as per my branch manager.  From my first week up until my last, she was undoubtedly rude to me, unhelpful any time that I had requested her to review an urgent document, and extremely unprofessional in the workplace as she publicly showed her frustration/stress in-front of our customers. From time to time, I even had to reach out to the bank tellers for assistance and yet there was only so much that they could do. I lasted at this branch no more than nine months. Perhaps re-locating to another branch location with a new branch manager would have convinced me to stay with the company, but, I didn't want to risk it."
bad,"The hardest part of this job is dealing with management. I had good management and I had bad management. The job was good. I worked with really awesome people and loved the coworkers. The job wasn't bad, however management made it awful."
bad,NA- I wish to not but my likes and dislikes about this company. All I can say is there reason I am leaving is due to not having any work life balance.
bad,I do a variety of inbound outbound calls - invoicing legal bills for legal action on accounts. working queues under 30 days overdue. I work with a  great team.  I find it rewarding to be able to assist customers.  I don't find anything hard about my job
bad,"I wouldn't recommend Citibank to anyone who's looking for a career in banking . citibank only cares about certain types of businesses."
bad,it's a corporate culture so it's a kissin' buttz and gain your superiors' liking type of place. company did invest tons of money into the technology to impress clients.  Customize servicing packages to meet various clients demands.
bad,Hated it. Can't just sit at a desk taking complaint calls all day
bad,I did learn how to do sales over the phone and i meet some great people. The hardest part of the job was meeting sales quotas that were a bit outlandish.
bad,corporate espoused culture is not reflected in field offices
bad,"At first I loved working here everyone is always nice when your the new employee. My first 3 managers were so nice, caring and were always there to help me succeed. Then I switched to a different department and this is when it all changed. After being there for almost 4 years I started to hate coming into work because these managers only cared about ac few employees their favorites. They allowed some of my co-workers get away with certain things but if someone else did it they would get in trouble or written up for it. One manager in specific was picking on a few of us, he was being racist. I went to the main boss of that department to talk to him and he had my manager there. First of all there is an open door policy when I ask to speak to someone in private I expect it to be that person only. These two managers made me so uncomfortable, I told them what was going on, how I felt about it and was told this is work we don't come to work to have fun. I loved the benefits this place offers but bad management will make someone want to leave."
bad,"Citi was once a great company, not any more. The only care about bottom line. Citi doesn't care about their employee, just their bottom number.. And to keep from getting fined by the Government. Stop giving insentives, nothing to look forward to, no company picnic, no Christmas Parties offered by company. Just a job. Didn't feel valued as a employee."
bad,"The pressurized Work environment"
bad,"Extremely unrealistic expectations of management in terms of delivering against set goals, mainly because resources have been cut or just don't exist. Meeting after meeting, too many conference calls. Morale at all time low. Many are leaving so their health doesn't deteriorate to an early end of life. Does the Executive Suite know, or even care?"
bad,Job is super stressful and that few months I spent at citi was the most miserable time of my life. I became depressed and cryed every morning before going to work.
bad,"Citibank was a great place to work back in 2000, probably one of the best employers in Missouri. However, they are in a retrenching mode and are no longer competitive. Jobs are being eliminated, and Citi has largely surrendered the domestic market to its rivals and moved most of its operations to foreign shores. Citibank forces an abnormal liberal agenda upon everyone, whether they want it or not. Somewhere, working for Citi is probably still good, but you better be able to speak Hindi, Tagalog, or Mandarin. What was once the largest financial institution on the planet now isn't even in the top ten. Stock prices are in the toilet, growth is negative, and customer relations are suffering greatly. While the tombstone hasn't been finished yet, you can hear someone chiseling away on the granite."
bad,Citi started off being a great company to work for. Once Private label was shipped out the moral went down and so did the bonuses. Management was stressed out and they took it out on the team.
bad,Seniors managers are more focus on saving money which leads to frequent turnover. Poor management and do not care about the employee performance and do the online assessment on which they show high performance in paper only.
bad,At first I liked working in this office. The longer I was there the more work the manager would put off on me and another employee in the office. She would be in and out all day and we would be responsible for not only our daily work but a lot of hers as well.
bad,"Never work at Hands on Physical therapy! Run as far away as you can. Pay is awful. They only care about themselves , keep you until not need you then fire you. So un organized. Awful patient care , awful job training , therapist leaves at 3 so not enough hours, Charleston computer program ever. Never seen so many computer problems with any company ."
bad,"At the end of the month the manager make us go and collect payments from the customers."
bad,"Typical call center job sitting all day making calls. Helps to get hired into the right portfolio for your personal strengths, otherwise you are stuck. Some managers are phenomenal while others don't assist you or are not present when needed. Great culture for some but depends on the person. Not the job for everyone"
bad,"Like every other big banks, Citi has beens struggling for years trying to turn profitable through laying off people and restructuring which was never effective"
bad,Citi managers have no clue of the workload the reps handle but love to fire people. Citi underpaid us to the point they was made to give us a raise it was not at all.
bad,There were not a lot of positives while working for Citi.  I was not fairly compensated and management was not the best to work for.   Would not recommend.
bad,Dont go here if you are looking to move up. They only move up people they like. Management lies to its employees on a regular basis. They do not like aggressive women.
bad,"But after working there for a year and never once had any issues with anything, until they moved me to another team. I felt like I have to do so much extra stuff to do in order to be able to take days off that is needed. They say that they'll flex your hours for different days, but only when it's most convenient to them and that's if they'll let you flex those hours."
bad,"This was my first ""real"" job after college.  Learned a TON from co-workers about how the financial markets actually function.  "
bad,They no longer have a cedar rapids location.   Overall they paid great and it looks good on a resume but I did not learn anything new and the banking compliance you have to endure gets pretty annoying.    If they did'nt just leave town even though management was not good and the job was not great i would have stuck it out for the pay.
bad,"a lot of micromanaging and favoritism. If you are not Hispanic they threat you like animals . The training is very poor the training they give you is different when you get on the floor. Its a sink or float environment. The seniors act like you bothering them if you don't understand something. the AML department is not a secured job, its a revolving door. They get rid of you just for asking a question if they don't like you. They set the bar very high to make it impossible to make production. They treat their contract employees like animals. Citi is a good place to work just not the AML Department."
bad,"I have been a part of the automotive repair industry for nearly 10 years. Recently I have acquired employment at Pep Boys, but I have also acquired a guard card. I have been optimistic about the opportunities in law enforcement and see myself working as a security guard as the first step on my journey. That is what brings me here, to find work as a security guard."
bad,"a typical day at work is an easy day wether your busy or not , Citi Mortgage was the easy place to work, what i learned is i learned alot about mortgages that i didnt know about . Management is horrible , if you miss a day then they want to fire you , its ridicious , i loved the co-workers that i had around me they were always trying to get the job done, there was no hard part to the Job i had, the most enjoyable part of the job was having co workers i could turn to when i needed help and there right there to help you ,"
bad,no swipe in swipe out required. cab facility is provided. good for working as team member and single. hike will be based on year all performance and project ratings
bad,You are required at Citi to work quickly and at the same time be completely accurate. Your time per call should not exceed 2 minutes. Which is ridiculous.
bad,"My day will start at 9:30am with a Hurdle conducted by our Branch Manager. Next around 10:00am we would open the Branch if there was not clients to help. I would follow up with clients and several task. However, if clients were there to help. I would help them with their Financial Needs. We would clos the Branch at 5:00pm. I learned a lot of sell skills and great customer service. Also, I learned how to know different cultures and different personalities not only with my clients, but with my coworkers. Management was not that great at my Branch we had a good Branch Manager but a Terrible Assistant Manager that would not complete all her job and only assigned the job to others to do for her, horrible attitude. The hardest part sometimes was meeting with the high goals since they reduced way too much the points on the products we were selling. I enjoyed helping out my clients and building great long term relationships with them."
bad,"Management is incompetent and unrealistic in its expectations of employees (as a collective.) They are also lacking in reward for those particular employees who actually exceed the exorbitantly high bar that is set because they are ""grading on a curve"" when it comes to the review process. It is also very much a good ole boys club when it comes to hiring, bonus, and performance appraisals."
bad,If I hadn't needed emergency surgery and unbeknownst to me had to stay in the hospital for well over 5 months I would still be there. It's a great place to work.
bad,"Lack of work/life balance, egotistical managers, high pressure environment which can be extremely stressful, not for the faint of heart"
bad,"Same as Discover"
bad,"A 'Completely Terrible Employment Agency/Workplace'; Citi Bank and Citi Mortgage are both destructive in the utilization of an employee's 'God given gifts and character traits/work ethic's that shine; That place of business is SOOOOO Micro Managed, All about Production Numbers instead of  any 'Quality Service' that the customer deserves and/or needs !!!!   That's why the (JD Power Ratings) show all Citi related facilities, Bank, Mortgage and Financial are all at the bottom of their ratings as reviewed by their clients. Once you are commited as either a customer, employee or both, you become a # and Not a Person representing Cit !!!"
bad,"lot of sales caqlls, retention calls and customer service. management and co workers were good."
bad,a company that treat there people with respect and understanding.
bad,Evaluated all reports and managed staff to branch goals. Ensured we were selling loans above the average benchmark and collecting to reach exceptional delinquency percentages.
bad,"10hr shifts in a high speed place "
bad,"Maintaining daily log in and disbursement tracker, Secured case MIS tracker and Customer Original Documents."
bad,They are not a very personable company. Information is not relayed to employes properly
bad,The work day would typically go by pretty fast. The only con about this job was that they never gave me any work to do. Too much downtime makes the job less likely to want to go to.
bad,"Helping customers with their banking needs. Open CD's, Transferred funds, balance inquiries. Processed auto loan applications"
bad,it's ok if you have a fulltime position. Perfer better hours but overall kit ok.
bad,Out of business. Field production visiting insurance agencies.
bad,Supported banking Relationship Managers in servicing clients with the account needs.
bad,"Liked working there, managers great, money ok. Good when it was still Sears, citi bought them out and moved the company to Nevada, lost my job."
bad,"Some days are great, some are bad. Customer is always right, no room for excelling in certain positions. pay is competitive, but raises are impossible"
bad,I loved working in the Mortgage field.  I enjoyed talking to different kinds of people.  It seemed rewarding to help people refinance their mortgages.  The downfall was they closed after 6 mo. of working there.
bad,Citi at first was laid back and the team morale was excellent. When the company stated changing the team morale dropped then comes the lay off. I think all managers need a refresher course on how to manage employees.
bad,"My job pertained to calls inbound and handling documents, this is to ensure that they are correct and then have to be submitted to the Underwriter for final review."
bad,A typical day at work requires everyone to meet their personal quota. At the end of the month if you worked hard and you know you are getting a bonus is great but for some reason the company always finds a reason to cut your bonus in half or not give you a bonus at all.
bad,"reconcile all domestic & foreign trades, wire in/out  funds, multi currencies, resolve any out of balances in clients account & exchanges. reconcile carry broker , answer & resolve client's requests.   "
bad,A typical day was being on the phone for my shift talking to customers. You are graded by the amount of time on the phone customer service satisfaction email surveys and sales. I worked at the location at Mcleansville and left 2014. My manager left the company in 2013 and I was given a manager who didn't even want to be there and help employees and let us know what would happen in the future. I had to go to other managers for different situations and this particularly manager only was around when it was time to terminate employees. I wouldn't recommend anyone to work here and glad I no longer have to deal with the unprofessional environment. There are employees that talk the whole shift place customers on mute and use negative language. The reason why the site really closed down in 2014 was due to upper employment not filing the paper work and sending them off like they should have. But of course they will try to make it out to be the lower paid employees fault. The place was simply unprofessional and ghetto. And to add when I left the company they cheated me out of my pay check and didn't pay me for 30 hours that I actually did work and had the nerve to send me a invoice saying I had to pay them. lol yeah right they will wait on that one.
bad,"Most of all, collections is a production-oriented career, so the ability to stay focused and on task is essential to a collector’s long-term success."
bad,The training is very good and thorough in making sure new procedures are communicated . Positive feed back from team lead and a relaxed management. very good training department.
bad,"Great company to work with, including management, co-workers, the environment was fantastic.  I was very exited to go to work every day and for that reason I was very proactive and good Processor."
bad,"Working for a company that expects you to take on extra responsibilities without compensation or career advancement is beyond frustrating. Working in that environment for 12 years was soul crushing.  Can people excel and advance there sure. Can everyone excel and advance there, no."
bad,"- Learned about Investment Banking, Credit Cards"
bad,"Trying to have manager stay for more than 6 months would've been called a miracle, they don't care for their employees, and through away seniority out the window, because its ""up to management discretion"". The pay is too low for the stress that they put you through, and all the policies you have to make sure you follow."
bad,"Lack of employee development and no opportunities for growth. Heavy work schedule, work on weekends, Christmas holidays are short. Not a great workplace."
bad,"This was a contract to hire position, that never proved to be ""hire"".  Brought on as contract to hire in 6 mos.  Every month after the 6th month, told wait till next month."
bad,"This company is an alright company to work for. However, the managment is terrible in my opinion, only looking to gain for self . Countless times they look for one's downfall"
bad,"Hours are sometimes 1:30-10:00 in the evening, 15 minute breaks, a lot of meetings and cannot leave desk often.  Must close a minimum of 4 loans a month to get paid.  More managers than loan officers and a lot of pressure to close loans."
bad,They lie about a lot. Care nothing about their employees. Have no idea how to train properly. Very disorganized. Horrible Business. Apply if you want a sad life.
bad,"For such a large corporation, they work with 6 plus systems and can become quite confusing, training is very poor. Not recommended for a first timer to a call center environment"
bad,All they want are referrals. I tried my best even without and I was the only one brining in referrals. I just did not feel appreciated.
bad,The management is not open to listening to the employee's.Lack of advancement opportunities. Lack of opportunities for learning new software
bad,Typical banking culture of the mid 2000s before the meltdown. The bank didn't care about anybody but the bank - forget the employees and the customers. It was all about how do we get our money and we see where things ended up. It was the worst career experience of my life.
bad,the jail is very nasty and they don't pay and you can stay for 12 or more hours
bad,"lacked organization "
bad,Citi is a great company to help boost your resume. The compensation however is meager and the work is excessive
bad,"always expected to do your job plus managers work, unable to get help or better yourself and as well management does not know to help  better your performance, expects you to get help from your co-workers but is frowned upon when you get off phones to help each other, always going threw equipment failures and system updates and having to perform collections on Sundays are the worst part of the job"
bad,"Assisting cilents on dequlient accounts, assist with programs. As a team we all worked together to assit on all accounts. The hardest part is helping a client and does not trust you. Receiving rewards like thankin points to shop at the company store."
bad,"The general feeling around employees is ""when will my job be terminated and sent outside the US."
bad,"Unfortunately, the company has reached an all time low, with the down turn beginning with Travelers and SSB. The lack of care for their employees, quality, immoral behavior by VP's, and overall management has hurt citi dramatically. The board and all top level mgt is interested in themselves, not the rich history and name of Citi. Remember a pilot is always responsible for the lives of the crew and passengers (NO EXCEPTION EVER) Layoffs are unequivically, an admission, of failure, by senior management. Citi continues to be fined, and continues Reductions in force (RIF). RIF's do not increase profitability, public opinion does."
bad,"Promises, promises... They will promise you the world and never keep it. They change everything all of the time. None of the systems actually work and on top of that, the leadership is full of micro-managers. They recently took all of old Wachovia and gave them jobs at Citibank. If Wachovia failed, why would we want their old leadership team? I suggest to look for another bank that treats their employees less like savages and more like human beings."
bad,"Not the best place to work, hefty goals for slow locations , no work life balance , team members don’t seem so happy which reflects and transfers to the rest of the staff"
bad,"Low pay "
bad,"Citi Bank works best for you if you assist them with collecting money. If you can do it, that is all that matters to management. Just make sure you do it on the script and do not spend too much time on the phone."
bad,If you are a contractor(resource) your value is placed lowest on the totem pole and you are easily discarded in opinion and position. Be wary of Managers who are unable to manage. Stress Management  is lacking and you would do well to keep this in the forefront of your daily operations.
bad,In a good economy avoid working here. Positions will be offshored as soon as the project is completed. You are made to work to transfer projects offshore and then will be laid-off.
bad,I worked for months and was never offered a perm position and never offered insurance or any other common compensation.  would not recommend as employer
bad,"You have to be a fast learner for the customer service position.  It was a good job when I was doing the morning hours, but I have to move to another city."
bad,"Overall the most comapny to work for, bad work life balance, bad culture, dirt politics played by senior management which trickles down to the staff. Very bad salaries and benefits."
bad,Unable to advance positions in over 10 years with the company. Was based on stats and having that perception that everyday you work could be your last. Not a place to work if you want to keep your sanity.
bad,This job wasn't the best experience. It was Production based and they looked at how many applications you produced.  You had to be there very early.  I learned how to do things faster.
bad,"Although I learned a lot during my time at Citi, the work environment is very deplorable.  You either had connections or were stuck doing the same job until they shut down the unit."
bad,"Every branch yo go is different house rules. Citi Bank doesn't see their employees as peoples but as machines. You will never get a ""Thank you"". No chance to grow."
bad,"Well, this was a very stressful job. This company was all about work and no life. The way they treated their employees was awful. Compensation was good within the bonuses, but the level of respect the management team and employees had for each other was so bad. This was not the place for me."
bad,This was to be a stepping stone position into the banking division of Citi. I was there during the financial crisis of 2008. There is much prejudice and backstabbing within this company.
bad,"Citibank was not a place that I was very happy with. I never saw my manager, and when I did see her, she didn't seem to know who I was. Then two weeks after I started she informed me that she was leaving and had put in her two weeks notice. I had no one to report to when she left and whoever was around that was supposed to be a supervisor, pretty much acted as though they were above you."
bad,"You can be fired at the blink of an eye for little or no reason."
bad,"Difficult and uncomfortable work environment.  Management is "
bad,I had a great time there to many managers always a new one every year things change all the time nothing stayed the same there new is great but not all the time
bad,"There is little to no progress at Citigroup. Most employees are just hired for Contract, meaning that once your job is done you need to find another job. Contracts are now used just to cut down on the budget and staff benefits."
bad,"Harrassment, level of competence, professionalism from managers....all were extremely low.  Comp time was offered instead of overtime pay, and then when comp time was asked to be taken it was denied. 36+ hour shifts over the weekends in addition to regular 40+hour work week, with no compensation, pay or time off."
bad,"Clocking in ..Getting on the phones for 8 hrs "
bad,I was so stressed at this job the one thing it taught me was never to have another call center job selling products because that is not who I am. I can not force people to by things and the first no was good enough for me but they wanted 3 no's. That to me was being pushy and rude. My supervisor was amazing he believed in and helped me in anyway he could. My coworkers were amazing we had some wonderful times together. I miss them not the job
bad,I can only make these statments for the West Milwaukee Branch. Managment was horrible. Supervisor was even worse. Very unprofessional work enviroment and no structure. No room for growth and the collection performance is not improving.
bad,Answered phones and delt with the public about getting credit cards.  Also handled  ID theft with people. Co worker were fine and helpful and bosses were usually hard to find.
bad,"I learned a lot from working here, gained a lot of new sales techniques. At the same time, I felt like i didn't matter. Everything was about how will you let us earn more money. I helped people for a year on increasing their sales productivity, and had no reward. I was losing out on bigger bonuses from my own sales with no pay increase, and no promotion in sight,"
bad,real fast pace workplace short breaks terrible management nice co-workers back breaking labor
bad,"I worked at Citi before and during the crisis, I think during that time it was bad everywhere, but the company holds a special place for me because it was the first big bank I ever worked for and I wish things could have been better when I worked there."
bad,"Sin idea del valor de los empleados, muy enfrascada en lograr resultados para la empresa pero no para los colaboradores, la empresa mira el yo, luego el yo y no hay nadie mas que el resultado de la empresa sin importar el colaborador"
bad,"From the citibank initial training, one may think this is the best company to work for... till you get to the branch."
bad,❖ Performed/Displayed Professionalism and Excellent Customer service 1 & 2 skills
bad,collecting checks and other necessary papers
bad,"Overall, Citibank is a good place to work. The problem lies with the management of security personnel. The training is excellent, unfortunately, due to such people the experience as an employee could be greatly improved. Management need to have a spring clean and employ supervisors with people skills."
bad,"Per ""clean desk"" policy I won't be able to give specifics regarding this but if you have any questions feel free to contact me for discussion,  My number is on file."
bad,"This place helped me develop my career however in the last 2 years the place really started going down hill. They offshore alot of jobs which resulted in people getting let go. The only way to really get promoted is if you have a ""special hands on relationship"" with managment."
bad,"The company has a lot of nice people. However, their technology causes delays in productivity which could effect the daily stats. The representative is hired for one position but later extra duties are added but no extra pay to accommodate the extra work."
bad,Someone violated my privacy and and another gave out my personal information violating HIPPA giving my personal information out to a third party so I resigned because I did not feel safe
bad,"Enjoy the teamwork at Citibank we respect and understand each other as a team, we work to execute our goal everyday, every week, every month, I also enjoy the environment."
bad,"Regrettably, Citi hired a lot of type A personalities and let them go after each other. The actual work that I led at Citi was very rewarding but the cut-throat culture was not something that I appreciated. I hope things have changed now for the sake of everyone that works there."
bad,"Keep getting these  operations managers who gets off on authority and screwing up people’s lives, but makes them look better and if they can get rid of seniority employees there rewarded for it and makes them act more above the employees"
bad,"After the Financial Crash, The Citi environment, culture, and overall treatment of employees went steadily downhill. After the initial ""post-crash"" layoffs, there continued to be layoffs every year after in the interest of ""downsizing"" - resulting in increased workload for those remaining.  Within a couple of more years after, the company aggressively started ""off-shoring"" jobs.  this resulted in even more work for those remaining in the New York office in terms of cross-training, and also extensive correction responsibilities for errors made by overseas trainees that went on for months.  Finally, as all this was going on, the employees watched as their compensation steadily decreased (in terms of bonus-comp) and totally stagnated- in terms of salary. This was regularly justified/explained by management pointing to the crash and resulting layoffs (i.e. ""you're lucky you have a job"")"
bad,"Created financial supermarket model for meeting sales margin. "
bad,Lots of people who were only looking out for themselves and very cut throat.  There was not a lot of integration and knowledge sharing being done.  Would not go back.
bad,It is a great company with gloabl presnece with lot of potential opportunity to improve. It is really hard to describe in words and difficult to express.
bad,"- a very judgemental environment"
bad,"The running joke at Citi is that the ""C"" stands for Change.  Poor leadership, management and direction from the top has steered this company listlessly for years.  The only constant is change for changes sake.  Millions of dollars are wasted on new internal corporate slogans and projects, but nothing is followed through on or given an opportunity to succeed.  Most frustrating, however, is the lack of current technology.  Citi is operating on platforms that are severely outdated."
bad,"After almost 9 yrs at citi it was a decent job. Over the years I saw management make up and lie about people just to fire them, After winning many awards and working 50+ hrs a week they finally got to me and made-up things that I never did and let me go. If you do work there you'd best become some managers' pet and kiss butt if you want to stay."
bad,"Cheap to low level employees.  Take advantage of employees.  No raises even with a promotion.  Horrible District Manager.  Management makes $ in salaries, raises, and bonuses."
bad,"Reviewing reports and organizing data. "
bad,depending on what department u choose u will find it this job to be very unstable there is never thought put into the changes the company makes until its too late
bad,"At Citi it's not what you know, it's who you know that will advance your career. I experienced first hand this situation. If senior management likes you, then you will be more likely to obtain promotions and better pay."
bad,They are very slow to adopt to the new techology. Stressful environment because lack of knowledge to the immediate managers. Not learning from their pasts
bad,"Everything is like they are making it up as they go. "
bad,"not a good company to work for , there is a lot of issues an discrimination. the worst employer to work for . poor management and unfair and provide  no training."
bad,"Poor management.Two old. need new blood. The company could be a litter better, if only they would listen to customer and employees.he management treat staff extremely poorly. They intimidate, bully and constantly threaten with disciplinary or dismissal. They employ poor untrained staff so that they can pay poor wages. There is no training or development from this company. They operate on very thin margins which is reflected in the amateur way they provide services to clients. They encourage staff and managers to lie to clients as to pretend"
bad,I am not CITI material. I appreciate my time there. And will only say that my time there was a learning experience and I learned that CITI is not a place for me.
bad,"Experiência boa!"
bad,"if you don't fall into a click or are a certain type you can forget about advancing. I've been an 11 year employee and have jumped through every hoop and accepted every challenge set before me. yes, because I don't fit the ""corporate look"" I am always passed over for management promotions. this place is all about who your friends are and not based off of the quality o your work or about how above and beyond you put yourself out there."
bad,Worked at Citibank for just under a year and couldn't stand it. Citibank was too political for me and management was way too strict which made the working environment difficult to work in. They required tellers to do more work than the personal bankers. Moving up in the company wasn't even a question. And they moved you from branch to branch if another branch needed help and you couldn't even say no. Starting pay is awful as well.
bad,"It's a call center job. I had a great time working with customers and I could have gone on doing it forever but there was a serious problem with management. Regardless of how well you took care of the customer, if your 'handle time' went over the specified 5 minutes you lost all credit for the work you did. You were rated on 'handle time' and score card talking points. Never mind that the customer doesn't always want to hear the whole spiel that management wants you to take up time regurgitating like a robot. You have to be callus in order to get positive reviews. You have to sell your soul to succeed here. Additionally work from home is isolating. Teem meetings are always cancelled because of call volumes and personal time is recorded. I was chided for the amount of bathroom time I took one month. My manager told me to 'hold it in til your break'  "
bad,"In Mortgage, you are paid the worst out of all large banks. They do not have a fast internet. There is always issues with the programs you put your loans in. Everyday there is a problem. They have the worst condo partners department. In all honesty the bank does look out for its partners. Only on the retail level. This is not only my opinion buy my whole region. Many people have left Citibank. I would not recommend working here."
bad,the primary reason for me to leave the organisation was limited growth possiblity and preference is given to iit and iim .it had long work hours without any benefit
bad,"I don't remember the details of my time with Citi. I didn't stay long because they did not value life work balance. "
bad,"Citi is not a family friendly workplace. Once you're out of time off, you'll be fired. There is no room to wiggle. If you go on a LOA, you will very likely be let go soon after getting back to work. Once you're off the phones(as in a promotion), you're subject to being laid off. You're o KY valuable to them if you don't have a family, and you remain on the phones. Management is a joke. Nobody ever knows what's going to happen."
bad,"This job was a learning experience in the sense that it gave me a taste of corporate America. I learned a lot about banking and it's laws, regulations and policies. After one month of working the branch made me Head Teller. With that my responsibilities became counting the vault with an officer, count the ATM's with an officer, receive the incoming money from Brinks with an officer. I also processed daily transactions while giving exceptional customer service. Management was difficult to deal with sometimes. Co-workers were nice and they were great at training. The hardest part about this job was dealing with management. Most enjoyable part was meeting the customers of the bank."
bad,The hardest part of this job is the lack of communication from upper management to employees and from co-workers. Too many hands in the same file and it makes it confussing.
bad,busy work days .. the pay was good but you worked hard for the money. no room for growth but the pay was outstanding. The job role inculded collections
bad,"Not a good place to work with, so many red flags, poor management, and unrealistic annual targets. usually hire on outsource visa and treat you like an outsider."
bad,Citi has made so many changes which has resulted in low moral of the company. I would not recommended this company to any family or friends of mine
bad,"As a company, CitiMortgage has done an excellent job in ensuring that Mortgage Default processes were cleaned up and in compliance with all State and Federal regulations as well as reducing the number of foreclosures and foreclosure holds."
bad,"Global bank with offices in US"
bad,"I appreciate all I have learned while at this company. I learned a lot about financing and how to budget my time. Company is not very supportive on job growth and enhancement, very difficult to apply for other departments"
bad,"I enjoyed working the cases, one was never the same as another. Fellow associates were great to work with. We all helped each other being it was a new department and we had no managers at the time."
bad,"A typical work day full of Non-Productive Reporting, the hardest part of the job is meeting unrealistic production goals. The most enjoyable part of the job are the team building events. I learned how Citi handles cutbacks due to paying mortgage settlement placed employees compensation benefits at high risk and job culture overall rating low."
bad,"-Little to no supervision/management"
bad,"•	Answer customer’s telephone calls regarding existing/new account."
bad,My manager started the same time at the job as I did. When you ask her a question she tells you to figure it out and when you go over her head to the next manager up he tells you not to bother him. My paycheck is always short and never gets fixed. Angry customers always screaming at you.
bad,"Not a good place to work"
bad,"The company is going down hill fast. When I first started Citi it truly was a great place to work. They once cared about their employees and often offered incentives. Over the years, they (upper management) expected too much from their employees work harder, with no over time, micro-managing, no incentives etc. Upper management was constantly changing, and making changes to save the company more money. They do not care about their employees. The hardest part is accepting you will never be good enough. Despite all of your good months,  and all of your hard work and effort it will never be appreciated. Your head is on the chopping block any day. Everyday management is threatening your job. There is absolutely no job security. People who have worked there 20+ years were axed. If you're looking for a temporary job while getting your college degree than by all means this is the place for you. This isn't for people who are looking for long term careers or job security."
bad,"I enjoy what i do. However, Citi has really changed. We had A LOT of responsibilities at to our job description with no compensation adjustment.  Also,Citi needs to provide better training for employees."
bad,"If you work on the phones, advancement is usually quicker; however, Citibank has a policy that states you cannot be promoted. You must apply for your promotions. So, if your manager thinks you're doing a good job, they need to create a requisite for a job opening and open it up to the entire bank. You apply, and interview, and if you're still the best candidate, then you get promoted. Raises are laughable- right now the best are getting 1.5% annually. Yes, that's 1.5%. Also, when you move up levels, HR has a 10% cap on salary, so the hiring manager must fight with HR to get you more than that, though most offers at time of promotion hover around 7%. Your best bet is to negotiate a great salary when you are initially hired, because promotions and raises take years to jump. I was there for 8 years and had several promotions and my salary was $12,400 more when I left than when I entered. If this is how they treat the better workers, I can only imagine how an average person fairs."
bad,Not a good place to work. The turn over rate is ridiculous and the pay is really low. I was there for a year before i found another job that paid betterand had better security.
bad,"After over 20 years at Citi I can honestly say that the company has changed in a negitive way.  The culture is poor, the benefits are poor, the compensation packages are poor.  There is no true leadership anymore."
bad,Very interesting projects. Aggressive timelines and mission critical applications.
bad,Nice place to work you only need to manage the political landscape of Sr. leadership
bad,"They are very badly structured work environment. Employees usually work long hours, minimally 55 hours a week. No regard to family or personal issues. During Hurricane Sandy, IT employee risked their lives to keep the company running, I used to drive out to Rutherford NJ for the DR site, and get in the line in the evenings to get some gas for my car, all-the-while worrying for my family and kids, and incurring various expenses. When submitted the travel expenses    for the bank, there was no way that they could re-emberse us back the US $140.00 we spend in transportation for that week or so. The examples are many"
bad,Culture of wanting everything right away with no idea of how it gets done or how long it would take leads to no work/life balance and many disgruntled employees
bad,"The salary is terrible considering is a leading global orgainization and banking institutions. The work load is too much, without proper training and guidance; its like the blind leading the blind. Hardest part of gettin through the day is dealing with the system issues that prevent the employees from servicing the clients efficiently."
bad,"Unfair distribution of work and responsiblies. Accounting system that did not work well, poor communication between management and staff and high turn over of staff."
bad,"Citi will tire you out quickly, its a shell of its former self. Annual decreases in pay vs. increases. Will I be employed tomorrow or will they release the entire area?"
bad,worked with customers from application to closing process of personal loans and refianced mortgages.
bad,data entry
bad,Very disjointed and mismanagement wouldn't work there again ever and don't recommend it to any one. They constantly accuse you of things that you haven't even done. One of my coworkers made racist comments that were borderline harassment and discrimination as well as illegal. There were sooo many rules and the most enjoyable part of the job was handing in my resignation letter.
bad,"At first, I was hired to work as a bilingual customer service. Then, they put me to work in the Collections Department and decided to reduce my income because did not use a lot of my bilingual skills. The schedule changed all the time, never asked if it worked for me. Harsh environment to work with. The worst job I have ever had so far in Colorado."
bad,I learned her what is banking & what actually is the meaning of sales & marketing
bad,they say you can advance within the company with hard work but its all a lie. Its who you know that gets you the advancement you want!
bad,I Couldnt Even Consider It Work You People get paid for doing nothin. i once saw a guy hang up on every caller and nothing was done about it because he knew was good friends with the management members
bad,Not a good motivation to work in Citi. no added payment for extra work. Its not employee friendly. Very less scope of career growth. People doesn’t care about emplyee growth
bad,The company is worldwide.  No one person seems to matter much to the organization.  There’s some opportunity to contribute to local improvements if you are persistent in communicating good ideas
bad,"The expectations were beyond ""stretch goals"" and there was a high drive to produce or move along. Job comes first and family comes second and you are made to feel inadequate if you think otherwise."
bad,"Training was decent but you’re lied to from the beginning regarding job advancement opportunities when you start out as entry level. Know many people that have been there for years but still have yet to be granted a better/different position within the company. Constant overflow of phone calls, the only calls that are mainly scored are the small percentage of calls that include angry customers and ruin your overall scorecard and take away any chance of monthly bonuses."
bad,"Policies make no sense,  system is very backwards.  Very impersonal staff,  culture in general.i can’t even explain them bec they make no sense.  It’s anything but global"
bad,"They offer good competitive salary but when you are inside the company, you will experience such a bad management by some supervisors and managers. No people skills. They only care about their numbers. No work and life balance. Can't even apply a Vacation Leave if you really need it. For Sick Leave, you need to be hospitalized first before you can use it. Worst management ever."
bad,"If you can sit through a call center position, great! If not, please look for something else. I've had to get medically accommodated breaks to use the restroom and just take a moment to breath, because anything outside of 2 15 minute breaks and 30 minute ""lunch"" is unexcused.I would never discourage anyone from taking any job, because you never know what's going to work for"
bad,"Citi likes to say it embraces change.  Roles are defined by the person not the process and thus as people change, Citi redefines roles and role levels to suit individual managers.  Jobs internally ""posted"" are rarely filled by postings.  It is all internal networking and favortism.  HR is completely complacent in this practice, defers to management, and thus there is a culture of ""yes"" required to retain or grow ones role.  "
bad,"The role was contract to full time. I was initially very excited about the opportunity as since I went through referral the interview process was a cake walk for me. but still, I was assessed for my technical skills. but when I actually joined the team, they put me in a work which was nowhere related to my profile. I was upset and mentally stressed there for all the 5 months i worked there. People work for endless hours and no-one complains as this is an unsaid expectation. the people are nice though."
bad,Very monotonous job in nature. Slow career growth. Basic data entry job. Over populated workplace. Free tea coffee. Basic health cover. No job security.
bad,When i first started at Citi I liked it but the culture when way down the tubes after. They brought in a whole new management team from wells and I don't think most people liked it.
bad,"I hated this sit down job. My manager was awful. I hated being on the phone. The only perks of this job was the pay, benefits, and the cafeteria food was pretty good."
bad,They are shady. Lots of favoritism and chaos. Calls are really stressful.... Hr is a joke. Find somewhere else to go unless you want to have someone constantly breathing down your neck about the littlest of things!
bad,"Director is a Micro Manager, does not let you do your job.  Director is completely involved in every position does not let employees do their job to their potential without changing how they do their job."
bad,There was little but some opportunity to go permanent here from contract. The benefits for permanency are impressive (at least 4 star) if you can get in but the competition is fierce.
bad,"Citi wants to ""empower"" people to make decisions but tries to create jobs to be robotic.  The culture does not provide for individuals to try new things.  There is a big disconnect between the businesses and support functions especially technology.  Management seems more concerned about protecting their own turf than looking out for employees (i.e. are more prone to throw someone under the bus than take responsibility.)  There are very few leaders at Citi; only managers."
bad,Employees are not able to give input.   Some managers need more training on how to be managers and not punish the employers for having more knowledge.
bad,"Constant demands from unappreciative boss. Boss has so much going on at the same time, messages and emails are ignored but if their messages or emails are ignored, the team gets lectured."
bad,"Typical corporate investments banking culture. Rather average salary, average work-life balance.Very bad management. In overall not recommended unless you really need to gain experience at the start of your career."
bad,"Depending on the team you are working with you have to watch your back.  Some will swipe loans that you should be getting paid on for themselves, taking money right out of your pocket."
bad,Working at citi is a good learning experience. I learned a alot about finance and the banking industry. This company is very stressful to work for but for very few benefits.
bad,"I found the work interesting, but overall the people in higher management positions did not care about those under them and were more concerned about control, protecting their own interests, and made the working environment very stressful.  I did like my peers that I worked with.  Easier for junior people to move up, but middle management is hard to get promoted unless you have a strong mentor with connections."
bad,This organization will make a decision to do layoffs.  They will call you at home early in the morning and let you know you have been laid-off and tell you not to come into the office.  your personal effects will be mailed to you.  Not really ideal in my opinion
bad,"Citi was a previous career I am employed at JPMorgan Chase, I am currently a Production Leader at Chase and I am looking for better employment. I feel like I need a better place to grow"
bad,"This is a great organization, i just wish the company's management was as great as the company is.  it is unorganized and chaotic at all time.  I hope they change things around here soon."
bad,"Long hours poor rewards,  Incapable management structure.  Not enough work force with experience on shore any longer who need to pick up the issues when near and off shore locations fail to meet standards."
bad,Didnt like working there supervisor were very rude never talked to employees much fast paced stressful place to work wasnt paid much short lunch breaks
bad,The job is stressful but mgmt makes it much worse with unrealistic and unobtainable goals.  Every single call mgmt can and will find just enough to make sure you do not meet your goals to bonus.  Even with a degree no chance for advancement.  Left and found better pay elsewhere.
bad,If your single with no life its the perfect place to spend time and make good money. There is nothing to do around the area plus if you do not live around the area its hard to get to.
bad,I believe that CITI has a good product but do not do enough to convey their desire outcome of the position.  Training was not provided and no two consecutive employees conveyed the training necessary for completing the task of the position.
bad,The corporate environment is typical to all financial services careers. The workplace culture prides itself on diversity. The work/life balance is manageable.
bad,"typical day at work. I worked in this firm for almost 4 years, and no promotion was given. I have made it clear from the start that I wanted to climb the ladder and grow, Unfortunatley it seems they didn't care about my career goals."
bad,"The workplace culture is to ignore the needs of the people on the frontline (in the branches, etc) and to work them to the bone. This company only pays well relative to other banks of its size. Truth is, management is incompetent and no one cares about what we go through in the branches. There is virtually no opportunity for advancement unless you are coming in as a teller, the staffing models are inappropriate and people in the branches are doing the work of multiple employees. The technology is archaic in the branches and people are set up for failure because Citibank refuses to catch up digitally with its competition."
bad,"Exposure to African markets and working with counterparts. Being a part of the large turnover, you focus on your region only. being exposed to financial services from an international view"
bad,"Everyday I am regretting my decision to join this Company. "
bad,"Out of probably a hundred companies I have worked for, this is one of the worst corporate cultures I have ever seen. Management makes decisions without any data, then expects reality to conform to their artificial project timeline. ""Managing to the timeline"" never works in any company, and it doesn't work here. Nevertheless, management wants what it wants, regardless of whether it is a realistic expectation or if it's even possible to attain the specified goal - they want their bonuses, and therefore they mandate working nights, weekends, and holidays (80 hours a week) to reach the goal. When a deadline arrives, the product goes into Production, whether or not it works, and then the business users must suffer from the broken product that doesn't work. "
bad,"Touched several different projects on a given day. This allowed me to learn about several different basins, but it did not allow me to completely focus on one project at a time."
bad,Bad expenrence to ats services... very bad work culture no salary increase on annually basis... basically it is like LALA company type
bad,"not client centric at all, the culture of product push comes straight from the top, management is incredibly inept and have no understanding of how to manage the regulatory pressures outside their home market (India), don't touch with a barge pole"
bad,"Some managers are good and some not. Totally depend on your luck."
bad,"no raises, no career advancement."
bad,"While there are many wonderful people that work at Citi and will keep your spirit afloat, the management makes decisions that are not in customers' best interests.  It is not uncommon to be assigned one objective or task and two weeks later you are told to drop that and try something else.  Redundancy is a real problem at Citi due to the large number of mangers.  Everyone wants data in a different format so employees are asked to put the same information in different documents (ie: SharePoint site, PowerPoint doc, Excel file, etc) and then we get in trouble when the information between all of the files differs."
bad,Citi is an ok place to work but has really high turn over rate as well as layoff rate. The pay rate is the lowest of all the major banks located here in Dallas.
bad,Received a large batch of alerted files every month. Most files could be cleared with adequate research and some required escalation to the fraud department for possible SAR filings.
bad,This place at the beginning look very security job environment but ones you start they micro management and listen to your IT service calls and if you don't sound with the repeatable customer service they start giving you warnings and they accumulate a few and the fire you.
bad,They hire you for 1 job and as they fire people they throw more and more work on the people left. Soon you are doing the work of 3 or 4 people without any extra pay and constantly harassed that you are not doing it fast enough or well enough.
bad,If you are looking at the San Antonio Recruiter position that seems to be a revolving door.   There is a reason for that and it is the VP there is the most micro-manager person that I have ever met in my life.   I have never worked in an office were the staff felt like they were not even aloud to talk to each other without getting in trouble.  Worst experience of my life.    Above that level I did not appreciate that they told employees they were not allowed to attend any political events or be involved then when you walk into the building two days later they have displayed posters for a candidate.   With very little research you can see who they have donated a TON of money too.
bad,"The company did not respect hard work, management was not good at all. The training was very strong and very insightful. The system used was very advanced."
bad,"Great company but Management is awful, they think by having meetings all day about nothing...! literally nothing that helps. "
bad,"Too micro managed. Ridiculous, almost childish expectations. Promote incompetent assistant managers with little college or work experience."
bad,Enjoyed my work with good colleages and subordinates even with prolonged timings & work pressure. Sincere workers needs to be preserved.
bad,"Learned alot thankful but seem to make irrational decisions regarding employees, enjoyed my time there, management could use some assistance"
bad,"To begin with , a typical day at work was easy not really demanding or challenging whatsoever. Delivering forms, analyzing customers profiles to check if they were eligible to get a loan ."
bad,A receive inbound calls or make outbound call for applications or I do online chat for inbound questions about applications as well.
bad,I have worked here for 10 years  This is a transfer agency.  This is all that I want to put in my review.
bad,Zero work life balance; no respect for employees/consultants; poor management; very little or no support for employees/consultants. Incredible work hours....unrealistic work expectation; outrageous over time requirement.
bad,"Responsibilities"
bad,"I worked for them over a year in Customer Service in the ""special merchants"" group, here in Tucson, Az. My manager was very dull and simple, not very smart at all with a big inferiority complex. With him everything was fake. He was so unprofessional that he commented things like: we where over payed for the things we did or, that manager is... or my boss ...  and then he pretended you where his new best friend; very dumb indeed. The managers pretend to care about you but the reality is other. They have to review your calls and they have to come up  with some ""feedback"" that most of the time was ridiculous. I see a lot of ""happy people"" reviews in it his website, saying how great is to work for Citi, to be honest, I think they are made up. I quit because I couldn't stand having to take calls from other departments because they did not have enough service reps. The quicker is, all those extra calls, you don't get payed for. People in The Home Depot department make more per hour, and since they are slammed with calls all day, you have to ""help"" without proper training and no extra pay. If you speak Spanish, and you are not on the ""Spanish Team"" they will ask for your ""help"" with out paying extra. The ""Spanish Team"" is always busy and they get payed .50 cents per call extra. Here in Tucson, work is not pleasant. Since is a call-center the best bonds you will make are with your co-workers because they all feel the same pain; management is terrible. If you have another option take it! If you want to be question if you went to the bathroom and  be slammed with calls non-stop everyday,"
bad,"Management not capable of managing but were promoted based on technical skill only and not the ability to manage people of the company. used layoffs as a means to reach financial goals. Showed very little creativity in making the bank more successful but instead left ""business as Usual"" and laid-off."
bad,This is not a great work environment.  This is a high turnover company that does not care about employees as they will hire 35-40 more the following month to keep them coming.
bad,Junior varsity management -- from bottom up (except for the legendary Municipals business). Juvenile sales and trading team. The organization needs a new management team and new culture to fully capitalize on the company's massive potential. Citi Markets would be a world class group if second string managers at JP Morgan took over. Another way to make Citi Markets a top performing organization is to fold the entire  business under the management of the Municipals business.
bad,"Training was great, however the management is awful...you are a number there...high turnover...supervisors are moved around when they do something wrong or their numbers don't show..."
bad,"A well paid senior role that ended up being on the radar because the NA owners do not want to employ staff in London, so for the last 5-8 years the role has always been challenging as the culture had radically changed from what it used to be."
bad,"Good benefots poor culture and management: the client is the most important person for the cia but they do not help you to help the client, at the end the less important person is the client."
bad,"•	Responsible for risk exposure to Citi Mortgage in regards to outstanding claims cited by both internal and external Clients. "
bad,"I worked last nine years and gone through lot of good and bad things but bad things is so much that I forget to remember the good things. They do not value your urgency, they are not sympathized, they are rude, racist and inferior mind. If you want to think that you will spend your career in citi then I will say that you have to have a good manager and asst. manager otherwise within six months your job will in line."
bad,Good opening spot for recent graduates. hours are not optimal for a balanced work life
bad,"can learn domains,"
bad,Management wouldn't let you breathe. You are expected to take hundreds of calls per day and push to sell on every one. My manager gave me a hard time if I had to take a 3 min break to go to the bathroom.
bad,The most enjoyable part of the job was leading a team of employees to excellence.
bad,Citi FRO is a terrible place to work. They chew you up and spit you out.
bad,"Fast paced environment.  Constantly changing federal and state regulations.  Learned alot about the finance industry (consuner loans and home equity loans).  Upper management is completely out of touch with day to day operations and the demographic/market/customer base.  Unrealistic sales/delinquency goals.  The district manager in the Austin area doesn't care about his employees and is verbally abusive to his branch managers. Coworkers are great peoeple.  Although most are burned out and seeking other employment. The hardest part of the job is collections...about 60% of the job. Most enjoyable part of the day is helping our customers.  The company talks a good game about customer service and compliance,  but at the end of the day it's a do whatever it takes attitude."
bad,"By far, the WORST place I ever worked at.    Benefits prohibitively expensive.  Many layoffs.  Your benefits end on the day you are let go, forcing you to pay for COBRA immediately and lose all monies in your FSA."
bad,"long days"
bad,"The culture of Citigroup changed significantly over the twelve years I invested in them. The benefits continually deteriorated and morale was low in several of the departments I worked in as a result, Management varied from department to department, as did their goals, rating systems, and level of feedback. I enjoyed working with the many people I came to know over the years. Hard working individuals always make a workplace worthwhile."
bad,"no proper use of manpower as per their employee strength. No proper promotion methods, partiality in promoting the right candidates. Promotions on favoritism."
bad,We had fun in our immediate group but there was no advancement and the compensation was bad
bad,Didn't like the pace that they would push you to turn out loans. They didn't really care if they were done correctly they just wanted them done. They required 10 hours a week of overtime and saturday per week. The management didn't really have an idea about more of their team only the ones that did well.
bad,"40% of the work force is contract, even while the contractor/sonsultant segment of the workforce at Citi has most of the education and experience contractors experience second class treatment in many departments. Other experiences of the contract workforce include being excluded from such basic necessities as the company medical center, and periodic forced pay cuts."
bad,"Since the oversight by the OCC and the lawsuit NMS the mortgage business has not been able to stay ahead of the storm. The job is now consumed solely to putting out fires and chasing problems with solutions that are not well thought out. As a Citi Manager I needed to work 70-80hrs a week to keep pace (of course on a salaried paycheck). I am a hard worker willing to dedicate countless hours to a project or a temporary need. But, there has never been an end in sight and that takes its toll. The pay offered at each level is not competitive for what's being asked."
bad,"Citi can be very rewarding if the employee is fortunate enough to be selected as someone's favorite. Once selected as a favorite the employee will be helped and guided down a successful career path. If the employee is not favored than no amount of effort will make a difference in career progression. In fact, promotions do not seem to be based on hard work, smart work, job proficiency, product knowledge, accomplishments or any other accolade that one would think makes their resume stand out."
bad,"There is not a lot of oppurtunity for advancement, constant frustrations and feeling like you can not take ownership because nothing is in your control that makes a difference"
bad,Great place to learn but not a good place to big professional steps. Lacks a strong hiring policy and focus.
bad,I am an MBA (Banking and Finance) but higher management always neglect me just because i am not of their cast.
bad,"Day would start at 7:30am and typically not end until midnight. Meetings would go all day ling and then when you got back to your desk, return calls, draft memo's, see manager, fill out paperwork, look at reports. Co-workers were like me, robots. The hardest part of the job was never ever making a mistake. The most enjoyable was leaving at the end of the day."
bad,Internship provided a small amount of useful training that would be applicable in another role. There could be much better structure.
bad,"Came in to setup loan closings,made collection calls,put together file folders from previous day and take pmts."
bad,very uncoordinated and do not communcate with employees about changes to the way they want them to approach customers with offers about their products that customers are able to take advantage of if they would like to. changes are made daily to the way offers are made but employees cant depend on being made aware of all of these changes because they are numerous and made on a daily basis..it wouldnt be so bad but they hold their employees accountable for not implementing these changes immediately. not my first choice in businesses that i would choose to work for or send friends to for employment.
bad,Citi is most concerned with bottom dollar and ignores morale concerns among associates. Citi has adopted a payroll system that has created extensive problems paying employees correctly.Employees are expected to handle an excessive work load in exchange for under appreciation.
bad,"Management does not really know whats going on, they push off their work to the agents. In my department they fired several agents and never replaced them and expected the work to get done just as fast. More and more often it feels like a prison with how strict the company is becoming. Like do I really need to take 1 minutes unplanned time if I show up a minute late? I think the company should really buckle down and realize they succeed because of the agents, so maybe they shouldn't be treated so harshly."
bad,"good learning in this job,in this job they teach how to survive under more pressure, what you learn and what you take decision, over all good experience"
bad,Citi do not care about employees and you will get no assistance from management. They will make you feel like a robot. Vacation days are always blocked so what the give you is pointless.
bad,"i feel awful giving citi such a low rating after working at their selden location for a year and having no problems and a manager i could probably never replace!!!!! after transferring to their 5th ave location, any fond memory working for this company was completely robbed. the only decent things i can say about the 5th ave/52nd branch is you can expect to make at least one good friend during your time in confinement and there are NO weekends!"
bad,There is a clear distinction between full time employees and contractors.  Contractors are treated like the step child.  Everything is on a need to know basis.
bad,"This organization cares not for its staff. The turnover is ridiculous...mainly driven by constant management change.  The revolving doors result in new management frequently coming in and wanting to ""put their own stamp"" on the organization. This usually means significant cuts to staff.  I worked for this organization for a long time (15+ years) and was fortunate enough to last (luckily) through slaughter after slaughter. There is a reason why morale is so low within this organization...people walk on eggshells waiting for the next shoe to drop."
bad,"Don’t work in the lockbox area. There’s more drama than a high school. About 95% of the people working there are hired through a temp agency which accepts anyone that can pass the background check. The place is run more like a prison except I think inmates earn more money. I’ve seen people fighting in the office, people throwing things like children, higher ups don’t care about anything aside from themselves, but they won’t hesitate to watch you your entire lunch break to make sure you don’t take more than 30 minutes. Pay is terrible and since most people are temps they’ll decide to fire you for no reason at all and it won’t matter to them because their turnover numbers aren’t effected. If you like high school drama, middle school maturity, and feeling like a max security inmate then this is the place for you!"
bad,"This place works you death for little pay. Especially in the asset based lending /syndications group. Unorganized, unstructured, needs to be updated and modernized, the existing management should retire, management not open to change, wants to stay the same, strong favoritism, only allows favorited employees to work remotely from home and spying."
bad,"Nothing i think the daily work culture is imbalanced and the management and workers of the inclusive ""people"" is too close, will not let newbies in unless they ""please"" the management or inclusive."
bad,"The work atmosphere it's like you're in high school.  you have to conform,  with what they want, or they will find a way to get rid of you. They say that they want your ideas and your individuality but they don't. I must say the benefits are good but the working atmosphere it's not worth it."
bad,"The job was ok, but my co-workers almost always seemed disgruntled about one thing or another.  Management was around but i'm not really sure what they actually did."
bad,"Citi is a great place to get in, get some experience, but then get out!!!  Longevity and loyalty is not rewarded.  Compensation is paltry and raises are minimal.  My direct managers were always great but in the same boat as me.  It is very clear you are just a budget line item and can be cut at a moments notice."
bad,"Citi is being restructured and changing daily. People are hired one month and let go the next. Leaving a secure job for a role at Citi would be highly risky. Also the working conditions are less than desirable. Everyone in shared space (even Senior roles) noisy smelly, dirty bathrooms, overpriced cafeteria....and more. Also very difficult for smokers who must leave campus, parking nightmares and a culture that is uncaring and often borders on inhumane. Politics and favoritism are the norm. Everyone I know who has left is far happier. I am looking and hope to be gone soon as well. Fingers crossed. I have been there almost 20 years and have watched this organizations sad decline.  I can’t believe that it’s gotten so bad."
bad,"Unhealthy work environment, you could be laid off anytime. Management knows less than staff, management also listens to gossip and teammates will gang up on you just for being male or female. They would rather keep the snitches and lazy people rather than a hard worker that keeps to theirselves, even if you go to management and complain of bullying nothing will be done expect a bigger target on your back. Im baffled how Citi is a billion dollar company with the type of people they have working for them."
bad,Very poor management / They tend to Play favorite / Discriminatory Practices / HHRR is there to cover the company. Avoid to all cost / If you bring your book of clients to IPB US (International Clients) you will end up loosing them sooner or later. Stay away from Citi.
bad,I was laid off yesterday. I will review at a later time as I don’t want my current feelings to void my review. Citi was my work home for over 16 years.
bad,"A factory being run by a bank that was constantly in need of a short term gain was never going to last. Despite the efforts of a highly productive workforce, management was able to run it into the ground."
bad,"Management ignoring issues when discussed early and will get into once the problem has occurred. Same with new hires, too much focus on Northern Ireland and not taking care of experienced employees in London."
bad,Benefits are great. Need better schedules and better pay. You can’t live off what citi pays.  They offer great opportunities for advancement. It’s a ok environment........
bad,"It is only possible to get a promotion if a role becomes available. No clear career progression. The tech that my Department uses is very old and tends to go down numerous times a month. Management is poor, they are subject matter experts but have no talent in managing people."
bad,Training is minimal at best.  They certainly aren't open to work-life balance.  You don't really have a voice.  You are expected to know your job from day one.
bad,"Citi es una empresa global que atrae talento de primera categoría debido a sus altos salarios y beneficios competitivos.  "
bad,Little to no opportunities left in Ofallon location. Management has went down hill. No real leadership. They are never proactive. Everything is done in a reactive manner.
bad,"Local office of CitiFinancial was run by a director with little leadership training.  He lacked the ability to foster collaborative culture and in fact, promoted conflict.  His regional manager was the same way.  Entire leadership team was ultimately fired, except me. I left before the critical mass was reached."
bad,"The job is ok and the salary is little bit below the market average. Benefits are good but the bank has high turn over rate just like all the other big banks. Lack of advancement opportunity, does not want to train or provide licensing training to associates who is interested in promotions."
bad,"This place is a waste of time. Very stressful work environment. Few breaks and short lunches don’t make any sense in a such stressful call center. If you don’t want to be stressed out, stay way from Citi."
bad,bad management not flexible with hours very stressful environment its a good company but the management there is very very poor its very unfortunate...
bad,"I knew how to process the payments from them coming into the mailroom to getting deposited correctly. I loved the shift I was on, and we all got along great. Mangement was not the greatest. Could of been better."
bad,Most days are typical for a large company. My specific called for many weekends an nights due to business green zones when actual changes to the network could be completed.
bad,"Tons of Red tape, company was mismanaged to the point it cost me tens of thousands of dollars in my 401k because I was young and naive and listened to senior managers that had ""had their entire 401k in Citi stock""...then 2008 happened.  I somehow hung on working, excelling, winning awards, etc, then was reassigned to the worst boss of my career.  Citi promotes a bully culture, focused on numbers only.  The company i joined was the most profitable company in the world, the one I left was a shattered joke."
bad,Typical Everyday call center but if you ever need to reach out to HR or Management hire up for anything you can count on being shot down or being told that your issues arent valid issues to be calling. When it comes down to it its a favoritism place and you have to kiss butt for your manager to take your side.
bad,Management is difficult to work with. Hired with a bunch of promises and it was a different story when I started. No one wanted to address issues that were brought to upper management.
bad,"It was good to learn a lot about the banking industry and ML in general. However, there was a lot of redundancy and inflexibility. New ideas were not met with open mindedness in many cases. Lastly, the work/life balance is not good. If you prioritize family, it will be very difficult to reach the SVP (C-14) level and up."
bad,"This was the first time I  had got a job for a bank. They hired me with limited knowledge of the banking industry. My experience was not as pleasant because the employees doing the hard work were being overlooked. The employees who were not showing up for overtime, completing timecard fraud, and calling in were better rewarded. I made the decision to leave for more money. The pay at Citi was not very high compared to others. It was a fun place to be because you got to meet newer people and the team work was really good."
bad,Management is poor and always has their favorite. They are not always equal and often unprofessional. In order to be able to move up in the company you must have a good relationship with a manager.
bad,"high stress job with poor management. goal oriented business - expectations are unrealistic. overtime is expected when you dont meet your targets as a team and/or individually - expect to work 6 days a week more often than not. hours are extended with little notice, so if you are looking for a 9-5 monday-friday, i would advise you keep scrolling. little to no team building exercised. a negative work environment with no privacy - no cubicles, and desks are close together. wages are decent and they have good benefits though...."
bad,Jobs being moved out of NY and older workers being shown the exit. It is all about how fast jobs can be moved to low cost locations with no regard for the years one labored at this firm. Becoming more of a tech firm than a financial services firm.
bad,"The epitome of corporate culture over human beings."
bad,"This is a good company to work with. Good benefits.  However, most technology jobs are moving away from NYC to TX or India which allow the company to cut cost."
bad,I am all for competition but this is beyond that. It is frowned upon to have FMLA and definitely frowned upon to use it even with short term disability
bad,"Very fast paced and stressful, mangers were not around a lot for help if a question was needed. very little high management support very high turn over rate"
bad,"Company feels if you are young theres not much potential in you. They have their favorites and there is no way to become a favorite. They don't have room for anyone else, too much change.. C in Citi stands for Corrupted."
bad,"In process of outsourcing the entire mainframe support to less experienced staff to save money. This has led to very low morale, a cut throat, save yourself culture that inhibits camaraderie."
bad,"This job was very stressful and you never knew if they were going to cut your position at any time.  Also, this job was very competitive and did not offer a lot of incentive towards customers to accrue more business."
bad,The work environment was extremely stressful as the culture of the business changed and their value for tenures agents started to deminish.  Policies change frequently and information is not communicated across the board.  When trying to verify information regarding compliance the information is never consistent.
bad,Citi is focusing less on mortgage and more on personal wealth management...this is a good move in the right direction considering the aging population.
bad,"management level is lack of leadership"
bad,if you work hereget ready for inconsistency in the way they handle things or even score you. You make great money but the benefits are not worth all of the stress they put you through
bad,There appears to be no Corporate/Federal Compliance requirements and/or  Corporate /Government standards are not followed.  Not impressed considering the financial/banking fallout in 2008.
bad,"Management is under qualified and has no real direction. No one ever knows whats going on. Women are catty, Men are distracted by breasts. Your manager will only give you positive feedback and will fire you if their boss doesn't like you."
bad,Very frustrating 100% of job duties were carried out on computer and entire 5 yrs worked  constant problems with systems which often effected performance.  I was very fortunate to be work-at-home collections rep. Finally Involuntarily promoted to position with minimal bonus program.  Lost 20% of income.
bad,"Wonder if CEO knows or cares what goes on in the branch systems as to how it impacts clients. Dissemination of information spotty, often  released after the fact, i.e. late notice. Employees treated differently re access/perks depending if they are located at a headquarters building vs a branch location."
bad,"No career advancement. No proper training due to high call volume at the call centre. Contract based , no additional remuneration unless marketing job is done."
bad,"Large corporation, inefficient workflow, compartmentalization of function and thus limited interaction with associates across departments, no job security."
bad,"Too many changes, overwhelmed with work.  They expect you to grade yourself, if you rate yourself too high it's brought down no matter how hard you work.  Salaries and bonuses are a joke. Benefits are not great."
bad,Company is focused on reducing overhead costs and moving jobs to low cost locations. No opportunity for growth in NYC. Experience may vary from department to department dependent on specific manager.
bad,The pay was horrendous and benefits were cut while there.  I didn't feel management really cared about career growth.  The monthly goals were ridiculous for anyone to meet.   Just another way to avoid paying.
bad,"People don't seem to like or care about each other.  Everyone has their own agenda.  You are on your own once you start working there.  Nobody gives you pencils, notebooks or anything else a normal company would provide on day 1."
bad,The managers are very disrespectful. Coworkers were hard to get along with. Customers would yell and would leave unhappy. Not a comfortable place to work.
bad,"It is good place to work but not on third party payroll , Job culture is good but if depend on yours bosses how they treat you would be on yours luck , rest everything is fine employees are treated by Citi is best I would say."
bad,"Good work facility in Tampa, FL but it ends there. Poor Management and I've see a storm there in restructuring with Managing Directors to Senior VP's forced out and organizations with 80+ people affected with families. They have year end reviews that work on a curve and are fixed to not work in the benefit of their employees. I've seen great and smart leaders have to leave. They don't stay ahead of curve and they cycle people more to maintain their bottom line. They don't look at ethical cases seriously unless its in the companies best interest. A lot of marketing is put into promoting employees in growth but no actual implementation or actions are carried out here."
bad,You can move up very quickly. If you do not mind have multiple bosses this is a good job for you. The culture can seem not welcoming at first but once you prove yourself the job gets much better!
bad,"Compared to the care of employees to other retail banking jobs, Citibank has been the worst. They expect one banker to be fill in multiple positions while the manager sits behind their desk and dictate what they want."
bad,"I worked as an account investigator in Citi's business operations department.  My job description said that I was to perform account maintance, monetary transactions, and account openings.  I had to do so much more than that.  I was in a unit within the department called the Account Opening and Maintenance Unit, and I ended up carrying the majority of that unit's workload.  I became a subject matter expert for everything we did and all the systems we used before I was even hired on full-time.(I was temp to hire.)  My numbers were easily three to four times that of my better teammates', and I had a much lower error rate.  I was also handling every big project that came in by myself in addition to my work without being offered overtime, despite my coworkers getting overtime for Business As Usual work.  "
bad,"I'm working in Model Validation, which is hundreds of PhDs reduced to checking boxes for compliance purposes. Quite depressing."
bad,"I worked at citi for over 9 years trapped at the same location. I begged and pleaded to be transfer year after year to a better location. My production was great , I always made my goal , however citibank management fails to reward me for all my hard work ."
bad,"A typical work day is answering incoming calls from customers to redeem Thank You points and answer questions about their credit cards. I've learned about the credit card industry. Management tends to micromanage. Co-workers are friendly and helpful. The hardest part of the job is the lack of variety, it's the same thing everyday. ."
bad,"At Citi there's BC (before crash) / AC(after crash), my era was BC having left in 2004.   It's Walls Street so you got paid but very tough work environment... Advise you know what you are getting yourself into and who you work for / with is important.  There are a lot of  good people but can (often) easily be overshadowed by the ""titans"""
bad,"Typical Day - N/A"
bad,"they dont care about you, and will make up any and everything to make you feel like an idiot,and will not help you at all. they want you to sink and if you are good at your job they will hold you back so they can keep you."
bad,"I worked for Citi in the Ft Worth office for 14 years. There is no job advancement unless you drive out to the Las Colinas office. Some employees that are qualified for some of the jobs are passed over."
bad,"Access to senior management is impressive, but extremely political and not successful at promoting strategy beyond senior management."
bad,"I was hired through a temp agency. I was offered a specific starting amount, just before starting (5 days, after all paper work was completed and accepted) I was told due to Citi's mis-budgeting-my rate would be -$4.00+ lower than originally offered.  Accepted the position for Help Desk/Commercial Research. Team Lead knows very little about what his subordinates do and the job processes. A lot of office drama.  All temps were told they would have a decent notice, 1-2 weeks before job would terminate, or there could be an opportunity to be hired onto the company.  Was told by my agency, not the company that my assignment was ending with a 2 day notice-per notification from Citi 'management'.  It's unfortunate that this company is ran so unprofessionally and that NO management level could deliver the notification in person, as we see each other at least 20x on a daily basis. Glad for the opportunity to learn the business side of the position, relieved I am no longer surrounded by the office dramatics and poorly ran leadership."
bad,"impossible deadlines, inconsistent guidelines, no oneknows what they are doing,everyone is freestyling, the café is awsesome, you get to listen to your music all day, parking is ridiculous, however if you park in the employee of the month spots youll be fine(tow trucks never come) you'll just get little fake tickets lol. security will jumpstart your car for the low low)freeee, the VPs sit in little cubes(bhahahaha) and you share desks, training is a joke , basically you get paid for listening to nonsense for 4 weeks then once your done they expect you to pull tricks out of your hat  the bathrooms are super yuck. and again there is nooo unison, however if your a college kid or grad in your mid 20s this job is ok...its play play monopoly money"
bad,"my typical day of work is rather highly flexible: "
bad,"I was assigned to Ready Pac as a temp agent. A standard day had me working from 4:30 pm to approximately 3 am give or take loading pallets for shipping. I learned to deal with a harsh work environment as it was very cold, and still be focused and productive. My co-workers were mostly Hispanic which posed no problem with myself, but there is occasional racial tension. The most enjoyable part of the job for me was interacting with my co-workers and knowing that I played a major part in my team achieving it's goals each night."
bad,"Forget reading the job description, it has no bearing on what your daily activities will be. Prepare to be micro-managed and threatened with being fired on a continual basis. The sales process involves working the branch book of business, which has been wrung dry and has not much left in it, then compete with the branch for sales."
bad,"I learned quickly that the squeaky wheel gets the grease, and acting as unprofessional as possible gets you promoted.  One woman especially was a great example of this.  She complained daily and actually went against the grain on everything that was new policy.  She bullied people she didn't like and was two-faced.  She started the same day as me and arrived late to work the first four days.  Finally on the fifth day she got it right.  Her work ethic stunk, as did some of the other employees that she had worked with previously at CoreLogic. There was no work ethic and a very abrasive demeanor.  She was just looking to start something whether it be with a co-worker or a manager.  She wasn't bipolar but her personality would seem like it, as she was a powder keg waiting to go off.  No matter how many times people brought her up to the manager, she never got reprimanded and knew how far to push the limits without getting fired.  Her and several others who exhibited a lack of respect for others got promoted while those of us who actually worked our butts off didn't go anywhere.  Very disheartening work environment.  The stress became too much. Not a healthy place to work by any means"
bad,"its my fist job , i have learn lots of thing hear, i have get 1 st salary hear , am enjoying that time, its a great time,,,"
bad,"it is my experience working in NBFC .I Have learn how to handle the customer while during walk-in ,Phone and emails etc ."
bad,No positive review to give. Benefits are okay but not great. Low annual raises given to top rated employees.
bad,"Management is either lazy, incompetent and manipulative or brown nosing, mentally abusive, liars. Just all bad."
bad,"Working in such a large company will make a dramatic difference in your experience and quality of life. "
bad,"Citibank is a very difficult company to work for.  The favorite motto is that everyday it can be a different flavor of ice cream.  The management is not real supportive of you and the advancement opportunities are just not there. "
bad,"I entered the mortgage industry through an open invitation and found success quickly. Once the industry started to change, they became much stricter and inflexible. They became more demanding of my off time and the work life balance was very poor."
bad,A typical day at work can be very hectic due to the volume to loans being handled. I've learned to be extremely versatile and to react on the fly. Not a very social place to work as competition even amongst colleagues can be very high. The most enjoyable part of the job is the sense of accomplishment.
bad,"Company as a whole is ok but the group I work with are unscrupulous group of former Lehman folks that has double standard policy towards anyone outside that group (i.e. they will saddle with anyone outside the group with 4/5 projects at a time while they basically do nothing most of the time). When it comes to reward and recognition, the double standards again apply. The group head has a ""sponsor"" up the chain so everyone just mumbles about it and does nothing in fear of retribution. Also when it comes to accountability, there is none. You will be blamed for delay on project while the other people (ex-lehman) might be the cause of the delay because they have not responded on a request for weeks. If you bring it up to your manager, then he will say maybe you haven't done enough. You should hound them or whatever (totally ignoring the fact that it was one his former / current colleague) that held up progress."
bad,"Good company to work with, free dinners, good transport facility, great management & good shift timings"
bad,"Individually sold 95 Residential units valued at over INR 2, 40, 00, 00,000/-."
bad,"The job was easy and kinda fun, to help internal and external clients with online/computer needs. The co-workers for the most were a joy to work with and I made some life long friends also. I learned a great deal about the tech world and about computers while at this job. The most enjoyable part of the job was dealing with the clients, people who had simple issues (but not for them) made me seem almost like a super hero when I resolved their matters. The hardest part of the job was dealing with the values of key management, seeing the corruption first hand and how it impacted my co-workers and the work place."
bad,"Highly stressful environment"
bad,"1) There are no sturdy plans to implement work"
bad,"High demanding, very little room for advancement. Call center for credit card service and high pressure for selling products. Focused more on sale than service."
bad,"Citi Group is by far in my opinion one of the greatest financial insitutes for building a great foundation for success in any line of business. Currently as a project manager I touch every aspect that could effect a business overall. Projects that I have dealt with cover the full spectrum of buisness from sales, operations, legal/regulatory, operations, and of course Citi's fortee, financial product lines."
bad,Learned a lot about sales and people and customer management.
bad,Highly stressful company to work for. They have no care or compassion for their clients or employees & are only worried about making that almighty dollar. Only individuals with corrupt morals would continue to work for this company.
bad,"When you get to work you have to sit and wait for a truck to get in, this could be 2 hours after you are supposed to start! Once the truck comes in mail gets sorted and then you could start. I learned how to process passports it was not hard fairly simple, I actually enjoyed it! Management was okay, if you were one of the select few that they liked you could give input during meetings. If not you get let go with no warning! The co-workers pretty nice mostly everyone stayed to them selves but was always nice! The hardest part of the job was all the waiting around just to get started and the best part of the job was being able to have my Ipod with me while I worked!"
bad,Overworked and outsourced - No Work / Life balance. No concern for personal health or family life.
bad,Focused heavily on numbers but it helped employees strive.
bad,Progressive training and work environment. Open door policy from management.
bad,"Under trained and under skilled manangement. They don't offer ongoing training, they put individuals in positions that aren't trained for management positions. They also don't value their employees."
bad,"great benefits, constantly changing policies and procedures, long hours, underpaid, no work/life balance"
bad,"ok company to work - do not have any training  or mentoring concept."
bad,"This site is full of one specific ethnic unfortunately, which is definitely not fair to other ethnic and could potentially violate the equity of employment although they will not admit the fact."
bad,"Not a good place to work, if you are looking for a growth. Salary is very low and the incentive structure is very poor. Sales Managers are also not at times not supportive."
bad,"	Responsible for top 5% of Citibank’s high value, chairman, celebrities accounts."
bad,"CITI has amazing health insurance and their pay is very good for a call center."
bad,Citi is one of the leading banks with advanced system technology. It also promotes a positive workplace culture and provides good employment benefits.
bad,The capital markets division does not give their interns any experience in building models. Whilst you are there you are a professional formatter. Would not recommend
bad,"Job was very flat, depending on the work week. No real room for advancement without nepotism. Management is very poor. Amazing and hard working coworkers but also beaten down by Management."
bad,They are the lowest paying of all the major banks. You can virtually never change your schedule unless a doctor writes out something and then it's at least a month long process. The benefits are decent. your life will be ruled by ambiguities such as single word variations in notes. Changes will be sprung upon you and you won't even have time to react.
bad,"Fresh grads, stay away. They offer higher than average salary yes, but work life balance sucks. They ask you to come in an hour before shift UNPAID and when you’re late for that UNPAID hour they make a deduction to your salary. When you take calls even if its already time to go home they will ask you to finish all calls and extend longer hours UNPAID. They even told their new hires to sleep in the sleeping quarters just so they wont be late for that one hour UNPAID ‘study session’. Terrible. You'll find better opportunities elsewhere without having to sacrifice your personal life. Stay away. Their new hires almost never last that’s why they’re always hiring."
bad,I felt everyday I was going to be fired and they keep you stressed out about do this do not do this and the trainers have their likes and if your a favorite then you can violate the rules
bad,"Citi was once a great place to work.  Now the company is focused on the bottom-line by discontinuing jobs and posting a slightly different job at a lower salary.  Some employees are required to post along with other applicants for the position, or lose their job while other employees who have longevity with the company and at the top of the position's salary range lose their job immediately.  Citi is able to save by hiring another employee at less pay, having the existing team absorb the work or sending the position overseas (overseas workers are paid up to 60% less than what US workers are)."
bad,I prefer to not make any comments about Citi as I am currently employed there. I find it a shame that Indeed forces you to make comments about your current employer.
bad,"training was short and many employees quit due to not understanding the training. management was not available when needed for help, when needing help with job advised to find help on our own, was frowned upon to ask managers or others."
bad,"The managers are lacking in customer service skills, they dont care and you are just a number to them.. You can find something else don't settle, child!!!"
bad,"If you are ok with figuring out everything on your own, lack of training, long hours, bad management then this is the place for you. Diversity is not what try to promote."
bad,"Quick footed, slow witted management style"
bad,"I was an Associate in the Investment Banking Dept.  I learned valuable skills such as financial modeling/analysis, and I was well-compensated; however the culture was extremely bad. Junior talent are treated like resources and work-life balance is non-existent.  You are expected to work at all hours of the night on-demand, even for the most menial tasks, and you are also expected to work during holidays. Often times the work was not meaningful. Investment banking is supposed to be an ""apprenticeship industry""; however our senior bankers took no interest in development, there was no collegiality nor camaraderie, and, frankly, personal animosities on my floor were common and intense. Most junior bankers in my group left within a year. With so many career opportunities available to young professionals, I would advise against a career in IB at Citi."
bad,"was a modification underwriter for 5 years with Citi, kept clients updated on their accounts and modifications and made sure that they were able to make monthly payments based off their income and assets or assisted in liquidation procedures. job ended when citi sold off the Mortgage dept"
bad,Face Time is important at the work place. No work life balance. Not a great place for working moms. No collaboration. No Training. Not a friendly place to work unless you are young and single and stay to burn the mid-night oil.
bad,not a good place to work.  Micro-management and politics.  Senior management does not know what they are talking about in many cases but does not seek actual answers
bad,"Recruited for handling credit operations hot site for Mumbai. Later no further recruitment happened, in place of 5 people only 2 were placed. Daily stretch and lunch between 3:30 to 4pm."
bad,"i enjoyed the co workers and this also had a fast turnaround , but i learned a lot about retail, i don't think i was suited for a sales position . i would not to work under sales environment"
bad,"I had a degree in Finance, but I felt like I was selling my soul to put people into loans they couldn't afford or didn't need. It was really high-pressure sales. Churning existing profiles by offering ""CAD"" or Customer Appreciation Days to add funds on to existing loans. Really shady practices."
bad,"pay is good"
bad,"I found out after I worked there for such a short time that they needed a few people to catch them up while they were hiring others that had come a few weeks later. My duties were very basic such as stapling papers, filing, faxing, Xeroxing and preparing portfolios. As soon as the people they hired before I filled in for such a short time, and they were  ready to start, my services was no longer needed."
bad,"In Citibank you got job security but  you won’t be get recognised for the work you do tat and ad hoc activities. If you do your work within the work hours and leave than your are not capable , only when you stretch for 2-3 hours daily your capable."
bad,Our company was purchased by CitiMortgage.  If you were not an original CITI employee it was verify difficult to work there.  We were always threatened with layoffs.  It was a verify stressful place to work.
bad,"A workday would consist of focusing on customer service & sales to acquire new and existing client into new banking products. Also, speaking with clients that had investment accounts."
bad,"Great job but poor management. Not enough foundation for learning to become into your role. Management always made me as if I was pressured, not gaining enough knowledge or stability."
bad,a typical day at work and the management is ok. Workplace are mostly Indians though. Team was good and we do have team lunch every now and the but overall I don't see myself working long term on the firm.
bad,"A lot of training and support during the training sessions. Once on the floor, team leader monitoring and much couching. Training meant to create extensive multi-tasking of bankers."
bad,"solid work place, the hardest part of the job is the schedule, the most enjoyable part of the job are the people you work with.  a ypical workday starts at 8 ends at 5"
bad,Don't expect to be special here you are just another number.  You can easily be replaced and there are far superior companies that hire in the treasure valley.
bad,"This company does compensate their employees well.  Each employee also receives remote access on day one.  Being able to be flexible and work friendly is key, but certain management is not caring and very tough to work with."
bad,"This is an okay company to work.  Often feel like I am working in an hostile environment.  As a new employee to Citi, you are expect to know the work two weeks after your start date.  I think to be successful, Citi should offer more training to their new managers and assign someone to mentor his or her."
bad,"My career at Citi was from part-time and full-time from 1985-1993.  I was driven to get my BA while at Citibank; however, my employment at Citi was so distant from today, my rating would be irrelevant."
bad,I worked at Citicorp Investment Services 20 year ago but many things may have changed. The culture was to micromanage and there was little room for advancement. Hours were long due to lack of technology.
bad,It was a very fast pace competitive workplace. They had their picked and choose. The managers were more friends than managers should be to the employees.
bad,Citi tries to pass themselves off a fun place to work but the micro managing is out of control..they will even question who youre friends with. I felt more like high school than anything else
bad,The company is too large to care for employees although they appear to be for their employees.  They continue to have mass layoff and when it happens they are not transparent and most cases no noticed is given they just come in and say this is your last day.
bad,it good job; while i was going to school the salary wasn't enough to live on my own.  i had to live with some one.  what i didn't like other temp agency paid more for the same job.  but only hire certain race of people
bad,"Really do not care to submit any information on this company or my past experience with them.  "
bad,"A typical day at work meant a 10 hour day, with very little time to relax during lunch breaks due to the demands on the team.  Lack of management and little interest in the well-being of  permanent staff, evident by a team being made up of over 50% temporary staff."
bad,Ja deixou de existir no Brasil. Pessimo ambiente de trabalho.
bad,"Its hectic on daily basis but there is a lot to learn. Its a very good exposure to learn on projects, re-engineering, process improvements. Its a place  diversity is given importance. However, the managements decisions is not in favor of the existing employee's."
bad,"Outstanding Benefits. My direct supervisor did what he could to save my job but upper management did not seem committed to our channel and there simply wasn't enough work to go around. Too much work was outsourced and quality suffered, due to the lack of quality, lenders became reluctant to do business with us. Things were bad in my channel but I have to say Citi has been great since the lay-off. A long notice period and generous severance package."
bad,"There is too much discrimination in terms of salary,perks between manager and higher rank employees in comparison to front or lower management employees.HR not supportive to lower level employees."
bad,"Citi company has been aggressively moving positions from NY to FL to reduce labor expenses."
bad,"typical day at work, what I've learned, management, workplace culture the hardest part of the job. All was just fine. The most enjoyable part of the job"
bad,"No work life balance, limited growth opportunities, poor management, too many reorgs, no meritocracy culture, poor bonus, unfair management, lack of transparency"
bad,If you don't mind sitting all day and taking calls non-stop then you would enjoy this job. The company has great benefits but terrible work hours. People are great but you won.t get a chance to interact unless you are on the same lunch or break.
bad,"Its an outdoor job,everyday i encounter different kind of people."
bad,The environment was extremely disorganized and stressful. Management was not on the same page often resulting in confusion and missed opportunities. Goals were constantly changing with little to no communication to the appropriate parties.
bad,The hardest part of the job was meeting deadlines and not receiving proper incentives afterwards. Its difficult to remain motivated when your work isn't recognized and direct leaders fail to create an inclusive environment.
bad,"Good benefits, competitive pay, but a stressful working environment. The schedules vary per department and also the pay per postition. beautiful building"
bad,"I only worked here for one year before they closed their doors and moved out of the city.  I would not work here again for that reason.  "
bad,Empresa focada em não cometer os mínimos erros e as vezes esquece do ser humano.
bad,"In the beginning the place seems as if there are unlimited possibilities; however after being there for 6 months or better, you will notice who the favorites are. Management is unorganized and does a poor job at communicating with the entire staff. If you have a family or participate in outside activities, you will not advance as there is no flexibilty with schedule (but they have the capability to work from home)."
bad,A typical work day was very routine and usually very predictable. The days are extremely reliable and regular and expect to have routine figured out within a couple of weeks.
bad,"Extremely political and stressful work environment. Compensation does not match work volume. My direct manager was excellent, but overall culture was horrible."
bad,You aren't paid much but to be fair there isn't much out of the box thinking required here. If you want to advance or get your way there is a way but its inappropriate
bad,Management is two faced.  Don't move up in the company if you want to remain valued.   You'll regret moving up in the company unless you can brown nose.
bad,"Over demanding for the pay.  The Management are always changing the procedures.  Managers don't communicate with each other, and some managers don't communicate with their employees and they expect you to do a great job."
bad,"A typical day at work is dealing with an angry boss. You have to walk on your tippy toes to not get her angry. Anything sets he off. We have dinosaurs who don't retire which leads to younger people not getting promoted. I haven't learned anything new in fact there are some things this place could learn from my old company. Since I'm the newer guy I'm treated differently. For instance Citi is big on remote work however my boss makes me come in 4 days a week while everyone else gets to work from home 5 days a week. Everyone here is at a minimum 25 - 30 years older than I am and instead of using that to their advantage they are very condescending very unhappy old people. Just to be clear not all of Citi is like this. I see some folks in my age group all the time and they look like they are having fun. They work in other departments. If you decide to work here just make sure to grill the hiring manager and get the salary you want when you walk in the door because although people get raises and bonuses here, if your manager doesn't feel like giving it to you then you won't get it and if you complain make sure you have another job lined up."
bad,"Generally, these work places were alright and fun to work in.  Gained lots of knowledge for work as well as life skills.  Able to exercise discretion as offices were small and interactions with colleagues were easy."
bad,Citi was a whatever type of job. not the greatest of space or location. management was kinda of iffy. if you fresh out of hight school I would recommend.
bad,The hours were extremely long and stressful. The focus seems to be on volume (amount of work produced) versus the quality of the programs delivered each quarter.
bad,this company does not care about what the employee needs. unless you are a high up. forget. when i worked here they gave you 1 week of training then you were on your own. had to buy all your own supplies. then you were not able to take it with you when you left.
bad,Too much of work pressure and working 10 hrs is a norm and expectation from the management though you are only paid for 7.5 hours. Weekends are also tight. this might not be entirely true if you are working on the development or any other team. Support teams are fully loaded. Salaries are just good enough but not at par with the market. No work-life balance!!
bad,"Work day can be 10 plus hours..."
bad,I learned a lot from Citi Mortgage but the job did to many layoffs.  Also the commute was 45 min away from my home and that was really bad in the winter time.
bad,"Huge advantage because of the brand. However, I was unfortunate to work with immature managers. Management style is hierarchical and bureaucratic. HR intervention was NIL during my stint there."
bad,I had to approach the people that walked by the mall and to convert them of that they requested the card. Some customers were angry for bothering them in their free time
bad,"No work life balance though management will deny it.  "
bad,I worked for this company for 8 years.  I had a jealous manager and she made it very difficult for me to move to another department.  She used me to make herself look good.  After she found out that I was in school for my Masters degree things got worse.  This may be a good place to work for some but it depends on who you are and who you work for.  Management sucks and they can tell each other not to hire you for their own personal reasons.  They also hire friends and family eve if they are not qualified.  After watching my manager treat myself and others horribly I wouldn't want to work in that department anymore... I saw her fire a young lady because she told on her.... the young lady was a temp so she couldn't report it.
bad,"systems are very very very very outdated. Processes are confusing, tedious, and leave a lot of room for mistakes. A lot of things do not make sense at all."
bad,computer issues daily. system is very slow menus are the worst to navigate. Doing simple things require 5min+. System is old and outdated. A lot of paper is wasted doing simple documents. Audits are serious thing here this is probably more serious than anything else. It's hard to get help with a specific issue since they have departments for every single thing and a lot of jobs are outsourced to 3rd party and they really have no idea on how to fix related issues.
bad,"Did you know that Citigroup fired over 50,000 employees and the majority were males over the age of 40. We had to sign a No Lawsuit agreement to receive our severance packages."
bad,"Responsible for confirmation of trades . served as liaison between sales team, inter-bank, prime brokerage, treasury and future clearing departments. handled outgoing payments, transfer of funds and wire transfers of currency from commodities to stock side"
bad,"With extended hours at work, you expect long term growth in knowledge and expertise but this isn't the case here. Reward comes in form of some annual bonus and hike, but this isn't something that really puts curtain to the show. Provided you are lucky enough to have good peers and a supportive leadership team, you may learn something."
bad,"Seus representantes misturam itens pessoais com profissionais, não sabendo (infelizmente) distinguir bons amigos de maus profissionais..."
bad,"I start my week with planning my itinerary for the week. Plot schedule with client as well as corporate meetings so I can gather bulk of loan application for the week. "
bad,"Good place to work for "
bad,I worked for JLL.  They hired me without letting me know that they were loosing their contract with Citi Group.  I resigned from my employer for a better company but they were hiring just because they were short of people for the last quarter of the year.
bad,"The training is good, the ability to be promoted is limited, and the culture is corrupt. Not for the faint of heart or those with desire to believe in their work."
bad,"Long hours of work, no good compositions. No good co-worker environment. Not a good management interpersonal skills. no life balance. Hope it get better."
bad,"Hardest part of the job is keeping get up with the numerous logins you have to come in early to do without pay, and your payroll system management."
bad,Company does not like to promote from within.  Job security is not reinforced so things are always tense on a monthly bases.  Company changing banking model and switching to digital access and forgetting about the well being of it employee.
bad,this job is fast paced you must be able to keep up because there are productivity requirements that you must meet they give you some time to learn and get the hang of it but you must be a fast learner.
bad,"Friendly, but stressful environment. Did not have time to advance my skills that much. Very tight schedule and deliverable"
bad,Good co-workers to work with. Productive place. Learnt much about how to interact with other people and to manage my time well.
bad,boring just do reapeated and waste work everyday. The salary here is so low that a lot of people jump to other companies. I learned nothing here. The management here is so chaotic.
bad,"A typical day is filled with meetings, emails, IM's and more meetings.  The pace is fast and fun.  Co-workers are mostly supportive."
bad,A lot of projects that have following projects to undo the previous. Good people that work there. Ultimate Leadership lacks qualifications and knowledge to plan but they do anyway.
bad,"worked for  short time not having that much knowledge about that company. "
bad,"A typical day at work consisted of coming in, being ignored by all the full timers, given attitude from the assistant manager and being ignored when requested for help in order to prosper in the job. The only thing I learned from that job was the NBS system and how to not let people walk all over me despite their position. My co-workers never talked to me because I was new and a part timer and they did not even try to make friends with me no matter how hard I tried. What I most enjoyed was the one other part time who was treated the same way. We started off with 4 part timers and all of us left because of management so how is it possible we are all wrong and they are all right."
bad,It was ok...it was a contract job. not much to say as I did not stay long. time The people there were ok. Did not havet time to make friends. Not too much to say.
bad,"It's ok to get experience at, but for the long haul I would get what you need and move on.  Hours & benefits are good, people are nice."
bad,I learned how to prepare complex tax returns.  The co-workers were easy to work with and were team players.  I didn't like working just for tax season.
bad,"inancial advisors typically provide clients/customers with financial products and services, depending on the licenses they hold and the training they have had. For example, an insurance agent may be qualified to sell both life insurance and variable annuities. A broker may also be a financial planner. A financial advisor may create financial plans for clients or sell financial products, or a combination of bot"
bad,"The recruiter was terrible and did nit disclose certain aspects of the job, in addition told me it was bonus eligible, that was not correct. I left a good job to move over for a better opportunity that does not exist..."
bad,If you're looking to get at least one year of management experience under your belt its a great place to work and advance. Difficult to advance to anything higher than a store manager though because those positions stay full for long periods of time.
bad,This job is cool. I am okay with the company and will not speak bad about it because it was the decision I made when there was nothing else that came my way. So I am in a sense thankful for Citi in that aspect.
bad,"Dont get caught in the deadzone of VP or SVP unless you are happy doing very little.   If you are passing through its ok - long term its where lifers pass their time with decreasing impact. There are far too many like this and its bad for the people and the organization."
bad,No upper management presence. The managers in the department have no additional training and are too focused on the wrong areas due to poor direction from higher ups.
bad,"The people I work with are very data knowledgeable. Management doesn't appreciate all the work that gets done and promotions are not offered in public. "
bad,during my time at CITI I found that there was a lot of favoritism going on as most of the people in charge came from BOA.  The only was for me to advance at this company was to be on another team or to be a male.
bad,"Everything scrutinized to the nth degree, including comments made as an aside to a peer.  Could not trust management or co workers."
bad,"expect nothing more, Citi is going through a tech stack upgrade of sorts after years of stagnating, so lots of expectations on developers."
bad,They were at a good place back in 2007-2009 after that its been a down hill ride for these guys. hope they recover from there downward spiral soon
bad,"Citi is a global company that values its clients.Citi strives on making its clients happy. As an employee, I am treated fairly."
bad,"It is not good for it's employees."
bad,"learned about documentation of home loan seekers, drive team targets, managed a team, time management, enhanced sales skills and so on."
bad,"The position started off pretty well. The branches had a happy atmosphere and seemed like a very nice place to work. Co-workers were extremely helpful and patient when it came to training and interacting with new hires. Teamwork was present within the branches, and the Personal Bankers worked very well with tellers to help them with referrals. Branch managers were supportive and encouraging. This all began to change over the year I spent with Citibank."
bad,"You have really work hard to set yourself apart from the waves of people coming in and out. But if you find the right manager who will develop you,  your future can be very rewarding at this organization. "
bad,"Citibank is a okay place to work. Not a flat organization and very hierarchy driven, but great experiences with the company."
bad,"this is a hard place to work, stay away.  far away"
bad,I worked at First Nationwide for several years prior to the company being sold to CitiMortgage. My job was outsourced and our department was eliminated.
bad,This company was strict with not enough pay and the benefits were to high.
bad,"No opportunity for growth, once you are in a department, that's where you will stay no opportunities for training or advancement. Department managers were not underwriters & hired a mixture of Underwriters & Non-Underwriters. Only friends of management (non-Underwriters) were given favor/bonus & special treatment all others are treated with sweat-shop mentality."
bad,"You should spend lots of overtime at work. Management would not help in any way. Work is expected to be done all by yourself as an individual. No team work. Management is involved(sort of directly provokes) directly in conflicts within colleagues. "
bad,No work life balance. Badly managed project. Higher management don't provide adequate information.
bad,"This was a decent place to work for the time I worked there. It is unfortunate the location in Mcleansville, NC is now closed. It provided a lot of jobs for a lot of people."
bad,"A ok pay ,but no room for advancement and hiring on. supervisors are hard to understand because they don't speak full English."
bad,I am currently responsible for maintaining the online messaging process.  I am responsible for all training and overseeing the representatives currently working the incoming and outgoing messages.  This includes both retail banking as well as retirement and brokerage.
bad,"10 hr shifts on the phone as a fraud representative. "
bad,"Highly matricized and specialized, decent pay and people. While they speak about work/life balance the workload they require doesn't really back it up"
bad,vente en ligne et augmentation de limite de crédit à la clientèle
bad,People were great to work with but company needs to grow and understand who they are looking for.
bad,I was not completely satisfied with the work environment. The employee moral was very low with no support from management.  Innovation was not invited by management.
bad,"The management is terrible. There is no work-life balance, no matter how much work you do management is always ungrateful. Over my 5 plus years at this company, I've watch the management of this company get worst with each passing year. I think Citibank should reconsider who they employ to represent their company. With that being said the training and benefits were good."
bad,took in bound and out bound calls to various clients who have financial questions
bad,not receptive with follow up.  most enjoyable part of the job was working with clients.
bad,No work life balance and unnecessary chaotic work environment
bad,i have nothing to say about this company...it`s been a good one though its on a night shift
bad,"Working with other co-workers is enjoyable able to bounce ideas of of each other easily.  Lack of support teaching, training."
bad,"Accomplished business professional with a high-level of project management, SDLC, business anaysis,UAT Coordination and release management"
bad,The hours are long and the work is not for everyone but for the few who are able to excel this can be a good experience.
bad,"Good experience, the company is a bit too big making it difficult to be effectively managed. most employees are just a number.."
bad,Overall the benefits are good. The case workload is too much and not managable for a 40 hr work week. Most people average about 60-70 hr work weeks and weekend. company can't see to retain employees. High turnoever rate due to employees being over worked and burnt out. No work/life balance.
bad,"Citi has great pay! But, there are downfalls. Depending on the area that you work in. It also depends on how well you read specifically by script. This company does not set you up for what you are going into. The scripts and training do not tell you what to do; in the event your client is screaming at you. This company will not work around a different schedule for up to a year."
bad,Branches closed left and right. The pay was horrible. You were giving vacation days but not allowed to use them.
bad,in my department it was all about upselling. if you were good it was hard for you to advance in the company
bad,really there is not much to describe cause I didn't really get that much work opportunities.
bad,this was my first company.i had started my career from this company. management was so-so. low salary. off roll job
bad,"Let me first start out by saying I worked here for 3 years. They hired me as a Customer Service rep, and I was pretty grateful because I had left a McJob right before. Compared to the pittance I was making at the McJob, Citibank was a revelation. However, as time progressed and my financial obligations increased, I quickly found the $12.80/hr (after 3 years with the company) to be unrealistic compensation. They will keep training you in different specialties, but they will not pay you for taking on these extra responsibilities. I am unmarried and have no children, so to think this company is paying similar wages to people with families is shameful for the amount of pressure and workload of the job. "
bad,"My work day consists of collections calls, soliciting and customer service. The hardest part of my job is when I know a customer really needs financial assistance and I cannot help them."
bad,Call people in regards to their store credit cards. Work as a team to achieve collection numbers.
bad,Citibank was great introduction to banking but no room for growth.
bad,A company that is an ok place to work. Not a team playing organization
bad,As a Company CITI might be big and a great company (for its name sake) but its impotant to consider to which Dept you are going to work with. BP&A department in 6400 LasColinas is a worst department to work with. Worst culture.Specially all the Senior and Group Manager are with worst attitude and worst management practices. Not a good place to work.
bad,Very busy. Not enough time to do an excellent job. Timed on everything done regardless of the work involved.
bad,"I was a Teller there for about 10months, I had to quit due to the STRESS! Personally, when a work place begins to cause me stress in a hostile manner I am unable to perform. The Branch Manager would always be breathing down necks in the Branch to push referrals. The manner in which she'd go about it became very hostile. The PB was also stressed out and would ask me if I had any family members willing to open up accounts because she was worried about loosing her job. Very Very Sad. The company cant really fire you for referrals but they will make a way"
bad,Bond valuations and index linked fund analysis and understand global debt and equity market.
bad,See previous; same company as Onemain Financial.
bad,"The best thing about this work place was that there was a huge cafeteria. The pay was very low back then, I quite because I found a better job."
bad,"The hardest part of the this job was having to explain the ""Change in Terms"" letter. Having to tell people their interest was going up, then having to try and sell them a feature for the credit card."
bad,"Office politics ruled the day at Citi. Management could be overtly insulting and disrespectful to employees (ex: executive in charge of operation telling broker to pick up an errant piece of paper on the floor in hallway and throw it away, same exec commenting in elevator shared with brokers ""im riding with the little people today."") Personnel decisions for promotion and advancement rarely if ever merit based. General sense of malaise among most staff, attitude of ""I can't wait to get out of here..."" shared by most."
bad,"Monitored accts for fradulent activity, closed accts due to fraud, learned how to look for fradulent activity"
bad,No teamwork encouraged. Managers lack experience. As soon as you start consider you are glued to your desk: minimal break in 12 hrs working day. If you do take a break - suddently you are a bad employee! I've learned to survive in hostile environment created by managers and work for/with unprofessional people.
bad,"Didn't like being there... the department was constantly changing the rules from day to day. From policy changes to non policy; there was little time to adjust to these changes, until after being there for a year, they began laying all of us off."
bad,"Excessive micromanaging, no job security and unrealistic goals"
bad,"Citicards is an extension of Citibank. They have good benefits, but the schedules aren't the best."
bad,"This company wants you to know everything right after your training is over, at least the branch in San Rafael CA does!They don't give you a chance to grow."
bad,A very greedy cheap company to work for.managment is horrible as is training.
bad,Respond to hundreds of emails.
bad,"Citi overall has a OK benefit and compensation package, but the company does not value the employees' contribution and move lots of jobs to overseas all the time. The communication between the management and the employees are not effective. In terms of life-work balances, the company is doing pretty well by giving the employees the options to work from home a day or two every week."
bad,It's a terrible place to work the management would rather fire you than help you improve. I was given less than a month for a necessary performance improvement
bad,"I applied for a sales job but was given customer service phone representative position with a sales opportunity at and of call. Within 6 months of taking job all sales were cancelled. It became more about customer complaints then anything else. After ! Year I was promoted to supervisor position with was just to handle escalated calls. After 3 years Citi began to offer bonuses to base representatives so I stepped down from supervisor For bonus option as would make more money. Each year they would change the bonus criteria so I made less and less each year, until was making little to no bonus at all. The customers call in were angry about the bill and procedure and are on hold with an automated service adverting 20 minutes before speaking to a representative. The was by design to replace representatives, but made customers more angry. The customer were verbally abusive and Citi did not allow representative to advise customer or policy and to “take ownership of call” as if representative were personally responsible. The verbose abuse and decreasing pay made me hate my job and life in general. I grow more and more happy until my mental heath and happiness were at risk, so I decided to walk away. Management were some what nice but nature or job was the issue."
bad,Proper compensation on overtime and bonus. Appreciation should be given to the staff on their hard work. Work life balance should be implemented where employee should not be working for more than working hours. Innovation plus welfare of employee should be in line.
bad,"So I had a rough year. I had complications with my pregnancy, lost both my grandmother's, my little brother had a medical crisis, I was in the hospital four times, and my mother had two surgeries and each time I was told to plan better, have a back up plan to my back up plan. I was over my unplanned hours, yes, but was watching other people in the same situation accommodate and given opportunities I never was. I was also preached to about our amazing benefits, which I used when I qualified for it but most of the time didn't due to not having enough hours under my belt or not being out long enough. I was struggling due to my ongoing health issues and instead of being helped they walked me out the door.  My experience does not speak for the whole company but get the wrong manager that waiting till your drowning to finally try to help and you will not do well"
bad,"Only stayed in the company for 4 months and I hated it."
bad,"Citi is a huge company and with that comes the advantages and disadvantages of working for a huge company.  On the plus side, if you want to relocate to Poland, you can.  On the negative side, if you don't want to relocate, you will.  Human resources is a mess.  They don't really have a great strategy or a focus.  They say that employees are their greatest asset, yet if that employee does a referral, it's doubtful that they will be paid.  Whenever they can outsource, they will do it even if that means a huge step down in quality.  In short, they are cheap."
bad,"Its all about work here..the management needs a lot of improvement especially in listening to the staff's opinion and needs. The benefits given were good. They gave good medical coverage and the paid leaves are a plenty. Overall, you need to really be mentally strong to work here."
bad,"very competitive, very slow.  had to be able to sell to every customer and it was hard since it was usually the same customer. staff was very close minded"
bad,"Excelentes salarios e instalaciones a cambio de pésimo liderazgo, managers mal preparados y mal intencionados. La cultura entre los empleados es de chismes, problemas personales, engaños, etc. High Management desde US empeora las condiciones con requerimientos poco claros, políticas y procedimientos mal diseñados y decisiones mal acertadas. Las evaluaciones de desempeño son subjetivas y antojadizas. El departamento de recursos humanos vela por la empresa y rara vez por los empleados, los generalistas están atrozmente understaffed. El servicio de comida es caro, sabe mal y siempre esta frio..."
bad,"This location has a lot of friends and family that work together and employees who've been in their positions for 15+ plus. More so than I have seen at any other company. Guaranteed if you are talking to someone they have a connection there. This makes it hard when competing for a promotion if you are the new employee. I found a lot of favoritism as people have created long term friendships and will give work to their friends and family first. You are expected to work fast with no errors and most positions have standards set based on their highest achievers. In my opinion, they've missed the boat completely on a good working environment. Keep your head down, don't talk to anyone, get as much work done as you can. On the positive, its really hard to get fired from Citi, the benefits are brilliant, discounts are great, and they have amazing volunteer opportunities."
bad,Poor Management from the top down. No raises because of poor management and accountability issues. Promises and forced ratings of managers for several years in a row. Okay pay but not enough to keep up with the industry.
bad,Not much to say really. Worked extremely hard only to have the results of our efforts be useless soon afterwards. Management played favorites and prevented advancement.
bad,"Highly political, back stabbing culture at Sr VP level up. The amount of management that has surpassed their Peter Principal level is staggering. The regular employees are for the norm very very talented people."
bad,Citibank seees you as just a number not a person they will turn you over in a heart beat if not meeting goals and requirements in a one month period and the management team would always talk bad about the employees
bad,"This company is a great company to work for however, the people that work for the company need to get a better understanding of the company value. As an employee of the company i felt that it wasn't everyone value. i was mistreat and when i took the step to go to upper management per there open door police my concerns was pushed under the rug. My problem was never resolved and as a result i ended up putting in my two week notice"
bad,"Work was challenging, people were usually cooperative, but competative, very stressful work place, high expectations to deliver, sometimes unreasonable, pay and compensation was inconsistent, especially for Director level managers."
bad,A área de Recursos Humanos não está preparada para resolver assuntos de ética no trabalho.
bad,"Previous managers were GREAT! Couldn't ask for anything better! Very flexible, understanding, have an open-door..., allow room/ opportunity for growth...  Current management is a DISAPPOINTMENT in comparison. Very little respect for team members. 4-5+ hrs of meetings scheduled almost daily, with little regard for employee workload.  Frequent night/ weekend work hours with shifts scheduled from 8p - 5p (the following nt), in addition to weekend night release work.   Very easy to burn out your staff in this manor. "
bad,"Citi group has much to offer, but at times Company mission gets ignored. If you are all about processes and procedures, then this is not for you. We have procedures and processes but most are broken and not followed. Email is used as an IM means of communicating  and the IM chat is used to by pass any processes. No one knows which group takes care of what site or product. "
bad,Call center collections where certain procedures were implemented that were not above board. I had been doing collections and kept up on all federal laws and took exception to some of the policies that were being used. Management and I discussed it and I was laid off a month later.
bad,The team morale is lacking. Small businesses celebrate their employees as unique individuals. I wish Management would celebrate our hard work with something special like a healthy lunch or thank you points (that were discontinued months ago). I know many employees feel they are not appreciated for what they do. How many of us take pride in our work?
bad,"•	Daily task include review and evaluate originate VA/FHA, USDA,  203k and bond loan files and  Information on mortgage loan documents to determine if borrower property and or loan conditions meet company requirements and government standards"
bad,"When I initially joined Citi, I was excited to join an organization that had a history of being a strong institution.  It was not like that at all.  When I left, the culture of the organization was crumbling."
bad,"working for citi was very stressful. Lack of training was almost a given, and then made to handle work with out the proper tools. Most assistance came word of mouth from other employees versus with management. The pay was great during my first 2 years. After that I felt they did all they could to cut positions and cut senior or tenured employee's."
bad,Poca estabilidad laboral y muchas horas extras que no eran pagadas
bad,"The company sold the auto division of the company and we had no knowledge of this until it was too late. I worked from home and it was great but, we had a lot of problems with the systems working from home."
bad,"Empresa prestadora de serviços, dinamica e bom ambiente de trabalho"
bad,I would not recommend this employer to anyone. As a manger I was required to work an average of 50+ hours per week and some Saturdays with little notice.
bad,"did not care for management, they are very disorganized and very stressful place to work...majority of the people there hate being there so the environment was always negative"
bad,This is my first job. I have learned how to review the pattern of transactions of customer if they potentially involved in Money Laundering activities.
bad,"Big company culture, not the best place to work, management is only focused on what is right in front of them as opposed to looking at the big picture."
bad,"It all depends on the team surrounding you."
bad,Low pay--not able to advance---management does not seem to look at what the job entails-great people to work with ---good 401k plan--good medical and dental
bad,Management is very aggressive and unfair.  Constantly on your back on a daily basis about job performance. Micromanagement. Keeps track of every time you are away from your desk and employee has to account for every minute of the day
bad,I loved the staff and my work hours. I was able to finish my Bachelor degree and manage to work full time. My Boss work around my school scheduled and allowed me to make up hours on the weekend if I needed it.
bad,poor pay for working very hard and making alot of money for citi    hired within but outside 20 yr old hired makes more an hour.   after training or account retention they cut our bonus and all of us are lookin for 2nd and 3rd jobs.
bad,"A typical day was filled with assisting customers with their loans to ensure an efficient end result with satisfied service. The culture was great and I learned a lot of great information from others.  Unfortunately, my department was shut down and everyone was laid off."
bad,Multiple opportunities to learn aspects of financial products in addition to interfacing with traders and senior level business management. Opportunity to grow career.
bad,"Employer who does not consider individuals as human beings, but rather a ""number"".  Benefits/Compensaiton were being taken away, slowly but surely.  Only concerned with returning the dollar to the shareholders at whatever expense.  Letting experienced employees go with open employment requisites and hiring high school students with no experience to replace at lower salary, less benefits."
bad,Citi has wonderful benefits. They cover the family with great coverage. Kids are covered up to age 27. This is great due to my kids asthma. I am very busy for the most part of my day. Escalations assisting agents
bad,I spent three years at the company without an advancement opportunity.  It is fair to mention that I was hired at the time of the company merger with California First Bank which did add much confusion to process and procedure.
bad,It was stressful working at Citi.  The pressure was not compensated for.  Tellers were expected to do a Personal bankers job without being compensated. There were short lunch breaks that began at 10:30 am and the bank closed at 5pm.
bad,"In the process of reducing staff worldwide, reducing jobs in the more expensive cities (New York, London, etc..).   Over working management staff, who do more hands on work then manage the departments they are running.  Financial decisioning such as departmental budgeting is done at the highest level of management, as a result few line managers have budgeting experience."
bad,"1. Taking calls back to back assisting clients with credit card accounts"
bad,"Management was not on site or located in another state which made it difficult to communicate. "
bad,ok. will recommend to others. But left because wanted to grow further in life. Got a good break with Current employer. Now the company does not exist....
bad,"Some of the manager have ""favorites"" and its very noticeable.  When something changes, they expect little time to comprehend it. The work isn't so much hard, its more how the managers and some of the coworkers act.  The pay is decent but compared to other call centers, we should be making more. Unfortunately, you half to be there 6 months to move to a different position. So while the favorites get a helping hand."
bad,"Teams are spread all over the country causing duplicative work due to lack of communication. "
bad,"Very fast paced and demanding environment, a typical day at work was exhausting. The hardest part of the job was keeping up with the high volume of calls and being monitored by a scorecard which determined how successful you are in the department."
bad,"Full of great people trying to do the right thing.  Unfortunately, can't say the same for many in Senior Management who seem more focused on their own personal agenda instead of the Company.  Managing upwards seems to be what really counts here. "
bad,The company is in a freefall.  I wouldn't recommend it to anyone.  It used to be a great place to work but now they don't want to pay competitively in the market.  They also seem to be getting rid of a lot of management that actually do their jobs and keep the ones that are pretty worthless.
bad,"Citibank offers great benefits but that's it.  The lack the ability to advance your career, or develop their employees.  Their Work at Home benefit is just a way for them to reduce their financial responsibilities by placing it all on the employer.  They continue to change the requirements for incentives so that won't have to pay you as much."
bad,"Management sees you as less then human, and their is a stark disconnect between how the people at the top view the job and how the job actually functions."
bad,Great place to build experience and grow professionally due to diverse opportunities and exposure to projects and mentoring tasks. However compensation is low for the amount of work and hours put in. Hard to advance because it is less based on merit and more so on politics.
bad,"Citi is a good company, just be aware when asking questions during the interview."
bad,"Decent compensation, but upper management was using skills from the 50's - 60's.  No commitment to long term employment only the bottom line and were happy to tell employees every month on calls that were forced to be on."
bad,"Ok to start your career path in back office centre"
bad,"A typical day of work lasted 10 to 12 hours. The ""digital"" branch concept, which Citi is transitioning towards, requires you on your feet 80-90% of that time even at Personal Banking and Management Levels. Morning meeting daily going over yesterdays numbers for the branch and making ""commitments"" for today's numbers. Emails to Area director for approval of commitment numbers. A 10 o'clock, noon, 3 o'clock and closing day report of  sales versus commitment numbers. Half-hour unpaid lunch, no other breaks. In a busy branch, like mine, constant bombardment of clients dealing with customers issues, to sales, to ATM malfunctions, to complaints, to online banking education tutorials, to more complicated issues. All sales staff are required to sale and know business and personal products. At least 2 hours per day on the phone contacting clients in your assigned client portfolio with additional after-hours calling on Tuesday and Thursday nights till 8:30 pm. Training and re-certifications (required by law) done between clients at standing monitors. "
bad,"Wonderful money making place, It has great pay and benefits. Lost of perks. most enjoyable are the spirit points and unlimited OT"
bad,very bad management they tried to terminate me due to a funeral. after taking paid time off. first job at a call center didnt learn much
bad,Management rule by threats. Most of IT works between 50-90 hours a week. Buddy Buddy management structure. Not a pleasant environment. Non IT is much better I understand.
bad,Make sure you fit in with the personalities of your group before you decide to work here. Little work life balacne which is expected in this industry but understand that your work will not be appreciated and you will be understaffed.
bad,"Looking to save money, and stay ahead of the Regulatory Agencies. Continually performing layoffs to save funds. Complete brain trust lost due to layoffs."
bad,"Fast paced, sales orientated, not the best manager, losts of gossiping but I guess thats every where. The best part of working at Citbank was the compensation and the benefits."
bad,"Not the best bank to work for. Very disorganized as productivity e-mails are coming from every possible department. Mortgage has to reach their quota you have to stop everything you are doing and focus on that, business lending is low same thing, credit cards, merchant services etc. Imagine this day in and day out. Followed by outdated technology and old school ABMs who know nothing else about managing but write ups and an upper management who works with their personal agenda, in support of certain BMs that they believe will help them when they can go and do their personal stuff. "
bad,"The company was ok to work for. They gave breaks and had game day. They were ok, not great the people were good to hang around with. It was not the best of places for advancement opportunities."
bad,No job security and lot of politics. work life balance is not there. But you have work from home option that is good. Management need to treat people better
bad,The job was fun and wasn't very demanding.  Lacked in job security.  Management was far from diverse. The culture was more around the individual versus team.
bad,"Great place to grasp the big picture on how the market operates on a global level. Multi cultural employee base, great place to diversify your professional career with in the financial industry. Compensation is the lowest out in the field, Management is not trust worthy and do not live up to promises made. Management needs to improve on relations and employee advancement. employees are nut judged fairly upon work performance but based on the friendships they hold with management. Management is not structured as all managers micromanage the markets and team."
bad,It does not center it's focus or care for the needs of their employees. I felt very much that the most important goal was to appease the shareholders. Customers were somewhere in the middle and then the employees were on the bottom.
bad,Typical day there is helping clients with their day to day financial needs. I did have a great learning experience and came out knowledgable about banking and finances. Main reason for leaving was the management... They have favorites and are typically rude when speaking to you. When you would ask a question on how to do something that you haven't yet learned the ABM would give you an attitude and act like they taught you how to do it so they wouldn't get in trouble. Truly hasn't happy work there. Other than that the clients are so sweet and loving. They would make my day 1000 times better.
bad,"Citybank was fun to work for , the job was challenging and  unpredictable, co-workers were sometimes not helpful due to nature of the job"
bad,"Great Benefits and pay. Just my personal thought that upper management would rather look good on paper then really be very good to their people.   Lack of training, unrealistic expectations. You feel like you are just a number that may be fired at any moment. Over all feeling of management staff and upper management they do not care about or for employees or customers.  They drive success through fear, not thorough loyalty. Good benefits, and pay, many different opportunities."
bad,"As a loan closer, I spent most of my time fixing the problems that the loan officer, processor, and occasionally the underwriter put into the loan.  Frequently, the loan officer would tell the customer anything they wanted to hear to get the customer to sign and then the customer would be surprised the title company's fees were more than expected.  The processors frequently inputted incorrect information into the  files that hindered the loan from closing.  Training could have been improved; it often seemed as though teams were working at cross purposes.  This was usually due to a misconception brought on by inadequate training.  Due to having to fix problems, a closer frequently had to stay late.  Rush files were always messed up in some way.  "
bad,Typical day is waiting for account letter to come thru to process for mailing.  Learned that quality control is important and attention to detail.   Management is caring and will let employees be heard good or bad.  Co-workers were kind and considerate. Hardest part of the job was sitting and waiting for work.  We did team building exercises and those were always fun. WE would have extra time at lunch and we could sit and talk sometime we had games.
bad,"Citigroup is a great temp job!!! Not ideal an company to plan your future...please reconsider applying to this company.  The technology is seriously out of date and very slow.  The back office team isn't too reliable.  But I digess, run if your offered a position, the stress level is not worth your peace of mind, sanity or your health."
bad,"they lost their vision, all they see now is today's bottom line. they're giving away the keys to the kingdom, not knowing that they are incapable of running a kingdom"
bad,"Job Roles and Responsibilities:"
bad,Citi has alot of great people however the poor compensation creates an atmospehere of low maorlae and leads to high turnover..I was able to gain exposure to a number of different product areas which will only benefit me in my job search
bad,constantly changing training is good could improve in work life balance management is okay all depends on the location of your branch had great co workers
bad,"It is a busy work place."
bad,my customers are the best they don't want me to leave I love doing my job I just need change and to grow and where im located I wont get the chance to move up so its time for me to go I love helping people I love making them smile my cowokers are great we have the best team work
bad,"The benefits and daycare discounts are great! However if you work in Fraud, you will be stuck in that department forever. The upper management is terrible! My manager has more work put on him from his manager then anyone else working there, even though he does his job well, she treats him like trash. The other managers skate by doing the minimum and were given those jobs because of who they know. Citi is a terrible place to work. I just quit working there after 12 years because I couldn't take it anymore. I was treated poorly and people who did not have experience were chosen for jobs that many seasoned reps would have been better at. All because Citi wants to save a couple bucks! I do not recommend this place to anyone! Unless you kiss a lot of rear, then you'll excel!"
bad,"The position was easy,my co-workers were nice and helpful.I did not like the hiring process they just hire personnel before verifying your work history."
bad,Citi is not aware or even concerned of their employees health/welfare.
bad,"I have not even enjoyed a single day within 2 years of my work. Quality of work is of low standard and on top of that Micro-management on employees makes it worst."
bad,"Work Timings 8 to 5 .previous day pending work closures,Closures of NCR's ,current day work progress with overall agenda and targets.Review team and personal targets at dayend and closures."
bad,Poor corporate culture. Employees are treated as number; one in a hundred thousand .There is no freedom for individual thought or creative ideas. This may explain why they became insolvent and sold their company.
bad,"Pleasant experience with clients, but poor managerial skills."
bad,"Citi is a good company to work for, however, be prepared to for a lot of work, with little direction or support. On an average day, I arrive at work and filter through hundreds, if not thousands, of e-mails, both internally and externally. I check in with my manager once a day, but always feel rushed. Internal partners would rather escalate instead of working directly with the person they need to get the information. Every inquiry is an escalation and needs to be done yesterday, leaving little time in the office to do what the job description says. If something isn't done, it becomes an escalation. There is more time spent sending internal members of management ""updates"" or  "
bad,"There was lack of room for advancement, the management team were not very helpful. The company had great benefits."
bad,"What I have learned to do multi task within any given day, its hard work and at the end the most enjoyable to knowing that a project has been completed and users are all trained."
bad,"Bulk processing of invoice payments for HR"
bad,"Citi as a whole is great place to work for family/work balance.   I don't know much about the finance side of the house however if you are an IT professional beware.  Citi is currently in the process of outsourcing a majority of its technology services to third party vendors who are slashing the pay of current workers.  Most of technology will be moved out of locations such as NY and into areas overseas and in TX.  The technology heads who are running Citi have ruined other banks (just google ""national Australia bank"".   So while Citi was a great place to work 10 years ago today no so much today."
bad,"I rarely ever see anyone promoted. The turnover rate is insane--3 people on my 5 person team in only 1 month, and that's been my experience over the last 3 years. Management pretends to be excited, but it's completely transparent and falls short of anything meaningful. Compensation is sub par, and they stretch resources to the limit. Multiple people are filling two positions rather than them hiring more people. Can't wait to get out myself."
bad,"In the six years I worked for this company, the targets increased more often than the pay did. Upper management had no concern for you work/life balance, only for their quarterly bonus that you were earning them. Not a personal company, strictly business.  You didn't have a fixed work schedule like they advised during the recruiting period."
bad,"good culture"
bad,The most difficult situation is to manage different type of Supervisors and Managers. I had overcome all the situation to attend to customer First Call Resolution
bad,"There are always deadlines.  The key is knowing what is urgent and getting it done.  Time management is important."
bad," Work remotely at home, Underwriting conventional loans thru automated system engines, DU and DE as well as manual underwrites ensuring loan meets guidelines."
bad,Citi is a good company. It all depends on what department you work for.
bad,"Contract negotiations - cleared derivative execution agreement (CDEA), master securities futures transaction agreement, confidentiality agreements."
bad,"I am very thankful for my job, but there are moments when it gets tough and you feel that you are not appreciated. The work balance is awesome, but there is room for improvement with this company and they the employees are valued."
bad,"To many managers. Employee reports to multiple seniors which makes it difficult for one manager to get a good understanding of employees workload. "
bad,"High stress work environment regulated by meritocracy. I learned a great deal of the realities of the lending industry that demands unrealistic results in a volatile market. Problem solving, team work + results are demanded. The most rewarding part of the job is when someone hugs you, crying , thanking you for helping them. The comradeship is highly competitive as this is the basis of the meritocracy and is encouraged. After 13 yrs. of dedication to this type of employment, I am looking for new employment that will allow me to use my sales + customer service skills in a capacity more related to my previous sales experiences, in food and retail."
bad,"I have learned managerial knowledge, and how to deal with various emotion at work. It was something else."
bad,"Worked on various assignments related to COB and IS. Supported 6 business on Business recovery, records management and Information Security."
bad,"As dull and soulless as you'd expect a Credit Card company to be."
bad,It was a great place to work while attending college. The job was flexible.
bad,Good benefits and paid time off. Very poor leadership and management.
bad,"Policies and procedures were constantly changing without any proper training provided, which resulted in delays and missed assignments. Due to lack of internal communication and training, month goals weren't met and the team suffered as a whole, which resulted in personal scores being low which goes in your personnel file."
bad,"The middle management ranks in the Consumer Bank in NYC are full of mediocre professionals that only care about politics and managing up. Executive management is good, very good in my opinion, but are far too removed from the trenches to know what is going on. Poor management often translates in the more skilled employees working 10-12 hours a day until they get frustrated and leave the company. Meanwhile there is a good number of mediocre employees that work an average of 3-4 hours a day...I do not exagerate. I see it on a daily basis, and all of this within the same department. Salary in the consumer bank is an average of 10-15% below Industry."
bad,Too many managers who care only about their jobs and not their employees
bad,The benefits that they offer from day one are really good. However the pay is the lowest out there compared to most companies in the same field. The chances to advance is low due to you will need to work there at least a year in the same position before advancement unless time and title is waved. Also there is a lot micro-managing that causes an environment that feels like school.
bad,"Pay was low, incentives were often treated as some carrot in front of a horse. Earning of incentives was treated as if they were the base pay and as like they were a metric for which you could be fired. Benefits were provided and sold up as a great reason to work for the company, but they often almost FROWNED upon using them, especially those that involved taking time off. Things like securing a better schedule or position were near impossible. I would not go back unless I just HAD to."
bad,40% of your review is about communication and they employ hyper-sensitive people and encourage drama
bad,"Though Citi has great benefits regarding vacation and holiday time, the stress associated with any of the telephone jobs there is not worth the stress for the $/hr.."
bad,Managing a team of 8 sales officers.
bad,My overrall revies is that the job itself is rewarding when helping save someones home from foreclosure the draw backs would be the revies and the number of reviews you have to go through on a monthly basis.
bad,Citi is an ever changing organization. They change models and locations every 2 years in every area of the organization besides the actual banking centers. Be prepared to relocate! However this concept has made me very flexible and able to adjust very quickly to changes within the organization. The management skill is very traditional corporate. The employee at Citi are dedicated and committed to excellence.
bad,"Disorganized company. Too many layers of managers who do not communicate well with each other. Co-workers are good; however, other regions are not well organized or trained."
bad,"Arrive at work 15 to 30 minutes early, to get set to go right to work at the given time of 8 am. Log on to all the systems I would be needing to access during the day at work. Read email to was sent by Unit Manager, record any changes that may have been made in the last few days. Take phone call working with the Card Holders and their problems on the statement they would have just received. With late fees or any other problems they may have. If could not assist in the solution would transfer to correct department that would help the customer. Making sure the customer felt that i cared and thank them for calling give me the opportinity to assist them with their problems and ask them to please call back if they had another problems"
bad,"I started working here at age 18. The pay and benefits were a great incentive. Over the years, I've had to compromise my integrity, be pacified by management while trying to assist a client whose account we screwed up (there is little compassion), and had management be dishonest in my annual review (to the point that I refused to sign off on it until the comments were explained and changed if there was no validity behind it)."
bad,If you plan on getting a job with excellent benefits than Citi is the place for you as long as you can deal with criticism on a daily baisis. They talk about being a supportive team and willing to work with those who are having a hard time. That is true as long as you are in training but as soon as you step on that floor all that goes out the window. These mangers are all thinking about getting there incentive at the end of the month and that means fussing at you cause you are not meeting quota for the month. Stressful environment I stayed six months and I was 24 at the time and I got a head full of gray hair dealing with all the mess and people at Citi.
bad,"Morale low. No room for advancement regardless of performance. Hiring from outside for better paying positions and not hiring from within. Even though met or exceeded all performance standards and in top 20% received just 1.5% raise for 2011. No annual bonuses. Stats aren't accurately measured, yet the stats reports lead to constant manager harassment of employees. As far as I'm concerned hostile work environment. They want our Net Promoter Scores to increase but customers aren't happy and neither are the employees."
bad,Citifinancial-financed loans
bad,"The Citi life is gruesome. You'll have 3 systems that you'll be working with. It's a hot mess of how outdated the systems are. "
bad,Company was a great place in the beginning and then declined slowly when bought out and rapidly when it went global.  It was obvious employees were no longer valued.
bad,"In order to move up in the company it is important to network. Promotions are given out to unqualified friends of the hiring managers over qualified and educated folks. I would say to be successful in management you must join professional networks, attend all happy hours after work and dress in expensive tailored outfits. If you're an IT person then your credentials are all that matters, you will be promoted based on merit in this field at Citi."
bad,"Still good old boys club, who you know and have lunch with.  Skills sets are overlooked for other attributes."
bad,"* Expected long hours of work without any compensation or day in lieu."
bad,"Nice work place,stressful and underpaid !typical day is producing Pl with a deadline!Dealing with multiple departments. Very hard to get promoted & underpaid"
bad,"Most Managers are stuck up and condescending, they will try and belittle you every chance they get. They will segregate you based on roles and make it clear where your place is."
bad,"I found the company very hierarchical and difficult to navigate;  from a personal perspective I felt that Management (not leadership) calls the shots and you do what is given to you.  At the level I was brought in at, that should not have been the case and I was quite disappointed.  With that said, the people were one of the best group of people I have ever worked with."
bad,"I don't want to return, even as an FTE.  In my PMO people were verbally abusive and would 'scold' people in front of their peers.  Unacceptable."
bad,"Working at Citi, I thought would be a good, well rounded job, however that wasnt the case. There are alot of young people that work there and the competition is pretty brutal to advance in management.  We truly have to kiss butt and know someone to know someone in order to advance within the company."
bad,"I really liked working at citi when I first started. Training was great other than the cattiness with coworkers. Once out of training , coaching is horrible. My manager does not interact with us at all. She doesn’t like promoting her team to where they need to be. My team is the worse team on the floor. This job will stress you out! I told my manager the job was mentally getting to me and she told me to GET OVER IT! Don’t ever bother going to the boss over top of your manager because they will absolutely do nothing about it! They even hit you on stupid stuff from your calls. Citi overall is a ok company. As long as you have a great manager that supports you and make sure you will advance then everything is fine. I definitely don’t see my future working with citi anymore. Even the people in the cafeteria is RUDE! I wouldn’t recommend working here or having any business with Citi."
bad,"Management was poor and customer experience on situations that are out of the representatives control really hinder opportunities for growth with Citi. Regardless of rep behavior, if the customer is upset with a policy in place the rep will suffer."
bad,"Citi was a great place to work, but if you try to quit you’ll most likely end up owing them a lot of money, because they pay a week in advance. Some of the management needs improvement, as I lost my position due to my supervisors negligence while trying to go on a leave of absence. If you plan to work there long term, great. If you try to leave/get fired, you’ll probably end up screwed by the company."
bad,"Management looks forward to firing people on the personal banking section. My manager in particular, they would always try to catch you doing anything that could give them leverage to fire you. In the year I was there I watch my manager fire 8 people that was more than the other managers combined."
bad,"It's a call center.  You are strapped to a phone all day and you are expected to work like a robot.  The wages are low, especially for what you have to put up with.  If you want to work for $12-$13/hour dealing with stupid customers and being pressured to do more, more, more, then be my guest.  I just think it's soul-crushing."
bad,Citi has laid off hundreds of workers over the last year.  There is little to no job security. I was able to advance to a higher level of seniority but along with that came the struggles of not having the support I needed to succeed
bad,"After working in another line of work for most of my life, I was so excited to start at Citi.  Set schedule every week, great benefits, lots of employees there to get help/advice from about calls... But then reality set in and it was more like I was back in high school."
bad,Citibank is run by senior management that has risen through the positions of teller on up.  If anyone enters the firm from the outside without having climb through the subordinate positions they are looked at in a demeaning manner.  Regardless of the level of knowledge skills abilities or education if you did not serve in all the position below your current position you were an outsider.
bad,"The technology, culture, senior leadership, and compliance are as the summary says. Countless DOS-based mainframe systems necessary for each line of business, lack of transactional data integrity, weak (if at all) control centralization, and status-quo management abound!"
bad,"The upper management, middle management, and lower management are not on the same page. They are always adding to the work out side of what your job title is and call it business need, with more work load , the pay remains the same."
bad,typowe kolesiostwo - szczegolnie widoczne w wiekszych zespolach. firma jest ogromna i daje jako takie dobre doswiadczenie na start. ale max 2 lata i szukaj dalej albo wyzej
bad,"Busy ringing phones"
bad,Typical big company. horrible management. great benefits . limited chances of advancement. compensation is also very low but because of the good benefit it was ok
bad,"The company goes through various changes (3 in 12 months). Very little culture and employees usually have to fund their own work events. "
bad,Working here has been a disappointment. The calls are back to back and you are expected to be glued to the phone your entire shift. You can't even have a 10 second break between calls. They're instant. No room to advance despite being told advancement in Citi is great.
bad,Liked my roles at Citi but the hours required and demand placed by management made the work life balance next to impossible to achieve.  There was NO life when working at Citi.  It was the cuture of the management and staff.
bad,"First job in a collection agency, start it in front-end collection's, after a couple weeks of being yelled at cussed at you kind of got used to it so that's was that was the job but there were an awful lot of nice people as well. 8 Intuit the team was transitioned to a HAT team "" homeowners assistance team"", strictly dealing with homeowners applying for the Home Affordable mortgage program or more commonly known as HAMP. This is where the train came off the rails some of the angriest people on the planet was your customer base and really not the fault of the customers they were repeatedly asked to resend pay stubs bank statements tax returns cause for some reason they either got misplaced lost or the loan officers took too long and they were time-sensitive documents are they had to be updated. Each time it was the homeowner's responsibility to fax these in at their cost. After a little over a year of doing this was offered a position in the Freddie Mac pilot program. There were three teams of roughly 12 members per team, you were given a portfolio of somewhere between 150 to 200 clients or homeowners to call on range everywhere from 3 months past due to borderline foreclosures. This was probably the best job on the floor and the ham job that I spoke about earlier really was honestly a punishment job if you had that. The Freddie Mac position was a lot more relaxed than the over-managed micromanaged poorly managed teams that were Elsewhere on the floor. This program came to an end 18 months after it started and all the Reps were given a choice of going to the new government regulations"
bad,"Competitive, how to open loans and collections. Management was horrible, they were always giving my loans to the people that could not get their own loans to make it ""fair"". Fast-paced, cut-throat and unfair. Hardest part of the job was staying in spite of the un-fairness. Most enjoyable part of the job was meeting new people and helping them."
bad,"In my case, when management switched hands, it solely became a sales game. There was no personality or warmth within the environment anymore. A typical day of work was sales ad nauseam. This stifled the morale of myself and co-workers. Aside from answering client inquiries, sales and numbers were prioritized above EVERYTHING. Skills from my previous job weren't utilized, AT ALL. Granted, I'm better acquainted with some of the institution's processing software and improving my attention to detail. The most rewarding and enjoyable part of the job is the great clientele whom I've had the pleasure of being acquainted and working with. It was the only factor at one point that drove me to do my best."
bad,Very poorly organized in my Outreach.  Would love to work for Citi but not in Outreach department.  Would like to work in Opps Support.  We were supposed to be making calls but ended up taking calls from very aggravated customers.  Bank accounts were blocked for reasons as simple as they did not call and update their mailing address.
bad,I learned a lot in the many roles at Citi. The environment is fast paced and there was always new projects and assignments to keep you interested in what you had to do daily.
bad,"If you can avoid Citi, then good for you!"
bad,"In general, Citi only cares about their bottom line numbers.  If you are a poor performer, you will not last.  You need to find the right position under the right management team.  Like any job, there are good days and bad days, productive years and unproductive years.  In this very corporate environment, look out for yourself, because there is no loyalty to employees at the end of the day."
bad,"Your experience at Citi will depend on position, managers, and location. I am managed by managers that are somewhere else, which affects their ability to see me as more than numbers. Training is not good here, even for internal systems."
bad,"They use contractors for supporting functions with no chance of advancement or perm position. Most everyone in my group was hired for something they are good at, then ended up with a boring routine job. I hardly have 5 hours of real work each week, most of the time is just pretending I am doing something. I am not alone, I watch people play Netflix all day, It's like an adult babysitting location."
bad,"Hard to achieve much due to red tape and bureaucracy. Hard to move up, no career path, often stunted by your managers level. No internal promotions unless you physically apply for another job. Compensation not level with market if you been there for more than 5 years."
bad,The company focus on its groups and not on togetherness so in a nut shell they promote separation of people.  They do not offer more day hours even when the hours are available.
bad,"Citi is too competitive. I have been there for almost 2 years, and have applied for 4 other positions. Have not gotten one of the positions I have applied for. It is very hard to move up. The pay is too little when you take about 100 calls a day, and you get talked to like you are crazy. They are not lenient with anything. You pretty much are required to be on the phone unless you have a lunch and a break. It is mentally exhausting."
bad,Had a tough manager who was a micromanager. Did not learn much from manager and was not able to perform to potential due to lack of development. Would not recommend.
bad,Very demanding place to work with high volume of work. Training provided does not always gets you prepared for the actual work requirements. Lots of opportunities for further developments
bad,"Very stressful since we moved towards Agile and have two week Sprints.  My projects were Waterfall but our area worked them as Agile which was dependent on back-end systems ability to support us.  Meetings everyday between 5-7 hours due to different projects which resulted in me having to work at nights and on weekends to get the user stories written so that we could groom them for upcoming sprints.  My agile team was not co-located which resulted in a lot of stress, 100;s of emails daily where I had to follow-up with the business since offshore's hours in India were different then what I worked.  Offshore was gone by 10:30 AM EST.  I was working 6-7 days a week.  Other Agile teams were co-located with the Scrum teams being together and their operations worked so much smoother.  My manager did not have a clue other than saying 'Get with the Model'.  Plan of Record was no where near what an Agile Team worked on, the brunt of Plan of Record was ehancements or new requirements that did not fit in with an actual Agile Team."
bad,"there are a lot of jobs in citi, however, chances to grow are limited, as your managers will often block your career growth in order to keep you at your current position."
bad,This was a secure consistent job but I acquired a lot of stress working here. there is a lot of pressure put on th employees to up sell even when the client is unable to make their current payments. YOu get cursed at and hung up on a lot also. there is a lot of stress that comes with working in the debt collections department
bad,been here for  over six months tried getting my name out there for further advancement. Receive stellar reviews about job performance but no opportunities to move up unless time and title is waved or yearly review is graded. Too much bureaucracy.
bad,"Citi's very challenging and nothing like you expect as far as the difference between the training given and the real work load. There are so many components, projects, and expectation placed upon the worker that it's not realistic and very complicated. The Benefits are the best thing about Citi and the pay is not bad. I would not recommend Citi to anyone who ask."
bad,Work Life balance is great.  Management allows you to take the time you need for sickness or family emergencies.  You still have to stay on top of your projects.
bad,Good place to start off career and then get out fast. Good learning opportunity. Benefits are average. Some managers are great mentors but sr mgmt sucks aXX
bad,"Too many poorly planned projects. Not hiring appropriately qualified technical people. Technology is old and obsolete."
bad,"Overall, my experience was not positive.  In the Technology area, the work environment is rather unstable and there is a lot of turnover.  Work force strategy seems to change constantly between onshore, offshore, high-cost moves to mid or low-cost, etc.  I never felt like my job was secure."
bad,"Even though the way we do our work can change every week sometimes, the work itself is very repetitive work, but also very easy as long as you pay attention."
bad,"I had surgery while working here. When I returned to work they kept docking pay they had already given me because I had gone on a disability leave due to major medical issues. They also kept a bonus I was supposed to receive and did not work with me during my recovery. The benefits are good, but are difficult to take advantage of. I want to be treated like a human-being, not like a number on a spreadsheet."
bad,"Inbound call center /customer service environment.  Extensive training and preparation for role.  Great learning experience.  Pay is low, commission structure is unattainable,"
bad,"Culture is good there, but with offshoring and multitude of regulations, job is not what it used to be.  There is some job movement, but it's generally to low cost centers."
bad,Worked at a small location in Ohio that was not too bad until we were  reorganized under a foreign executive that forced job outsourcing to promote company wealth.  Small site with limited advancement potential.
bad,"Usual day of work is answering incoming phone calls."
bad,"-Citi has a great culture for such a large company: positive/fun employees, quality work/life balance, etc. "
bad,"Collections is a tough job under the best of circumstances, but during the recession, it was even more challenging. Management is hit and miss. Some where great and others not so much."
bad,Top company management not that great communication didn't seem to make it to local management. Also company doesn't do a great job of make you feel appreciated. Lots of red tape and feels like a big bank.
bad,"Very long hours during the week with no choice in the matter. Prepare to work outside contracted hours everyday. Work most, if not all bank holidays with no choice in the matter. Immediate superiors ranged from OK to useless. Terrible culture, but decent pay/benefits and job was secure and team-workers were knowledgeable. This job was not for me and wasn't what I expected from the contract I was given."
bad,"If you have family and dont want to do much-- Citi. If you are ambitious and want to work hard and be rewarded, dont bother."
bad,"Tall organization"
bad,"In today's agile environment, people need autonomy and freedom to innovate.  When constrained, innovation is minimized. Good people, however, management operates in an archaic fashion."
bad,"Overall good nature of claciksPros"
bad,"Given its recent financial troubles, Citi is going through a transition phase.  Salaries have been flat for the past few years and bonuses have been almost non existent.  There is plenty of work to be done because people are constantly asked to do more with less resources.  That being said, one could look at Citi as opportunities unrealized.  I have been at Citi on-and-off for the better part of 10 years.  I have seen a lot of change (some for the better, some for the worse).  I have given it my best, but the reward hasn't been there."
bad,"Started as a telephone rep and within 6 years was in management. Worked in many departments including Identity Fraud. I took advantage of many company offered training classes in management, economics, and team building. It was such a large  company that it was hard to affect any real change, lots of red tape and politics. I enjoyed helping  my employees grow and develop."
bad,"I am not impressed with my employment with Citi. The pay is 28% lower then the national average for the same positions.  Benefits are average and nothing special. "
bad,No job security/ guarantee of advancement.  There is a lack of clarity as well and you never know where you stand.  The managers are mostly external hires so its hard to advance into management.
bad,I worked in as a loan processor in the corporate mobility department.   I won't go into details but it was not a good work environment.   Worked at Citi less than one year.
bad,"Tough place to work if you are not a ""favorite"" employee."
bad,Coming to work was great. I grew with my co workers to the point we felt like a family. Every work day is not the same. I've learned to how to adjust to a call center environment because things change daily.
bad,High Net Worth client management.  Great working relationship with colleagues. Heavy turnover with management of all levels.
bad,A difficult environment due to internal structure. The economic climate and external view toward financial institutions are factors as well.
bad,"Largest global bank in the world offers average to below average salaries but exceptional benefits and a wide variety of entry level opportunities for those interested in financial services, accounting, or business analysis."
bad,Working at Citi Cards was an eye opening and life changing experience.
bad,Good pay/benefits. no job security. there is always lay-offs or terminations randomly.
bad,inbound outbound call center - very stressful mindless work.  not able to sink my teeth into this due to complications at home.
bad,"HR and Management have created an environment that keeps employees ""in their place"", and prevents open and honest dialogue about workplace concerns.  Improvement of processes can only come from above, suggestions from the employees that actually perform the duties are frowned upon.  Managements arrogance increases as you get higher up the ladder."
bad,There are a lot of employees with high tenure. The work is very extensive with expectation that you would put in many hours
bad,"Responsible for office cash intake. Organized and filed confidential documents. Prepared account statements, loan files, receipts, and bank deposits. Met with clients to discuss potential future business. Sold home, auto, and personal contents insurance while exceeding monthly targets regularly. Answered telephone in a professional manner, and assisted customers with inquires, relayed messages, and scheduled appointments. Reviewed credit bureau and offered effective financial advice. Approved clients for personal, consolidation, equity loans, and second mortgages."
bad,"Great pay, stressful job with no stability."
bad,"look out. citi is one of the most shady companies i have ever worked for. They will harass you until they find something to fire you for, and then when they do they will find a way to make that shady to. i have never been more shocked at how a company does business in my life. the management was god awful, everything about the job was awful. run...run as fast as you can from these crooks"
bad,"This is a great place to learn how to sell, but ultimately you will be expected to sell to anyone despite whether the need is there. It's not about what's best for the customer, it's always why didn't you make us more money."
bad,I would say that company is a very good company to work for. Training is provided and the company is always on top with providing you online training for updated law guidelines.
bad,"A good place to get experience, but besides that no long term potential for advancement"
bad,"At the beginning of the month you are assigned cases.  They MUST be complete by SLA day.  It is up to you to get them done. Meaning you are working late nights, weekends, there are even people signing in from home when on vacation.  People are known to stay past 11 PM to get their cases done. When the daycares close, employees pick up their kids and bring them to work - because they have to get their cases done. So most nights and weekends, expect kids to be onsite. Oh - and you are NOT paid for all the hours you work - it is expected. Failure to get your work done results in a development plan.  If that doesn't work - you are out. High number of people giving their notice and just walking out."
bad,"I used to enjoy working at Citibank then began the implementations of all these rules and guidelines of what to do and what not to do, you feel trapped."
bad,The benefits are great. That is about it. If you're lucky you might get a great manager. But chances are you won't and you will feel like your job is constantly in their hands. They are constantly holding your job over your head. You never feel quite secure in your work or that it's good enough. If you excel in something it felt like they always looked for something else to complain about. You're required to work 1 weekend day and unless you're in good with a manager it's practically impossible to advance.
bad,"Too many silos of individuals which were required to communicate with to accomplish any task. Not one person can/could move a task/project/change from start to finish without touching multiple groups. Each group, being silo-ed, did their tasks as they saw fit regardless of time frame."
bad,"There is little work life balance at Citi, depending on what group you are in."
bad,"very fast work place daily functions daily where great ,hardest part was working over night."
bad,"Co-workers were amazing! Team worked well together, and helped each other. Lost two wonderful Team Managers!"
bad,"Working approximately 70-90 hours/week. Excellent benefits and pay structure, but difficult work/life balance."
bad,Never have job security. Company is always changing and have to work late nights not a good job if you have a family!
bad,My day is long because I commute everyday. Our department has limited resources so it can be difficult. In my office there are limited opportunities of advancement. Lack of efficient processes. I enjoy working with my collegues though.
bad,Manage a newly formed securities department created by acquisition of Egg and the winding down of existing mortgage portfolio. Coaching team members to improve knowledge and prevent costly mistakes.
bad,Job functions moved to various centers with doubt about long term job stability.
bad,"Taking inbound collection calls, providing financial advice to card members delinquent on their accounts. Had no problems with the calls, it was management that was difficult to work for."
bad,"Si te toca trabajar en una época baja prepárate para que te despidan sin avisarte. Simplemente te eliminan las credenciales de acceso y ya no estás más en el sistema, que se haga cargo de ti la empresa que te subcontrató. Ni en trabajos temporales son tan poco profesionales."
bad,"The process that you have to go through to have your reasonable accommodation met is not a reasonable process at all. It took almost two months to have my service dog approved. The HR office kept stalling the process, along with the higher up managers, they also asked intrusive questions that violated the ADA. Once my service dog was approved, some members of Citi refused to treat my service animal as such and tried to treat it like a pet to play with."
bad,"People would openly cry on the floor because they were stressed out , managers talked about other employees in team meetings, and the office was always filled with people who came in early and left late because of the workload."
bad,it depends on the group you are in if you get promoted or use the new tech. IT is not a good bet at Citi since it is offshoring heavily to India anything that's technical.
bad,The management sucks at this company. I was advised by my Supervisor to request short term disability because of a health issue I was approved I was gone for 2 weeks when I returned I was terminated. They say that it wasn't the reason for the termination that it was my metrics but I was given no paperwork to reflect that.
bad,workflow was done as a team. Goal was to bring down delinquency and bring our portfolio back to current.Typical work be on the phone dialed answer all customer concerns and questions they might have on their mortgage.
bad,"I work from home for Citi. A typical work day would be to book and Modifications or Short Sales DILs that were assigned to me. Since working from home, I did not have the workplace atmosphere. The hardest part of me job was getting consistent information regarding procedures and how management wanted things completed. The most enjoyable part of my job is working from home."
bad,"Vastly different after acquisition by Springleaf, company became less well managed, more stressful, less interested in helping customers and more interested in monthly numbers"
bad,"Great benefits.  Management seems to focus upward and not at employees.  Went between midyear and year end review without talking with supervisor.  Thought was only my manager, but spoke with others in different division and same issues.  Either extremely busy or extremely slow, no middle ground"
bad,Senior Management just cares about employees working but not concerned about their welfare. No bonding activities in the AML department. There is no work life balance.
bad,"Depending on what department you are in, you are either busy, busy, or not at all. The chance for advancement is very slim unless you are a good suck up to your manager. Don't waste your time and talent at this company."
bad,The pay is good if you are prepared to work weekends and late shifts. Everything is monitored and you get error reports daily. People are nice but very hard to advance or move to other departments unless you are very young and a favourite of the team leaders.
bad,"Day-"
bad,"Hope this is helpful.  This wont be your happy place.  You will rock and no one will care.  Only the buddies will be promoted      The Buddies will surf the internet all day long.  While you rock out the work.  Oh and the Buddies will get a yearly raise and you will not;  seemed to be a pattern of every other year even through you rock out the work.  Salaries are low.  For example some high achievier long term 14 year employee are trying to live on around 14 dollars an hour.  After all their time there.  Teamwork doesn't exist here, because of the citi productive tracking system.  Team players wont help because they can't take credit.  They will sit at their desk with their phone texting while you work your ...off and when its time to leave say see you tomorrow and walk out the door.  While you my friend finish the work.      There are citi employees who if you ask them what they do for Citi they will personally tell you they dont know.  So I guess they just are pretty faces with princess titles, Citi waste alot of  money on the Buddy salaries.  There alot if chiefs who dont know what the other chiefs are doing.  There alot of waste and poor management.  We not sure how this place survives."
bad,"I have almost 2 yrs with Citi and cant remember how many managers had been directing my team, the job is extremely stressful not intended for people who dont like to work with people. In almost 2 years Citi had done lots of changes most of them for the worst and giving overwork load to reps. There is always a good excuse to not give you chance to grow, lots of micromanagers, monitored calls and expectations are unrealiastic most of the time making it frustrating, excellent and great knowledge managers and supervisors had gone, my best advise if you can handle to work overnight I highly recommend working overnight pay more due to differentials but is not the perfect shift for people with family, daytime shift are hectic pay less and are frustrating. Best side of Citi? Lots of chances to learn with excellent trainings, discounts, health insurance and short and long term disability, there is always a good moment to have a potluck in my unit there is no pto instead Citi offer us vto, they offer shadow jobs to explore new positions before you apply for it. Right now need to relocate and is challenging to move on. I wish go back in time a year ago and be in the system I started miss those days."
bad,Excesso de mudanças não proporcionava engajamento entre as equipes. Comunicação muito deficiente.
bad,"Management doesn’t understand that the most important resource of the call center were the associates, management is not the type of managers you can Confide into they will use that against you for any reason to terminate your employment.  The managers can’t take or handle constructive criticism to help the department or express your opinion even though they will tell you they have an open door policy. My advice don’t go into that door either deal with the issue or find another job.  Citi has hire some great employees, but the managers or senior management doesn’t make the best decision or listen to their associates when they truly have an issue with a manger or with them.  So, if you are a well spoken person or when you see wrong you speak up this wouldn’t be the place for you if you are applying for Customer Service or anything with that management department."
bad,Citi has multiple roergs per year which become a distraction. Location strategy impacted lots of teams and culture is not longer there. Pay is ok but career opportunities no longer there for tech roles
bad,I was one of the highest grossing financial consultants at the company. We received 20% of our compensation in restricted stock. By 2008 I had 80% of my net worth in Citi stock. In 2008 Citi stock declined 95% because of reckless investments in mortgage instruments. The management always reacts to issues instead of anticipating them.
bad,"Coworkers tattle to management instead of sorting it out with you like an adult.  A lot of complaining by associates and low morale.  Definitely need to watch your back here, and no one is your BFF.  On a positive note my team is willing to help out when it comes to work."
bad,"Es buena, pero necesita cambios muy fuertes en temas de orientación hacia el bienestar de empleados, y la formación de supervisores, gerentes con criterios de responsabilidad y trabajo en equipo y no enfocados únicamente al resultado."
bad,Everyone in UW seemed afraid to make a decision on loans and would often reject loans that guidelines approved. No one ever seemed to be able to explain why though.
bad,Although citi bank does have competitive pay and great benefits the daily job is very degrading and demanding. Calls are usually back to back and customers are very disrespectful. Seems like the majority of people there dont know what they are doing but there motto in training was fake it till you make it!
bad,"Direction of manager was rude and harsh daily"
bad,Great place for job security and the benefits are above anything else. Everything else is very vague however. There is hardly any continuity from department to department making the customers take a large hit in service quality.
bad,I feel this is a great job if you are still going to school but nothing long term because the management is horrible and show favoritism. I don't want to stop people from applying because they do have great benefits and pays well considering the job. This job just weighs on you over time and you will feel empty after a while so approach with caution. GOOD LUCK
bad,"Cultural and job work environment. Very nice place for upgrade any human resource. Timing punctuality, marketing area, reporting officials etc. are also very genuine and can treatable."
bad,"Typical call center environment. Very intense, high pressure. My team members were very enjoyable. Some management was easy to work with, some weren't. "
bad,"Revewing the productively of the collection done by the agency "
bad,"its a good place to work with great benefits and a competitive salary with job security.Good work/life balance for employees"
bad,Citi Bank helped me understand the importance of credit and loans. Citibank's customer service culture is the very best. Their main priority is their customer's satisfaction.
bad,"i work there during college, good balance, just too many managers with different viewpoints. you get paid nothing and you have to do three different jobs. You do not get any extra paid holidays, because the company is cheap."
bad,"it is not a great place to work, management is not great, culture is not great, limited room to grow. overall I would not recommend it to anyone."
bad,typical day started at 7am with project calls lasting until noon. Some late days. I learned how to work on a large scale agile project and schedule work with other work streams also were also sprinting their own projects. Co workers were great. Mostly very seasoned. Most enjoyable part of my job was my boss
bad,"As I was growing up, I have always been told -- if you have nothing nice to say, don't say anything at all. So I will not say anything."
bad,"I worked for Citi in Irving for less than a year and I had to quit due to the stress. It was one of the worst places I have ever worked due to management and lack of proper training. Had I been properly trained and not been under so much immediate pressure, it ultimately might have been an ok company. But my manager was unbearable which eventually led me to resign. Also the facility is huge so be ready for walking!"
bad,"The benefits are great and the schedule selection is pretty good for home/ work balance. The kind of work that customer service reps do is horrific (in my opinion). I came from a retail management background of 5+ years, so I was no stranger to angry- hard to deal with customers, but I could not take how brutal the clientele could be at times. It also did not help that the systems are so hard to navigate and as a new hire you it is very obvious to the customer that you are not seasoned and they eat you alive. They say that the learning curve is 6 months but I honestly could not deal with that much uncertainty and anxiety in my everyday work life. You are also expected to be accounted for at all times which I know is normal for a workplace but I was so scared to get in trouble for unaccounted time that I would be writing down my every move as to not get in trouble. If you can deal with this kind of environment more power to you."
bad,"The training received is great, better than many corporations. Typical day is taking call after call in the call center. Hardest part of the job was taking call after call, if you were off the phone for more that 2 or 3 min it had to be logged.  As a customer service rep, your calls are reviewed not on how well you serviced the customer but how many times you rebuttaled a customer's no to a sales pitch. As far as management... this was a very cold place to work."
bad,"If you need money, Citibank has always been a good option. However, management is typically uncaring and abrasive. This is due to the fast paced call center environment."
bad,If you like bullying people and hounding them to take a loan out then this position is a great place to work. Great benefit.
bad,"management changes daily....5 ceo's in 3 years, lay offs in waves, constant policy changes, all bonuses have been cut...no advancement"
bad,"My time at Citi has been a truly wonderful learning experience. I cannot put into words all the things I've learned, not just about how credit works, but also the ins and outs of working for such a huge corporation. My teammates are amazing, and no matter how long one of the employees has worked there, each of us is willing to share whatever information and knowledge we have, and cheer each other on. A lot of this I would think is due to our manager who tries really hard to motivate the team to get their numbers up, and even when someone isn't making never looks down on them or publicly shames them. He simply pulls them in his office, explains what's going on, and sees what's going on with the representative that is getting in the way of their performance before asking what he can do to improve the situation. A typical day is coming in, having 10 minutes to set up your workstation, before logging into the phones for the rest of your shift. You're only allowed to log off when it is your scheduled break time, if a manager calls you into their office, or the occasional account maintenance or equipment failure. The most enjoyable part of my day has to be all the additional work I get to do on behalf of my manager. I am one of our teams focals, and so it is my job to remind my teammates of any pending callbacks they have and assist them with any questions they may have in doing said call back. The hardest part of my job has to be that I see no future not only with this company, but I also do not see where the company has a very bright future themselves. When I interviewed I let it"
bad,"Day to day experience depends on your direct manager."
bad,"conduct account maintenance, process transactional requests"
bad,"promoting credit card in booth that company charted,easy to get client hard to get approval.Less approval less income"
bad,"a lot of reviews, with no sense at all. The manager does not know what you do since she is not there. If you do well on what you were told, that is just OK. You should do something manager never think of and sell it let the manager buys it. Otherwise you are not a good employee. If I am so much better then my manager, why I am the employee and she is the manager?"
bad,"Management regularly participates in favoritism. If you don't earn brownie points frequently, you will quickly be thrown by the wayside and never considered for advancement or recognition."
bad,"Too many business units running their people via fear of job loss.  Reviews given to average to above average employees seem to always follow the ""be lucky you have a job"" attitude when you see the end of year compensation.  Yet you receive the company emails telling of huge quarterly gains, over a billion in some cases.  Yet the stock price has yet to maintain a 5 dollar a share level for the last 4 years.  Don't be fooled by the 49 or 50 dollar a share listed.  The company did a 10 to 1 UP split around 4 years ago.  It's 5 bucks if you owned stock prior to 2010.  Now despite all the government interference since the mortgage crisis, the increased federal requirement of Anti-Money Laundering efforts we now have Banamex maybe scamming anywhere between 600 million to a billion in phony loans.  Unless you walk on water, compensation is sparse, especially in the technology groups that are always tasked to save money.  But look at the bright side.  The summer employee appreciation summer lunch was an overcooked hamburger, fries or coleslaw, a fountain drink and an ice cream sandwich."
bad,"Working in Global CTO group responsible for all the Middleware environment for consumer (Retail) Banking.  "
bad,"My role is to identify Gaps in the existing processes and make changes to ensure Compliance to regulations, improve employee productivity, reduce TAT in processing and ultimately lead to increased customer satisfaction."
bad,"Çalıştığım dönemde aktif olarak faaliyetlerini sürdüren banka şimdilerde Denizbank'a devredildi. "
bad,"If I had to say what I think could be improved, I would say the systems we use. Other than the technical issues the company is fair and has made changes to help and keep there employees"
bad,"I was recruited to work for this company as business needs far exceeded the companies capacity to fulfill loan applications.  The company hired way to many people way to fast and did not have the infrastructure or personnel in place to handle such a large staffing increase. The training was awful, the management was awful and the technology was outdated.  The training had very little structure and new employees were not given the proper training and tools to succeed.  I would NOT recommend anyone to work at Citibank, at least not in the Mortgage Lending Division."
bad,"Citi is a great place to work, however, most of the jobs are being outsourced."
bad,"This job used to actually be fun, until it became customer service concentric.  Citi has (along with many other companies) become so focused on the customer and not how to make their employee happy, that it makes this job not worth your time.  Constantly harassed by managers to do better, not enough positive feedback to employees. Benies are really good, but the pay is hideously low ($11/hr to take serious abuse from people put into a bad situation).  Bonuses - forgetaboutit!! If you actually manage to make the highest tier level, your manager will make sure you don't get it.  They're really good at giving you non-monetary ""awards""."
bad,All day you are on the phones trying to get people to buy things but even if you get the sale its a 70/30 chance you WILL NOT get commission for it. If they say they love the sales person but just hate the company then it falls on your pay check. High turnover rate.
bad,Learned good tips in ways to manage my money and make good business choices
bad,the most enjoyable part of the job was to hear the appreciation of the customer once your have completed modification or payment arrangement so the were able to keep their home
bad,Very appreciative of the opportunity to work for Citibank.
bad,Business in wind down in UK and undergoing divestitures of the consumer portfolios
bad,"The people that you work with are okay, and they are willing to help you to feel comfortable with your work. But the company expect you to be master on dealing with customers, handle all the problems within a month after a month of training"
bad,I worked for Citi Financial Mortgage rebranding websites that had been acquired. These were online loan applications that were at times operating on servers without updated security certificates. These loans went to unqualified borrowers at ridiculous interest rates who should have never been given a mortgage These are the types of lenders who caused the collapse of the economy in 2008.
bad,"Citi made it clear from day one that temps were not to receive ANY favors paid for by Citi. This meant that when workers got a meal catered in, the temps had to wait until all the workers done before we could pick through the left-overs. That is how petty they were. I worked midnight to 9 a.m. in the mail room of a facility where customers were not permitted and I was still expected to be ""business casual."" The rules came across as petty and arbitrary."
bad,Employees would be fired with any prior warning. The goals set were impossible to reach in the area provided. though there was separate management there was always interference from the branch manager
bad,Citi has decent pay and benefits but isn't a place id stake my time to try and make a career out of. There is a lot of favoritism and its more of who you know then how you performed.
bad,I was only there for a month.   I had very little training and I told them from the beginning I had never done this type of work before.   I left because of the lack of training.   They had an outdated Msnual to learn part of the job.  They were moving my position offshore anyway.  I worked thru an agency not directly for Citi. I heard they had good benefits.  They did have a nice cafe for meal time.  Very serious and unfriendly group I worked with.  Keep in mind I am not a job hopper.  I was at my previous place of employment over 22 years.
bad,"If you're hoping to get hired on the retail side of Citibank, good luck because you will have to self teach yourself almost everything. I'm generalizing of course but be weary."
bad,"The work is id very challenging. If you are looking to work on the guts of cutting edge technology, Citi is place for you. You may get to play with cool toys, but it is unlikely that you will develop it"
bad,"Everyone is on eggshells because the atmosphere is stained, Management  is very unprofessional and the turnover rate is out of this world ridiculous. Not a good place to work long term."
bad,A typical workday is chaos from the time I log in. Managers do not help much and delegate what they can to the operations assists. The managers cater to the agents but then tell us we need to crack down on them. The rules are not the same for all the agents across the board. There is favoritism and you get promoted base on who you know and who you are friends with not based on your qualifications. I have learned what kind of manager i do not want to be. The hardest part of the job is trying to get everything done while trying to deal with agents that act like children. The most enjoyable part of my job is the other operations assistants I work with. We are truly like family.
bad,"Great environment to work"
bad,Citibank has an extensive amount of benefits right from the start of training with many events to show employee recognition as well as leisure with absenteeism and vacation time.
bad,El departamento del call center tenía fallas en la supervisión y los salarios así como las comisiones por concepto de ventas era deficientes.
bad,"Transitioned through massive layoffs and outsourcing only to find the company unwilling to support higher education, despite assurances to the contrary.  Encouraged 7 day a week employement over a leave of absence or part time employment during a practicum. Managers were stressed and typically took 3 month leaves, which trickled down to employees."
bad,"IT PM roles not challenging, poor management / morale. IT PM role was more of a documentation role, not a SME / detailed role. Team did not like management, management not supportive of team."
bad,"Citigroup Technology Infrastructure group not a fun place to work. Raises are poor due to the group constantly involved in people/cost cutting. Unless you support a business in NY, you will either be transferred to Irving, Texas, or let go."
bad,"This job wasn't worth it to me. Don't get me wrong, the pay and benefits are great.. but that's the only good thing about this job. Training and nesting were wonderful, but once you're out on the floor it's just down hill from there. We weren't trained on out of country calls so I had absolutely no idea what to do. If you needed help, you had to call the escalations department who very rudely would answer your questions because that wasnt their job. I can't remember any specific times where I saw my manager either. It was nearly impossible to get a day off for a funeral which was just sad. In the beginning, it feels like you personally matter to the trainers and managers.. but once you're finished with all of it you're just another agent. I just had no idea what I was doing the entire time. I paid close attention in training and asked so many questions but that didn't help anything. I was always so nervous and felt out of place there."
bad,Citi is a great company to work for if you're starting out. They pay well and have great benefits. The main issue I had working at Citi was that I felt a little Harassed by my managers and ultimately the managers harassing me fired me after i went to their boss. Overall not a terrible place if you don't mind sitting around waiting for work and getting discouraged for it.
bad,"I worked at Citibank as a Teller for about 2-3 year. I had few manager changing there compare to my other job. The only thing I like about working there is the co-worker I met; Hate the last manager I worked with. The job is a kind of stressful, I hate the ""Sales and referrals"" pressure from the managers, especially the last manager I worked with before leaving the job (That manager was the worst, if a teller doesn't meet the sale or referral goal she give so much attitude and bullsh*t to the employees) The Last manager wasn't flexible with the work schedule due to shortage of employee and force employee to work even when they can't."
bad,"Pay is not good which is the most important thing. Most customers are nice people, but some call just to have someone to yell at. Co-workers are cool and management is nice.  The most enjoyable part of the job is being able to help customers by correcting store problems or waiving fees. The worst part of the job is when you cant lower their interest rate and they give you a bad rating on your email survey which directly impacts the amount of raise you get(even though you were super nice to them)."
bad,"Needed a job and got through training; but, I hated the hours and hunting-down people for being over-drawn on their accounts."
bad,AML compliance production work for High Risk Account Classifications. I really enjoyed learning about high risk accounts and what makes them high risk. My team worked very closely with each other to determine if an account was a risk for the bank. The training is very poor so you have to depend on other co-workers but there has been so much turn over that you are own your own for the most part.
bad,The company doesn't value employees.The pay is good but with experience should be give better raises.I did learn a lot about the mortgage business but they did do so many later moves in positions but wasn't compensation in pay.
bad,"Citi was a great place to work at many years ago.  After 2007 that changed and now it is really a job and it is okay.   There is room to advance, but it is quite stressful these days and you never know when your job just might go away."
bad,Very structured and controlled environment. Not a lot of advancement opportunity.
bad,"Typical day - daily customer transactions."
bad,"Fun environment, lots of work to be done on a daily basis. Not much room for promotion, good bonus and incentives."
bad,"not as employee friendly as advertised, Its a very easy job, but the job is very boring and its also not very fun contribute to the economy and downfall"
bad,"On average, I assisted clients daily regarding their mortgage accounts and/or assisted with inquiries regarding products and services available. I gained a great deal of knowledge about mortgage loans and servicing. The best part of my work experience was when opportunities to educate clients about their mortgage loan arised. Also, on many occassions, when I was able to resolve customer concerns and any servicing issues, I took pride in my position knowing I helped the client. I also enjoyed sharing information with co-workers about how to better service clients and reach company goals. Management set goals for the business and its employees to succeed. My trainers were very informative and always provided ongoing support. "
bad,"typically Monday thru Friday job, very little increase of salary, loved the face to face contact with customers. After so many years you looked at most of them like family and friends instead of customers"
bad,"Taking inbound calls all day long 8-10 hrs a day. Back to back calls. Helping customers process their mortgage payments over the phone, online or providing a mailing address. Their KBS system is huge! During my employment they were constantly changing information and the links to get to the information w/o even notifying the working CSRs. This made it difficult in finding important info for customers and a longer talk time."
bad,A typical day at work is spent on the phones. I have learned to navigate thru different systems on each call. The co workers are very helpful to each other. The hardest part of this job is the customers that I am not able to help.
bad,"It seems there is a divide on the management team as to ""fear"" managers and those who believe that everyone is an adult."
bad,"Call volume will be slow at times, and other times very heavy. Company looking for how many ""recurring"" payments you can set up on each account."
bad,"From hero to zero in less than two years. Ik heb me gesmeten voor deze job, banking examen 96,5%, creditcard examen 94%. Een maand na indiensttreding bevorderd tot specialist."
bad,"Ever since I started working at Citi, things has really going on well. I made a new friends and people over there are very friendly to relier on. I have been getting my salary in time and there wasn't nothing like disappointment and also built my skilled in the work and very happy in it."
bad,"Citi is cutthroat with little opportunity for advancement. There should be a lot of opportunities at Citi but they don't trickle down to the masses. Large, multi-national company that cares about bottom line more than employees"
bad,"Poor Management , was on overnight shift with several portfolios to cover from credit applications to fuel cards to fraud.  Expected to keep low call time as set under one portfolio.  Fraud calls aren't quick,  nor are credit card applications."
bad,"I have been with Citi for more than 18 months so far and strongly suggest if you are looking for a part-time teller job in southern Ca you should look elsewhere. I have been to most branches in the Los Angeles valley area and all the branches have a great staff including their branch managers and officers, however, the upper management of the area is the worst I have ever encountered in my entire career. also, Citibank only thinks about the company's benefit first and the employees later. the whole culture of Citibank has been shifting rapidly towards the worst."
bad,"ok place to work, culture isnt the best'. Management is not understanding of personal issues. Overworked. always on call.  Not good work life balance."
bad,First off management is lacking. They are nice (some) mine was awful and lacked management with our team. Then I changed schedules and I still had a manager completely opposite of my schedule so I struggled when asking questions and had to find another manager for help. Their training severely lacked what actually being on the floor was like because they hardly did live traing.
bad,This company has amazing benefits but treat their employees terrible. If you get with the right department with a great manager you can do amazing things here pick wisely
bad,"work from home is good"
bad,"It is a great place to work with great benefits. It is fast paced and is very competitive. Like other employment environments, there are opportunities for improvement and challenges"
bad,"Citibank is a commercial bank. They are interested in just one thing - company money. Employees are a means to an end. While I was there, the powers that be, who came from another bank, instituted something called ""KDS"", or Key Driver Scores, on which they based employee performance. The trouble is, these ""scores"" amount to nothing more than customer opinions. Even if you do you job exactly the way the bank tells you to, you would still get in trouble if customers gave you a low score - even if they lied. Your performance reviews were based on your popularity with the customers, not on how well you did your job."
bad,This company was not stable. It was stressful not knowing day to day if you would have a job. This company was always up and down constantly. Will never work here again.
bad,I do not feel like explaining or giving a review with Citibank will explain at interviews. citi has good benefits that is about it. you work for every dollar you make.
bad,"Citi is a great place to work. I worked there a total of 13 years,  however this is my second time being laid off due to our jobs going over seas.  I can no longer stay at a company that is so unpredictable when it comes to my family and my well being.  My advice is that if you are looking for a more stable environment and a company that doesn't look at you as just another number, I would not recommend Citi."
bad,The manager really sets the tone of the work environment. The manager should not show favoritism to one group over the other. The manager should acknowledge the work being put in by their reports. The manager must not be a micro-manager for that's when even the good people begin to feel the pressure. It is a testament to the manager when 9 out of 10 people in two different groups under a manager want to leave and some did.
bad,"Company Disappeared from The US after many issues with the government including fraud. So, it makes absolutely no difference what my opinion is. Good luck finding a job with this company"
bad,"The hardest part about working for Citi is that their equipment consistently fails daily on the worst days such as the weekend, which greatly impacts our customer service scores. Citi does not invest in newer equipment and software that is not advanced or current to todays technology. Management is very poor, unfair, and shows favoritism to particular employees unfortunately. Many employee's have transferred or quitted due to this. The only enjoyable part about this job is having co-workers who are outgoing and caring individuals who become family. On a positive note, responsibilities are huge in this bank and it might be overwhelming at times, yet it sets you up for success in future up bringing for other banks to take on higher roles. You gain a lot of insight on operations and the team spirit is high. On some Friday's, there is casual day friday sports day."
bad,Dealing with cm's can be stressful.  I have the oportinuity to work from home with is great. The benifits are great. The guidelines are constantly changing and there is concern of elimination of department.
bad,"stressful. you can never do enough always changing the rules. to much romper room acitiviies going on instead of work, they treat everyone like children instead of grown adults"
bad,My typical day was taking inbound calls from a call queue for new mortgages. Purchase and Refinances. I also spent the day following up with clients as needed.
bad,"A typical workday is between 10 and 12 hours a day. "
bad,"You have to log in and get on the phones with 5 minutes. If your computer is slow and not loading up right, it counts against you. There are multiple departments where you are on the phones and some of the departments are not good and if you are asked to move, you can say no, but you will essentially never get another opportunity to move departments. The metrics are difficult, for example, you have essentially 4-5 minutes as an average call time, and some calls can go for 20 minutes and you will get in trouble if you don't meet the goals. Everyone you talk to on the phone automatically hates you because they know why you are calling. They will start reaching out to people after one day and sometimes it is for like 2 dollars that is past due and they will be called a LOT of times per day and the people will be very upset that you called them 8 times for 2 dollars. The pay, benefits and PTO are good, but that's because the job is very not desirable. They record literally everything they review and monitor everything you do. The culture is good, they do a lot of contests and fun things throughout the building. The cafeteria is great, lots of options for food. They have a gym you can have membership to and they can take the membership fee out of your paycheck and it is not that expensive. You can also get a Citi bank account and they have employee perks for having the account."
bad,"Citi creates an atmosphere of really providing a lot for the employees, but also creates numerous drawbacks  to undo the benefits. The workload often stays nonstop for a large majority of the day due to understaffing. Then, near the end of the month when the service level metrics aren't balancing out (because they've kept it short-staffed), you'll receive the e-mails desperate to get overtime hours to try and make things up. The review teams who score employee's calls are terrible; either pulling something randomly out as wrong on either a random, non-impactful technicality, or strait up incorrect information. The policies not dictated directly by federal law also wind up being confusing and often contradictory."
bad,"I never worked for Citi, I have no idea why this showed up for me to review.  As far as a bank customer, I would never do business with them, as far as an employer, I have no idea."
bad,"Pros"
bad,"Was not a friendly place to work. Management was not flexible to anyone schedule. Everyone seemed overworked, underpaid and generally unhappy. Things might have changed since then"
bad,"•	Confident in numerical data tasks and excellence analytical and mathematical skills"
bad,"Not very professional, work every weekend and nights, shifts are not flexibal or easy to work with, citi does not make customers knowledgeable of changes, not enough pay for thw stress."
bad,"No employee interaction, medial pay, not the best job I've ever had. I dreaded going to work, I won't recommend anyone to this place. Impersonal management."
bad,not trained very well. supervisors and agents would provide different answers. No one seemed to know the correct response! The money is great so If you don't mind giving possible wrong info to your customer its a good job.
bad,"Working alongside my colleagues who are fantastic and learning about new and emerging technologies."
bad,As  temp you are very aware that you are a temp - feel as though you are just a number filling in - not a very friendly atmosphere
bad,"I contracted for Apex systems. No benefits, no PTO, and only worked there for a year. Contract was open ended, but ended with no notice exactly a year after I was hired. The pay was mediocre, especially given that there weren't any PTO or benefits included. Work was fine. Good temporary gig."
bad,"Apesar de ser uma empresa extremamente organizada, acredito que não dá o devido valor aos jovens aprendizes."
bad,"the company is okay depending on the manager you get but I love the diversity of the company. I loved my job and I was great at my job, I was not fond of my manager but I did what I was told to do."
bad,It was fun to work for the company. Lots and lots of fun stuff to do in terms of extra curricular activities. Everyone is so friendly and always want to help out.
bad,"The usual day at work start with planning and prioritizing.Then the normal health check of the critical applications."
bad,departments that offer incentives based on over all monthly performances. this gives employees whom tend to stand out the opportunity to be recognized financially/.
bad,"At the junior level there is an over emphasis on menial tasks (coffee runs, etc) and a lack of mentorship and general appreciation for intellectual capability."
bad,"After 5 enjoyable years at BISYS, Citi became our new company.  Due to needing to increase profits all Production Assurance roles needed to be outsourced over sea's."
bad,"Upgraded all pc and laptops and refurbished, Every day was different, I enjoy troubleshooting to figure out the issue at hand"
bad,Citi bank is a great long term job if you don't mind doing the same thing repetitively and don't mind waiting years to move up.
bad,I worked at Citbank during most of my growing adulthood.  It played key parts in my growing knowledge on how to handle customers as well as multitasking to complete daily jobs.
bad,"to take outbound calls to members on their home depot account that were delinquent on their accounts to try and resolve the past due pmts by setting up future auto pmts, promise to pay forms and future call backs to collect pmt"
bad,"I learned a lot from my time at Citi. Additional data entry skills, team building techniques, and additional coaching skills. Most of my coworkers were very good, some of which are still my friends today. My immediate supervisor was a wonderful encouraging effective leader. However, the upper management was way too focused on the numbers instead of employee development and advancement."
bad,"It was nice work place with good management, however the role was extremely repetitive. Longer hours expected when necessary."
bad,Stressful environment a lot of turn over. Constantly changing in the wrong direction. Always hiring and then always laying people off.
bad,"The project where can we except maximum pressure. I was working 24/7 production support"
bad,I is a wonderful company with a lot of great benefits. Only downfall is there is no job security and they don't take care of the elders.
bad,"excesiva cantidad de horas de trabajo"
bad,difficult organization to navigate.  they do like to take risk in the trading portfolios and compensate better than other banks.
bad,"If you will ever join and IT department within Citi, the first thing you will notice is (in general) the average age : too high. So if you are looking for a fresh, dynamic and young environment it's definitely not the right place for you. It can be a great place to work depending on your career aspirations and if you enjoy working in a very international company. This means that you can be left alone with all your team working abroad or in other cities, this might sound exciting for some people, but in my opinion it's depressing. There's a self-starter attitude which is very good because it forces you to learn and improve your skills. Managers are friendly and open to any discussion or questions you might have. I would personally reduce the possibility to work from home because I noticed that many are taking advantage of this not coming to the office for weeks/months deteriorating the social atmosphere. Job security is low as most of the financial institutes so you must be prepared to change your chair quickly without second thoughts."
bad,Too much workload for one person to handle.  They expect one person to do everything.  TOO much paperwork!! There is an obscene amount of paperwork and then you have to follow up on everything you submit including different departments that do not answer you back!!
bad,"Empresa, não dava oportunidade para crescimento profissional,"
bad,waited on customers for there order on the grill. Prepped for the following day and cleaned my area. I was also a cashier.
bad,"While being employed at Citi, I was able to inherit different skills in different areas of the business. Citi offered many ways of celebrating their employees."
bad,My typical day would include dealing with angry and happy customers. It would also include team meeting with my coworkers to share best practices. The hardest part was dealing with upset people. The most enjoyable part was meeting new coworkers and speaking with different people.
bad,answered phone calls in incoming call center the worst part of the job was sales the most enjoyable part was working from home.
bad,Citi tried very hard to make their stressful work environment pleasant and fun by putting on various competitions. The Legal Department was fast paced and calendar driven.
bad,I was teller so typical day was taking transactions and working in the foreign currency department. working at Citibank I have learned a lot about foreign currency and how the rates work. My co workers were well educated and did not need management involvement. Hardest part was when there was a line and management did not give you a minute of resting before calling the next customer in front of you. most enjoyable part was leaving at 4 instead of 5
bad,I enjoyed working with my team and management at the call center over the years we rebuilt the call center infrastructure when completed we obtained 99.9 percent uptime.I enjoyed my job at Citi the pay was good but there was no advancement opportunities in the IT department.
bad,"There are a lot of good things about working at Citi bank, set hours, amazing benefits, no forced overtime, but there are a lot of down sides as well. Your scored on the phone calls you take which can be a problem when management cant agree on what does or doesn't meet their standards. It is not uncommon for a supervisor to tell you to do a processes a certain way just to inform you two months later that you have been doing it wrong. And it's nearly impossible to get the same answer twice if you ask making it a very stressful work environment"
bad,"Secured delinquent funds by setting up specialized arrangements, non-stop phone calls using a dialer and you need to know all rules for every state"
bad,"Citi lacks a certain ability to create good leadership."
bad,Management is not helpful and environment is hostile. Team work culture is inexistent. Pay is lower than average market.
bad,This is where I first learned my skills of talking to people on the phone and was able to take that with me even today. I enjoyed helping people pay off credit card and setting up pay plans that would work for them.
bad,Citi Private Bank is faulted with the issue of too many tasks given to managers and improper use of their own resources. This leads to a lot of projects being incomplete or delayed.
bad,Nice bank but issues are not as should be for all the workers.  It is not good to discuss issues here.  It is good to be a worker for this company.
bad,"Good place to work. Fixed wortking hours."
bad,"Fun work environment, work life balance. Great training programs on sale of insurance, home and auto, personal loan and mortgages. Potential for very generous monthly and quarterly bonus."
bad,Logged into phones and called customers all day.  Didn't like the script we had to follow.
bad,"Would not work here again, bad conditions, the only good thing was all the time off so i didnt have to be there."
bad,"The people are happy to be working there, they dont really work a ton, and everyone gets paid decent. Its a little hard to move up the latter though."
bad,"The job is easy, the standards are reasonable, but the continuing changes to policies and procedures are beyond ridiculous."
bad,"Always there will be target pressure."
bad,This place went out of business in 2005 due to bankruptcy. Their medical benefits are pretty good for part time employees
bad,It was fun and a great environment. It's just HR really needs to get thing organized.
bad,Upper management is inadequate and do not understand the needs of their employees
bad,"•	Handle incoming calls, including complaints and exercised independent discretion when responding to inquiries"
bad,"over time required"
bad,"While Citi is just like any other large bank, the work/life balance flexibility is amazing, but dependent on the manager."
bad,Citibank is not the place for you if you do not adapt well to change and a lot of it.
bad,"It was good working with Citibank. Work days were fun."
bad,"A very friendly place to work with constant expectations altering to meet the market. The management teams are balanced well and very skillful. Management pushes and encourages advancement, however, the company has limited opportunities depending on which function you work in. The co-workers mostly are under qualified for the job unfortunately, which I believe is due to a poor hiring process. The hardest part of the job is constant change in expectations and more demand without compensation. Other than that it is an enjoyable company to work for and the insurance and benefits are very good."
bad,"Management staff over extended,"
bad,Working at CitiMortgage reminded me of the company Initech in the movie Office Space. It was god-awful.
bad,"A typical day at work what ever can happen, will happen. Every day was new venture, a new part of the process get enhanced daily. Management was right along with the crew. They jumped in and kept us very much informed on new stuff. My co-workers were a trip. We got along very well, we had fun every hour and that made the day go fast. We laughed, disagree and laugh some more. The hardest part of the job was when routers, severs and hubs went down or we needed an Federal Reserve extension.The most enjoyable part of the job was the job itself."
bad,"Strong knowledge and flexibility to adapting in any situation,"
bad,"Working at this place was fun but very stressful at times. The management was okay at helping others. The hardest part about working at Citi was dealing with all of the angry, unhappy homeowners. The most enjoyable part of the job was making the homeowners happy."
bad,Worked 10 hour shift and assisted clients online with bank accounts. Created templates to respond to clients requests. On the Escalation team so were self managed. The most enjoyable part of job was team mates had experience from all different departments within the bank and we were able to problem solve with each other. I learned the banking inside systems. The hardest part of the job was being the only Online department in the site.
bad,Company goes thru many management changes. Constant revolving door of personnel.
bad,"The job was solving collection issues on the phone, call center environment. Low pay"
bad,Dead end job went no where even worst they wanted to keep you there in the dark cold room.
bad,"Answered incoming calls regarding bank accounts. People were usually upset when calling due to something ""wrong"" with their bank accounts. It was very stressful being yelled at, however I was usually able to correct the errors or transfer them to someone who could."
bad,Certain Citibank employees seem to want to assist the clients and do a good job. Others do not care for anything but the bottom line.
bad,Citi is an organization where if you are good you can excel. You can also get lost and become a number.  Its typical corporate culture. its great place to learn and start your career.
bad,"good management skills, maintaining strong working relationships with all team members. Dexterity with Microsoft Excel, Word, Outlook, and PowerPoint."
bad,"A place rich in culture and great work ethic."
bad,Because Citi is a bank the federal government regulated the calls for sales so the more you sold the more restrictions where put on you. I was fired due to doing very well on sales but wasn't meeting the very restrictive guide lines. Most people don't last as long as I did.
bad,"Location near to me was a plus. Large employer is positive for community. Environment was difficult. Primarily a call center environment. Answering phones non-stop for 8 or more hours a day can wear on you. They have programs to attempt to keep morale up among employees but many people are burnt out and don't have the best attitudes. Occasional layoffs is stressful. Opportunities for advancement but notable favoritism is present. Poor management overall. Most managers unable to perform the job of the department they manage. Limited accountability, questionable ethics. Great time off and benefits. Some ability to change. This place definitely has it's good and bad."
bad,Best part about the company is the culture. The people that work here are what make coming to work everyday bearable. Management is only concerned with the size of their bonuses
bad,There is very little grow in career and it could be a dead end job.  Hence I left and wanted to do more.  But recommended first students right out of college.
bad,Work there depends on what branch you work for. Some branches are non stop busy and there are others that are slow the majority of the day.
bad,"I supported users at 4 physical location...2 in Northern CA and 2 in Southern  CA, as well as most of the CA telecommuters. Desktops, Laptops, Printers, Asset management, troubleshooting and repair of devices from beginning to end. I used remote access to help remote users--Mostly VNC, and Lync, but occasionally I also used Remote Desktop Connection, and UNC to connect to the computers. Most of the remote user issues were with remote connection, printer installs, and computer functionality. I also built computers from the ground up (imaged them) to delivery to the customer. I was the sole support for these users. I did shipping and receiving for them, too. I performed service for anything which came in the door except for a remote server environment. They had their own help desk. I had to manage my day, including contacting users and scheduling with them. The hardest part of the job was itemizing what I had done for each of the 8 hours. I was ALWAYS busy, but trying to break down how much time I spent on a particular user in order to itemize the day was hard. Meeting the hard 3-8 hours for completion was hard with the telecommuters unless it was an easy fix. I got along very well with my co-workers, management and the users. the most enjoyable part of the job was being free to organize my day on my own. I liked the work, the people and the location. Just not the paperwork. I learned that I could fit into the role, and do a good job with minimal supervision, keeping everyone satisfied. I came in with minimal background."
bad,It took forever to get a Computer to fulfill the contract requirements. I really wanted to show my skills to get full-time work at the company.
bad,"I did not enjoy this job, Citibank is extremely shady and unprofessional."
bad,Citi Offers the best benefits you can ever get. Great coworkers.
bad,"It was typical work, where you do your job following the internal policies."
bad,If it was just the company taken into account this would be an awesome job. But clients on the phone are absolutely horrible. I had a panic attack a day for 6 months.
bad,Job involved calling and collecting on past due accounts. Job is hourly and you are required to meet a goal of amount saved. feedback from customers isn't always pretty.
bad,making calls to collect from people who are 4-6 months past due on a credit card isn't exactly the easiest or most enjoyable job.
bad,"Average daily transactions exceeds 100 per teller."
bad,"Company is a very stressful company to work for. But I manage to make the numbers happen as they should with even trying to over achieve the task. I work with great people in the office. We make it a competitive workplace but fun at the same time. We collect the loans that we book. So we do everything in this office. From booking the loan, to processing all paper work, repo the vehicles once they become delinquent enough on their accounts. We also do the skip tracing on them as well. But if we do not get delinquency down no matter what else we do it, will cause us to not bonus."
bad,"constantly changing, very busy. great benefits. nice atmosphere to work."
bad,I had enjoying working at citi bank processing loan payoff and loan payment. cutting check out for client who had less $50 in their escrow account. i also enjoy process 2nd mortgage payoff & payment.
bad,I had the opportunity to start up as a teller and truly develop my career by showing proof that is the place I want to be and grow with hard work and by exceeding expectations.
bad,I loved Citi Bank. Management really cares about their employees.
bad,I worked in a branch office as a loan officer in retail Citifinancial office where I originated sub prime loans for retail borrowers.
bad,Sitting down and on the phone for long hours. The hardest part was selling to customers after helping them with their credit cards over the phone.
bad,I hated this job. Working in a call center was awful customers were mean and sales were impossible to meet goals.
bad,"Buena remuneración, buen ambiente laboral."
good,"Learned about Finacial Sector, procedures :-"
good,"the company relocated out of the area, the wages were minimum wage and it was a much better company when it was associates before they changed to new owners."
good,"Citi can be a great place to work, if you have a decent manager. However, the people in management are really bad. My manager was a typical example of micromanagement, who will even follow you to the bathroom even when you were not a temp employee. She created work, so she could show that she is working 60 plus hours per week and will not allow any time for training, learning except mandatory training. There were several ethical complaints against this manager (and some other managers) by different employees but Citi strongly favor managers. I met several employees who had similar complaints against their managers and had to file ethics complaints and nothing happened to those complaints. HR is very very biased and works with the managers and sometimes try to intimidate the employees. On the other hand, I also knew managers who were good and the employees under them were happy. So, when you join Citi, you are actually working for your manager only and not for Citi as they drive your career, your training, your interaction with other teams and they can effectively block your ways and take your ideas. Most people I met could hardly wait to get home. This was one of the worst experience."
good,average day was 7:30-6:30 and holidays. high stress levels and demands. Not great training for new processes. Not replacing of staff when resignations happen.  Cost cutting.
good,"Management does not know how to manage or develop employees. The manager is always too ""busy"" to assist and only available when they need to complete their monthly one on one."
good,Salary low.  Management has replaced permanent employees with contractors.  Little chance of being hired as a permanent employee.  Will learn a lot about the workings of the company.
good,"I begin each day with a group huddle, to review our MTD numbers vs. our Goals. I ask for feedback from team members to share any insights, or anything that's best for the team. I review all account openings, loan paperwork, operational tactics, and communication. I see clients all day and work side by side with my team members, coaching them in a service and sales behaviors."
good,It seems like all i would do is just wake up go to work everyday for 5 days i didnt really have a life
good,"Trabajé a traves de una consultora en el area de IT. La realidad es que ser consultor en citi, implica ser empleado de segunda, es como sino existieras para ellos salvo para cargarte de trabajo. La diferencia que hacen entre el staff y los consultores es asquerosa. No dan ni siquiera estacionamiento. "
good,Average work environment.  Management over haul is necessary as old corporate practices still seem to override sensible and practical decision makers.
good,"It all depends what business division you work in. The bonuses are (generally) laughable for a fortune 500 company. That is a reflection of upper management's structuring of the particular division you work in and MOST keep the money at the top.  If you get anything, know you are  reimbursed in bonuses based on your pay scale, not on the work you do nor the performance. Literally I have gotten nothing for doing a good job here. I have known personnel who get top ranked (and they watch how many of those they give out) and they have gotten nothing. Again, laughable. What's worse? The employees just stay here. Many jobs are very simple, boring even. But then others, you are overworked and earning your boss' paycheck.  Scope creep is rampant as a lot of management can talk great strategy but cannot execute their way out of a wet paper bag. The hardest part to deal with is politics and employees not willing to help one another, which is not always 100% prevalent; however, it is a lot of the organization. They talk about digitization and next level for the future, but they execute poorly,if ever. Talented, younger folks who are smart leave quickly. So then the same outdated ideas for people that started years ago is the population that end up staying here. And people stay here for years upon years upon years. The benefits (time off, insurance) are really really great - but know you also pay into insurance depending on your pay range. And when you take time off, it's a load to catch up on when you return. The culture speaks to keeping up with the market and talks about appreciating"
good,"Citi is great start for your career however it will consume your time entirely working. I always complain the 12 hours working schedule or more during the month end cycle. No OT pays ,  No holiday pay"
good,Total culture change.  Not great and a lot of lay offs.  Some great people but management change.  Moving to low cost zones and loss of jobs moving forward.
good,Not much autonomy. Everything is highly structured and micromanaged. No opportunity to work from home in any of the areas I worked in during my 12 years there.
good,"As a SAWF FIU investigator, the day flew by because you're constantly working with no downtime.   There was always work so there was limited if any, time to do anything outside of work and there was very little if any, acknowledgement of declining morale and no understanding of a healthy work/life balance."
good,you will def feel like a slave working here! and the environment is super strict! very old school and zero fun factor! i have been working here for over 8 years! and i think its time to leave!
good,"I dedicated 10 years at Citi and gave alot of hours to the department. They demand your best performance and reward you with nothing but an ""I'm sorry, better luck next year""."
good,"the worst customer service experience ever, they did not care if you had children or medical problems you had to come to work and you could never change your schedule"
good,"Citibank paid decently but since I worked in a call center, it was always busy. They got rid of several departments and we were given those jobs without a pay increase."
good,Very fast paste environment. Production driven. Managers will micromanage you to the point that is unbearable. Pay was okay because received monthly bonuses. The benefits were good also.
good,"Helpdesk management of security reference data led response to questions on data quality issues, build and validate various investment vehicles types in master data management (MDM) as requested by traders"
good,"Management lacks vision and does not take into consideration the long time benefits of any strategy. HR is totally mislligned to the company's value and brand."
good,"Ok work culture. No processess at all. Better to find something else."
good,"Absolutely none of the rules are in writing.   Every ""policy"" is passed on by word of mouth.  You get a great flexible schedule, however, it is overshadowed by lack of management, lack of pay and no insurance."
good,"unlikely to suggest this company to anyone due to poor managment and out dated regulations."
good,"Overall Happy was able to learn new tasks"
good,"Great global exposure and interaction with senior management "
good,"Working at the lower levels of the retail bank is primarily sales with a lot of pressure for ""production"" coming from middle management. I hear things are better outside of retail banking."
good,"At Citi it was very much like any other corporate company. I loved working there. In the beginning the hard part was being in a collections role. I loved how we tried to offer solutions to get people back on track with paying their bills. We helped many people avoid Bankruptcy, and being sent to third part collections. Love the people I worked with. Loved having a café at the center."
good,Great company to work as a student. Limited growth opportunity. Low morale.
good,"A typical day at work was about 12 hours but the business was seasonal, with spikes during to quarterly earnings reporting periods. "
good,"a typical day at work"
good,Overall average place to work. Nice people. Job was outsourced and we were given adequate notice. We reported to TX site which was a hassle. AZ associates treated as less than equals.
good,"Worked the 1st Saturday & Sunday, and usually the 2nd Saturday of every month, due to client deadlines. This was in addition to the 12 to 14 hour days during the 1st two weeks. Very little chance for advancement. Co-workers were great, as we were all in the same boat."
good,"* Middle management was eliminated so it caused alot of chaos. "
good,falta de oportunidades e péssima gerencia dos superiores.
good,Good working hours
good,The job was very emotional draining and from experience managers pick favorites and try to use there power in order to get employees to meet goals set by them and not that the company sets.
good,En General la experiencia en Citi fue buena. Ellos me ayudaron mucho en un momento personal muy difícil. Deberían de enfatizar más el trabajo en equipo.
good,"Managers will throw you under the bus first chance they get . Also promotions are typically given as a quid pro quo, not top performers. Beware of management at all cost."
good,Things were going well till an outside manager came in. He is a workaholic and expected everyone to be the same. Since he worked nights and weekends we were all expected to do the same.
good,"very professional when I first started working tthere"
good,Citi offers great time off and flexible hours. They also have a good family health benefits and a 401K match program. Citi provides a great management program to further your career
good,"Citi seems to be known for its layoffs. While you work there they are a great company, but they eliminated the role that I had. They have great benefits and they are a CURRENT pay employee so when I was only there for 3 days I got a paycheck which was great."
good,"Long days even longer nights, pay is scattered between the departments. How does an analyst make less than a customer service agent the world may never know..."
good,"While limiting your growth by requiring you maintain a position for at least a year, management can not seem to keep personal feelings aside. Favorites run rampant through this call center and seem to get away with murder. Rules change depending on who you are and with whom you spoke. No flexibility in scheduling, they are unwilling to work with you for a schedule revolving around school or children. There are a few redeeming qualities about this call center. There are one or two managers who can keep things professional, and one or two non-managers that attempt to keep things as fair as they possibly can for you when dealing with leadership."
good,- Investment banking was well paid but lots of work
good,I worked at Citigroup for 12 years.  The first seven years were bearable because the work was interesting.  The main problem with my time at Citigroup is that I was never able to leave the Night Shift and I never felt comfortable.  I'm not a night person and if the work schedule stayed at 8 hours it might have been better.  In 2002 when I was transferred to Weehawken it became a 12 hour shift and it being Overnight I never became accustomed to it.
good,This was a tough job in a tough work environment. I do not believe that working in M&A in SSSB was any more difficult or easier than any of the other banks.
good,"Some customers were rude, the management at my assigned bank branch always took the customers side even when the customers were disrespectful and insulting. The management there was not supportive. The position was for part time but they practically forced employees to work full time,if not you were treated unfairly. No consistent schedule. You couldn't plan personal days or doctor's appointments, you never knew when you would be off. The Saturdays off were only for the full time tellers, even when you probably had worked the whole week."
good,"1. Very high work pressure"
good,"very stressful sales practice"
good,"Citi has a culture of promoting those that can do the job the best instead of those that can lead others.  As a result, you might get a good manager and you might get an absolute nightmare know it all self centered control freak.    "
good,"Was not able to move up, they find a way to stop this from happening.  No communication between employee and management.  Was written up after coming back from surgery, was not made aware of changes."
good,"Citigroup Inc. is an American multinational investment banking and financial services corporation headquartered in Manhattan, New York City. The company was formed by the merger of banking giant Citicorp and financial conglomerate Travelers Group in 1998."
good,management must review the agency they hired if the agency give the benifits well to the workers and if the agency are taking care of the worker well
good,"Senior Manager responsible for Centralised Risk Desk (CRD) technology platform, delivering high quality systematic solutions to maximise trading efficiency to customers, provide production support teams and managing throughout, including coordinating the delivery of consistently superior end-to-end service across regions and functions.  (Managed a team of over 30 Developers and 3 SDMs globally)"
good,"Very routine duties on a daily basis, but my team mates always had a smile on their face. Learned that financial institutions changed daily when dealing with bankruptcy rules. The hardest part of the job is keeping up with all the changes and when they took affect."
good,I enjoyed my co-workers and I was very impressed with the willingness to help each other. The work was never boring as there were daily changes to the process which required attention to detail. My training in default mortgage was extensive. We all had daily goals to meet which made the day fly by.
good,This was a horrible job listening to people who were about to lose their home. I had to try to get them caught up. People 6 months behind were required to make all 6 payments.
good,"The company is more about the money and themselves and not really caring about their employees. They removed a whole divisions bonus on the drop of a dime, to appease the company shareholders and improve their stock value"
good,No platform for you to move up into Management.  Very little diversity seen in Management.  Strategies seemed to change from month to month.  No consistency
good,"A typical day at work was reviewing new web design assignments.  Then distributed to the web design team.  Answered various questions from meeting event planners about attendee reports, event name badges, meeting and event tracking system."
good,I learned a lot of great skills at Citi. It's a place which allows a lot of opportunity as long as your willing to take the risk.
good,"Its An ""Okay"" Work Environment. The Co-Workers Are Nonchalant. Its Not A Hard Nor An Easy Part Of This Job"
good,"A typical day is signing on to your workstation and calling your portfolio of 100 or more accounts and helping home owners find a solution to get them out of default. "
good,"Pessoas dispostas,Ambiente agradável,Equipe de trabalho"
good,"Learning and career advancement."
good,"Good company to work for."
good,"Worked as an Office Assistant with the Office Manager ; worked at the front desk. Greeting walk-in clients and answering the phones and taking messages and other clerical duties. Worked for 5 years until company downsized. It was my first job in the financial Industry, learned a lot about the industry and enjoyed working there with my co-workers."
good,Management lacks professionalism and the company is laying off on a regular basis.
good,"A typical day at work consist of reconcile cash and portfolio holdings, record corporate actions and ensured accurate fund records through reconciliation's and reporting."
good,A typical day at Citi-financial as a lender while the economy struggles is not easy to do. I ensure that all the collections under my portfolio were done accurately keeping in mind ethic and professionalism while conversing with customer in regards to their troubles and/or options. The hardest part about this job was convincing the customer that on a struggling economy they could get a high interest loan to cover and contain their unique situation under control as well as making sure that customer understand the importance of insuring the debt so the customers has a piece of mind if the struggling economy take a toll on their jobs. The most enjoyable part of my job is keeping in touch with my customers and make sure that all their needs are being taken care off even after they have accepted the loan terms.
good,"Claims to be Customer Centric but penalizes employees for taking care of clients' needs over selling. At the end of the day, it does not matter how many pleased customers you have if no ""numbers"" came in."
good,I started atthe bottom as they say. A teller. Then moved up to a personal banker. This bank always tryies to run before they can walk. The things they do not make sense. It was a great company when I was a teller but then became a bank for the rich. They want and want but don't give back.
good,"The call center atmoshpere can become a bit depressing. You are bound by four walls, then your cubical which is three to four walls closing in on you. Just like with any major corporation you are expected to act and live as tho you are a robot, i.e. no feelings, no mishaps, show up to work even if you are in a body bag. Oh and don't forget your proof to be excused."
good,Citigold was a good program once but now has a lot of draw backs. Cut throat between regular bankers and Citigold bankers. Branch managers constantly fighting for new money balances. Overall not the best
good,"good benefits, but work is stressful and unfulfilling. Management is passive aggressive. THey lay off people with little warning. THey will say everything is ok until it isn't"
good,"Lots of trash people.  Mgmt is mostly total garbage and they do everything in the dumbest way possible.  Salaries vary wildly and neither they nor pitiful bonuses are merit-based.  No one really gets to travel and no one really gets to train.  "
good,Managers do nothing but care about metrics. Employees' abilities mean nothing in the work environment and leadership does not take feedback into consideration. The company is great and offers amazing benefits and compensation but choose your job carefully.
good,"Good,"
good,"When I started at Citi, they did a lot of interactions with the staff, since the mortgage piece is no longer a part of the company, they don't appreciate the staff. Most of the management staff is not good. this company only bases advancement off of who you know."
good,"It’s been so long since I worked there, I can’t really give a fair & honest  review. I do remember it was stressful & I had to travel a long distance to work; I eventually moved out of state."
good,"Favoritism, have to be part of a click, back stabbing, yelling customers. If you don't met your numbers your put on a PIP plan then fired. No room for advancement, pay is okay, basic call center environment and a lot of stress."
good,"-Good workplace"
good,A constant revolving door of incoming and outgoing employees depending on the department and.or project you are working on.  Job security is non-existent.
good,"No career advancement , no bonus and low pay for administrative staff. Most admins work long hours and don’t get credit for their work and their mgrs complain about working overtime which is incorporated in comp."
good,It is stressful to work in Citibank .We have monthly releases and the environment is political.The learning curve is good for the new technologies. Good for new comers.
good,"This was my first job that stated back in 1996, the company has goon through so many changes. No longer in contact with any staff or employees. Being a fraud analyst was easy and enjoyable."
good,"Long working days, company hires unqualified personnel.  Management is not properly trained to handle client concerns and needs. There is little to no work-life balance, their bonus structure is very hard to achieve."
good,Manager is a tyrant. focus is on the wrong issues. spends too much time micro-managing the smallest of projects; which looses focus on immediate and more important projects. Management style is quite all over the place.
good,"After almost 2 decades, the company is still trying to integrate from mergers and acquisitions from the 90's.  Their technology is primitive and costly."
good,Competitive atmosphere with a lack of positive culture. Training is severely lacking to support the needs of the business. Organization is disjointed in many areas which causes internal departments to be siloed.
good,They work you to the bone and expect more then you can deliver. Management never had your back and asked you to do things that seemed unethical in my book.
good,"Too much manual workload and abusive management..."
good,"The company is too large to work cohesively and productively in a single direction.  Fairly regularly, different departments will issue conflicting policies and directives.  "
good,"great culture, free lunches, lots of fun activities outside of work. Great people, had a very nice manager who they interacted a lot with the employees on a daily basis."
good,Working in citi bank is prodcutive learned many things over here learned actually how corporate works benefits and culture how an organissation works. Learned how to communicate with business
good,It was very difficult in the retention department I worked in to try and keep accounts open when we were still in the middle of the credit crisis and people didn't was in the middle of the  credit crisis
good,"You have to know how to multi-task. If you can do that then you can get the job done. I was very good as a teller, always attentive and ready to help whether it was the managers, employees, or customers/clients."
good,"Supportive and good place to work if you like high pressurised environment. Like any organisation has both good and bad parts  and on balance, this is quite a reasonable place to work."
good,No proper handling of its own employees - medical leaves are also counted in their Annual leaves - treated as PRODUCTS SOLD and no treatment like their own staff
good,fiquei decepcionado com a forma que o RH trata suas contratações
good,"Senior Managers are very nice although most leads are horrible, career growth quite stunted for full-time employees (may your lord bless you if you're a consultant), if there is a vendor involved like infosys/tcs/l&t you're better off quitting and working at McDonalds. Least pay but usual casual job environment. Workplace culture? LOL"
good,"I like the job and dealt with co-workers accordingly. The job is not hard but compliance have spurs stuck up the you know what. And the people I work with are diverse people, and you will deal with different cultures, and that is a plus in Albuquerque. The pay all depends on you and how much you put into your work."
good,This company offered no growth and or stability after being there for 2 years the company closed down. The training wasnt up to standard and the management wasnt professional at all.
good,"I only worked for City bank for 1 year and about 9 months and was retrenched. I don't have much to say as I was retrenched after such a short time , was not given any time to prove myself on any level"
good,"It was a better place before, now it sucks to work there. All branches are short staff and branch manager suffer of a lot of stress because of that. massive amount of work, eliminated assistant branch manager so now as a Branch manager you are not longer able to focus on sales, but to focus on operation etc."
good,I went from full time to part time to getting laid off after almost 8years of service the only plus side was the benefits package like vacation time and paid holiday's. I was always nominated for too runner and won a lot if awards for being too runner exceeding the daily numbers of payments processed.
good,"Not a good company to work for.  That is why it was sold to TD Bank.  Management and employees were not professional, and work/life balance wasn't there."
good,i learned how to work under pressure in this company. management was professionally good. i learnt to be professional too in the workplace.
good,"I get in early before the branch open so I can get emails done and if there is any training  I would take it before the bank start, then get ready to help our customer. The hardest part of my job was too much turnover and I have to work with new boss every other year!!"
good,This company needs to improve on its management. The company itself  trains you well for the work. But for the most part employees retention is very low.
good,"I learned a tremendous amount about Anti Money Laundering from analyst and a quality assurance perspective. Specific scenarios to monitor, what triggers the need for additional review and how to properly mitigate risk to the bank."
good,"Your experience at Citi could be very pleasant if you are in the right group, but not every group is created equally. Management will definitely impact your happiness and chances for success."
good,"Human Resources cut back English program for all but the highest level employees  after crisis of 2009"
good,"in the 10 years that I have worked here I have had more grief and lack of direction than any other job I have had. There is little opportunity for advancement and job security is sketchy at best. "
good,Great organization with plenty of growth. Had a great time working in New York and a fun atmosphere with great employees.
good,This is a typical investment bank that will work you to the bone. The upside is you learn a tremendous amount and find yourself in a position of responsibility immediately.
good,Citi is a good overall company. It has programs to engage employees. Good work life balance. Not a whole lot of opportunity unless you know someone
good,Managed to make most progress in my recent career; however incentives at work were zero. There's a lot of work to be done and not enough knowledgeable people at workplace.
good,"No room for advancement. Very unstructured. Policies change all the time, managers can't agree on anything. Fast pace. No organization."
good,"Take over the updates of night duty person, Printing reports for Tellers, Attending computer related complaints from different users and solution of issues in timely. Immediate manager was friendly with all the subordinates."
good,Working at CitBank has pleasant work environment and good benefits.
good,hard to review a company i havnt worked for in 9 years. i just remember that they harped on little things. it was little things. lots of cool people though
good,Learn how to oversee the bankruptcy process.  Learned the breach letter default process.
good,The computer work is fun but the idea of being on a clock and everything timed is different atmosphere for me.  Time cannot be anticipated when dealing with a customer over the phone; one can only do what it takes and make sure the customer is satisfied.  I do understand the call center does need a way to judge performance and productivity.  One has to be willing to adjust and learn.  The supervisors are very understanding and supportive.
good,Typical NY Bank Mentality.  Too much finger pointing and getting beat up for 'doing the wrong thing'.  Of course the wrong thing is whatever management deems necessary to keep you from getting a decent review.
good,"It was my first Job and every bit of it was a learing for me."
good,Citibank has a diverse culture in its employees. There are people working there from all walks of life and it makes it enjoyable to come to work everyday.
good,"This position required a high amount of training, Certification and Specialized knowledge. The pressure to perform was immense and the style of micromanaging even in a Work at home environment was punitive at best."
good,"Ambiente  agradável , pessoas dispostas, equipe de trabalho"
good,"The management in general had an undeserved sense of entitlement. They were uneducated and had virtually no idea how to do their job, let alone their subordinates. As a result the work environment was tense. In order to pretend that they knew what they were doing, they would randomly write people up for bizarre infractions like being 1 minute late from break or not taking a lunch. Although the company offered sick time, if you took even one day of sick time, you were ineligible for a raise for  that 12 month cycle."
good,Meet different clients everyday. Offering new products that can benefit their needs. Handling large sums of money. Setting daily goal.
good,"Not a place where you can grow, compensation is low. Managers like to be micromanagers."
good,Traveled with employment and enjoyed the employment place
good,A typical workday would include sitting on a headset connected to an autodialer making outbound calls to customers whom are past due on their credit card bills.I learned how to solve customer issues in a professional manner. The hardest part of the job was collecting money from clients that were in hardships financially. The most enjoyable part of the job was the paycheck.
good,Pay of white counter completing same job getting paid more than the minority race employees.
good,Demanding and excessive sales requirements. Job requirements and compensation do not match up. Always made to feel that you should put the sales before the customer.
good,I have 12 years experience with Citi and its subsidiaries. I have built great work relationships over the years.
good,"The branches are very slow with very few customers. Thebenefits are good but you sometimes work 11-12 hours a day. The compensation was good at first, but they have not given employees a raise in 4 years."
good,A typical day for me starts with a conference call and ends with another call with calls in between. I learned that being a branch manager is rewarding however it can also be very intensive especially with the sales culture. My fellow branch mangers are also on hand to assist when needed in various projects. The hardest part is long hours especially when you have a family waiting at home.
good,With the downfall if the banking system coming Citi is greatly responsible. Based on their actions management has no loyalty to their customers or employees just their fat bonuses.
good,"No work like balance. Expected to do everything at one time. No help. Never leave on time. No full lunch break, always at desk.."
good,It all depends who your manager is whether or not you will be feeling good . It is a US company so expect a very formal way of working. There is a lot of cost cutting which puts stress on your work.
good,It’s stressful and management is poor. No job culture it’s boring place to work. Nothing interesting and no growth career no proper team management...
good,"The AML job itself is great, although there are too many managers who truly don't know or understand what they are doing. There is always room for growth and retraining, but you have to be willing to be taught and accept constructive criticism in order to correct behavior, and have a better experience with your direct reports.  Its sad when your management believe they are liked when people really fear bruising their egos because it will lead to retaliatory behavior.  There is a major disconnect between management and their direct reports..."
good,As it's a commercial finance company filthy languages are on. It's a different cooperate sector. For temporary employees there are no facilities but for permanent staffs they get much better facilities. So I am looking for a permanent job from which I can give my family the support.
good,"It's a lot to do with no benefits for temps at all. And you won't ever be promoted. There are people who been there for years still waiting to be able to become a perm."
good,"Citi is a good place to work, but too much time and resources are wasted during the day, driving away talent. Citi seems to also value outside talent more than internal talent which is discouraging."
good,Citi has great benefits for their employees. They also care about inclusion & diversity. There is not much work life balance in the dept. where I currently work.
good,Salary not competitve. Some people can work remote but most departments can not. Management knows who they are hiring before holding interviews. Average place to work.
good,"Citi as a global whole is varied in culture, which affect individual teams across a vast array of products and services. In my experience in New Castle, DE, Citi failed to live up to the values they espoused."
good,"Company decided to sell servicing rights, eliminating hundreds of jobs. Non par severance packages. If you met goals you were expected to pick up the slack for those that were not,"
good,The environment there was not good.  You were pretty much asked to work 7 days a work and on holidays and would make you feel bad if you didn't.  Very stressful mostly due to the constant pressure from management with very little recognition for your work.  And when you were rewarded it didn't seem genuine at all.
good,"Jobs are never secure, lots of moving around and unanswered questions on merges. They spent money on gifts to there employees and not a lot of raises."
good,El trabajo no es pesado es muy padre se aprende mucho solo que los capacitadores son muy viejos y traen una cultura barroca y no acorde a los cambios contactuales en la cultura laboral aprende el que quiere por que hay reglas de trabajo y lo mas difícil es lo arcaico de los jefes que para mandar les hace falta tacto y que se actualicen no saben en ocasiones ni de que hablan la paga no es muy buena por que la comisión la pagan desfasada  y eso no esta bien despuesde un año segui reclamando mi paga.
good,"Advancement is difficult. It's who you know, not your skills. I wanted out, within two years of working there. They're laying folks almost monthly. Stay away from them."
good,"Still operate under a dark cloud from 2008. Culture did not treat it's people well, capitalizing on services workers had at some to reduce the carbon footrprint in the office and having people work from home without reimbursement of basic services needed to work at home."
good,"Citi is great place to work for the benefits.  The environment not so much. Management is always lacking and not much help.  They don't seem to be interested at all in helping people advance, just in their own personal advancement.  Other employees however are great, you can make great friendships!"
good,"They load you with a bunch of things to do while helping customers at the teller window. Management is very unfair they are constantly firing and hiring people, no communication skills. It feels very much like high school the energy is very off. Its like everyone hates their job. Upper management is even worst. If you are called in to work on your day off because someone else called out and you can not make it be prepared to be coached constantly even for using one sick day. This is the worst company ive worked for thus far I have worked with other banks and I never encountered difficulties in answering customers simple questions."
good,"My experience there was ok depending on the supervisor assigned to me. If you had a good one it was pleasant , when you had a bad one it was not pleasant."
good,I'm working 60 hours a week on the average.  I have never seen so much wastage in an audit position.  Many times management changes direction and this makes it difficult for those of us in the trenches.
good,"Great time off if tenured. Everything outsourced, not necessarily offshore, but even contracted out.  Very political with upper management. 401k isn’t even that great because their stock isn’t great or makeing much money."
good,"Salomon Smith Barney was a v different bank back then.  It was sprawling, too big to manager but not too big to fail.  Lots of waste and fat everywhere, bureaucratic and bloated."
good,"In the department I worked in my manager and co-worker conspired againsyt me and treated me poorly which forced me to resign. I felt racism was a factor, spun as if I was incompetent"
good,"This position was a contract position, with no chance of a permanent upgrade, so the possibilities were very limited. Management was mixed: one of my managers was fair; the other wasn't."
good,工作量不多，但是公司的制度比較混亂，沒有一個指定標準，基層員工難以跟從。公司有健康的work life balance 文化，但沒有好好的宣傳，比較可惜。環境是以office為基礎，沒有太大問題，但是管理較嚴，不允許使用手機，這一點希望可以著情處理。
good,"Citi bought out Cal Fed  which was a personable small bank that valued its employees. Citibank did not-it was a churn and burn mentality. Keep raising the bar from which bonuses were paid until you did not attain them then write you up. Turn over became a real problem to establish consistent positive customer service."
good,"Interesting projects, good technology stack, very long hours, no life-work balance, decent benefits. Not a very employee friendly place, but a place where you can learn new things and move on."
good,"I've worked for Citi for 13 years.I love the people i work with, the relationships I've made and the skills I've learned. Our medical benefits are unmatched. But when it comes to compensation and advancement, you honestly will make more money by coming in off the street than having a long career with the company. They have ""vanity titles"" for roles within the company that don't mean anything if you go somewhere else. A credit underwriter at Citi isn't the same as one at another company, meaning you don't have the same training and are basically unqualified. It's a well known fact that people quit Citi to go somewhere else and then come back within 18 months to get an increase in pay and keep their tenure with the company. People are leaving in flocks because we are tired of being underpaid."
good,I never worked at Citi.  Not sure why this is showing up.  I worked for Shearson Smith Barney which then became Smith Barney many years ago prior to my days at Lehman Brothers
good,"Our hours had to be justified among 3 technicians, that said we had an average of 20 tickets a day to cover 8 hours of work per tech for 3 techs. The other two techs prioritized quick tickets leaving the ones that could take up to 2 hours per machine to me with re-imaging. Each ticket only counts towards one hour of work with insufficient work to cover all our hours I spent many hours in phone calls about justifying time. Beyond that as talking with the end user fixing their issues I learned that I was making less then majority of people on the floor."
good,"Great peers that I worked with. Poor management, everyone has a different answer to every task. A very disorganized workplace. There is no encouragement or a great feedback."
good,"Já faz mais de cinco anos que me desliguei da empresa, portanto não sei como está hoje. Irei descrever como era quando eu trabalhei lá. Por ser um banco privado americano, o capitalismo predatório sempre falava mais alto e passava por cima dos funcionários. Os gerentes precisavam bater metas altas e, para tal, não mediam esforços nem consequências. A rotina era árdua (eu era estagiária, mas trabalhava como secretária dos gerentes de relacionamento e da gerente geral da agência, e realizava atendimentos por telefone e pessoalmente), e nem o meu horário de almoço era respeitado, além de, todos os dias, trabalhar mais horas do que minha carga contratual previa (na época, não existia a lei do estagiário e eu não tinha conhecimento de Direito do Trabalho). Apesar de todo o relato, foi uma experiência intensa e desafiadora. Precisei me encaixar nos moldes da empresa e acredito ter efetuado um bom trabalho. Em pouco tempo, aprendi muito sobre rotinas administrativas e bancárias, amadureci pessoal e profissionalmente, e o período lá possibilitou que novas portas fossem abertas para mim posteriormente."
good,Citi Bank is a wonderful named company.  When I joined initially I had a wonderful yet very stressed out manger in which I couldn't understand the stress until the goals grew to be attainable for myself but not the region in general.  This created a very harsh and non commutative work environment.
good,Too many laid offs. Management is okay to work with. Just do not cross their bad side. It is hard to get move up within the work place. You work hard and sometimes it get overlooked. Offers a lot of OT which is a great thing for some.
good,"I did really well my first year, got promoted and now am stuck in a graveyard shift that I hate. My manager told me that she's not going to release me to work anywhere else in the company and that I will die in the department I work in now."
good,Low pay but great benefits. Management only talks to you when they need something. Co-workers are great as we do try to help each other. Hardest part of the job trying to keep up with all the different systems to be able to reconcile and account.  A typical day at work is waiting on the offshore team to download activity to the sub ledger's which may be duplicated or incorrect. Then researching differences and settlement to partners in a time crunch.
good,"Though there are good managers, nothing is done with the poor communication between management and staff. Too much stress due to job security issues for past 5 years."
good,I really do not wan to do a review of my previous employers.  I do not think it is fair .  I do not have anything to say about my positon with this company
good,"My tenure here has equipped me to be productive and effective in a fast paced working environment.Given a heavy workload each day has , I have maintained the right amount of discipline to provide accurate and on time service. My strong initiative and technical skills combined with my ability to work well under pressure, allow me to play a crucial role in a fast paced client-centered environment."
good,The Jacksonville campus is really nice and has a ton of things we can take advantage of. However it is almost impossible to get a job out of the call center once you start in it. Management turns over relatively frequently and this makes me concerned about building a career here.
good,"I would not recommend working at Citi group to anyone, based on my experience there."
good,I was worked during the recession and times were very tough. We were constantly worried bout loosing our jobs when stocks were at $1.25 per share. Management was ok
good,"Productive and fun loving place, however work life balance is not good and always pressure of work. Nevertheless you en cash your time spent in the company."
good,Great benefits and pay structure however the company has serious management issues and the culture is very typical of a politically influenced hierarchy.
good,"Very poor management and no room for advancement,  they make you feel they are better than you and they talk about employees on the floor. There is no confidentiality."
good,"Senior Mgmt is very unprofessional, lacking business acumen and general knowledge of work being completed in office."
good,"Very unmotivating; peers advance despite not exceeding expectations. Due to employees having various managers, all expectations are not set to a same standard.  "
good,Citibank is a huge financiel intitute in pakistan. I was start my job as a sales officer and product is laibelities loan in all over the karachi city.
good,"Manager give proper and suitable motivation to staff, know the basic of process housing loan, how to process housing loan. The most enjoyable part of this job is invited by boss for drinks. The hardest part is high target set by company hard to achieve every month."
good,"They time your bathroom breaks, do you know how awkward it is to have to tell your manager every time you went to the bathroom."
good,We processed government documents and were required to have a 24 hour turnaround on all documents. It was hard work but rewarding when you met the deadline. The culture of the building has changed tremendously and has went downhill. They let go of all the great leaders in 2014 and only have Managers left. If you are good at conforming and just doing what your told it is a great place to work.
good,Management not flexible to new ideas. Rigid organizational structure. I was working as a contractor so didn't have much of a say.
good,"Management NEVER gives one word of praise, It is all negative feed back. Work schedule is crazy and changes from week to week."
good,An average day at work consists of 100 solicit telephone calls and 100 collection calls. I do not find the job very stimulating
good,"Not consistent management.  Decent place to work. Very long hours. Lots of bureaucracy and re organizations."
good,Coworkers were young and a bit inexperienced at the customer service level. The hardest part was calling to report fraud and being suspected of being a con artist.
good,The management team expects you to learn from other employees and most are not available when needed.  I had 3 managers and could ask the same question to each but receive 3 different answers.  Upper management does not understand that this position was a unique position and could not be put inside the box.
good,fast paced yet friendly environment. it was a great learning experience. and I gain valuable learning tools for future jobs
good,Job was ok didn't really enjoy it. paid the bills. I worked their part time. Customers were mainly people who worked in the building.
good,After 21 years you have to make the best of any situation. The team  varied from location to location. Getting used to each location was as challenging as the job. But overall it was a good experience.
good,"I fell like it can be more room for advancement, and hours can be better for us to be here,also communication to employees also."
good,"Work timings flexibility ,Good place to work, Slow movement of roles, work from home facility. but the management is a lil stringent"
good,"Como Gestor de Tarjetas VISA teníamos una Cartera de Clientes que teníamos que llamar cada día, dependiendo de la deuda se les llamaba con más acritud o menos."
good,"Attended to bucket of cases."
good,"My day was busy helping people who had fraud on their accounts and in some cases identity theft, my job was to guide them to what to do next in the fraud process, "
good,"I loved my work. I would call clients, banks, hotels, car rental companies etc to try ton figure out what happened and why my customer was disputing charges. I am very knowledgeable in the dispute process and trained our employees."
good,This was a good job with several opportunities to advance and learn new things. the management all depends on the department but higher management was exceptional. the best part of the job was meeting new people on all different paths of life. wonderful place for customer service interaction.
good,"The company overall can be a great place to work for, however, it is also hard to advance within the company due to position availability and favoritism. "
good,"Citibank is going through a lot of changes right now. They are closing branches, reducing hours and laying people off. Not sure they know which direction they are going."
good,"The pressure is high, where as the salary is very less and no other benifits."
good,They say you will get a bonus for making sales but they will find any excuse to say you did not meet the requirements.
good,This company had the worst managers I have ever worked for in my entire career.
good,A typical day at work is getting the work done before the shift is over. I learned that working in a big workplace you have people that work with  you that have different personbalities and people switch up on how they are feeling everyday. I worked for a temporary agency so the managers really don't care if you stay or leave because we all have to leave sooner or later. The hardest part of the day is trying to get through the day with no work and trying to stretch the day without having to leave. The most fun part at work is being able to work with friends and new people to make time go faster.
good,its good but I am looking my career to go ahead on top.. but here the growth is very slow so that's why I am looking for change
good,the work environment was pleasant and professional the managers and co workers were very friendly and helpful
good,"The company reputation and benefits are good however the AML department fails to provide its employees with the appropriate work life balance. Caseloads are impossible to complete due to an extreme shortage in staff and management has consistently failed to develop methods to provide incentives to keep their employees' job satisfaction ratings satisfactory. The company has developed a new hiring model which brings only temporary workers into the department as an attempt to alleviate the shortage in staff and the inability to meet the 30 day service level agreement but this has resulted in the hiring of inexperienced analysts who are quickly and POORLY trained and puts a stress on the more tenured analysts. "
good,The company chooses your schedule without much concern to the employee and their needs outside of work.
good,"I worked a 7:00-4:00 schedule manage my own work however their were daily reports guiding us on pass due calls, loans that haven't closed, etc. The management was not micromanage they tended to keep to themselves and not come out unless it was urgent. My co-workers were kind very helpful. The hardest part of my job was mostly when vacation was taken or sick time no one covered anybody. Most enjoyable has to be the work environment very laid back but always working."
good,I learned a lot about finance and how different products can be helpful for clients. Helped build my customer service skills. The coworkers for the most part work well together except for a couple but the job became too stressful with every move you make and different rules that came along with everything. Everything became monitored and criticized almost setting up for failure.
good,"Constant customer service and needed to motivate teller to do their job to meet the goal of the branch. I have learned to keep focus and attend to customers no matter what they need and also cross sales products. M co-workers are very competitive, but I always accomplish my goal that they gave me."
good,"Tons of layoffs.  No rewards, bonuses, raises, promotions.  Terrible."
good,I use to really love going to work for the first couple of years with this company until everything drastically changed for the worse!
good,"Big company , but they don't look at you work ,Senior management are rude and they expect you to be nice with the clients"
good,"As a third party accounting administrator to hedge funds, we prepare daily reconciliations, month end NAV packs, and year-end financials."
good,Great company to work for.
good,It is a good place to work if you like working from home. Taking phone calls
good,CitiGroup is an excellent company to work for. They are however going through a lot changes within the department which make for an unstable and ever changing environment. The volume will definitely keep you busy but the processes still need to be streamlined. There is no work/life balance; this company will consume your time.
good,Diverse organization with great focus on Women in Business
good,long hours dealing with all sorts of individuals. fast-paced and always need tons of energy and provide great customer service.
good,A instituição por ser global é muito boa entretanto tem areas operacionais que nao valorizam a pessoa e sim apenas numeros. Isso é ruim na empresa no geral é uma empresa otima para se trabalhar.
good,Dont pay you enough and expect so much out of you. Hours are not that bad. Tons of micromanaging.
good,Typical day at work was very jam packed with work with little to no guidance from management but high standards. Management often times did not give good guidance on what they were looking for but expected perfection.
good,The days are busy. The work groups are cooperative and friendly.
good,it was a good company to start call center career to get experience. the company started good but turn bad once employees started getting fired due to poor collections goal. there was no programs to help customers get current on accounts.
good,"Pro- I had fun working at Citi I was their for 14 years.  I had a lot of opportunities to move around and learn new skills.  Management staff was just ok. I suggest if your just graduating from collage that you add Citi to your resume but I wouldn't stay longer then 5 years."
good,Good benefits.  pay should be a lot more. rude customers. Be prepared you will be on the phone 8 hours a day. They constantly made you feel like they didn’t need you there. They would change your shift for their convenience.
good,"When I first started with Citibank, I had a really great supervisor who was very knowledgeable. He taught me a lot about the financial industry and supported me during my time there."
good,As my career progressed you were expected to work longer hours but annual comp decreased.  I was lucky enough though to work with some amazing people.
good,"Management was not very good to say the least. I liked the benefit package that was offered, and the paternity leave was great. The schedules were not great in my department, most departments had holidays and weekends off and mine did not. Overall performance does not give you a better chance to promote or take on the leadership roles when available. Favoritism plays a big part in the fraud department, I cannot speak on other departments."
good,"I loved my team, The pay was great, Management needed to work out some kinks. There was a lot of over turn in management team, Our team was left without guidance. Some team leads were unchecked bullies."
good,"I liked working there, until I didn't. Open seating is horrible when you take meetings all day.  Management either micro managed or let you roam freely, there was no middle ground."
good,Lack vision and want to make the financial investment to be great. Poor at listening to the employees on the issues and slow to adjust if any adjustment made.
good,"Management doesnt care about anything accept your ""product"" sales. This means selling different insurance policies on the loan or a home and auto bundle to jack-up the total loan amount so the ridiculously high interest rate is applied to a larger total. And they significantly pressure you. In some situations you're just left feeling slimey."
good,"I  worked for 30 years at Citi in SFSD. "
good,"My banking history  began with this company.  While they provided me a opportunity in banking, it was in sales in which today (15 years later) I would chose not to go back into.  Upward mobility was difficult and my management was not supportive in the employee, but in how ""widgets"" were sold on a daily basis."
good,"When I initially applied for this job I thought it was going to be a stepping stone into a career at a company with lots of advancement opportunities. After some time there I realized that Citi is not all that it is cracked up to be. The job is less than spectacular with the majority of the calls you are taking coming from rude and mean people who will yell at you, curse at you, and make your job difficult all while you are trying to quickly figure out their problem and get it resolved. To add to the stress, everything you do is timed, and I do mean everything. They time how long your call handle time is, how long it takes you to wrap up the call afterwords, they even time how long you take to go to the bathroom. And if they don't like how long it takes you to do your job regardless of how accurate you are and you get the job done right, they fail your calls. "
good,I worked with the company for 7 years until I decided to leave. There was growth within the company but it was very limited. The benefits were great but were not enough for me to want to stick around.
good,flexibility is great however it has its up and downs. Citi offer's great benefits to their employees and alot of different perks. Only downside is the micromanaging.
good,"A typical day at Smith Barney was a minimum of 10 hours cold calling.  Training and educating was not a big part of employee development, the sales numbers were the most important piece."
good,Opportunities for growth is limited and depends on the business unit.  Management focus on career development for employees is limited.  Huge mismatch in Compensation vs Expectations.
good,Citi is great company to work for. They do give you a lot of work and there is a lot of pressure to do multiple things at once and they expect you to not have any question about doing so.
good,"a typical day at work, management treats the staff like a school going children, overtime not considered, hard work not recognized , no appreciation at work."
good,This place was an ok place to work. Young group of people and they dont care. They call in and quit and care less.`Management even was the same very unprofessional
good,"Great, caring coworkers at all level customer facing levels but company has extreme top-down management style. Senior management sets impossible expectations with tools to meet success and then berates staff for not meeting expectations. Customer facing employees are presented with constant issues self inflicted by misdirected or poorly implemented company policy or by non-reachable back office personnel. There are few opportunities for advancement outside of NY and salary is relatively static. Sales culture is mostly ethical. Majority of people in company have best intent, but it is often lost in company created convoluted delivery."
good,"I have worked for this company for 19 years in total.  And I can tell you with absolute certainty is upper management, directors, all the way up to the CEO does not like to be told what to do.  They will hire from outside of the bank to get the advantage on something they need, but will not listen to one iota of the advice given so they can do it their way."
good,"Citi is a great place for learning, as it allows its employees to take on as much responsibility as desired. It is also a highly structured organization, often times riddled by impeding bureaucracy and nepotism. Its remuneration is one of the least competitive among major global banks."
good,"Participe de la creacion de una empresa desde cero y ademas de una sistema desde cero, pero eso devengo en querer cambiar por otro tipo de trabajo"
good,"Overall Citi is a decent place to work, its easy and friendly environment. The issue with the job is that overtime everything is very robotic, nothing really changes. You feel brain dead doing the same job day in day out. Managers can vary some being very nice and easy going, while others are strict and by the book. The HARDEST part of this job is career advancement. Theres little opportunity for growth within the company, often times favouritism is employed when new opening come up. Another negative is the very high employee turn over.  One of the worst parts about this job is its nearly impossible to get a day off, theres like zero flexibility at all when it comes to booking vacation. The nice part about working at Citi is the job itself is easy and very accessible area, lots of parking, diverse culture of people."
good,"Fue una multinacional muy grande en la que era posible cambiar de puesto y aprender mucho sobre diferentes temas, con posibilidades de ascenso."
good,"Citigroup as a whole is a great company. Prior to my current position I loved everyday, worked with fantastic people and never dreaded coming into work. Dealing with a mirco-manager is the biggest hangup for me currently and one that makes it difficult for you to seek other employment within the company."
good,Citi helped me to advance to further heights in my role as a customer service agent. The management was very understanding and sensitive to my needs. I really enjoyed the people and the management.
good,"A typical day would include conciliation of trade volumes, reconciliation of dealer errors, passing write-off charges, passing central bank charges (Dubai&Bahrain), passing customer dividend payments, manual settlement of customer FX deals. I've learned a lot, but it wasn't taught the processes properly."
good,Train and coached teller.   Oversee daily teller transactions.  Loaded ATM machines and balance them out.  Perform teller duties whenever needed.  Assist managers with customers etc.
good,"We have fun days and outings with co workers. Birthdays are celebrated. Retirement celebrations and we have Christmas parties. I actually like working for Citi however, there's no room for advancement."
good,Its a good place to work.  I learned a lot of new things.  Its helping to grow as a professional.  I have very good experiences here.   My co-workers are very friendly.
good,"The management team was lacking. Many of the managers were placed in positions that they were not prepared or qualified for. The lack of strong management led to poor employee morale. Employees were not developed or mentored but rather left to learn things on their own. "
good,"The flexibility was great as it allowed you to care for home life situations that would occur and your job at the same time. You were able to makeup your time. This was great especially since I have two elementary children. "
good,"Citi is a good company very diverse, telephone customer service is not hard work and the benefits are good but does not offer much in job advancement or intellectual stimulation"
good,"The pay was great, the managers were great except the last one.  Cell phones were allowed out on the call floor. For the most part of it, the atmosphere was more relaxed. Wearing jeans was appropriate."
good,"This company has great benefits and paid vacation time. However, the pay is not great. It is difficult at best to get a raise, as they skew your numbers so they don't have to give you one. That also makes it impossible for you to apply for other positions or promotions. The departments and pay do not reflect fairly for the job duties. If this is a first job or you need a job just to pay the bills until you can find something else it's great. However, if you have any kind of experience you will get bored and frustrated as it is a dead end."
good,"A role in Middle Office at Citigroup serves as a small piece in a large machine. Work effectiveness is largely dependent on effective management which is hit or miss depending on the desk you get assigned to. there is a fundamental lack of understanding of the day to day operations by management which inhibits there ability to make effective decisions. Largest inadequacy is the technology in the Operations departments. However, with the company being so large it is a place that you can take advantage of interdepartmental role changes."
good,"Citi is all about multi tasking which will help you to discover the best in you (or the worst).  The work is something you could be proud of.  It gives you opportunity to travel the world without leaving your cubicle.  Citi does not have time cards, which is good because traffic is really bad.  The Health card is top of the line.  Retirement? Yes, Citi have a decent retirement plan for all its employees."
good,Front desk customer service to maintain all the records and delivering the credit cards those who are directly to bank. I was handling customer service for Higher Clients.
good,"flex hjours"
good,I've been told on several occasions by management nonetheless that promotions are not about how well you do your job it is about who you know.  This is not a good thing for introverted people because most are not comfortable with being in the spotlight. Citi should promote based off of work ethic and competency verses nepotism and friendship.
good,Production based work environment. Fast paced work place. Call center setting. Great medical and dental insurance prices and benefits. Very generous mount of paid time off.
good,"A empresa propõe a oportunidades a jovens, ganhando conhecimento e prepara para o futuro."
good,Fast paced environment overloaded with multiple task. Took a while to improve overall process to minimize manual workload.  Work assignment was not distributed fairly nor added additional staff to ease up the workload.
good,This is a good place to learn and grow your skill set. Overall it's a good place to work as long as you can move around and experience different jobs within the firm.
good,"Lost drive for innovation over the last few years.  After some senior management left, we're just in a mode of ensuring there's no issues/outages, but not expanding or innovating"
good,"The pay and benefits keep you going to work but the environment is unorganized, unprofessional,  and favoritism at an all time high. I have never worked in such a high school atmosphere. Great employees with exceptional work ethic are overlooked for advancement for unqualified people."
good,"Top Manager was assigned to section, but did not understand the business line, Lower level managers got away with everything. If you showed profits, you were a king, if not, you were shown the door."
good,"You are fully responsibile on your task and you need to do what you need to do to reach your goal which is the department and company ultimate goal. No ONE will be there to push you,remind you except yourself."
good,"okay so i had times i enjoyed working at citibank, but due to lack of rule enforcement and being overworked art times it is just a job that made me not like coming in to work for after awhile. Citibank has let me down countless times not due to the people i knew or worked with, but because what was expected of you. it feels like you're the equivalent of the person that scans items at checkout in a c-town but the banking version. being a teller is just about making sure you give people their money and knowing about the companies policies and what to tell the clients. theres nothing to really look forward to. i was paid 14 starting and thats not bad for one of my first jobs out of highschool but after working there a year it quickly became a lifeless job with the same rinse and repeat withdraw and deposit jargan the most enjoyable part was balancing out at the end of the day and signing the paper that showed you had no differences tbh."
good,The management is not very competent.  Various organizations do not collaborate. It is difficult to get information from outside your organization. Also there is scope of improvement in the area of communication between various organizations
good,"Did not enjoy the environment, long work hours and the expectation to work weekend and holidays as well as only 10% of my skill sets where being utilized."
good,Worked in the A&D Investment banking group. Long hours. They give solid base salary but bonuses were not even half of what they said it would be. Most people in my group left within a span of 1-2 years since they'd stay for a bonus cycle and see how short-changed they were.
good,I got to travel and write procedures but I also had to run my department due to managers never stayed and i did not get compensated for that i loved it when it was sears but when citi took over i was job displaced twice
good,"too much emphasis on quota, not enough quality training, management needs additional training, stressful, not enough support from upper management, pay is too low"
good,"Citi used to be a wonderful place to work, great management, incentives, and appreciation for a job well done.  Over the years, the ""mood"" slowly but steadily diminished, managers did not show any appreciation to the staff, moral continued to drop, so very sad to watch and experience the steady decline!"
good,I was laid off in 2009 in A massive layoff nationwide layoff. I would not return to such A large corporation . Over all the work environment was ok Citi  was A nice place to work.
good,Citibank is different and can be difficult to work for as no management support. Always Changing to increase  Customer Care but no depth process for support when an unknown circumstance would arise.
good,ok job wish they paid more than what they did. I did sales which was nearly impossible to receive payout. The benefits were good the management was willing and the culture was decent hours were sorry and so was the compensation
good,Citi was a cut throat place to work and the people that you worked with were very competitive. Sometimes that is a good thing but the way they would do it was not it was very mean and nasty about things and that is what i did not like about Citi.
good,too much workload. no engagement activities. worklife balance is compromised. its better for the management to sit down and have some time with the team to talk about work aspects
good,"see above,pls."
good,"Typical call center job. The managers don't do anything but sit in their office on the computer or chatting.  They delegate their work so they don't have much to do.  Managers never walk the floor to see whats really going on and don't offer extra training or cross training with other departments even though they say that they do."
good,"understaffed and nobody seems to want to speak up about changes needed. Poor management & poor work/life balance for employees. I used to work 6 days a week, open to close for 5 years, and couldn't even schedule ONE day of my 3+ weeks worth of vacation."
good,"Work life balance is missing in my life. there is only work if your working for 12 hours a day, there is is still no appreciation from management."
good,"Needs lots of improvement and better promotion rate. Training was okay, the trainer was the best. The management is where it need the most improvement, the managers are unhappy and have no care for the employees, everyone is underpaid and overworked."
good,"There is no work life balance & the people need to slog everyday."
good,"Learned a lot with this company"
good,"Best training (initial, and recurrent) you could ask for.  Management for the most part is good.  Most problems working here revolve around no stability.  Can be laid off at any time with no warning.  At that point no one cares about you.  Hardest part of job is uncertainty of position and no advancement.  Company preaches life balance and teamwork, etc but in reality its hit your numbers and turns and if you have time for a life ok.  If not we don't care make it happen.  Funny working for a company with so much training and compliance yet the executives keep causing the company to pay millions in fines each year.  Gave a 3 stars because of the training."
good,"One of the best places I have worked in regards to management however, pay isn't great and it is a dying industry. With most things going electronic, many jobs have been lost as payment process buildings are becoming a thing of the past."
good,"Corporate banking at Citi, while a demanding job, offers limited growth both in terms of job profile and salary. The geographical mobility in terms on international mobility is limited. That being said, Citi has some of the smartest people in the corporate banking industry."
good,"Great place to work for shot-term. Co-workers are friendly and can become like family. Break are short, stress is high and Management are trained to keep a turn over. Average work term is 1-2 years then they want new hires. If you are lucky enough to be there 15 years plus you know your days are numbered because you are now making too much and they need to find a way to get rid of you so they can replace you with a lower paid employee. Watched co-workers and Managers lose jobs they had for years because they needed to show a profit and employees are just numbers to be replaced."
good,"I could see how the company lost money, we would have temps working constantly to fill seats even though there were many in our group who weren't assigned any work. There were fun events for the employees."
good,"I have never worked for a company that feels like working with my family. In the good sense. :-)We all work hard and are recognized for doing so "
good,If you work hard and prove that you are a hard worker you will be given more work to do and no reward for your hard work. You can work hard and help others out and and at no given moment your job could be eliminated and sent over seas at any given time.
good,"Mortgage is leaving. Unless you go into AML on the banking side, jobs are very limited and not guaranteed to last. Very selective on promotion of hard workers."
good,Not a very good job. Great if you are young and don't know any better. Bonus structure leaves a lot to be desired. The computer system is basically a series of kludges built one on top of the other and pathetically fails daily.
good,"I worked here about 12 years ago as a contractor, back then the compensation was way too low compared to the industry, it was a short project though but the weather in FL was awesome."
good,Work life balance is not good and resources are limited.  Company needs to invest in technology and process improvement.   Business objectives and cost discipline are priorities.
good,"The company provided some help when needed. A bit more organization would bring the company closer to perfection. My coworkers always tried their best to keep us all as one. I learned to do wire transfers, how to verify funds & how to sell credit. I had to sell products like mortgages, home equity loans, personal loans and credit cards. I enjoyed the love that the clients would come in with regardless of their personal problems."
good,"Working environment is good where all the staffs have strong team work. The people are fun loving. However, the nature of the work entails having an oversight of the outsourced partner."
good,Citi is becoming too political and top heavy restricting and hindering personal productivity and advancement. the atmosphere around the firm is deteriorating at a significant rate making you watch over your shoulder all of the time
good,great work environment to gain banking experience. Heavy call center work will be where you'll work the hardest but it is also very rewarding to help members with all of their banking needs.
good,They take the VOE surveys very seriously which is a good thing. Mobility to non-US locations is encouraged - good opportunity for those who can be mobile.
good,"It has been some time since I have worked with Citi and when I worked in Auto department, I can say it was great. Good life work balance, managers and co-workers. Then Citi sold it to Santander, and once that happened I left the company"
good,"Pretty good steady and stable work environment. Usually overtime available which is a great opportunity to make additional money. At times it is difficult to maintain a work/life balance due to workload. There is a limited room for advance.Overall, not a bad overall experience"
good,"1. Good place to explore"
good,"a typical day at work was fun, productive & i enjoyed meeting new people . i was introduce to member services department and red mailing which i enjoyed the most."
good,"I have an experience in HR Operations of 2.5 years"
good,"If you like being held to strict and unreasonable expectations, this is the job for you, but they're a growing company with potential to get their stuff together"
good,most organizations are keeping up with current technology and I have seen slowness with this organization which is mostly driven by management.
good,Very up beat. They like to motivate there staff so that they have fun in the office and close loans and help people budget better if they can help.
good,"There salary is not suitable in our daily needs, but make our works done early before the deadline. When somebody resigned, they make laugh of them or talk about them."
good,"It was a good experience getting to learn the processes. However, the work environment was not good, and management did not seem to want to fix any of the issues."
good,"A typical day at Citi would be bringing in mail, scanning each and every piece as they would at UPS or FedEx, you could be sitting or standing all day depending on what they want you to do in the building. toy are viewing information from customers/clients to make sure they are well up to date and all information is correct before sending it back to the customers."
good,Great benefits and flexible schedule. New jobs are brought to this location then outsourced to offshore. My job was eliminated after working for the company for over 10 years.
good,"Fat pace environment, but interesting. All about the numbers and with very monotonous tasks. In there, you have the chance to leran new and interesting things."
good,Busy all the time but it was a fun environment to work in learned a lot about underwriting and loan structure. Co-workers were friendly and nice for the most part. Management was really nice.
good,"hard core sales profile will never let you stay calm or enjoy your worklife."
good,Need to improve management's awareness of employees welfare. Employees should be given proper guidance and equip with the proper training primarily on soft skills
good,Decent startimg job with decent benefits.Management needs to be changed should promote more from within. Pay is decent
good,At the Record Center in O'Fallon - Locked in Vault all day to review Mortgage Documents for File Review for which Citi was Custodian for on Mortgages.
good,Citibank is undergoing a large transformation in it's staffing structure which has made job stability questionable for many employees. The branches run very slim on employees and the work load is heavy. Balancing personal life and work is difficult under the new structure.
good,"It is very challenging to work at organization of a size of Citi. Having global presence, dealing with diverse departments and team members with variety of cultural back-ground. All that just adds lot of excitement of accomplishing some thing big. Opportunity do exist, however budgetary constraint and frequent change in management leads to lack of consistent direction and lack of job satisfaction."
good,"it is a friendly environment but you do not have time to be with your family as we worked from 8:00 until late at night (sometime until 1 or 2:00 am)."
good,"This company doesn't mean harm to their employees, but their way of going about things definitely show otherwise. Its really difficult to move up when they have these ridiculous surveys thats customers take, and have horrible ratings for. "
good,very pressure job in which you need to search/look for a client everyday in all listed companies in citi bank that will suit on credit cards and loan application.
good,"Small group of people help each other and feel very comfortable working in the office. I was working alone in chafe of Tokyo desk. We have several clients in Tokyo, Singapore, London, NY. We have 24 hours operation coordinated with Tokyo, London and Chicago office. "
good,Other than working in the restauraunt industry this was really my first 9-5 job and was a lot of adapting to get used to.  It did give me hand on call center experience to further my business career which I value.
good,"Embora a Empresa tenha uma filosofia de trabalho apenas com vista nos objectivos e não tenha grande consideração pelo trabalhador, o ambiente de trabalho era óptimo maioritariamente devido à camaradagem existente entre os colaboradores"
good,"I worked there when the pay was very competitive and bonus potential was excellent.  Starting in 2007-2008, they started cutting costs in any way possible.  Benefits got more and more expensive while covering less and having much higher deductibles.  Raises were always only annual but they weren't even keeping up with the cost of living.  They would make excuses about how they did market research based on what other companies in similar industries were paying but that research must have been based on starting pay.  Bonus structure changed and the potential for a good bonus became much less likely.  The advancement opportunities were a joke.  The people that typically got promoted were people who sucked at their existing positions but some people in upper management really liked their brown-nosing abilities."
good,"The people are great and the work is easy but, the days are long and boring."
good,"Typical day consists of routine client contact and account reviews as well as client emergencies, updates, and assistance. Use of several systems to help assist clients and manage accounts. Interaction with treasury departments, internal operation and systems teams, and upper management on a daily basis. Must also be comfortable with working with international teams and clients."
good,Had a great experience while I was employeed. Co workers were awesome. only bad part was it was in a basement without windows.
good,"great team players, management worked well and helped resolve issues"
good,There is very little growth from a career perspective within Citi Private Bank Technology group
good,took inbound calls to enroll customers in annunally benefits .
good,"A typical day at work.  Trying to help customers (internal Citi employees) who had problems related to their access that was requested wrong.  Customers who requested the wrong access (their mangers were no help), and due to auditors who are not in the IT field, they set policy that we were forced to grant the wrong access since the employees manager blindly approves requests without reading it first."
good,I enjoy the work I do.  The pay is ok and the benefits are pretty good.  Leadership is weak and self serving.  They lead by fear and not by coaching and development.  This is why I am looking elsewhere.
good,It was my internship time and during this time I over viewed the collection and litigation process of there consumer business
good,The company is alright - after a while you feel there is nothing to look forward too
good,"The organization enables to improve your productive."
good,"enjoyed it completely."
good,Most enjoyable part is the people you get to work with. I enjoyed training so many people here and in India.
good,"-Large Global Company"
good,"I was given an opportunity to grow to my current position.  I have been working here for 8 years and do not regret making the decision to work for Citi.  "
good,My co-workers are the best. The most enjoyable part of the job was completing tasks timely.
good,The work environment is great and the mangers are micro managers.  Not enough work to keep busy.
good,"I like what I do,  Operations areas are for people that like Operations.  Advancement is limited and very politically structured."
good,"Good all round place to work."
good,Direct oversight of 3rd Party Vendor relationships with Citi.
good,Was promised bigger role. Layoffs across the board prevented that. Was brought back as a contractor under Open Systems Technology 2010 to assist in VOIP roll out in Metro area.
good,"Joined Citi on a temporary 6 month contract - Initially was put into the transfers team which i received on the job training, settled in fairly quickly with nice people, my typical day would be getting my paperwork handed to me in the morning which i would then work through. I was then moved off the cuff to another team which was the most high pressured team in the office, working to tight deadlines and where accuracy is 100% they had never taken a 'temp into the team' thats how they put it, they said it was a compliment because i had settled so well and my productivity was excellent, the work in this team was extremeley difficult and everyone in this team had been in the team for years, the training i received was minimul and the manager never approched me during this time, the person traning me left for another project after two weeks and the other members of the team were very annoyed if i had to ask a question and expected me to know everything, i was working about 40 cases per day and making perhaps 2 or 3 mistakes a week which i then got a meeting from my manager telling me they were worried about my performance, i tried to explain i felt as if the training was lacking and the other members of the team were quite unapproachable, the way my manager spoke to me compared to the permemenent workers was totally different and unprofessional, i think joining as a temp in citi is extremelely difficult and its as if your not part of there group, my day was becoming unbearably stressful as like i said above there was so much information to take in which people in my team have taken"
good,"The group I worked with have all followed each other since they worked together at Enron. They weren't very highly trained, couldn't explain what they did and why. They looked down on any processes  put in place. Very unkind and unwelcoming to newcomers."
good,"Due to an agreement that I signed in accordance with the severance package that they gave all of us that were laid off, I am unable to really comment either way. "
good,"Experience within a very large environment is the most beneficial part of working for this company.  The culture is such, that the management is very secretive and not very forthcoming with their employees.  I don't believe it is the individual manager's fault, but the pressure from executive management that causes this rift.  The people who work here are some of the smartest and most talented I have had the pleasure to work with.  I would say the hardest part of this job, is learning how to survive the culture set forth from the top without losing your positive outlook and passion for the work."
good,Continuous monitoring criticism can be nerve wrecking.21
good,"The company division I worked for was subprime loan through car dealerships. I reviewed stips for loans, audited weekly on all accounts, skip traced on delinquent accounts when needed, decisioned overall loan acceptance for any loans that were applied for thrugh local dealerships. Worked side by side with co workers to maintain a balance of consistency in the office which in turn provided an enjoyable atmosphere. The hardest part of the job was having to say no to loan approvals knowing certain people are truley in need. I enjoyed the office being around co workers and the ability to socialize occassionaly."
good,"•	Successfully managed multiple portfolios, CitiMortgage Arm loans, CitiMortgage High Risk, CitiMortgage 90 day delinquency, inbound call team, Network Real estate."
good,Overall good company. Service over 100 calls per day for various clients.
good,Its my first job. i lean how to handle the customer what ever the product sales it is. company given me the first hope that i can deal with the problem confidently.
good,"Good pay, but they make you give up almost everything else, family time, health etc."
good,"A typical day at work was me sitting behind a teller window hoping customers would come in and when they did come I have to basically shove credit cards amongst other things down their throats."
good,"Citi has a very high turn over rate for a call center. The credit card collections metrics are very tedious. You have to hit specific points and guidelines. Management was not the most tolerable but if you keep to yourself you might be okay. Co-workers are really supportive of each other. If you have a good training class, that is a plus."
good,I have worked for Citi in different Positions for 7 years. They are closing our site here in NC.
good,The Job Was Just An Entry-Level Job. Other Employee Looked Down On You. Some Employees Were Nice Others Were Very Rude And Obnoxious. The Best Part Of My Job Was The End Of The Day. Nothing Spectacular About This Job Or Position.
good,Analying credit data and financial statements to determine degree of risk involved in extending credit and lending money.
good,nothing more to say. good benefits. bad management. good employee networks. mentor/mentee program. hard to excel within the company
good,"Company was bought out by OneMainFinancial, and thus was a temp. position for me during my short time there. The manager and DM were very combative w/ each other and created a negative atmosphere during my time there. I still learned a lot in regards to Sales and prospecting, but the negative tension was too much at times."
good,No security in job to many layoffs.Over all average but very little work/Life balance.
good,The hardest part of this job was being cursed at on a daily basis at least 3-4 times a day.
good,"I started my day with checking on clients and staff making sure everything was ok. Making sure that the patients were getting their meds and checking on the staff to make sure that fthe patients was taken care of. I learned that you have to be sensitive to the ederly needs.Managing the staff was challenging, just making sure their was proper staffing and making sur that all shifts were covered at all times. I got along with all my co workers, we had much respect for each other, which are really imprtant. the hardest part of this job was loosing patients, but the most enjoyable part was getting to know them all and listening to their stories."
good,company is ok to work for. not well paid for what one does. no real advancement within company. mgmt not good. employees are the ones to show support and appreciation.
good,"Citigroup is a large corporation and sometimes their values get lost in the shuffle. However, their compensation and benefits are good."
good,"place of employment where people work if you are looking for a job, you could work here, amazingly enough they will pay you, but the management team is very demanding"
good,A kis kedvenceknek jó hely. A többiek meg szívnak miatta.
good,Its an okay place to work depending on the department. The call center needs to work better on their departmental procedures. ALL managers need to be on the same page.
good,"At first you would love to work for Citi but as years went by they gots worst such as changing the hours of the bank , doing more work while they lay off people . No work life balance, mandatory meeting every day"
good,Little work life balance. Great colleagues. Good place to work in if looking to advance in the sales role. A lot of support given by the different roles in the bank.
good,"its okay I guess, there are lots of benefits and in my department there is not a strict dress code every year you get a raise I learned how to be a top notch collector and the hardest part of my job is going to bed late and getting up early the next day"
good,"Citi does great with its compensation and benefits although the medical is a bit higher than you would think it should be.  The biggest issues with Citi is not the company itself but rather the management.  Success there feels almost hit or miss on your direct manager.  I and many others I have worked with have had poor experiences with managers there, the expectations they have, and generally the culture they drive.  At the same time I know others that have had more positive experiences.  Based on that I would tell people to work at Citi, but be aware of the potential pitfall."
good,"CITI has great projects to work on, they have a decent corporate culture but management in certain parts of the organization are a hinderence to career advancement and innovation."
good,"Overall , satisfied with the Company. "
good,"Work in Citi means long hours, very hard work effort is needed."
good,"Liked the work, needed the job.  Covered my expenses for a time.  Assignment was shorter than told, but on to next assignment. Overall, I was able to learn another type of work and add this to my experience and skill set."
good,"I enjoyed the time I spent at Citigroup.  It was a temporary position, so I did not have long term job security, but I knew that going in and I enjoyed being able to focus on the data entry work and the co-workers were very helpful whenever I had questions."
good,"O banco é razoável. O problema são as pessoas que o dirigem, incluindo gerentes que são despreparados. Promoção de 5% no salário após 4 anos se ""performar"" além de panelinhas."
good,"stressful environment, lacks employee engagement, has brand value, open processes with open door policy however can do better with streamlining processes"
good,"Even though this company has good employee benefits and resources, I have found that under all the managements I've been under, and all that I witnessed while working for Citi, that 90% of promotions are due to favoritism and/or popularity with the hiring manager. This is also true for opportunities given by managers to advance your skills. If you report this to HR, theres no big chance they will make a case of it."
good,"Not much to say - a big bank with little soul. Management is risk averse and often useless. Benefits are OK, salary and bonuses are in line with the street."
good,"It's a good company to work especially for technical support folks, very limited functional role with limited scope of domain skill, very less US based  interaction with Functional SMEs. Company policy can be executed in a better manner."
good,"Senior management is out of touch with reality of what happens within the organization.  Internal competition, bureaucracy, and redundant/complex structure ensure that nothing is accomplished in an efficient, productive way."
good,"Senior management does not have a long view vision or strategy."
good,"A typical day at work includes many meetings during the day plus comply with your assignments. Most of the time, employees need to work extra hours (at night and weekends) in order to accomplish their goals. Although, you get pay over time for these hours, you feel like you don't have a personal or family life. The salary is not enough based on the job responsibilities. The company has higher expectations in regards to performance and productivity from employees; however the employees are not recognized for their hard work and extra hours expend in the office. Most of the time the organization is short stuff and permanent employees have to spend a lot of hours in the office to reach the date lines and assignments. The management is very disorganized and they don't get aligned within the same units. They don't take into consideration vacation days to assign your cases . Sometimes you get cases assigned that are due during your vacation time. Company does not respect your rights or vacation time as sometimes you receive calls from managers asking you to connect remotely and complete an assignment or report during your day off or vacation day. They implement new systems avery month without texting the system before and giving the employees proper guidance or training."
good,"Screen thousands of emails daily."
good,This place seems to be the worst for hiring with in. If you do not know someone or kiss your managements rear end you will not succeed. I actually enjoy my job but cant progress because of one person perception.
good,"Promotions were not based on academic and professional background.  Too many people without managerial skills or academic background in managerial positions."
good,"Working at Citi was find, neither my best or worse job.  Left due to lay off.  Management stressed filling quotas over doing your best for the customer.  I prefer to do what is best."
good,Citi has a very good culture and is a great company to work for. Management encourages its employees to work autonomously and always focus on the client first.
good,The limited staffing model made it difficult to provide outstanding service on a daily basis. Management is unit driven and there was minimal support in finding solutions
good,However upper management treated contractors like second class workers.  At the beginning It was a good place to work.  The bright spot was my manager who was awesome and that is what made it enjoyable
good,"Overall the company was ok to work for...my manager was not. She would manipulate data to ensure compliance with Federal Regulations - so basically breaking the law. I gave notice and began working for a vendor to the company, my former manager heard about it and bad mouthed me. Fortunately, they knew how she was and disregarded it."
good,"Not the best but not the worst depending upon which division within Citi.  Some offer more perks, while other areas have not fully embraced Citi's culture.  The biggest challenge is trying to do more with less people.  It impedes upon the work/life balance."
good,"Es una institucion muy importante a nivel mundial "
good,it was a very fast paced very stressfull job that constatantly changed.  that hours were always changing due to it being a 24 hour sservice center so it was unpredictable.
good,"_ typical bank routine"
good,Always short staffed. Too much quantity vs quality. Cannot hire quality people. Too much outsourcing. Templates do not fit the branches. You need to know someone in upper management. Certain people were always protected.
good,This is a company that is only in business for making money. The current culture is very hostile toward the lower level of employees. The ops manager in the Mortgage department is the worst manager I have ever had the opportunity to work or. If it was me I would not work for this company.
good,"No Citi o ambiente de trabalho é tranquilo, a cultura é bem rígida mas fácil de se acostumar. Devo ao citi todo meu aprendizado do mercado de trabalho bem como o uso de diversas ferramentas e habilidades ímpares que só tenho hoje devido a minha experiência lá. Sobre a direção e gerência não posso opinar muito por ter feito parte da equipe em uma época de transição com muitas mudanças (compra do Itáu). A parte mais difícil foi acompanhar e manter tudo em ordem na migração, enquanto a mais agradável foi saber que a comunicação lá é muito priorizada e nunca me senti sozinho."
good,"Unfortunately, I was let go for being honest, which all Program/Project Managers should be allowed.  I was 100% Loyal! Would have love to stay.  One good boss"
good,"Just care about themselves. Just keep you where you are so they can advance and look good. Not very good on compensation and bonus. Not great on training and development. Benefits OK (Health care, paid vacation, 401K and match etc.)"
good,"Hostile environment where promotions are hard to achieve."
good,"Working as an On-Boarding Analyst can be both stressful and challenging.  But with supportive co-workers and management, one can make it through the day."
good,took aprox 80 phone calls per 10 hr shift from very angry customers.  very poor management.  mangers were not knowledgeable of the positions they were managing.
good,I worked for Citi-Mortgage as a full-time employee and as a temporary employee.  My time at Citi-Mortgage helped to fine tune my skills in working in the mortgage industry
good,"My job was to be head teller and had me doing Assistant Branch Manager and Branch Manager duties without the necessary credentials and under the pay of teller which was $28,000 annual salary. If I'm doing managerial work, I expected to get paid as a manager and that was unlikely at this company. Therefore, I quit. Gave them my two week notice and discontinued doing managerial work being that my job description was to simply be a teller and nothing else."
good,Originally I loved this job. The benefits seemed amazing the job seemed nice well the veil was soon lifted. They dont really care about their employees they would much rather replace you then see you take time off for your health or family needs. Their metrics are unrealistic and you have to kill yourself and stress yourself beyond beliefs to try to meat them or they will fire you. You get a coaching a warning and then fired. So make sure you are never anything but perfect.
good,A very unrewarding job with a lot of turnover and negative attitudes amongst employees.  Company is being sold and half have left and the remaining left behind have not been given any sort of guidance or transparency to job future situation
good,Since the company has moved more to working from home and is moving to a smaller site things have become tense here. While it is a good company to work for it can be very stressful.
good,"typical day is extremely busy and fast paced"
good,Most of the level 15 roles already had a pre-ordained person before the posting hit the system. Virtually impossible for anyone to advance from level 14 to 15 where bonuses increased exponentially and stock options were provided annually.
good,"I am just a temp.  But from the outside looking in, Citi is a good place to work.  The open desk seating is fun and interesting.  The location is in a quiet area.  The campus is beautifully managed."
good,"They don't care if you're overloaded. Everything has to be done now. Management is a constantly rotating door and they have no idea how certain processes work together or dependencies involved to execute what seem to be ""simple"" tasks."
good,"Para pessoas que começam como jovem aprendiz e estagiários tem uma boa flexibilidade ética vinda dos gestores.  Talvez o ambiente deixe a desejar um pouco na questão inclusiva de novos funcionários,mas as oportunidades de seniores são diárias sempre com novas chances de promoção."
good,"With tuition reimbursement benefit, I was able to go to college and earn my Bachelors Degree in Business Management and Information Systems. The company provided many training opportunities for all staff."
good,"Management at Citi is somewhat compromised.  Too many old friends handing out senior managerial positions to their friends and/or family. The senior vice president at Citi Delaware, currently have family members working directly for him."
good,"Monitor internal systems, databases and depositories to ensure internal and client accounts reconcile and action discrepancies.		"
good,They expect a lot out of you but do not want to pay you extra. They used to offer great benefits and bonuses but over a period of time all of the reason I joined the team went away.
good,"CitiMortgage, Inc. offers numerous incentives to employees, such as discounts to local phone service providers and other amenities, tuition reimbursement, career development and more. They perform charitable acts for their communities and reward employees for doing the same. That said, often the job responsibilities are more than the role was designed for, the pay doesn't meet that of similar roles in other companies within the industry, and there is an ever-present sense of urgency in performing work due to high standards for productivity."
good,"Citi was a great place to work in the beginning then as management changed, the environment became cut-throat and taking care of employees was not important... Revenue was the most important agenda"
good,Too many changes without proper information to employees. Most branch managers are not very knowledgeable and are constantly looking to write you up. Good benefits
good,"16-18 hour days average, hard to take days off due to the nature of the job/culture, lots of exposure to senior bankers and very fast pace work environment"
good,"Over the course of 13 plus years with the Citigroup organization I worked alongside some extremely talented people. The collaboration and team atmosphere has been a huge plus to my tenure. I've had the opportunity to work in various business channels, however found the opportunities to advance to be limited at best. My personal experience as a remote employee has proven to be beneficial in terms of work-life needs. The management for the most part was extremely flexible and supportive."
good,"Trying to recover and implement technology based poor judgement, rather than sound architectural advise. Trying to justify $MM of wasted funds on solutions that neither work nor fit the need."
good,"A typical day at Citi would be performing all operational updates, servicing the ATMs, performing cash counts, completing reports, doing customer transactions. Management prefers to hire outside of the pool of Citi employees, and prevents promoting people regardless of merit and experience. Management prefers to keep their employees in the same positions by providing them with very minimal pay raises or incentives because they fear losing their employees."
good,"No life balance, work more than 11 hour. Management bias. flexible workplace. benefits moderate and job security depend on department / management. Job culture is moderate"
good,I don’t really remember it was two years ago and I was in a totally different position. So even if I had something good to say I couldn’t post it because I’d feel like I’m just making it up.
good,"Too much focus on costs, leading to decline in quality of staff and service given. Salaries in line with market norms but bonuses poor. Benefits package good and well administered"
good,It was a tough and challenging environment where I had gained lots of business skills in six years. Global Citibank effect and culture could be felt in every part of the organization.
good,For a short time of employment I got experience and decent pay. If you have experience doing data entry you can do better. It is a production environment which means your numbers are all they are worried about if you have excellent numbers you're golden.
good,"It's a very fast paced business.  Every second is to be accounted for.  There are very few shifts that do not work weekends and/or evenings.  I did not mind the job, but I need to be off on the weekends to be with my family,"
good,"poor management in portfolio sales dept, salary okay if you hit your quota you will get commissions. excellent medical benefits but lacked of bonuses this is the only banking institution that only has 13th month pay."
good,"The management is horrible. There is too much favoritism and not enough growth. Management feels like its best to hire people with zero bank experience then to promote within. Citi's pay is very bad. The culture as a whole in the work environment is not very welcoming and can be very unprofessional between the managers. They also make you use your time to go on a mandatory leave for a week if you've been there less than 5 years and two weeks if you've been there for more than 5 yrs, and its consecutive days so you cannot break your time up."
good,"If you can stay in your seat and not talk to anyone other than on the phone, this is the job for you. Talking to other departments is strictly frowned upon."
good,"Sorry to say this company tries to be supportive and create a friendly culture but it just doesn't happen.  Employees in the same division are spread out all over the world.  Time differences, language differences and cultural differences affect the effectiveness of the work at hand.  Many employees leave or their jobs are relocated."
good,Citi Financial closed too many offices on Puerto Rico.  Too many employees was fired for the closing.  There had not great products or accessible products.
good,"I learned many skills coworkers were great management wasn't too good most enjoyable part was the customers. Hardest part was learning the system but once you get it, its easy."
good,Atmosphere was not that great. Management could not find any soluction to that and there is very high turnover. There are very long hours in processing team.
good,"Citibank was a good job for me. Eventually, as technology and the world progressed, they phased out the groups I worked for and we were / I was layed off."
good,"I worked at a a Citi datacenter but as a contractor. everyone at the DC worked 12 hour shifts. Day shifts would be best but mine was nights. I never had a weekend off. Even though I had 3 or 4 days off per week, the constant trying to change from day to night and back was taxing on the body, mind and home."
good,"Some departments are great, others are terrible. It really depends on the manager that you end up with; you could feel like you'd prefer to get a root canal every day of your life or feel like you are a part of a family."
good,"Depends on your manager.  There are many good ones, some terrible.  Many excellent people at Citi, but if you are unfortunate enough to get a terrible manager, your life could be very miserable."
good,Good company with great benefits. Depending on who your manager is will also determine on whether you will like it or not.  You have a lot of changes that seem to be pushed through at times without thought before hand by middle management and then expected to be implemented in short time frame period regardless of the system limitations.
good,"Upon accepting this role i was told a few different things that had come to be untrue, regarding the job  and my role. Things quickly unwind-ed my first week in the role because there was such a lack of training i wasnt even confident at my job. The managers arent any help and they are nit-pickers to say the least , Not sure about putting anyone in such stressful environment . 30 min Lunches and 2 breaks it definitely not enough for what we have to endure and they always say things are going to change but the sad truth is ive been there a year and things are still the same."
good,"Poor leadership, disconnected management, lack of department structure. Managers and leads create a very chaotic atmosphere; they are often scattered and out of touch with staff. No approachable leaders to answer questions and provide guidance when needed. Altogether disorganized; from management of employee credentials to new hire training. Nothing is streamlined. NOTHING... Inconsistencies in resources to ensure that all new employees receive equal and adequate training. Asking questions is perceived as argumentative and will result in contract termination regardless of your performance."
good,Very good place for beginer .good opportunity for learning as a beginer as you get to work in various field of finance . And long hours makes it little difficult for personal life balance
good,Have to know someone to get anywhere. Good benefits. Good schedules. Lots of options. Decent pay. Try to be family oriented. Management is horrible...
good,"Desk was closed because of senior management decisions. With this in mind, we cannot comment on the business as it is no longer in place.        thanks"
good,"This is a fast paced, banking environment, with learning opportunities, however there is no work/life balance. Good Benefits, Monday-Friday, no weekends, Holidays off."
good,"Not much to say managers are very arrogant, and seem to not know what they are talking about 9 out of 10 times. If you have a question they normally do not help they tell you to check all resources and if you cant find it they just send you in the direction of your team members, They do not care if you have a customer on the phone or not which hurts you call handle time and then you get coached about why you are on the phone to long. The only pro is you get your own desk... until they make you move 6 times in a month span."
good,"Citi provides excellent resources to learn and grow in the banking industry.  Management, however, tend to not utilize those resources and create a hectic work environment due to lacking in their ability to conform to policy and procedural changes.  The need to reassess their senior managers and hold better accountability in order to maintain proper lower staffing levels."
good,I was employed on a contract basis for a special project in the Mortgage loan area.  This resulted in me checking the details that were provided for mortgage loans and chasing up on any deficiencies of the information that was submitted for the loan.
good,"The company under pays and over works the employees"
good,"Citi is a decent place to work. I have great coworkers and good managers. The benefits, including paid time off are outstanding. I would recommend Citi as a good place to work."
good,"Citi is a good company but it doesn't give job security to its people. It exposes you to different people, different cultures which is good. The people you work with (management, colleagues etc) are professional.  As much as you want to stay with the company, Citi lays off people due to robotics and migration of process to different countries."
good,Worked on phones taking inbound calls in credit cards for collections and customer service. To truly give a person the proper kind of customer service they truly appreciate it can't be done in 2.65 minutes. It just can't. You have to actually hear what they saying but Citigroup wants you to rush thru everything
good,"In the city ( manhattan ) its nonstop clients and you need referals plus wires, saftey deposit box and bussiness clients. In smaller towns it is much, MUCH easier just be prepared."
good,"Parts and elements of Citi are excellent, but overall the firm.. at least in San Antonio doesn't pay enough for the distance, and the company is highly unorganized."
good,"good place, great work life balance. gym on campus as well as a daycare. helps with tons of employess that are parents. vto is a plus when offered. pay should be much better"
good,"Cuando laboré, no había cómo tal horario de salida, muchas veces se sentía obligado a quedarse hasta las 9:00pm, entrando a las 7:30am. Sin embargo es un banco que ha dado oportunidad a muchos cómo a mí y sé que las políticas han cambiado para bien de todos"
good,If youre not planning to move up then this is a good job to pay the bills. It also helps if you have the right management team supporting you and helping move up.
good,"Decent workplace to learn about the banking business, but at middle management level, your work is not valued by the organisation as much as your ability to 'face-time'."
good,"Overall the Company is great company to work for.  People there are great.   The only thing bad experience I had.  Is my department got transfer to India,   and we all lost our jobs."
good,"Nice place, great tradition, strong values and practices globally. On the down side, there is a constant sense of competition rather than collaboration."
good,"Had a table. Could hardly use it."
good,"Dont go for it until you get a very good position"
good,"Hard to climb the ""corporate ladder"", if you are looking for something repetitive and middle of the road, then this is perfect. Not a huge bonus structure or any commission, and their recruiting practices are outdated as well as their technology software to do so. If you thrive on new challenges and a bonus/commission style compensation then this is not the place for you. This is a place you go to retire not a place you want to grow your career for a long time."
good,Working in this company thought me a lot. I learned to value my work and extend my skills and learning to the best of capability to be a better employee.
good,"Be prepared to be kept in the dark on anyting regarding your job.Our department was merged from the FIU to the GSO unit. The upper management for GSO never reached out to say hello, give introductions of themselves, or kept any kind of communication with us. The morale in our group dropped dramatically because we are kept in the dark. No telling if we are going to have a job or not because they are not telling us if our group is staying or going. My supervisor wanted to give me a promotion and they said no. I had spoken to other employees that have been in the department for a few years and they said they had never gotten any raises or bonuses. Just take caution when you go to work for Citi. They are not completely horrible but you should know what you are getting into before you take a job here."
good,"Citi is a global bank, and with its global presence come the challenges. It is a hard place to navigate, and internal processes are often driven by extremely inefficient and bureaucratic procedures that prevent internal collaboration and drive clients away."
good,The local managers and supervisors were great.  They are handicapped by the Corporate Higher ups that crippled everyone and caused the Mass exodus from Citi.  Everyone's income was cut in half and moral plummeted.
good,Citibank was a great place to work. I am very appreciative to be given that opportunity in 2005. I worked in several departments of Citi which helped me enhance Customer Service career.
good,"mostly learned everything in the department, Citi is one of the strongest banks to gain good banking experience with great exposure in all areas of investment and finanace. However in terms of Work/Life balance, it is one of the worst."
good,"Productive and fun work place. As a Banker, you are able to meet set goals and achieve beyond expectations. It's very rewarding, especially when you earn salary and commission. Management at all levels and fellow coworkers make the long days go by faster. You all become family and extend the relationship outside of the workplace."
good,"Working here did allow me to gain a tremendous amount of experience and knowledge, but unfortunately, the only way to truly advance is playing the politic game."
good,I have to attend all walk in customer filling the slips account opening forms filling the cheque and guide the customer making relationship between the customer and management . listen the problems and solve them.
good,"Good place to start your career. "
good,Only care about sales...no more human contacts decisions for gee reversals made by tools calculator it used to be a warm family atmosphere but upper management solidly cares for sales and no more personal care given to longtime clients
good,I had a good experience working here in TNS Global for a year.  Co worker are very pleasant and warm.  I got to work in different places whenever we had different projects assigned.
good,downsizing fears are major concern of technology staffs. many silos continue to exist making process changes difficult
good,"Inflexible time constraints, usually not willing to budget with set schedule. However the coworkers are usually very friendly as you basically live with them more than your family"
good,"Citi does a lot for their employees as well as provides great compensation (compared to most jobs around here) as well as great benefits. The downfall is that, they do a lot for the employees because they also expect basically your whole life from you. Working at Citi in the past 6 months, my schedule has changed 3 times. I was told walking in the door that my schedule was Monday-Friday 7-330 and that I would be ""stuck"" in that schedule for a year until I would be able to change. After only a month on the production floor, I was forced to change that schedule due to ""business needs."" If you don't have kids or a life, then this may be the perfect place for you to work."
good,"Everyday was a very challenging and a learning day as you come across many people and you have targets everyday."
good,Good learning experience at start but nothing new to learn as you get experienced. Working here depends on projects that are handled by individuals.
good,The people are great and work hard despite the constant redirection of the company.  Low level managers try hard to keep morale up.
good,The company is so big and you feel like you get lost in the big ocean  and are lacking sense of accomplishment. Managers are in their positions mostly based upon seniority not meritocracy.
good,"Na área operacional tínhamos tarefas diárias que dependem de vários sistemas e processos diferentes."
good,"Once you were in a department and proved what an asset you were, it was extremely hard to advance in career.  The managers would hinder all attempts at advancement.  Apply for another internal job and your boss could not have even the decency to return hiring manager call and avoid meeting.  This has happened on more that one occasion."
good,"Difficult Manager, Management not very helpful/involved. Stressful. Opportunities to learn if you seek them out. Hard to move up because it is political. Decent compensation and benefits. Boring atmosphere."
good,Not much hours given. Decent opportunity for growth. Late hours. Hardest part is the cleaning when you work in food service. Slight room for growth
good,Not the most fun very un secure in employment not sure when will be terminated or for what reason. not a lot of professional support from training or staff.
good,CitiBank like any place to work has it's pluses and minuses.  It has some of the most intelligent people on this planet with a culture that takes into consideration work/life balance.  The organization is still very large however and depending on your department there is a large contrast between management styles and messaging received from senior management leading to potential ambiguity among staff as to the firms mission and their contribution to that.
good,"This place is under constant change and crisis mode since the mergers late 90s. It has never become a single company and one should not pretend that it is one company. The traditional retail bank and Investment bank are completely disjoint, and they should be separated as now being suggested by some very senior financial gurus and politicians. Too much bureaucracy and regulation killing the productivity - you can't blame anyone for how it is - the company is just too large and too complicated."
good,"O trabalho é bom, para quem gosta da área bancária.Fazer o atendimento aos clientes do Citibank requer boa fluência verbal, nível escolar no minimo superior completo, conhecimento financeiro e capacidade de se adequar as diversas situações que aparecem no dia á dia.A convivência com os colegas é muito boa o que amenizava algumas situações desagradáveis e de descontentamento.Os gestores não tinham preparo para assumir este cargo, na maioria formam promovidos de atendente para este cargo e a empresa não investiu  e nem acompanhou a qualificação dos mesmos. A parte mais difícil era realizar o atendimento com excelência ,atingir metas de vendas e não receber os valores acordados por essas vendas, por critérios subjetivos."
good,"I never minded the fast paced work environment, that was the part I enjoyed, along with helping the customers.  However, their training program did not cover well what calls would actually be about; it was very limited, and when I made multiple attempts to answer questions concerning issues that I know as a credit card holder, that I ask about when I contact customer service, I was put off, or the questions were never answered.  I didn't have a manager for the first 7 months that I was there."
good,"Citi is where they invented politics.  No, maybe that was Ancient Greece, but the analogy applies.  The bureaucracy is amazing."
good,"Very little to no room to advance your career unless you are willing t relocate. In addition, a typical work week was 7 AM to 9 PM 3 nights 7 AM to 8 PM 1 night, 7 AM to 5 PM one night and 7 AM to 1 or 2 PM on every Saturday. The company directive is to liquidate all assets as rapidly as possible in as efficient a manner as possible which means the company future is bleak."
good,Senior Level Management needs improvement in the power of  influence.  Most Departments have great Metrics which helps with coaching and developing.  Vacation days and personal days are great however it is hard to get time off when you need it in the call center area.  Last Con is most shifts include working every Saturday or every Sunday. Great Training in the class room and virtual.
good,"Women's network and other professional associations"
good,A typical day was accessing the database to grab my work and my New York files were challenging. I became an expert and was very comfortable in my job in the Verdugo Dept. This is a diverse group of people which makes it interesting.
good,"Citigroup is a good company to work for.  In the IT operational side, there is not much fun to be had, there is only work.  As in any IT job, work does not seem stable, and there is no reward for over achieving."
good,"I worked for Citibank thru Randstad Staffing in NY a temp agency.  I liked working for them and put in alot of overtime when needed."
good,There is no more need for my job with this company they are getting rid off all the accounts and then will shut us down so I am currently looking for a new job
good,Great co-workers and professional environment.  Constantly a changing environment that breeds a must to be flexible and resilient.  Would recommend to others.
good,"Busy from start to finish, sometimes it gets very slow depends on time of the year, great co workers easy to get along with."
good,"A fast paced environment with multiple duties to perform at once. I learned to be ultra organized to keep on top of the work and to say, ""no"" when at full capacity. I encountered a lot of politics with upper management (from the east coast), were unfriendly and untruthful with west coast employees. The majority of my colleagues were team players and a pleasure to work along side. I loved interacting with the hiring managers and sourcing diverse candidates pools."
good,"A large organization with limited resources for each department. Culture tends to be rough with reluctant resources allocation. Best part of the job is the earnest nature of the people who work there, they tend to really want to help. Personal connections can ease distance between departments. The hardest part of the job is the limited resources and limited will for change."
good,"Repetitiveness is expected, but being unable to complete tasks because no time is available was disappointing.I enjoyed helping the customers, but lack of training for new procedures affected my quality."
good,"Audit daily work from the branch that consist of teller transactions, personal banker new account openings, perform operational tasks on daily, weekly, monthly, and quarterly basis to ensure that the branch follow the correct policy and procedures. Utlilize your skill to determine how, what, and when to always grow the company but limit the risk for any loses. Train and continued education is extremely important to be updated with the constant change of policy, procedure, and regulations. You must learn how to adapt with everyday because the senarios varies client by client or employee by employee. The hardest part about this job is not having enough time in the day to do everything. The most enjoyable part of my job is that I truely am passionate about helping out the customers ethically.As for the employees I love to see them take the skills they learned and get out of their confort zone to excel to become whatever they want to be."
good,"Global, competitive organization with highly qualified employees.  Expectations extremely high and tremendous opportunity for professional growth.  Work life balance limited."
good,"- Positive people and supporting environment"
good,Over all Citi was a good place to work. My co-workers were outstanding. As time went on and the company down sized the days were stressfull and hectic. Management changed from people with knowledge and understanding to people that were worried about their jobs. I had the opportunity to work in the back-middle-front office operations. I learned from runner deliveries to sales presentations to hedge fund clients. The knowledge and experiance I gained from Citi is something I am really proud of. I am also proud of the accomplishments and friendships with my co-workers.
good,Great place to work with talented co-workers.The hardest part is the long hours due to a global presence.
good,Too many meetings and not enough time to work. Good training. Cronyism. Good pay. Timelines unrealistic. Lacking in team dynamics.
good,I grew with this company and learned to love the people. You got rewarded for your efforts. The only downside was that any position can be changed by corporate decision and you would find yourself unemployed. If you are looking for job security- Citi is not the place.
good,"I answered incoming calls for a call center Citi Bank, I worked from home.  While working on the site  before moving home, I was one of the top three in credit card sales for site numerous times.  I worked as a training assistant for new hires.  I was part of the Leadership team and coached others in sales techniques.  I was acting manager for manager's that were on vacation."
good,"In a typical day at my work I am involved in a wide range of activities including but not limited to, reconciliations, account documentation reviews, complaints handling , referal point for all members of staff and work delegation,amongst the team."
good,I have worked at Citi Transactions Services Payments and Statements division for 14yrs. They have announced that they will be closing down. All 370 employees will be involuntarily let go.
good,"Company is fixated on outsourcing jobs for cost cutting measure. Employees are forced to take on additional work responsibilities without compensating pay."
good,Management is unappreciative of hard work and more concerned with office politics.
good,"Worked here to get through college.  After graduating, looked to management for support in advancement.  Did what they asked but didn't get anywhere.  You don't get paid well as a teller, and getting 40 hours is difficult considering they are cutting down on everyone's hours."
good,"Challenging environment, growth opportunities are limited in non-strategic locations."
good,I begin my carrier here so I learned many thing. It was a practical experince of what I have learned.
good,Answering the phones and assisting customers can be fun and can be boring. I didn't like that I had to sit all day on the phones but I needed a less stressful job well I was pregnant. I prefer a fast moving and changing environment and this just didn't do it for me. The manager were great and very professional and kind. I just didn't like how there was no work/ life balance. I worked 4 12hour shifts and didn't want to do that when I had my baby because I would never get to see her.
good,Citi offers a wonderful compensation package but they do not value their employees at all. Management is terrible and there is little or no room for groth from within.
good,"As taught in day 1 of training.........""C"" stands for changes!!! "
good,"it was working for 5 days in a week"
good,"Enjoyed working there, working with clients and other employees."
good,"Was hired to work inbound calls as Customer Service/Sales Rep. "
good,Working at Citi helped me learn more about money management and time management. I would was hands on in assisting reps with phone escalations. I really enjoyed the people I met at that job and formed life long friends.
good,A typical work day is that I would log into sytems.  Cit has a very good systems but environment is very unprofessional.  Back then when I worked there employee would arrive late with little or no consequences.  Management was laid back but professional.  I felt that if you were a manager you knew what you were doing.  Bonuses were okay but no room for advancements because of backwards politics.
good,"very good. previous boss were very positive for work.when work under an agency, the boss and my reporting boss help me to achieve my monthly target."
good,"Immediate team and manager are great, however new mgmt has killed morale with constant reductions-in-workforce. Learned a lot and gained valuable experience. Grew professionally."
good,"Great learning experience every day. Diversified, motivational atmosphere"
good,"I inputted various amount from data sheets, printed them out and sent them to various departments."
good,"self management is great "
good,"Technology is more than 5 years behind, processing is slow, IRA department is technologically challenged, outdated process and technology makes it very hard to keep clients happy.  However, with these challenges managers pressure hard for numbers not understanding that a full days work load consists mainly of service issues because of the outdated processes and outdated technology."
good,"A typical day of work is retaining A LOT of clients business with the company. Persuading the card member to keep their previous card and/or acct, which was also the hardest part of the day.At Citi there are some caring managers at Citi but then you have a few that are beyond disrespectful and talk to you any kind of way. My co-workers got me through the day they were friendly and they felt the same way I did about the job even after being there longer than me. The most enjoyable day at work would be finishing the day with more saves than closes and going home knowing your day at work went well."
good,"Initially when i began with the company,I started with a low base pay but I was adequately compensated for my work selling. The company has since ""re-engineered"" and now i'm only able to make about 10% of the bonuses I used to. However, my base pay was not altered to compensate for the company's decision to re-engineer."
good,Gained knowledge on insurance and other investment products.
good,"Review is based upon my experience as a temporary employee. There was no typical day, as I was working on special projects. I did learn Citigroup's general ledger chart of accounts & some aspects of Regulatory Reporting. My co-workers were fantastic, both the permanent Citigroup staff and other contract employees. I worked at Citigroup in the same department for 3 different assignments, so I saw some of the same people on each assignment."
good,"all depend on immediate manager."
good,Global support to users and ledger account research and reconciliation
good,"Unless you have a routine at a work place do not expect anyone to tell you whats going on. I've learned that if you're not part of the ""in crowd"" you're in the ""out of the loop"" crowd. Management only tells you what they think you need to know and (some) leads will not tell you anything. Foreign co-workers are the hardest part of the job. There is a communication barrier. They communication amongst themselves in thier own language and are NOT team players. Lunch will be the most enjoyable part of the job if you brought it from home. The quantity of work is looked at rather than the quality. Every year you can expect a drastic job loss."
good,"Zeitdruck, priview... priview priview... in der kürzesten Zeit eine Tilgungsvereinbarung treffen, die wurde dann statistisch festgehalten und wenn Zahlungen nicht eingehalten wurden, konnte man das dann auf den Tabellen öffentlich sehen. Das hat zu einer wirklich unschönen Arbeitsathmosphäre geführt und das Konkurenzdenken wurde entfacht."
good,Good benefits. Not too much else to say. Learned alot and continuing to learn.
good,"Traveled with my employment always on the road traveling, but a good work life balance did exist."
good,"I was young and knew nothing about corporate politics."
good,"great Brand recognition, numbers game as bottom line is performance driven"
good,"Handled high volume of calls to delinquent debtors to make repayment arrangements"
good,"1. Typical day at work is going out and looking for cients to market bank's products and build your own leads. Doing telephone call/marketing to follow up clients."
good,"They continue to use an outdated sales model from 20 years ago.  Upper and middle management have been in place for many years and refuse to change with the environment.  Refuse to listen to or consider employee suggestions.  Mortgage fundings were no longer a priority.  Cross selling credit cards has been their emphasis for the past 1.5 years.  Standard processing time is 90 days while competition is closing loans in 30-45 days."
good,"after my education ,, citi finacial was my 1st job , i joined as an associte, i have enjoyed my stay with citi finance"
good,It was a fun and flexible job to get me through college. I had a chance to learn how a financial institution works.
good,"As a Service Delivery Management Analyst, my day typically consists of monitoring branch equipment, taking plenty of phone calls for troubleshooting branch equipment with local technicians, monitoring application health via tools, and doing various MIS/tracking functions (tickets, etc)."
good,A very corporate level of work.  With strict guidelines for security and access.
good,"Pros – Employees have good benefits from the benefits provider"
good,"Citi isn't a terrible place to work. In fact, if you get in the right department, it's probably a great place to work. The majority of the jobs at this location are call-center jobs. Customer Service, Collections, Fraud, etc. I worked in the Fraud Dept. There wasn't much room for advancement. If you worked hard and were there for a long time, you could move up from being a floor rep to an operations assistant. From there you might need to work a few additional years to have a shot at a manager position. The only problem is that the pay for the floor rep is not competitive, and the pay for the operations assistant is not much more, so it could potentially take years for you to achieve the compensation you think you deserve."
good,"A good place to start your career, but compensations are deceiving "
good,"I have been with CitiMortgage for five years.  My co-workers are fantastic and we work well as a team and have been commended for a job well done by several other departments and sites.  Over the past year, CitiMortgage has been through quite a few changes with the resignation of two CEO's.  The default side of the mortgage business has also seen quite a bit of change with a constantly fluctuating market.  Being on the title team, we see the trickle down effects of what is occurring in the market and specifically with our customers.  We have recently merged with the title team located in Dallas, Texas and have been given more challenging tasks.  Although I welcome the change and an opportunity to learn more, I am interested in taking my career in another path and getting back in touch with people and more legal associated tasks.  "
good,"Good company however, very hard to move up once you get to certain departments. Its also hard to get paid what the average department pays so no raises."
good,"Don't recall much but it was the same thing every day. Teller and didn't learned anything more. Management was mean and unprofessional. Co workers were great. Happy, active and friendly. Hardest part was,  not meeting goals."
good,Presure to sell on every call and managment on your back about selling all the time. Can be a lot at times. Stressful work envirnment. 
good,"Very fast pace work environment. Once you start, you are immediately thrown in with the wolves. I never really felt like I actually worked here. No sense of job security at all. "
good,Communicate with company branch for customer information and answer all questions and concerns regarding their customers request to cancel insurance within the US and Canada.
good,Competing and shifting priorities can make it hard to be successful in the long term.
good,Citi was a ok place to work I've learn a lot in the sense of getting things done on a deadline and I learned that I'm a fast worker and know how to get things done on time. I felt that managers should of been in the room with you and not in another state because a lot of my co-workers was getting over with a lot of things that the boss didn't have no clue of what was going on from day to day. I most enjoyed learning different things on the job that I can take with me on my next job.
good,"A few years ago the company provided better benefits for employees (medical, training, recognitions). The compensation was also better. Now they are reducing costs and the work overload is overwhelming. It's a company that is constantly changing management and there is no real job security."
good,Citibank has tought me a lot through out my career. I will alway appreciate the growth and knowledge I received...
good,Typical day
good,Not sure what to say other then its a general call center that is ever changing. The management is ever changing and re-organization is always happening. Its a fast paced work flow with not enough hours in the day to complete everything on your plate so if you like a challenge that never ends and will always push you to your limits then this is the place for you.
good,"Bilingual client centric professional with more than 10 years of experience working in high visibility positions in the financial industry with multi-cultural teams in Latin-America, Top Global Financial institutions and Gold and Platinum Corporate clients, with a proven record of developing and implementing leaner and innovative solutions in order to meet client’s need and improve their satisfaction. Recognized by Management team for taking on business relationships at risk and under-performing areas of the group and generate results in a short time period of time."
good,A typical day at work starts normally with a daily routine from the day before. What I learned each day comes from the clients that I deal with daily. My co workers are the best thing about my job because we get along so well. My job is mostly self management which I like as well. The hardest part of my job is knowing that there is very little room for advancement especially if you have a higher level of education. It can be redundant doing the same job day after day with the only way to advance is to leave the company. I know times are tough all over and company's are trying to save money as well. The only thing worse is having the skills and the education that can only be used if you join another company that you hope well reward accordingly.
good,"A typical day at work wherein you will have morning meetings everyday, giving commitments everyday. I learned a lot in handling clients, interacting with different kinds of people by giving them proper customer service. The management is all about policies. Co-workers are perfectly ok, because as for me if you treat your colleagues right they will give you back the same, its all about learning to adapt to what kind of environment you're in. The most enjoyable part of the job is you have all your time, I mean your the one who handles your time on your own and its up to you how will you make it in a productive way."
good,Worked as a mail clerk but the department i worked for is no longer there
good,"My first introduction to remote working and adapting to a manager who was located in a different state than I was but trying to be the administrative assistant and know the day-to-day activities was a large challenge; our team consisted of only 5 managers which made teamwork fantastic and they were located at my site and we bonded to create a close-knit family in order to pitch in and get the work done; with a boss that only flew in every two weeks it was very difficult to schedule meetings and keep projects running smoothly; at times I had to run certain meetings or create PowerPoint presentations,"
good,I had a wide variety of tasks to deal with on a daily basis which I enjoyed.
good,"A typical day at Citi was reviewing payments, approving or denying loan applications. Contacting customers regarding payments and trying to find a solution if they weren't able to make payments. I had some great co-workers. The hardest part of my day was trying to do the work of 4 people when staffing was low and there was a hiring freeze. I liked interacting with the customers and helping them when I could."
good,"The best part about this empolyer were the benefits. The job atmosphere was very unprofessional, no structure, order or balance as one would think. Management was extremely unprofessional, as they would pick favorites based upon everything except skills, performance, etc. One of the wors jobs I've had yet!!"
good,Work life balance was poor. Opportunity for advancement was poor as well.
good,"Excellent Benefits package,however this company appears to have some racially biased issues with regard to advancement-the lack of diversity in management is obvious when you attend any of their ""Town Hall"" meetings. The company talks a good fight,but does not back it up."
good,"- Trade processing, client meetings, investor inquiries"
good,Enjoyed 1st 6 year of working but after restructuring got new manager who started building his team and removing old employee that were working for other manager before restructuring. I was not enjoying my recent job responsibility. I have a mix feeling about Citi. If you are lucky to work under good manager it is great company to work for.I feel lot of politics being played at higher level.
good,too large and cumbersome to be effective. Conflicting priorities about storage purchasing and infrastructure plans.
good,Spend your whole day on the phone doing customer interactions
good,Pretty meager income for this type of work.
good,"*Primary responsibility for managing large and complex credit portfolios (ca 50 names, includes over 5 ultra high networth relationships), particularly high net worth clients in EMEA."
good,"Citibank lacked consistency. Goals would change emphasis mid week and simple things such as greeting statements would change mid year and would range from long and silly in its complication to short and nonsensical. ""Welcome to Citibank"" to answer the phone? The retail side lacked warmth and loyalty. Everyone was ""out for themselves"" and true friendship and camaraderie didn't exist. Each week brought new drama and increasing anxiety of being fired due to customer service reports or cash handling differences. Promotion is impossible if you don't network, not based on hard work and ambition. Be prepared to be stepped on. Tellers are treated like grunts."
good,Acceptbable working conditions.
good,"I was warned, ""The C in CITI is for constant change"". Be on your toes. Policy changes with regard to compensation is frequent. It seems most changes were implemented to keep reps from earning good commisions."
good,It's an ok environment! The place is good if you're wanting be contend with the pay etc etc!
good,Citi is a good company but they dont like to pay there employee and it is hard for advancement within other departments
good,It was a great place to work before and during the merger with travelers Now it sucks
good,Citi is an interesting place. Its a giant bank and proudly carries with it all things that come with that weight on their shoulders.
good,"Is as you would expect, a soulless environment with zero culture unless you are a person that fits into a ""diversity"" group, no one smiles, no one talks to each other, work is as boring as heck, how people stay there long periods i have no idea."
good,Coworkers are great. 2x15 min break 30 min lunch. As long as you are quick and friendly and your customer reviews are good you’ll be fine. Hard to advance because it comes down to who you know. You are working for a bank so everything is closely monitored
good,"Citi has potential to be a great work place. They have good benefits, on site day care medical and gym. I feel they lack compassion for their employees. Going into this job the training sucked because it was rushed and cut short,first pay check was very late and they offered no help, They never asked if I had planned trips when starting so I was forced to use unplanned time. Citi was unorganized  gave me desk that was dusty  with a keyboard missing keys. Not a good impression for someone new to the company"
good,"After 18 years of service you would think you would treated better when your job was job was discontinued but no, no communication and no transparency as promised drug along for months, will not go back"
good,"In recent years there is a lot of training, a typical day is normally 9 to 12 hours long, work culture depends on the department, some good people, management always cutting cost"
good,"Don't get me wrong, i knew what to expect.  During my time there the ethos was that Citi expected you to work, and work hard.  Sadly this meant work-like balance was almost non-exsitent (i worked avg 60hrs per week, mon-fri) but i was paid accordingly.   "
good,"Citi is a stable job overall. The benefits are fantastic including paid time off, health, dental, and vision insurance, and 401k. However career advance is difficult. Overall the company doesn't appear to grade the quality of your work, but instead your ability to network. In short, it isn't about your skill, it's about who you know. Along with that the overall lack of foresight from management causes unnecessary complications. Management routinely disregards issues that arise that have a negative impact to customers and employees. It isn't uncommon to hear that Citi has over hired for a certain role and will force people into other roles without warning. This causes forced schedule changes, overall career changes, and lowered morale."
good,"Era un ottimo lavoro, ottimo campo lavorativo e tutto potrebbe essere benne se i superiori non rompevano con telefonate non-stop, richieste senza lasciare tempo da fare!"
good,"If you don't mind being on the phones and only getting off of phones when you have a break or lunch, this is the job for you.  They are big on no off line time and usually phone calls are back to back."
good,I was very excited to get to an a job offer with Citi I had quite a bit of experience in Customer Service and Call Center operations in general I was even told by the Recruitment Specialist that she would not let me walk out that without offering me a position. So a fews days into training things became very unprofessional people were called out and accused of things which really hinder the learning process.
good,"CitiGroup is a company that focuses on production and quality. The managers aren’t the best communicators, and the company doesn’t offer many job advancement opportunities for their temporary employees either."
good,Citi has been conducting annual layoffs since 2000 which makes the overall environment unsettling. The workplace culture is demanding and stressful. Benefits and pay are decent. Management can be supportive depending on the area of the Firm.
good,"The schedules were always flexible, Pay was lower than average, and it’s difficult to move up in the company, unless your manager favors you.  I would not return."
good,"Not much to say due to entry level post. Biggest feedback is that they are slow to respond and process external or internal applications. Only moved to workday in 2019 whereas other companies have been on this platform almost 4 years now. They are quite slow to innovate, especially Citibank AU"
good,the benefits was the best part about working here. another good part was some of the people. but when it comes to management its not the best place for it.
good,Citi was a good job. Just got very repetitive. All you did was take phone calls. I left because I was unhappy with my career. I’ve always wanted to work with animals
good,Citi offered great benefits and welcomed staff to get involved in volunteer work as well as addition education opportunities. Would recommend Citi to others.
good,This particular entity of Citi was all about who you know and not what your know.  The management and culture was about pushing numbers not quality of work.  I was never given an opportunity to try to leave to a different department.
good,The branch staff makes the job great. The team is what makes the day productive and gives the job a sense of meaning. Once the team is working as a unit the day files and becomes very productive.
good,"Working at Citibank was beneficiary for my career. It provided me the skills to get my job at the Praxis Project.  I worked in the real estate department and my job was to open accounts, prepare loan documents, provide research for loan documents, set up appointments and prepare closed documents from all real estate loans for file and upload into the banking systems.  This was a perfect match to my education.  I have a BS degree in business finance, specialized in bank."
good,"As an agent, my job is very tiring because we need to work in field everyday, we learned how to deal with our clients. Manager-employee communication is very important. It's fun to be with other employee. the hardest part of the job is to find client. the most enjoyable part is when you go to different places to promote our service."
good,"Stressful job they want  50 calls a week with 5 appointments on the system and with those calls you have to add notes to every single contact  and submit complaints, and referrals "
good,"My work is not challenging anymore... just want to explore my learning capabilities, knowledge and skills. I would also like to work with right supervision."
good,"Engaged me as a Program Manager but all they wanted me to do  was to run meetings and chase people for deliverables.  Hiring manager really wanted a Project Contol Officer which is a completely different skill set.  "
good,Citi is an average place to work.  Very devised in culture. Citi is very strong on training and compliance.  Citi's flex schedule and remote working from home is one of the great aspects of this company.
good,"""It is also nice to have the ability to work from home if something comes up rather than have to take PTO"" I wake up every morning pumped to walk into work... sounds cliché, but so true! The culture is unlike any company I've come to work for or interviewed for.  Upper management will help you focus on your next career steps, in setting up mentorships and having one-on-ones to meet your goals."
good,"Good company, good pay but very small options for OT. Very involved company with events that happen around town great way to get involved and experience new enviroment and help out in community."
good,It is a great place to work. The culture prides itself on diversity. Managers are usually very understanding and helpful with anything that you might need.
good,It is a big company with full banking and brokerage services but management is still trying to find the right way to lead the business. Too many unsure makes it hard to follow.
good,"I really liked my job, there was always something you could learn. "
good,I enjoyed working for the company a department was shut down and was moved to a more sales oriented position which I did not enjoy. Made a tough decision to leave.
good,Based on  my experience at Citibank the Management was not effective and the work dynamics was just not efficient. The superisors were not well trained and there were constant staff turnover
good,This employer only gives part time and lots to study added to customers that are rude and demanding. The management is not that helpful and has sales expectations that are not always reasonable.
good,"Citi has grown to 160 countries and the process and procedures are playing catch up.  Too many managers without enough technical experience. "
good,Average.  Location is a plus if you are living in the west end. Good flex work hour programs. Not much in terms of career expansion since its a pure offshore site catering to NY or London
good,"extreme office politics, only a good network or reference can help you. no value for hard working employees. its all about bureaucracy and show off to management."
good,"Depending on the position you hold with Citibank your day could be restricted to you work area, with time management a key issue or it can be very relaxed while staying business focused.  "
good,"I have worked at Citi for so long because I have had the best boss.  She is such a proponent of work life balance.  The pay is what is leading me to move on.  I have not gotten a raise in many years, but have been told that I am lucky to just have a job."
good,"In Product Control, Work/Life balance is not good. There are unspoken expectations that lunch breaks will not be taken, and coming in early and staying late are the norm. Bad management causes high turn over frustrating the staff left behind to carry on. Unclear job boundary lead to multiple meetings on the same topics where no one takes responsibility."
good,"Fast-paced, good managers, good people. "
good,New hires are paid more than existing employees. No rewards for long term loyalty. Jobs are moved around to different offices.  Layoffs are consistent
good,Being a teller at Citi was an experience that I do not regret because I helped me understand that I do not want to be in commercial banking. Being a teller was good job security in terms of hours but based on the job market the position is disappearing.
good,"Tellers and Bankers take care of all the tasks while the managers are not doing anything at all whatsoever. whenever something went wrong, they blamed the tellers and never live up to their position."
good,Great place to add on your resume but expect to be worked.  Hard to find work life balance.  Support system might not be there all the time for you.  They are still a hierarchical system.
good,The most enjoyable part of the job was attending non-work events where you get to meet coworkers in a less challenging environment and have great conversations and a good time.
good,"As a Center of Excellence, there is a number of teams to interact with face-to-face.  The scope of the teams is regional and global.  Great opportunities to work with other regions and ""follow the sun"" collaboration."
good,work was hectic long hours but it was rewarding when your peers and your boss saw how hard you try to achieve goals. you had to have great time management if not you would be at work for long hours. as for managemnt some managers was not capable of doing their job but most of them was very fair and took care of their staff
good,Have worked with different team and different location. Over all benefit is just about average. The increments and bonuses are low. Some time no bonuses nothing. Lot of politics around every team.
good,"Citi provided me with opportunities to learn how money moves around the world. Including currency conversions. Education included The Patriot Act, Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC). The agency administers and enforces economic trade sanctions in support of US national security"
good,Nothing to write actually. Like most big bank they do lots of work on offshore. In our case full team was here in NYC. No almost all jobs are gone to India
good,"I enjoyed the wonderful people."
good,"Realizamos una campaña comercial para un producto financiero de nuevo lanzamiento, informando a diferentes empresas con un perfil específico, trabajo orientado al asesoramiento e información para las empresas"
good,"Initially loved working with Citibank but after getting a new manager the branch went down the drain. She lacked communication and was shady. The commission has changed 3 times in the year I have been a personal Banker making it harder to meet goals and bonus out. It just seems like they lure you in by saying they want what is best for the client and care about work/life balance but really they want what is best for Citibank and that is to make money. If you get a good manager,  it's not so bad and can be a great opportunity but the turn over rate is pretty high."
good,"a typical day at work consists of assisting clients with their accounts, handling large amounts of cash, making sure you have a secure workplace by managing sensitive information for clients security "
good,"Before I joined Citi, I was always weary of them because they would mass hire and then let people go in the same fashion.  They tend to do that often when trying to correct their budget and they always manager to lay people off right before bonus's or the holiday's.  I'm glad that i don't work for them anymore.  I feel much more secure in my current company now."
good,"I cannot speak to the company as a whole, but my particular department did not provide the ability to promote.  We were constantly pushed to learn new tasks and the path to promotion was a mystery to most.  When brought up in meetings, managers would give a vague answer as to what needed to be accomplished in order to move up."
good,Great place to work. Good locations.  Good bonus opportunities.  Company slow at handling complaince changes.  Under staffed branches.  Closed many branches.
good,"Schedules are always unpredictable. If there are changes in the LOB, or transition in the schedule, most of the time, you'll have to wait until it's a day or 2 before the new schedule starts, there were times that you'll have to wait until there's only a few hours remaining if the new sched will commence or not. Changes in the LOB is always surprising. Pay is good, there's a retirement package. Incentives are sometimes impressive."
good,Citi put me thru college with tuition reimbursement.  I cannot really complain about this company  When I moved back to town they were hiring and offering tuition reimbursement.  Great match for me.
good,This was a fact paced environment with little room for growth. Requirements to sell products were prevalent and stressful. Pay and benefits were adequate but the environment was very dramatic at times.
good,"Great company, with great opportunities, is trying to get back to being a great company but does have work to do especially in the O&T organization. .."
good,"Its a company which does not compromise with working time.All submission and targets are to be finished on time. "
good,"Citi served as a learning board.  The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting new people and establishing new friendships."
good,The environment is not very friendly and working the night shift can be less than desirable due to the lack of having actual leadership. they manage you and that's it. No room for growth
good,There were some very inconsistent management characteristics throughout the company. There were departments closings all the time and positions being dissolved all the time.
good,Empresa possui grande estrutura de TI e prioriza o planejamento futuro porém sofre muita influência política interna para redirecionamento da estratégia e desviando os rumos outrora definidos. Ambiente de pressão e de muitos erros no desenvolvimento das aplicações internas causando estresse no desenvolvimento das funções.
good,Not a bad place to work. Management is decent. Company promotes from within. Unsure of job security as of lately. Pay is nice. Benefits start day 1.  Great skills to take elsewhere
good,A lot of meetings. A lot of people management. Not as ideal for people who enjoy hands on work experience. High opportunity for WFH is the biggest plus. Projects can be stressful and over demanding
good,"There is always work to be done, even if they run out, They find something for you to  do. It is  a good, easy-going  place to work but the shifts/schedules are crazy."
good,I enjoy my training with the company. I have learn a lot specially with my chosen field which is hospitality industry. Co-workers and mentors are kind and knowledgeable which enhance my skills.
good,"Typical day at work would start in planning strategy by prioritizing urgent items & scheduling a call to clear out requirements & establish guidelines and workflow process across business and product owners."
good,Being greedy and wanting to lend money to literally anyone is what led to the collapse of CitiFinancial.  Way too many bad loans written over the course of 5+ years.
good,"Good to get your foot in for customer service or finances. Lots of knowledge to be acquired dealing with cash, federal and state laws. Good place if interested in sales."
good,Citi is not a bad place but you must not have “real” life happening around you. It’s not meant for th single parent or someone who is ill or lack of support system. While it offers you many benefits .. the “ be here now” policy can cause it to lack compassion to real life events. I loved the on sight medical center . Made it very easy for minor things to be taken care of & skip the wait. But they wanted you to “adhere” to your schedule which means any “extra” bathroom breaks aside from your two 15 min breaks & 30 lunch was not permitted or it would affect your score card. Any time from your screen affected it . Then you were considered “not meeting expectation”
good,you have to be ok with someone always over your shoulder and never enough help and employees to cover shift. pay is good though and really good benefits overall a good job
good,"The environment is good for learning new things.  The pace is very fast, and can be stressful.  We are working with talented individuals.  Unfortunately, they are always in a cost cutting mode, and the work life balance is not good"
good,"Compared to other firms on Wall Street (Goldman, Morgan) - Smith Barney had larger IT staffs.  As a result there were fewer opportunities to lead.  Also, I did not feel challenged there.  This was a long time ago, I'm sure it's different now."
good,"With ""Execution 2.0"" a few years ago, Citi set in place a process to eliminate direct-hires and farm out their people to service agencies (contracting firms). Many times Citi requires the agency to retain some of the Citi employees who used to do the job and these must be retained for 2-3 years (after this, the higher paid ex-Citi employees can be offloaded for offshore people). "
good,Very antiquated as far as systems and processes.  Matrix relationships and New York employees make it very difficult to partner.  It is difficult to fit in when there are tenured employees that are not willing to share.  New process and procedures are rolled out without involvement from the people that do the work.  There is a lot of turnover in many areas.
good,Great place to build a career in banking and services with a global exposure. Opportunity to interact with cross-functional teams in a global setting.
good,"Management team is not focused on the customer. Agents don't know what they're doing. Escalation reps don't know what they're doing. These issues were consistent for the 6 months I was there. Call three reps in escalation for an issue, get three different answers."
good,"The work and people on site and remote are excellent to work with.  The direction of the company now is very much focused on cost cutting and social activism.  We end up with too few people, spread too thin and don't always have the time or resources to make the correct decisions.  It would be nice to just do the work."
good,"You may have great management, you may have poor management. It varies tremendously across departments and divisions. As banking gets more complex, too many stakeholders are involved in determining what you should be doing, impacting ones ability to do the job they were hired to do."
good,"Your experience will vary widely based upon the manager that you directly report to.  Also be prepared to only receive small raises per year if you're lucky.  The only chance of getting a significant raise is if you move from one level to the next (i.e. jr level to intermediate).  If you stay at the same level and are hired to another group it will be considered a ""lateral"" move and not eligible for a raise, even if it's considered a promotion otherwise."
good,"I think this site has the bank up here instead of the temp job in NY. Anyway, my experience was good. Decent work on a somewhat regular basis. Thankful."
good,"Company is good but culture and management worst, internal politics is everywhere.  All leadership from 1 side of country. So people and there thoughts not matching"
good,"It was a good experience working with Citi, I learn a lot.Employees were friendly. I was satisfied with my management and training.i  had an opportunity to work at 1st Mortgage and Home Equity."
good,"Management is confused of projects , spent money on something and decide to cancel later as well as not sure about the path going forward total confusion to all"
good,You were just a number with this company. They didn't have a good idea what direction they wanted to go. Thus they later decided to do away with the entire Automotive Finance Division. The experience was good I learned a lot.
good,"I really do like the company, I think that if you're starting out in a bank, this is the one for you. However, after being here X amount of time, I have started to notice the climate of my department. There really is poor management, they basically require you to act like a robot the whole time you're on shift, and you must leave the floor when you take breaks and lunch. Now for some people, that is great, but for someone who needs to be somewhat stimulated by their work, and must have interesting coworkers, not being able to ""properly"" enjoy my work is a big no-no. However, I do have to say that I love their business practice, and the way we help the customers as best we can, so that is a huge plus, there is incentives if you are a top performing collector, and there is advancements in the company depending on department and time in title."
good,"The Citi organization is very siloed, the finance organization in particular is overworked.  Citi in general pays the worst out of all financial institutions and does not believe in meritocracy."
good,Lot's of organizational change with bureaucratic process making it difficult to get things done.
good,"When you manage a pipeline of over 100 applications at a time, it is very difficult to provide the good service that clients expect/deserve, plus it would take 60-90 days to close loans"
good,"Analyzed accounts for potential credit line increases, by talking on the phone with them when they called in, or by working the increase request submitted via the internet."
good,Work life balance is good. Work form is also a suitable option. I think work is not assigned properly to the employees. Employee skills are not properly utilized.
good,"The most frustrating thing about Citi is how close it comes to being a really great place to work. They offer remote office options, and you have ample time off for illness and family emergency. They also compensate competitively."
good,I have no review at this time. I do no wish to make any comments about my experience at Citi. All I am willing to say is it is overall an okay place to work.
good,"I learned some new skills at this company. I am grateful for that. Most of the people I worked with are friendly, helpful and knowledgeable. There is good opportunity to advance within this company."
good,"This was only a temporary assignment. I served as a outsourced payment processor for a different company's like, UPS, State Far, Mercedes, and others."
good,"	Served as Underwriter and calculated the creditworthiness of the individual/business/organization"
good,"Working extremely hard was given and never a problem. I was extremely committed to servicing my clients and completing any open task or assignments and meeting deadlines. However, the most difficult past of my job was not getting compensated for my efforts but I did my job regardless because I cared more about my clients. My direct manger was excellent but the overall management was poor and toxic. I enjoyed the group I worked with and we were truly a partnership."
good,Citi was a place with a lot of change. There were some roles at Citi I really enjoyed and others that my role changed into that I didn't desire. Benefits and pay were average.
good,The hardest part of the job was working with management and number cruncher to squeeze more work hours in the day then possible.  No work life home balance.
good,There are not enough resources - expectations keep increasing - programs keep getting cut - many SVP level jobs have been eliminated - bogged down in process
good,"Do not care for employees well being it is only about the bottom line. Job are relocated at will. Th environment is extremely stressful , but not about work more about when you could lose  you job at anytime. and not for performance. Pay is low and raises are scares  , no more stock options and  bonuses are cut."
good,"The communication from the top down is not ideal. There is so much variance from job to job and team to team. Hard to give a good overall read, it is all relative"
good,"A good place to work if you have a good senior management, otherwise a cutthroat, lack of real performance acknowledgment. "
good,"During my time there we had massive layoffs. People would not be reassigned to different departments, they would simply be let go. The pay was very low as well."
good,"It was probably because I have been in this role for a few years, which has developed over time. Org structure changes have caused me to become the dumping ground of work; rather than focusing on my career path, the objective was on keeping up with the day to day needs."
good,I worked here for 5 years in the collections and customer service department. Enjoyed helping customers with their credit card needs. Career advancement would be a plus.
good,"I really loved my job  until the fired my boss and brought in the american owners. the changed everything. I started not liking my job."
good,"At the time that I left 8 years ago there was a lot of transition and political activity, compounded by limited communication from executive leadership. That resulted in a lot of anxiety and cynicism among the workforce. Certainly things could have improved since those days."
good,Busy but recognized for hard work. Many benefits such as onsite discounted daycare with very qualified teachers was a huge bonus. Senior management was disconnected and many had never actually taken a calls at a call center.
good,"Citi was a great place to work you able to meet people "
good,This could be a great place to work or not so great depending on which area are working on and your management.   Citi tries hard to have a life work balance. Some of the areas are just too busy and understaffed to achieve that. If you're taking a job there make sure you ask them what a typical day looks like.
good,Supervisor would walk by my desk everyday and would rarely speak to me. Felt like she didn't care for me too much. Never really felt like I was that welcomed there.
good,"Equipe brasileira senior, porém desfeita, em função da padronização de processos,  controlados por equipes regionais (centralizadas)"
good,Goals must be achieved and are constantly being changed. This is a newer department so the positions are added and changed as the department grows. Management focuses on goal accomplishments and SLA.
good,Just like the title said. I just needed a Paycheck. This was a temporary job for me so that I could pay rent and have some food in the fridge. Now I have to move on to the next phase of my life.
good,"I'd work there again, some upper management issues."
good,"The culture in most financial companies believes that it is acceptable and normal to work between 45 and 55 hour weeks. In my opinion you only get paid for 40. Work life balance ebbs and flows, but mostly you are expected to make sacrifices for the job."
good,Working at Citi Bank was a great place to get my foot into the door of what I was looking to do. I've always been interested in the banking platform and it has helped me grow in this field.
good,"Got hired on a 5 year project contract, but instead they laid off the entire building 2 years into it. Gave a severance and was otherwise one of the best jobs I've had."
good,"I arrive at work at 8:00 am. Help open the mail and mark off the Probes, which are the envelopes we receive from the different markets. I then start my Misc Tracking of work we did the day before."
good,"its very stressful, with impossible quoatas eachday. rules are always changing to make things even more difficult. there is no team building at all to give workers more confidence nor is there any mentorship or guidance"
good,Citi Bank has a lot of turn over and I think it had to do with the job stress.  Management did not really take the time to listen to the issues the associates had on how to help our clients.  As an associate I felt powerless in helping out clients at times.
good,poor management and less work life balance. The work place culture will be safe and decent. the hardest part of the work will be working more than 10 hours a day.The only enjoyable part about work will be salary and benefits.
good,"Brand is good, can be better in terms of new employee on boarding, Large scale business with international presence,Stress full at times, lots of process defined for a task, but no one has any idea how the process works, or who the contact person is"
good,Citi fostered a great learning environment for it's employee and managers it was a good place to work. The concept of partners in accountable was great and one of the fairest was to manage people.
good,"The stress places on the upper management seems to find it's way down to the entry level employees which made it difficult to perform effectively. When looking to be promoted, it was a challenge because if you aren't waiting for someone who is awaiting retirement to move out of the way, you're promised the promotion then not given the opportunity at all."
good,"We are extremely overworked and do not feel we have any voice in how to spend our days anymore.  In the last 18 months they once again had a re-org and changed management and direction.  There is no training and many of us have been relegated to project admin type jobs, just because management has lost a foothold on what the new regime wants and how to implement it.  This is very discouraging and hard to watch, much less to live through.  The bulk of staff in the digital space are looking for new positions which is sad because none of us thought we'd be leaving."
good,definitely an accomplish first based culture in which doesn't take an approach which supports the culture of the staff.  I enjoy working with my peers though.
good,"The job itself isn't terrible: very fast-paced, which I love; always something new to learn; great exposure. However, management puts too much emphasis on corporate politics and not enough on rewarding a job well-done. Management is upward focused, not engaging with their subbordinates. They maintain the status quo and will hold back whoever disrupts it."
good,Changes are expected but in the past we were given advanced notice now we know after the fact. My site closed I work at home and very hard to focus. I have a lot of responsibility but I am also micromanaged
good,Leaving Citi after 15+ years was one of the hardest choices I've ever made. But it has turned out to be the most liberating one as well. Citi used to really focus on its employees and those employees were passionate about growing the company. After 2008 it all changed and not for the best. They are not as focused on the SMB and the small home loan purchaser any longer. Only the high net and large equity businesses get the love now. I hope and wish this strategy changes some day.
good,"This is a corporation. If you do not understand what that means well, it is in who you know in this company. You will not advance unless you have a friend or are friends with a manager. Its simple."
good,"Not a bad call center, typical high pressure and micro-managed  employee time requirements. Focus on the negative and call reviews dissect every word placement and handle time, hard to keep a positive attitude. Computer systems glitchy, and management not very good about communicating changes to all facets of the business so everyone is on the same page."
good,"I worked with them for a long time however, I didn't feel there was a lot of advancement opportunities.    when I decided to leave there were a lot of departments being outsourced"
good,"Ambiente de trabajo con altibajos, momentos de divertimento y contracción al trabajo y momentos de contradicciones administrativas respecto de políticas y procedimientos"
good,"Worked there for many years. Looking to leave the company. The job can be tedious, however my current position is very rewarding. I get to help people and that is an amazing feeling."
good,I love the benefits but it is honestly a slave shop. Although the pay is great and benefits when it comes to surgical or fmla is great working  there is not good
good,Good place to learn basics with large number of varied opportunities. A bit restrictive on the way one can ideate and grow. Work life balance can do better however is largely dependent on role.
good,"When I started back in Sept we learned that Citibank converted all Costco AMEX to now be under Citi, therefore high call volume was in effect. The team I started with were basically the test bunnies as we barely got 3 weeks of what was supposed to be 6 weeks, or so we were told, that way they could get us out on the floor. The trainers were excellent despite the speed of the course. We get automatic day 1 benefits which was great, everything else promised didn't really come through. I think that the conversion caused a failure within the internal aspect because it isn't organized well, there is miscommunication and unfortunately they always give you the reason as ""the C in Citi stands for change..."". as you can guess, there came a big snowball effect that followed which is still happening which is why I started to look elsewhere. All in all the company is great as it does promote diversity, individualism and culture, just some adjustments in the way things are promised and actually done need to be corrected."
good,"I felt little organization and very limited room to move up in my position. Clients are very reluctant to outbound calls, and upper management has not created a clear set of goals for us."
good,"Citi has a culture dubbed as misleading and advantage-seeking. Communication amongst departments isn't always present and assumptions can easily be obtained, resulting in breakdowns of cohesiveness."
good,"The company offers a lot of opportunities to learn and build your resume. The environment can be quite stressful and I would not suggest it for individuals that do not perform well under pressure. "
good,"No work life balance, many systems don't function properly, procedures in some departments are poorly written, frequent layoffs, great health benefits."
good,"Empresa muito boa, porém peca no quesito recurso humanos. Promoções acontecem, mas nao remuneram os analistas de acordo com a responsabilidade que lhe foi atribuida. Em geral, é uma empresa que permite que o rorfissional aprenda o serviço, mas nao o especializa no assunto."
good,"Citi will provide you attractive packages for the employees. However one should have to take care of his personal life as well as career, which is bit tough task in Citi."
good,Depending on your manager is what makes or breaks this career.  I unfortunately had a manager with poor managerial skills.  She showed zero appreciation to any additional work that was completed.  Always spoke about what you did incorrectly rather than speak to individuals on what they did correctly.
good,"Citibank as a Junior Credit Analyst, Processing all the credit card applications in line with Credit Policies and Procedures."
good,"Many exciting opportunities to work in a global organizations.  On the downside, Citi can be an overly matrixed organizations that is top heavy on regs/rules/processes that can create conflict.  Poor work/life/balance structure."
good,Retail banking management needs improvements . work life balance is discourage by upper management on the retail side of citibank
good,We contacted customers regarding delinquent credit card accounts. The job was easy management was difficult at times.
good,"Typical work day -  at desk answering phone calls back to back"
good,Strong organisation but limited emphasis on people angle. More authoritative approach from leadership & less transparency & inclusivity in ways of working.
good,helps you to have both financial and technical knowledge. but you will feel like lack of innovation if you are more techie.. and wanna go ahead more in technical field.
good,decent company to work with which helps you to get both financial and technical knowledge.but if u r really tech oriented person it may not be a good place to go ahead.
good,Review contracts and ensure clients requests are answer on a timely mater to help in any needs and answer any questions or concerns they may have. Good place to work for.
good,I was a supervisor here in a department.  Decent amount of time off and good insurance benefits and company match on the 401K.  Ratings given at the supervisor level were often subjective with little data to back them up which I find to be a negative aspect.  My operations manager was very emotional and would bring her personal problems to work which made this a negative experience for me overall.
good,Management needs to be trained better in how to treat their employees to make them enjoy their job and want to come to work.
good,"Overall a nice place to work, office culture and environment is good."
good,Challenging environment.  Seem to be cutting just as many jobs as they are adding.  Work / Life Balance is sometimes challenging.  They are adopting a work remote model in some areas.
good,"When I originally got the job offer for bank teller, I was actually quite happy.  I know it's not the greatest job to have, it definitely isn't glamorous in any way, but as a person who is going to college, it's not a bad job.  The pay isn't horrible.  That's actually one of the things that keep me working there.  When browsing for internships, or other jobs, they all seem to pay less than what I make while working as a teller.  Either way, everyone's experience is going to be different.  The particular branch I was working for, there was a high turnover rate.  In the first seven months that I worked there, I saw 5 people either get transferred or fired.  In Citi, there's a lot of transferring and moving around of people.  Management does this, irrespective of whether you want to, or not."
good,"Worked as customer service representative. Working in a call center, Handling customer questions regarding credit cards account. Performed sales and service on accounts"
good,"You take phone calls, you do it well you can get bonus'."
good,"Citigroup had a big layoff this year.  The people at Citi are great.  The most enjoyable part of the job, was that people worked as a team.  The hardest part of the job was changes without knowledge."
good,"Management slow to promote talent, and not a very modern workplace. However I did enjoy my role, but had to leave due to no advancement despite stellar reviews."
good,"didnt real care about employees , which is why they had a high turn over . no room for adavance management micro mananged. didnt care if you want to get education"
good,"I have learned alot working at Citi, I appreciate them giving me a chance even tho I had no banking experience just a fast food background."
good,"Dealing with clients constantly,you will always encounter some unpleasant ones. But, is always enjoyable serving and helping the kind ones.  Not being very talkative, doing referrals are not my strongest suite."
good,"Only for the dedicated and intense business or financial person. "
good,Every day is challenge to work here and task was very typical and awarded three times with champions heart by handling personal loans and achieve the targets
good,I was not very happy with being displaced.  I do not really believe that they are going to save all the money they told us by outsourceing
good,"A day at work would start and end with labor;offloading one container after the next full of heavy boxes. since Citistaff is a work agency I wouldn't be able to stay working at the same warehouse. I worked everyday at one until they no longer require us to work there:they would send me home until the next time they call me. I had no permanent or long term co-workers because i would never work at the same warehouse where supervisors always be at for the supervision and management of the agency's workers. I've been called for work across the LA Harbor in Compton, Carson and Long Beach. The last warehouse I worked at was Yusen Logistics. I enjoyed Yusen because the task was very simple and there was no hard labor needed to be done and it was consistent. But it was too far for me to keep going after my transportation got another job and I couldn't make it to work anymore."
good,A positive overall experience working in a fast paced environment.  Management are helpful but career progression can be slow (internal applications often pending for months).
good,"Depending on which department you are in, would determine the review I could give. "
good,I reviewed credit applications and approved or denied loans as needed. Assisted customers with payment arangments. Was a very fast paced work environment and the hours were not conductive to a family environment.
good,"Citi affords opportunities to build professional knowledge in risk management.  Since joining Citi, I have had the opportunity to set program direction and strategy, for a number of first and second line of defense programs.  Working closely with both front-line and senior managers, I have set direction for its O&T Risk Architecture, including defining and managing: Risk Indicators, the Risk Intelligence Platform, and Issue Management Framework."
good,"Citi is a very fast organization and I encourage anyone to learn as much as they can and seek additional opportunities."
good,"This is a good place to work . Extremely professional people work here and one can learn and develop good inter personal skills."
good,Company has been through at least 5 major reorganizations in the past 4 years which keeps everyone on edge on if they will be displaced with the next one. Senior management has changed yearly. Far to many leaders and not enough of executing team.
good,"Day in and Day out you have to deal with the General Public's Banking issues while trying to obtain sales in any which way you can. If your a hustler this job is great, can give you a nice monthly pay out but if your just in to cash a check this isn't your territory, you will quickly be driven out."
good,"employee benefit are awesome, when it comes to management its little bit poor, but over all not a bad company to work, enjoyed working with pro co-workers"
good,"Great thing about this job is you will get benefits for part time work, in my experience that is rare. "
good,Management is promoted based solely on politics.  They continuously move positions out of the United States to the Philippines and Poland.  Benefits are average at best. I would not recommend.
good,"Telecommuting 1-2 times a week was a plus.  Communication and training left a lot to be desired."
good,"Need more emphasis on work life balance, great environment to learn working in a developing processes and unstructured environment."
good,"Dynamic and diverse environment"
good,"ok work environment with lots of job openings. However, limited room to move up in the company at this site with lower salaries offered."
good,"Having worked for Citi for many years I have been exposed to a lot of different experiences.  In the realm of work/life balance I can advise that it is very skewed towards the work side.  A typical day for me starts in the office at 6 AM (which means I leave my home at 4:30am).  Typically I do not leave the office until 9 PM.  So for those of you doing the math, that would leave less than 6 hours once I get home to do things like eat, sleep and the rest of the things we typically include in the ""life balance"" side."
good,"Dynamic environment."
good,Working for Citi was great.  This company is attempting to sell assets so they are downsizing.  Citi was a wonderful place to work with a high pressure day that was never the same.
good,"Citi is working on getting better technology, and improving their customer service every day. Treat their employees well, development them and there are opportunities for advancement."
good,"Great talented individuals good employee activities, but extremely poor management. The company is a good place to start-up early in your career and gain knowledge of the corporate world, but could get touch when dealing with poor management and HR support."
good,Culture and work life balance need to be improved. Teamwork is non-existent amount some teams and you end up doing more work than needed. Training is poor. They have a few managers that are not skilled at managing people.
good,"My typical day at work consisted of assisting customers, which I loved.  I also was able to train new hires and be the lead for my team, due to my experience in citi policies  and overall customer service quality.  I was ranked #1 (out of over 500 employees) for customer satisfaction, legal compliance, and sales.  Up until I left I was still the only person to have ever achieved that trifecta.  However, when Citi found they had someone able to produce so well, they refused any other kind of promotions to management.  I was told this numerous times by upper management.  I decided it was time to go to my true passion, the medical field.  Specifically Nursing.  I do miss my co-workers and still remain in touch with them.  Quite a few are no longer there as well."
good,"One of the best financial institutions across the globe."
good,"Productive and always busy environment but not very good management skills on the particular unit, but overall I did enjoyed working for them even if the pay wasn't the perfect"
good,They don't care about you as an individual. They were not really knowledgeable of the industry. The management was very rude and mean.
good,"Busy, learn attention to detail,manage people,build team work with co-workers, No room for mistakes, brings the best in you"
good,Sears Credit used to be a fun department to work in because of how well management and reps got along. The past 6 months it has drastically gone downhill with quality and with managers not wanting to help or look out for their reps. People have been throw under the bus and have been looked down upon without investigation and proper procedures of handling complaints.
good,The work and training courses for this job are not hard but the job does require your full attention because you are handling very important and personal information. The environment is like any office setting job. You will work with motivated people and great customers.
good,"We have this yearly event which is also know as company retreat whereby I was given a chance to go oversea with my team mates and also other staffs from other department. "
good,"At times, there are too many variables in the day to day and even week to week which makes it challenging to execute your work."
good,"Comair was wonderful to work for if you became senior enough to be a line holder.  With this, you could manipulate your schedule, pick up additional flying if wanted/needed.  However, if you were not lucky enough to hold a line, and were on reserve, life could be pretty grim.  Thanks to Comair's parent company, Delta, and representation (or lack there of) via the pilot's union, ALPA, Comair ceased to exist in October of 2012."
good,"Decent middle of the road place to work as a software developer, but there's many much better places out there."
good,If possible temp in a few groups before being assigned. if  you are starting out this is a great place to start your career.
good,expect to work hard and many long hours. If you value time with your family this may not be where you want to work. Over time is given daily.
good,"Rotina do dia a dia sempre a mesma, tediosa."
good,"Same phone call for 8 hours, activate cards, close call repeat. No knowledge or skill needed for position. Advancement is far a few between."
good,If you are in school they really are flexible in working with your schedule. They also encourage team building and communication
good,There was not much upward mobility at Citi.   I was able to work remotely which allows me to have a great work life balance.      Most enjoyable part of the job is that you get to work with so many different entities and are exposed to different folks and ideas.
good,"I loved the people and the fact that I was not micromanaged. However, the pay is below other industries. I was laid off unexpectedly, even though the Company kept stating that they were being transparent with Corporate changes. Management is always a step behind, they lay off when they shouldn't and then the work load increases to an inhuman amount. I work very hard and have a great work ethic, however, management realizes that the employees cannot realistically meet goals.  I loved the people but the upper management is always a step behind."
good,"Great company, just needs to change around management or rotate them. Some get too comfortable and would not allow change that might work better with new employees."
good,"There seems to be a high turnover rate at Citi (BANAMEX USA). There is little room for advancement and the work life balance is a little rough. Furthermore, this is an extremely high stress environment, though the conditions have improved over the years. The pay is also ok."
good,Good exposure to a different way of thinking. But very specific to citi environment as citi environment is very huge and highly customized for citi.
good,"A good company to work in early part of the career."
good,"Having worked at other institutions they have one of the best client bases to work, network, and develop with. Compensation was great but like most other places downsizing commissions and dry archaic management culture made the experience difficult."
good,"•	Cash checks and pay out money after verifying that signatures are correct, that written and numerical amounts agree, and that accounts have sufficient funds"
good,"For the most part Citi was not a bad company to work for.  The benefits were very good, but the compensation as compared to competing companies was at or near the bottom.  I was able to work from home for several years which was nice.  Our department was shuffled around and we got new management.  The working conditions and culture really declined under the new management.  Before our department was very stable, but we starting having firings and layoffs.  Also our work from home situation was ended.  At this point I sought and got employment elsewhere.  The first few years were great; the last year not so much."
good,Great people. Marketing efforts are unfocused and legal driven which is challenging. Learned how to negotiate with lawyers. Enjoy managing a very talented and hard working staff.
good,"Underpaid, understaffed, no real room for growth, petty salary increases, unsatisfactory employee compensation such as offering Pizza & Ice Cream parties for meeting your sales goals."
good,It is a good job for someone who is just starting out or a college student that needs a steady income. It does not open many doors for advancement and it is overall not a great place to stay for the long term.
good,"As soon as we enter the office, we have to contact our respective branch if there is any deposits (which is highly prioritized by the company), so we can prepare ourselves for a hectic schedule. And less priorities follows. We need to process as much as invoices we can so we are not behind in the deliveries. "
good,Traditional corporate banking environment.  Had the opportunity to work with some of the largest global corporations.
good,"A typical day at Global Credit and Collection Corp. was, starting 8am till our breaks we'd have to be really focused with our calls."
good,"Tons of job security, but extremely dull work. "
good,A great place to start a career with great benefits and paid time off. There are so many different departments you are certain to find a job you love.
good,Could be better in many management areas especially human resources and work assignments.
good,"Its an experience to work with a global bank citibank which is very well know organisation in the world. True to the puch line ""Citi Never Sleep"" people work for very long hours."
good,"The most enjoyable part of the job is the VOE (Voice of the Employee). VOE allows employees the opportunity  to voice their opinion on any suggestions or concerns they may have. On a typical day I would file and follow-up on claims, requesting payment for expenses incurred during the foreclosure process. Very Diverse environment."
good,The company spends time on coaching bettering their employees.
good,"This review is for the operations facility located on Boltonfield Dr. in Columbus, Ohio. This location displayed poor culture, lack of advancement opportunities and marginal pay. The management team was limited and did not try to develop employees. This was an overall poor working environment with poor execution and lack of direction."
good,"I learned excellent customer servicing skills and the ability to 'get it done' even in the most difficult situation. Having a good manager is key to advancement and promotion"
good,Job security and growth within in the company has been non excitant.
good,"Ok, not an easy way to advance fast or growth, very old school bank and policies.  good training, but not enough traffic."
good,I've learned how to listen to my own calls and grade myself and make changes and improvements. Worked along great peers. With so much support from them.
good,"performed a variety of routine and non-routine loan administration, operations, customer service or administrative support duties such as data entry, record keeping, research, report writing, escrow, account reconciliation, telephone inquiries, internal/external customer requests, research, and correspondence as described by department policies and procedures. Responsibilities included completing requests from customers (internal or external) regarding account information, regulations, special promotions, and bank policies by phone or in writing."
good,"working at Citibank was always different. Things changed often and quickly. There was always a diversified staff to work with, along with many shifts to suit ones needs. "
good,"Overall, great experience to work with a large group, specially the pricing team. As an analyst, we looked to find savings from the fee charged by 3rd party banks for different services and transactions."
good,This was a well paying position but the workload was usually overwhelming and the life work balance eventually was non-existing. The management staff and my co-workers were very pleasant to work with. The job consisted of very little human contact and I would be much more suited for a position that allowed me to interact with people.
good,Here is one of the places that I honed my communication and problem solving abilities. Diverse environment. Good burritos poor management
good,Company has laid off hundreds of employees over the past few years.  The pay is comparable to other call centers and collections department.  Allows employees to compete for monthly bonuses.  Comfortable working environment.
good,Citifinancial is a work place that isnt for you if you have family. You have to   work late   days twice a week and weekends.  Productivity is all you hear if you arent where you need to be--upper manager  will write you up.
good,I enjoy my time here. I love my co workers. The benefits are great.
good,"40 plus hour work week"
good,"Corporate work life balance. Work hours are very bad. There is good job security, cafeteria with several options available on campus but personally thought it was bit pricey. Good potential for growth."
good,Very few opportunities to advance your career outside of the collections realm.
good,"Sales and Revenue focus "
good,I learned the most from this job at Citi because this is where i began my sales career and overall it was enjoyable.
good,Citi was my 1st banking job and as a Collector I found the job challenging however it helped me get into the door of a sector I had never worked in.
good,You have the ability to become a permanent employee with some positions.
good,"Working in the fraud early warning department for cit bank is very interesting. You Learn new procedures daily. Assisting  customers and specialty merchants either process new credit applications or review the account for fraud. helping victims of identity theft protect their credit and finances is probably the best part of this job. I enjoy helping people in any way i can. The hardest part of this job i would have to say is the strict procedures we follow. They serve a great purpose so i dont disagree with the procedures,however they sometimes make the task more difficult to perform."
good,My daily job is answering incoming phone calls from our clients/ hardest part of the job is not being able to log off the phone until lunch/ end of duty/
good,"A fast paced, numbers oriented work culture. "
good,There is a lot of scope to learn but the management doesn't bother to encourage and motivate the employees
good,Challenging work in adhering to Citi's Policy and Procedures; constant change. Great team members.
good,"Great coworkers, felt like a payment center, needs improvement in management."
good,"Citi has a good reputation but many of the processes that you depend on are broken. "
good,AGF is  good company I just got stuck in a District with poor management at that time.  Promised to get promoted and District Manager ended up bringing in her best friend as Manager instead. Company has excellent benefits and training opportunities.
good,I would recommend this company as a good company to work for.
good,"In my former position I identified unusual transactions patterns on clients’ accounts and contacted clients to determine validity of checks and signature items that have been presented and deemed suspect."
good,"I have been able to obtain 13 years of experience in a number of IT facets within Citi. A typical day in IT at Citi is network and system administration, active directory management, software and hardware deployment, trouble and request queue management, server capacity management, voice over IP install requests. I feel the hardest part of my job is managing my time to fit all of my responsibilities in each day. The most enjoyable part is working with a fantastic team of IT technicians. I also really enjoy working with the clients and teaching them some best practices to help them manage their work each day."
good,Overall good benefits but no job security due to mortgage industry meltdown in 2005.l
good,I love my bcoz i meet new people everyday and learn many things in my feild with co workers and my clients.
good,"Good place to begin a financial career. A good place to learn the basics about the Financial industry with ""real world"" expectations. Growth and advancement opportunities are underwhelming however."
good,"A typical day for Citi included calling people to try and collect money from them. It was hard some days, and some days were pretty easy. Had to be careful with how you approached every situation, and how the people took what you were saying. Had to also put yourself in their shoes and be empathetic with them."
good,I came in not long after the market crash. Many permanent employees had already been terminated and many more for the next 5 years.No one I worked with had much sense of job security and that made for a very low morale.
good,"very professional work environment, but almost oppressively so."
good,"good"
good,"Customer Care...accept incoming calls from mortgage loan,  application customers, Citi associated departments.  Resolve mortgage questions, concerns and complaints.  Accept payments and update customer information."
good,"Huddling for morninig meetings and Accessing all systems "
good,"Learning is very high as there is lot of product process even the hardest task can be learned fast.No work Life Balance,as delegation of work is not done rightly"
good,"Maintained and maintenance many business and personal account "
good,"Very diverse environment, learn from different coworkers and/or management. Some days are challenging to reach individual standard and/or shift standards. Being able to listen to ipod or music device while working, majority of the time its one person a machine. Very physical demanding but for the most part enjoyable."
good,"Participei de um projeto  piloto chamado master para profissionais com idade acima de 50 anos, devido a crise no banco extinguiram o projeto e participei por 6 meses"
good,They bring you in and talk about all the top producers. Once you are on the floor you are locked to your desk.
good,My day at work starts at 7 am . Every day is a new learning experience. Management is understanding and co workers are awesome.I get a lot of support from my colleagues which means my job isnt that hard. the most enjoyable part of my job is the weird complaints I get to hear on calls.
good,Go through the daily task Calender  and follow the priorities. Call clients to follow up and set their expectations. Response to all e-mails on priority basis. Stay alert on the branch platform to make sure a professional work environment.
good,Banking is changing and an industry shift is advisable. Great loan products and many tenured employees.
good,I loved my job and the people I supported. What I learned from being in this large corporation is that the only constant is change which can also be the hardest part of the job.
good,IT is a Professional Company.There is lot to learn but the work pressure is too much ao not able to balance the work and life.
good,"Continuous Global team conference calls (Non-Stop).  Good people, but the organizations is not easy to navigate the cross functional ""walls"" of responsibility."
good,not so much life work balance. not the best place but still nice
good,"What can you say about a firm that had 350K employees worldwide?  There are way too many managers, teams, and divisions to define a ""culture"" or even summarize management.  Maybe you work for a good manager who likes you, maybe you don't.  Pay is universally known to be extremely poor and I was no exception.  While there is a lot of opportunity for advancement, good luck with that as you'll be battling it out with 40 other schmucks looking to fill the same role.  Was a waste of years of my professional life.  The only thing good I can say about Citi is that I met my wife there.  She hated working there as well."
good,"Low paying, undervalued, high volume of work, constantly changing work procedures."
good,"A typical day begins with maintaining and managing all of the corporate applications, testing, and user end supporting."
good,"It's a good company, however there focus on customer service is generic. It doesnt allow ot be unique with the customer. They care mostly on a new accounts."
good,Challenging environment with always complex projects with very tight schedule
good,"I learned how to be a better team player, asking for help when needed and I was always willing to help whenever I could. my manager was a great person to work for and taught me a lot. my co-workers were by far the best I have ever worked with."
good,Citi Trust is a Good Company to work for. Since working for Citi Trust I have been promoted 2 times. My co-workers makes it worth traveling to work.
good,"Nice pay, but no support from management.  Lots of promises for advancement, but never any follow through. "
good,"I learned a lot about financial products."
good,"Not much to say. An ok place to work, but too much favoritism displayed throughout the work place. Mostly about who you know rather than what you know."
good,Pay O.K.
good,The typical work day involved being on the phone all day. Trying to find and get people to pay their car notes. I learned how to be professional while talking to people who all had different lives. Management was helpfull and good at teaching. Most of the co-workers helped each other. The hardest part of the job was not being able to help some people when they needed it.
good,"Citigroup is now a global diversified financial services holding company whose businesses provide consumers, corporations, governments and institutions with a broad range of financial products and services. Citi has approximately 200 million customer accounts and does business in more than 140 countries. Citigroup currently operates, for management reporting purposes, via two primary business segments: Citicorp, consisting of our Regional Consumer Banking businesses and Institutional Clients Group; and Citi Holdings, consisting of our Brokerage and Asset Management and Local Consumer Lending businesses, and a Special Asset Pool."
good,"Great co-workers, outstanding benefits. However, poor compensation and growth within the company."
good,"typical work day was sometimes busy. did day to day tickets and projects, had a good relationship with co-worker and supervisor."
good,"I worked for citi for a long time. i must say I liked what i did, but I felt the only way to move up in the company was by who you knew. Their where co-workers that I out-shined and my scores were higher and also I had been there longer. Just because they were friends with certain people they received promotions that I applied for that I know I qualified for. I must say they allowed people to come in and ignore the dress code, the hardest part of this job is trying to except the fact that you really have to know people to get somewhere in the company."
good,not so bad
good,"Handle customer accounts, take payments over the phone, customer service"
good,Citi needs to improve and streamline their multiple processes.
good,Typical day of work taking up to 300 calls per day Great co workers always ready to lend a hand if needed.
good,"Not much to say about this position. I only labeled this one because it is the most relevant of my work experience, definitely not all of it. However, needless to say, this is also the path of experience I want to build for my career (in this case data entry in a financial company). The management wasn't the greatest, and the length of employment was too short - makes me weary of any temp-to-hire position whatsoever."
good,Always work to be done.
good,Talking to the customers was enjoyable however the handletime goals were quite tight and made it hard to really service the customers in a personal manner as first point on contact and results are measured by survey results so excellent service is essential for success. The people I worked with were great I worked in student loans dept before they shut it down enjoyed that the most. Gave white glove treatment to current and prospective med and law school students handle time was not an issue. Also assisted with the customer service sup gate with escalated calls.
good,Worked for financial advisors and they were amazing and made each day a new adventure. The company did merge with Morgan Stanley and the values of the company changed.
good,"citibank is great place to work, they offer the best benefits and compensation. They give you time for your family when you needed it."
good,pay is good. no chance for advancement. easily fired. shifts are available.
good,"A typical day at Citigroup starts with numbers, numbers, and balancing numericl totals"
good,During my tenure at citigroup I had the pleasure to work along side some of the best unit managers in the industry. I took my job very serious and worked hard every day to lead my agents and to make sure we did everything possible to satisfy the customer.
good,"As an employee there is so much to do throughout the day; solicit, collect, file, pay office bills, prepare daily accounting paperwork, close loans, sell insurance on those loans, put the file together, file insurance claims, answer the phones, reach delinquency goals and it repeats day after day. Overall, never monogamous, but can get overwhelming."
good,"A typical day at work: answering calls, opening accounts, money transfers, responding to needs and requests of financial advisors and clients. I was laid off in 2009 when our entire branch closed down due to financial instability. Most of the Financial Advisors left Smith Barney and a lot of the Client Service Associates were let go. It was a tough time in the financial job market."
good,Citi taught me a great deal about running your won shop and taking responsibility for all your work. It is a great global company to work for.
good,good co good invirment the people were warm and welcoming the call center i worked at closed wish i was still there
good,*MUITO MOVIMENTO.
good,"Really thought this was going to be a career position I would retire from but ended up getting laid off with 80 thousand other people. Yes, I am a little disgruntled!"
good,Call center. The best part of the job was assisting customers who where going thru a financial strain work out payment arrangements.
good,"the job i held here it was terrible specially since it was their credit card division in the South. if you do not have thick skin and do not have a shrink evaluate your mental health, this job is not for you. between the corporate, financial policies and customer abuse, this job was a nightmare."
good,Citigroup is a good place to work. I am provided the ability to work remote.
good,They are outdated in technology and training. They can structure the program that enhances the quality of life they provide; inside and outside of the job.
good,I enjoy working herre but large corporations care rather about a degree rather than what someone can actually do. It seems like anyone can get a degree but can they use it?
good,Working at Citi provided a fast-paced environment where those interested in making a name and making a difference in the company could do so.
good,"Citi in one of the world's largest financial industries that employs over 400,000 employees globally. There has been tremendous turnover in management and in its workforce. I cannot give an overall rating for the company, since there are so many different opportunities and environments. I enjoy working in their technology areas where good work is recognized and rewarded."
good,"Although Citibank is a great place to jump start a financial or banking career, you must be really interested in sales--and nothing more. Each day is very long and oftentimes boring because there is very little foot traffic. The majority of the day can be classified as downtime, but upper management is always coming down on the branch to make sales. Ideally, it is an awesome place to work, but, realistically, I feel as though there needs to be a completely revamped business plan and a new, more practical, strategy to accomplishing goals. On a brighter note, it is a pretty comfortable office, the people who work there are very cool and there is a great wealth of information that is easy to learn and very easy to transfer at other jobs."
good,"The Company is good to work for. There have been a lot of jobs moving to other countries, causing many layoffs."
good,• Although I had a what could be categorized as rocky start with Citi.
good,Whenever I needed help I could not find a manger to help me. And my department manager never worked the same shift as our team. The offshore vendor partners made the work more difficult as well.
good,"Citi was a very busy atmosphere. I worked in collections for past due credit card accounts. It taught me how to approach different personal situations when calling people that have gone through hardships. Management was great with training and working with you to strive to become the best at the job that you were given. The hardest thing, trying to meet your production. The most enjoyable thing is to participate in the different activities like Meals on Wheels and having the chance to give back."
good,Overall my time spent at Citi was ok. It never offered any advancement opportunities that highlighted my skills as a leader and awesome salesman having prior managment experience.
good,"I love the team base set up, as well as the culture and value of the organisation"
good,"Started working when it was still Associates Home Equity office. I was recruited from my previous employer to come work there. I was sent to training in Texas and was satisfied with the position until Citigroup bought out Associates and then a few months later, they closed the office and I was laid off. I was tapped to stay and pack up the office and prepare everything for shipout to home office."
good,"Good benefits, bad management, not a place to grow professionally."
good,If you have a medical condition DO NOT work here. I was not given the time off to go to the emergency room due to my condition at least 4 times in the 2 years I worked there. I had two other co workers that quit as well because Citibank did not provide the time off needed to go to dr appointments.
good,Good company to work for and great benefits the the compensation plan change it used to be monthly and quarterly now it's only quarterly so the money I used to do less know
good,"Pros: performance base incentive is awesome,co workers are great"
good,"I work as part of the Engineering teams that make the operating systems work with our architecture.  It's a lot of pressure, the teams are very disorganized although they are now implementing Agile to smooth things out.  The environment is very toxic, most employees in the engineering group do not respect each other and management doesn't pay attention to employee relations because they are all focused on work and project deadlines.  It has great benefits and depending on who your manager is you have the flexibility to work from home."
good,Management/upper coworkers would make someone feel bad for asking questions or needing assistance as needed. The company has really unrealistic expectations for their employees.
good,Citi is a very fast paced place to work. Most of the customers are kind and just want help with their accounts. You do have some people who call in angry but it's your job to help them.
good,"Pros: "
good,"Positives are volunteer program, on site medical clinic, and diversity.  Citi is a champion of all people without regard to race, gender nationality, sexual orientation, etc and lend their name to initiatives for equality. Volunteer program is excellent. You receive 1 paid day off a year to volunteer at an opportunity through their program. Also enjoyed that there is some variety in the work and not all the exact same thing everyday. All levels are overworked and micromanaged here. Citi has become stressful due to increased workload (without additional compensation) and micromanaging. You are managed down to the second. Training time and training materials are lacking information and completeness."
good,If you have a serious ailment or disability this is not the job for you when it comes to FMLA and MetLife. Pay is decent but the stress can become overwhelming if you don't have an understanding manager. They are about making bonuses. Let's say it's an experience that you have to learn on your own depending on the position you sign up for. Not all of Citi is bad.
good,"Excellent benefits, and very flexible work schedules. However,  "
good,it was a  great opportunity being able to speak  to different types of customers and convincing them to listen and act was a challenge yet fruitful when it worked out. The interesting part about the job is the confidence you have when you know well your product and able to convince your customer through a phone call without being physical presence. The difficult part is facing rejection but it builds you eventually which is important.
good,Working at Citi is a good experience. I had learned a lot. My senior help me out in every aspect. Management is very helpful. Working pressure is very high as I am in the credit card operation department.
good,"Citi has a horrifying week Senior Management, with no Leadership, No truth, No trust anymore. Speaking about my experiences, to much and permanent reorganisations, producing confusion and frustration for staff and customers. To many managers listen to the wrong people and wasting the companies money with ridiculous strategic decisions based on wrong assumptions given by clueless people. You will find a world full of fear, where the few good people left have to be very quite to avoid to get there heads cut off in the next ""right placement"" round. High skilled people and teams, capable to manage issues quick and efficient have been fired. Their core knowledge is wasted and gone, their responsibilities have been moved to so called ""low cost"" locations."
good,"Their Hotel structure is not conducive to solid training.  I suggest that you do not expect training and hope the person assigned to train you is ok with the task. If not, and they have an established ""clique "" (and sadly, most do),  they could sabotage you as ""punishment"".  Management (&everyone else) is too busy either being new (i.e. thrown-in) in their position,  or jockeying for their next promotion "
good,Good company to work for with competitive salary and benefits.  The best part of working for Citi is that they listen to the employees and try and make a change.
good,"Over-all CIti company is great.  However Executive level collections management is poor, more concerned with self promotion and covering up mistakes compared to doing what is right for the company."
good,Waiting for crowd flow. Learned to be independent and patient.Hardest part is to make people stop and listen. Most enjoyable part is to work with good colleagues
good,Good place to work and learned a lot of people skills along with technical stuff. High paced environments and all applications are super critical for business and needs extra efforts.
good,"Competitive salary with good benefits. Work at home options are available in various departments, mostly dependent on the managers preferences. Citi also has a great community service program to get involved in our community."
good,"My thoughts are you do the job the best of your ability.  I was brought up with a strong work ethic. At Citi if you are lucky you are recognized, but that is the exception."
good,its a melting pot of people from all walks of like and its extremely stressful and very hard at times and some days it makes you want to give up but your co workers som make working at citi the best
good,"Gravy Train: Resume builder, good comp and benefits, Exposure to Different Areas with Some Opportunities to Try Them"
good,"Some of them are good at what they do, and some of them aren't. You just have to live with it. Pay is on the low end of the scale. Unfortunately, there is a lot of boot-licking, especially among the management."
good,"Citi was very good to me over the 30+ years I served there.  As a large organization I was able to change jobs every couple of years without leaving the company.  Since the Financial Crisis, Citi has adopted an extreme risk averse climate with focus on meeting budgets over and above every other goal.  It has transitioned us into a very tough organization to make changes while they transition most of the IT work to India from the USA."
good,"- can possibly maintain a good work-life balance"
good,"A typical day is just making payments, assisting with online trouble, management shows favoritism, like I states above the job is full of variety, different job opportunities but for certain people."
good,Ive been employed with Citi since 2000 but laid off twice. Love the company but hate the turnover. They do have great benefits and tuition reimbursement. If you are young it's a great company to start with.
good,"Who you know and are friends with is rewarded higher than work quality. Will intentionally rate you as below average your first year in a role, regardless of performance."
good,"Management wasn't very supporting, however the branch staff was great which made life bearable."
good,"Heavy individual workloads not allowing team relationships to flourish"
good,The culture is based on meritocracy. Although the hiring experience I have had in the past is that the company cares more about loyalty and longevity rather than skills based and results.
good,A place where great people work very hard to get things done. lacking good leadership with the main cause being not listening to employees to make things better.
good,"Citi talks about advancement and how important it to grow and advance.  It is so difficult to make that transition if you are not perfect with numbers.  You get put on Performance Plan after Performance Plan and you can not move on, no applying out while on the plan.  If you know you are not right for the department you are in, you are stuck the continuing to fail."
good,"Company culture is friendly and supportive, with ready collaboration across countries/regions.  The work is high-volume, fast-paced, and stressful, but employees seem to be paid fairly for the market.  Site amenities include cafe, fitness center, mail center, and dry cleaning, which help to offset the occasional long hours."
good,"Citi is great to work for but periodical reduction in staff is flawed resulting in losing talented team members. Hopefully, they change this in future."
good,"There wasn't much value put into the employees at Citibank. It felt more like we were a number on paper, no real attention was ever given to us. My direct manager was fantastic, however, as the management gets higher in the ranking you'll find that they care more about meeting sales goals than developing their employees ore restructuring less than effective practices."
good,In finance there is not much room to progress and the work is not challenging. If you are looking for work that stretches your ability this is not the place.
good,People I worked with at Citi are very intelligent and innovative. There is lot that I learned within my team. The group that I worked with work was always pushing boundaries to come up innovative solutions to very challenging problems.
good,"Highly matrixed organization, challenging to identify correct contacts. Constant management changes and fire drills. Current cost cutting efforts are making the environment even more challenging"
good,"Expansão muito agressiva, passando do segmento Corporate exclusivo para também pessoa física (varejo) alta renda, transição sem definição etapas atropeladas, falta de gestão de processos, humanização e comunicação intra e interpessoal deficiente sem definição clara da missão, visão e valores organizacionais."
good,"Citi has many IT departments. Each department has its own working culture and functions. "
good,"Overall, the work/ life balance, culture and management was not the best. There are people that skate on by and do not possess the needed qualities to be an effective manager. Furthermore, the work/life balance is not really there for people that have families and other priorities outside of work. It's strictly always about the better good of the bank (or the individual manager) versus assisting the respective employees. The culture of Citibank does not truly show gratitude or value for the work , time and effort employees put into the company itself."
good,"The group I work for work very well together.  Our projects are intense but we are able to accomplish a lot because of skill, not being micro managed and the folks we work with in the field."
good,"Unless your in a very select few departments, the work/life balance is not there unless at an entry level position and even then it's pretty tough.  Extremely political."
good,"Overall CITI is a good company to work for, the one thing I dont like about this company are the policies and procedures, the are not consistent......"
good,"Hostile, cut throat environment.  No training provided to employees.  No work life balance.  No room for advancement and growth.  No job security and balance."
good,"Unfortunately  the company have been in a constant change process sending jobs overseas and reducing operations in all the departments."
good,"Citigroup Inc. or Citi is an American multinational investment bank and financial services corporation headquartered in New York City. Citigroup is ranked 3rd on the list of largest banks in the United States and, alongside JP Morgan Chase, Bank of America, and Wells Fargo, it is one of the Big Four banks of the United States.[4] It is a systemically important financial institution and is on the list of systemically important banks that are too big to fail. It is one of the nine global investment banks in the Bulge Bracket."
good,Citi was okay to work for and not much different than a Wells Fargo. Management was good at first but was changed and awful at the end before the whole department was closed and layed off.
good,"City has good benefits.  However, it is hard to advance in the company unless you are really young.  People who have degrees will get passed over for younger people"
good,Citi bank was a great stepping stone to cross train for multiple areas because you are placed wherever the business needs put you. The only downside to this is since it is a business needs basis the increase in pay does NOT come with it.
good,Very stressful. Management was not trained to the job specific. Had only each other to depend on for help. No job security within the last few years. Company restructuring  to move departments offshore.
good,Competive and retirement benefits. They offer flexible schedules and tries to promote work life balance by making work from home  available for employees. However there is no career growth and job security is also low.
good,"Its OK to work there but always having to worry about being laid off.I have friends who I have worked with at other places over 17 to 20 years, but here they have been laid off 3 and 4 times, just looking for something more secure."
good,I worked for the company for 7 years. it was ok in the beginning however changes were made that made the job harder for the employees and more difficult for clients as well. pay was good but job is very very stressful.
good,"The Commercial Real Estate Finance department that I worked in was an amalgamation of employees from Glendale Federal Bank and (the First Nationwide version of) Cal Fed.  At the time of acquisition by Citibank, the department had the Tiffany of portfolios, with excellent credit policy.  Citibank is first, last and always a sales organization.  The best CCO that I had the pleasure to work under was let go because ""he got in the way of making deals"".  Underwriting policy was streamlined and credit was tailored to compete with Washington Mutual as it was about to go down the rabbit hole.  People were in fixed positions so long that the environment became strange and backbiting.  There was no real opportunity for advancement."
good,"The benefits of working at citi outweighed the bad aspects of the job. The insurance was good, the gym and cafeteria great. I enjoyed working there for the most part."
good,Pedi minha rescisão para retornar ao estado onde estava minha família.
good,"I left due to career advancement.  Team was great, the Managing Director even better.  I wanted more of a challenge.  I want more creative control a d responsibilities."
good,A typical day at work was repetitive. I learned some things pertaining to my job but was not given the opportunity to take any outside training or classes. Management was sometimes unfair. They didn't always support their employees. The hardest part of the job was getting cooperation from them. You were treated like you were an outsider. The most enjoyable part of the job was getting paid; although it wasn't the best.
good,As a fresher it's a great company to enter the job market with. Adds excellent weightage to your resume while providing international training experience under top trainees. Amazing stepping stone.
good,Senior Management hired from other banks can make repeat decisions and changes that have failed in the past.  Many employees are afraid to speak up.  The mistakes are repeated hurting customers and employees.
good,Is good place too work with many opportunities. The salaries are average. However the work life balance program is not fully optimized and more flexibility could be provided.
good,As a company to work for Citibank is a good place if its temporary. The job itself is boring and rhe routine is annoying. You have to repeat the same thing multiple times. The management stresses on collecting but alot of times its impossible to collect because people are simply broke. Employees were nice and the benefits were good but the job itself isnt for anyone. It can become depressing when you're repeating yourself all day buf some people can do it.
good,Too many short term upper management changes where management does not get to know its employees and the work executed. There is no clear communication from upper management.
good,Really good place to learn a job. The On the job training is the best part of working at Citi. The skills I learned while working here will take me a long way in my career
good,Constant meetings/interruptions.  Many are unnecessary. Hardest part of the job is lack of communication on what the leadership team is planning regarding staff.  Need more information/explanation as to why our company is not competitive regarding loan rates.
good,Best place to work. Senior leadership lead by examples. Good driver for knowledge. Keeps and make life simple. Adopt best practices and six Sigma tools
good,"Great place to learn, too bad mangers are looking to stifle competition and play favorites. Too much ""Transformation"" every 2 years.Very poor on-boarding process and lack any real orientation to people coming into middle management."
good,Once you login in the morning there are about a dozen emails and messages from people in different time zones. Most of the issues are considered to be urgent and time sensitive despite having limited resources and SLA agreement. Faced paced environment
good,"here the work is more of L2 analyst with very less learning, if anyone wants to remain in this profile then its good but if you are looking for better work with growth, then its better to switch the project.The best thing about this company is work from home."
good,"Competitive, Dynamic, Global environment.  No job security. No defined career paths. Creativity, and power networking is required to score  advancement opportunities.  Currently, focused on decreasing their presence in the NY tri-state area. Becoming receptive to flexible or remote working environments in certain divisions."
good,"Nice place to work learnt different culture"
good,"Terrible work/life balance - good benefits"
good,"I was hired in a mass hiring effort after government approval to refinance mortgages expanded. A typical day included answering 10 to 30 calls from mortgage holders looking at option for refinancing. Unfortunate a combination of refinancing options, market uncertainty and lack of management training and development made securing loans very difficult. The culture was very cut throat and management was only willing to help those who had been with the company for an extended period of time."
good,"long and tedious hours, company is great at being flexible with your hours, but the management and higher up treat you poorly, you are nothing but a number to the company, whatever is happening in your life does not matter to them, all that matters is that you produce good numbers"
good,"It's a call center job, so if that isn't your thing don't expect to enjoy it. They had a very good benefits package and a decent time off package. Management changed a lot, employees changed a lot, and policies changed a lot--all without warning most of the time. Their saying is ""The C in Citi stands for change"" but from an employee's perspective, all levels of management were on different pages and no one ever really had a good idea of what was going on. Miscommunications happened a lot and occasionally had some unfavorable consequences. "
good,"Typical day was to reach out to existing clients and deepen relationship and prospect for new business.  Morale with all branch staff was generally low.  Lack of technology created extra work, wasted time, and loss of business due to inefficiencies and redundancies."
good,"I like Citibank as a global company, but I don't feel it compensates its employees enough. As a personal banker, I'm paid pretty much the same as what a teller earns."
good,"Communication is not well structured, which is frustrating as information is constantly changing. It seems as though when training and/or briefings are given, the presenters are not always in agreement with the interpretation of the information being provided."
good,"I started as a temp with First Nationwide Mortgage Corporation in May 1995 was offered permanent position starting in Sept 1995. Citi acquired First Nationwide November 2002, as the years went by there was alot of growth I enjoyed the Pride Network lots of community involvement and charitable work. I enjoyed working from home June of 2011 through January 2016. I was laid off in January attempted to stay with the company applied for other positions but nothing worked out."
good,"Great place to learn and develop, Each time there was a change in upper management, the top priorities would change. Although, it does make sense to assess potential changes, and definitely cancel certain projects, it does not make sense to kill a project when it is ready to implement and the investment has been made, just due to the fact a new leader doesn't feel the value in the project."
good,Had an opportunity to be a great company and set the industry tone for what creating a great work environment could be like but they missed the mark with all the disconnected lines of business and stuffy environment
good,the company closed my department so I don't have an opinion about the management nor the company the perks were awesome but they are no longer here so have a good day
good,the majority of people here obtain degrees utilizing the tuition reimbursement program. Once degree is earned have a difficult time advancing. Especially if you are a minority.
good,"On the positive side - It is an enjoyable environment with co-workers. The company looks to keep morale high where possible with appropriate social events. "
good,At my job I loved the people I worked with. I learn alot in 27 years. I was able to move up in the business. The work at home position was great. Pay was good. The Hardest part of the job was losing it due to taking job out of the country.
good,"You will get paid but you will work! Long days, lots of lay offs, good people but the organization is so large you might get lost in the shuffle."
good,Had to stay over and go to customers houses to collect for pay due payments.  Did not feel comfortable going to someone's house when they knew they owed us money.  The manager wasn't supposed to do this but wanted his past dues down and it was mandatory to stay late to get it done.
good,Working with Citi UAE as a relationship officer is really a tough job. I have to pass a probable application that will surely pass the qualification. A good job because i had my own time but I should have lots of leads or names and contact numbers of customers that I need to contact everyday. The management shows diversity because of multicultural staff and management.
good,"One will never run out of options for career advancement or growth, whether locally on internationally.  Citi is a brand that is respective by everyone, all over the world."
good,"El ingreso es a las 9:00 am y es posible trabajar remotamente un día a la semana. El volumen de trabajo es constantemente alto, por lo que tener capacidad para priorizar es esencial."
good,Citi is an intense place to work depending on which business you work in.  Working in Compliance it is very intense and uncertain right now with the restructure underway.
good,Citi is a place where you can take your own sweet time to complete a project.Am actually looking for a change due to this since my style of working doesnt match
good,"worked as a contractor able to learn new thing."
good,"good learning experience , good work culture, colleagues , lots of fun at work activities , but more transaction and time consuming , less compensation benefits"
good,"I worked out of the O'Fallon office and my experience was very beneficial the first year or so due to me having a great manager. So many changes took place within the Home Equity department that caused low morale among workers reason at least two people resigned or left the department each month going back to last August. The pay being the major reason. I was going on three years with a bachelors and MBA degree not evening making $37k. Management appeared unorganized and not on the same page with managing teams. Pretty much everyone started jumping ship. The people is what keep you going, your coworkers. With so many changes each week it was a lot to keep up with and nobody knew what was what at times. The department reduced work loads in half and neglected the idea of changing the bonus structure. Now, no one can reach a bonus and depending on their low salary to make ends meet. The middle man was cut out of many steps and additional responsibilities were assigned to workers but no change in pay ultimately making our jobs harder, longer and stressful. 4th QT 2016 bonus was taken away and employees weren't informed until that week's paystub was released and mgmt was aware months in advance they would keep it. That was very poor communication and a huge slap in the face of how much your employer doesn't care about you."
good,"Loved my job when I started. My managers and team mates were like family to me and we were always supportive of each other. We were always on top when there were branch competitions. We always tried to make sure our branch is always the best. Because you get to see the same clients all the time, you get to know them like friends and for me it was always a pleasure to help them in any way I can. However when our manager had to leave and new management came in, I felt right away that they don't seem to want me over there and they want their own people. The camaraderie in the branch was lost and one by one the old group has left. It is sad that when there is tension in the workplace, going to work becomes a nightmare and that is when it is time to go."
good,"Interacted with clients to identify any issues regarding service fees Worked with Compliance to resolve any conflicts regarding clients and AML risk."
good,"Great place with the exception of current low level management. Senior management does not see what lower level management is up to, other than that everything is great."
good,No opportunity to grow  within g my department. I've heard good things about other departments though. Good benefits and pay for employees: and it's not so great to be a contractor.
good,"Citibank seemed like the perfect fit for a Job with great benefits but was unfair to employees. Agents would not be paid fairly, new hires with no work experience would be paid more than veteran employees who have been with the company for years. Employees would get overrides to have time off, while other employees who put in for the days were waitlisted. Advancement was more of a ""favorites"" game rather than based off of qualifications. Adherence was so strict that you had to write down and turn into your manager anytime you were away from your desk, including bathroom or personal circumstances."
good,"The work environment for collections is fast paced and can be quite hectic, and the clientele can also be a bit much. It is not for everyone, but the pay is decent and the benefits are great. There is room to advance and make bonus every month, but with the sacrifice of mental fortitude."
good,Really good benefits; okay pay; not so great management; lots of stress; they do things throughout the year for the employees to raise the moral but many times schedule them at times that mid-shift/closing employees can't participate
good,"There's no work-life balance in Citi. If there are celebrations, those who are on shift are not given the opportunity to even have a ""separate celebration"" when it's not their fault that they do have a shift on that day."
good,"The employee benefits are outstanding, however the advancement opportunities are limited."
good,"Answering inbound calls for 8 or more hours a day, in the Partner Oil call center. Taking calls from customers alerting the company that they will be traveling out of the state or country and using their credit card"
good,"Learnt a lot on how to deal with crisis management."
good,"I learned that corporate america is not a fair place to work."
good,"Citi  gives you opportunity to learn and gain experience. Management is not the best , these is an area for improvement, overall is a good place to work."
good,"The engineering teams are outsourced and therefore most of the software development is outsourced as well. If you want to get ahead, Its more about who you know than your actual skill set."
good,management is always talking about adherence even when on target.  Manager has favorites.  Always criticize performance even when on target.  Management talks down to person treats employees like they are in elementary school
good,I did not enjoy this position as much as some but it was a means to an end.  There was a good comradery in the office and it was an enjoyable place to work
good,"Working remotely for several years with Citi as an underwriter was enjoyable for the majority of the time.  During high volume times additional hours were required and expected, which isn't unusual for the industry.  The layoffs when volume decreased felt at times to be  premature, with staff being shorthanded afterwards in trying to keep with expected turn times.  Hard to rationalize and accept the layoffs as justified when quarterly business reports still reflected the high earnings months/years later."
good,"I desire to work for a company that has clear guidelines of their policy and procedures, with great benefits, that maintain a professional, respectful, clean, safe, fun, positive, and productive atmosphere. I need the management staff to be knowledgeable of all the job function requirement, available, polite, and helpful, but not over baring, and must be very trustworthy. I like to work for a company that is dedicated to the acknowledgement and reward all their employees successes professional and community work."
good,I had long work hours but i enjoyed my typical day at work.In my job i was given an opportunity to interact with Seniors of the company and everyday a new challenge presented itself to enable me to learn and grow.
good,I enjoyed working at Citi.  My team was more like family so that made working there a pleasure.  The environment changed in 2008 and became more cut throat when Citi along with many others began laying employees off due to the mortgage crisis.
good,Highly competitive and stressful environment.  Exceptionally long hours in all global function roles.  Expected to work through the night and over weekends on a regular basis with no overtime or bonus compensation.
good,"Poor leadership, many silos, and management does not support their employees. Pays well but workload can be overly heavy at times and employees are often pitted against each other.  The company is in continuous reorganization mode and turnover is prevalent, both involuntary and voluntary."
good,"If you put in the time and are driven you can make a great income based on the bonuses paid but the amount of hours you will need to work can take a toll on you and your family. The benefits are great, management  is a hit or miss, and the stability is there if you meet your goals."
good,"After 2008, the company constantly changes. Always change, hard to keep up. Management did not always practice what they said, it was obvious they wanted to push the change from NY but NY did not appear to buy into what they were selling."
good,Current team I am working has good work life balance compared to other units in the company. The growth aspect is an issue as promotions are not linked to your performance at all.
good,"Citi retail bank is trying ahead to stay relevant in the market. However, its internal policies and procedures and organisation structure are weighing on its growth. It has a great product suite and is keen to innovate but there is too much bureaucracy and long drawn processes. Also, there is no work-life balance here."
good,"Citi does try to make the environment pleasant but the job is what it is. There is no way to make customer service fun because the client base is the public, not always easy to please."
good,"I liked to work at Citi solely for the benefits and compensation. Most managers do not value their employees and it is all about ""who you know"" there."
good,"You have to be the best rat to advance up the latter."
good,"Management is definitely culture based. If your different lookout! Diversity is a joke. Middle-eastern, Asian, Latino races are far and few between. They always harp on diversity, just hype. 90% of the employees are female white under 30. 90% of the managers are female white over 30. As are as males are concerned there is a token number scattered within the company but tend not to be there very long."
good,"tagline 'citi never sleeps' very much suits the work culture. however, if you want to learn than citi is best platform to work with. "
good,Overall the Irving campus is fine meaning facilities. All depends on your department and supervisors on how well your day to day is. Sorry but to many departments to give specifics.
good,"Citi is an extremely diverse and complex company to navigate. That said, it's also a company with many opportunities. As one grows within the company and becomes established, it's great to be able to put all of one's institutional knowledge to work."
good,Job Scope Is Very Good But There Is No Career Growth Given. 24 7 Shift Hour Job. Salary Hike Is Not Avaialable. For Gaining Expirence Is Great Company To Work In But For Career Wise Is So Suitable.
good,"I loved working for citi when I first started but lately there is no job security and they switched business direction, so customer service has gone from being the golden child to little orphan annie over night!"
good,Citi is one of the largest and oldest financial institution with wide geographic base and diverse clients. Good place to begin your career with immense learning opportunities and numerous business units.
good,"Citibank provides all the tools possible in order to achieve/surpass individual goals. Definitely have to be a self-motivator, you will not survive if you don't put your part into generating the business."
good,Vacation and time off are moderate- high turnover. Duties and expectations increase without increase of wages. Holidays and month end time off is not efficient with family life.
good,Great place to get the experience because it is always busy and low staffing. very stressful place to work for since their branches are always short staff with new management lacking the training.
good,"I worked here for over a year but my dad has worked for this company for over 15 years. He loves his job and works remote everyday."
good,"The work itself was quite boring and mundane, but the compensation and benefits were good for the industry. Initially we were told our department and group would be growing in the location we were hired in, but after a few months, leadership changed and we were told our jobs were going to be moved to another location abroad."
good,"Marketing through paper have changed to marketing through internet, so I handled on SMS and E-mail blast out to customers on new campaigns and promotions. I need to make the new campaigns and promotions abide to bank's rules and regulations."
good,As a personal banker here you can expect very rigid rules and thinking. You will have many opportunities to help very friendly customers. My short time here felt very robotic. The only enjoyment here was the customer interactions.
good,"This job is great if you're looking to enter banking or the banking industry. This is a fast paced environment and you have to be ready to commit to overtime hours. The position itself is great and very interesting, great experience to have."
good,"I started out in this position extremely optimistic. Having never had a call center job I didn't know what I was getting into​. Citibank being a global bank is consistently changing these changes affect all the workers on a daily basis. I was hired for one position, just as I started getting good they added to my job. By the time my one year came around I was doing 4 times my original job plus projects. I got the opportunity to rewrite the guilds and help teach new employees. "
good,Cit provides good opportunities to build diverse experience. Challenging assignments that are successfully executed can be rewarded with increased responsible.
good,Good place to  start career. No job security. Fairly competitive. Top many layers of management and so much turnover make job difficult. Hire lots of you do people.
good,A good place to work but be ready to put your social life aside. Pay is the best in the industry and basically structured around the principle of OJT.
good,"Depending on which manager you get can make or break the experience. Over the span of the time I was employed, I had 2 managers. The first I really enjoyed working with, who supported her team. The second was the opposite where everyone fended for themselves, and the manager would not hire new employees to replace those who left. The remaining team had to take on the additional workload with no additional support."
good,"I like the role , i dont have in the project directly seat in real project . I need to speak with client and user of citibank. Its very challenging role . We cant assume the  issue . What we gonna receive from the user ."
good,"Great work life balance with over 4 weeks paid time off/vacation"
good,"There was a merger to Citigroup from Legg Mason. I had to learn new procedures, systems, etc. The atmosphere was pleasant. I was a Client Service Associate in which i answered incoming phone calls from the branches. I enjoyed processing claims which was retrieving money caused by a cash debit or assets caused by a short in the client's account. I didn't like processing checks. Everything had to be balanced and if the amount was off, i had to figure why this happened. Management was available if there were any issues. My brokerage expertise carried over from Legg Mason into Citigroup. It was a good place to work for."
good,"Great coworkers, managers need retraining. Maybe it was just my manager but she singled me out a lot and also liked to play favorites. When she is in a bad mood, she likes to take it out on all of us. She blamed me for things I did and did not do."
good,"The overall facilities are great."
good,"It was a good experience overall. However, employees are just a number for corporate and it is a revolving door for the teller position."
good,"Working is a good experience for new comer's. Good salary to start with. Good overall working culture, however the growth gets limited after few year's."
good,"It has been a pleasure working for citibank, I was trained well and am a top 5 represantitive at my location. The job is easy but looking for more pay and more opportunity to move up. Benefits were pretty great!"
good,"While the occasional opportunity may arise for those seeking advancement, overall business strategy seems continually in flux and the executive management team a revolving door which pulls an ever-changing strategy with them resulting continual employee reductions and technology shifts."
good,"Profissionais bem capacitados e preparados. As metas são muito agressivas, mas investe em treinamento."
good,"I work everyday and i love it.i'm happy to served every people who needs my service..i've never felt that my day in work is hard.because if you love your work your employer will cherish you and love you back,and also your co workers will salute you with your hardworking personality😊"
good,"high paced position, low compensation and difficult schedule. I enjoyed the position however the schedule did not work and the compensation was lower than i would like"
good,"Being under CITI bank the operations are hectic, very little guidance and personal development, Management is bad, they cant handle big projects for certain clients."
good,"In my opinion many things at Citi were good. The working environment was good and there was a positive, considered approach to employee welfare and, for non customer facing roles, working from home was possible. All of which assisted a good work/life balance to be achieved. There was never any need to worry that the wage bill wouldn't be met."
good,"Citibank doesn't seem to care about it's employees the way they seem to in the beginning. The culture is very deceptive. The job itself is tedious but easy though incredibly stressful. However, the stress is not worth it."
good,It's an easy job. You do get cursed & yelled at by customers frequently. They don't allot you time off if you need surgery. Management is not understanding of you at all.
good,"Pretty typical large corporation - decisions are made willy nilly depending on who's at the helm.  Short term solutions are applied to long term problems and as long as the band aids hold until the top guy leaves it's fine.  Then the next guy comes in wanting to make a name for himself and the cycle repeats."
good,"The company is good has a good brand in the industry."
good,"Good place to work for a beginners job."
good,"Not a good place to be right now if your in technology..A lot of change going on and management are pushing people to wear many hats of responsibility. Cracks are showing on staff, no recognition or comp for taking on more work loads."
good,"If you can get a manager that is understanding and realistic in regard to work/life balance then you will be very happy."
good,The benefits of this position in my opinion was the opportunity to utilize my knowledge of the mortgage and real estate markets.  This allowed me to ascend into management fairly quickly.  The work load in a typical day was enough to keep you focused for 8 hours and longer.  I was able to learn a great deal more about corporate America and how the market collapse had impacted that industry and the subsequent effects on consumers of mortgage products.  The relationships developed with co-workers and management were invaluable and made the job enjoyable each day. Were it not for the demise of the default department I would still be with this company.
good,"No proper planning involving lot of vendors which leads to lot of confusion and eventually poor applications. Co workers are nice and helpful"
good,"- Have a great team of people to work with. They help make the monotonous day of work fun. "
good,Ensured complete due diligence of the foreclosure files from branch network before proceeding with liquidation. Analyzed distressed properties and recommended liquidation strategies.
good,worked from 8 to 5. Management was nice and i enjoyed the job.  best part of the job was my co-workers they made it fun to be at work.
good,"Getting over on people and then begging them to pay you, this environment will certainly keep you busy. I didn't realize how damaging this business is."
good,The position was good and could be challenging. Management was not easy to communicate with. Work Life and Home life appears to be a challenge due to Shift times.
good,"Typical day at work involves servicing clients with various tasks from deposits, withdrawals, inquires, opening of new accounts, uncovering needs and solutions through conversations."
good,Lots of opportunities to learn from intelligent people and work on challenging assignment. Large company with many roles and opportunities for growth.
good,Worked at Citi for two years. I initially only expected to be there a year maximum as a hold over job. The call center environment is not really for me. There is plenty of opportunity for advancement.
good,"The time I spent at Citi Bank was a pivotal part of my growth and development with a  company with over 200 years in business. I am so thankful to be apart of a very large undertaking. I was apart of a colossal endeavor to see a company introduce an enterprise wide system globally that will allow the entire bank to be on one platform system. I experienced lots of growing pains and I will every be changed because of this great challenge. I've seen a lot of major stakeholders come and go throughout this venture. However, our efforts will always be remember because we will all ways be considered the legacy bunch that introduced The CitiKYC product to the company and the world."
good,"- calendar management"
good,"Provide Risk and Control oversight to Citibank Global Loans department, Private Bank Loan department, Citi Community Capital (CCC) Loans department, and the Abandoned Property department consisting of 150+ operations staff."
good,Management change in the company and not happy with the way things are changing in the management. Citi Health benefits are not as good and changed a lot from the year 2016.
good,"Handled multiple phone calls, handling escalated phone calls, answering customer service representives questions regarding card members account. taking over calls from reps talking to highly agitated card members, resolving card members queries in a timely fashion"
good,"If you do not like stressful situations this job is not for you. The money is pretty good. Most mangers are pretty nice, but that isn't worth being yelled at over the phone for an entire shift. Day after day."
good,"Role of a Authorizer"
good,"Ideal  place for learning   and developing skills at various levels."
good,"My shift was 6:00 am to 2:30 pm.  The first 20 minutes of the shift were to be used to boot up the system, read any emails and or alerts and to enter time worked in various ""ques"" into one of several time keeping software packages depending on which que you had worked in.  It took approximately 17 minutes for the system to boot up leaving approximately 3 minutes for the other requirements."
good,Generally a ok place to work if you do not mind bureaucracy. Benefits are very good compared to other companies. Training is good.
good,"Co-workers all helpful and worked together as a team"
good,"Good locations."
good,"Good place to learn advance technologies."
good,"Good place to work and employees are taken care of in terms of flexibility in work times & culture. Not all about numbers but work on different activities of new project as well. Decent amount of red tape and politics, but this is expected of a big company.  The most difficult part is to get the work done from team members with adamant behavior or those who are not too serious about the work. The enjoyable thing is to work with some excellent people to achieve targets and meet tight deadlines.  There are lot of variety in what I do each day, ranging from monotonuous tasks to new projects with challenges."
good,"Citi is a good place to work."
good,"I have interned for the CSIS investigations. I cannot place a value on the amount I have learned. I intern at the Cyber Security Fusion center, and I am surrounded by all things cyber. My experience here is excellent, My particular manager is really laid back, and is one of the easiest people to work with."
good,"decent management, a little too young and unexperienced in some areas"
good,"Working in Citi requires lots of energy as no two days are the same. The only thing that stays constant is change. Things happen very quickly, deadlines are tight and timelines are short. Despite the high demands of the job, it toughens me up to be a survivor. One becomes an expert in multitasking (as this happens almost on a daily basis) and in the midst of all the chaos, one needs to keep cool and be level-headed."
good,"Take s too long to become a permanent employees, They specialize in getting employees from various staffing agencies. The process of getting hired permanently takes too long."
good,"Citi Bank is an amazingly successful bank because of its fantastic team but product penetration is pretty much low in market because of the policy.Awesome working culture.Tremendous growth.Best place to work.incentive plan very bad.Good team work. After work we all executives are deployed everyday and that's the very tiring part,6 hours continuous standing,even wont provide chairs,nothing extra paid for deployment(kiosk)."
good,The management team at Citi try to create a atmosphere that set the employees up to fail. There is no rom for advancement. The management team look down on the employees & do not reward employees for going over their job duties. The pay grade is low compared to other banking companies.
good,"Fast paced, multi-tasking and occasional long hours.  With all things considered there is great team morale and workmanship."
good,"I'm just sorry it didn't work out. Great environment, depending on department and manager. Enjoyed all of the benefits and the coworkers, didn't exactly enjoy the additional time wasting tasks we were given, which made the workday strenuous."
good,Pay is ok but recently the company has shortstaffed alot of branches and clients are very frustrated at the low amount of staff working at each location. Its alot of pressure to maintain a good service score when you are understaffed and have to be rushing when you are dealing with money. I feel like its time for change the company has been getting worse and worse lately.
good,Able to grow and learn new areas of business.  Many different positions available inside of company.  Changes frequently with economy.
good,"Management has been flexible with working with you in regards to your personal life (the ones I've dealt with). Some are micromanagers however.  The department I'm in wants you to account for every second of your day which takes up your day and they are focused on quantity not quality.  The pay, in my opinion, does not match the job (pay is not much at all) but the benefits are great! I have gained a lot of knowledge throughout my various rolls within the company."
good,"CLOSING REO ASSETS NATIONWIDE, Team lead for four closing officer and 2 wire coordinators. Citi Residential was AMC Mortgage Services, servicing division of AMERQUEST and ARGENT loans"
good,"Citi was a great place to start my career. I learned a lot under management; however, there is no room for promotion. It was starting to feel like a dead end. I appreciate everything about Citi but I would like if there were more room for growth."
good,I really enjoyed working with the people here. But the pay was very so not competitive at all. It was a great experience....................
good,"Good Benefit with Low Potential."
good,"I would not recommend this company to any developer who is looking forward to build a tech career."
good,"Decent pay but handling over 500 calls pero day, handling complaints and selling left you burn-out. Most of the employees were very fed up with Citi`s comission program in where you were paid only/if you maintanined your sales throughout the month. If that didn`t happen...goodbye."
good,"They change things so much and when they changed my job title it wasn't for the better. Coming to work was normal, and the job was ridiculously easy when you got it down. Then they decided to close my department, and move everyone to mortgage. It was so unorganized, and stressful. The managers were always walking around like chickens with their heads cut off."
good,"Researched and commented on any daily and monthly 3rd party NAV recons and ensure all items are cross referenced with custodian reconciliation"
good,"Citi staff is very team oriented and focused on delivering results for clients.  There is a high work ethic.  Talents at Citi make your worklife very enjoyable and stimulating."
good,"A great place for advancement, however not much of an environment for work life balance from what I remember.  A typical work day can be quite busy and make all the difference to both the internal and external customer."
good,you spend most of your time collecting. not enough time spent on sales and customer service. there is the ability to promote quickly. there are also lots of changes from day to day on goals.
good,"once we arrived we organize our data and we revise our appointment and go to them "
good,"-lots of overtime"
good,"My first position within the company was a good experience. Good work structure, and decent training. My second position was awful. Management was fickle, training was non existent, and work felt more like a popularity contest rather than an opportunity to take advantage of my work ethic."
good,"In my opinion it is hard enough to deal with angry customers all day and then having to deal with meeting numbers management requires you to accomplish, especially when we as CSR have no control over this #"
good,Helping and understanding  the clients  needs.. and  implement procedures in order to continue the best of our policies.
good,"I have worked from home for 11 months now and I love it!  The money saved on gas and eating out is great. Its also convienent to be able to save a lot of sick time when school is closed or my child is sick simply because I don't have to leave work.  The benefits are far better than a lot of other companies.  The downside is there is absolutely no opportunity for advancement.  Since we do not report to a physical site its, I am stuck in this position until either I leave or the job is discontinued.  Management changed abruptly at the end of January and it really left a sour taste and a lot of distrust of upper management."
good,"I have had a great experience working with TCS-CITI. I m currently working for TCS as a contractor for CITI."
good,This was my first job and was able to experience different areas in a country club. And after leaving the job was able to stay connected with member at the club .
good,"My typical day was to download any new identity theft claims from the system. I placed notes on accounts that I had received it. I had to open a claim in the system, send a letter out, place a hold on collections, and begin the investigagtion. I would then review my aging claims to close them due to non response from the claimant. Send the letter out, place notes on claim and on the accounts. I also reviewed claims for which I had received new information to see if claimant was a victim or not and go from there. Management was very difficult and I lacked any training. I was barely given a few minutes a day for a couple of days. I was overloaded with work and with no training to do the job the correct way. This whole process was a learning experience that thaught me that I could do a lot of things even in light of these extreme circumstances. The hardest part of the job was the micromanagement. I had been the lead of my old department and never had to be micromanaged; this was very hard on me. The most enjoyable part of my job was resolving a claim for which I had to do a lot of research and getting a good job look from management."
good,"Como RH o banco é ótimo, porem no dia a dia e estrutura para se trabalhar apresentava algumas variáveis com bastante diferencial, levando em conta o perfil do mercado de bancos."
good,"This was a temp job working for the President and Vice President of the company.  I was told that I would be hired permanently when my contract ended, but I wasn't.  No one ever spoke to me about it, I just went to work one day and didn't have computer access anymore.  From what I understand, they always tell temps they will hire them in order to keep them, then when that contract is up, they hire another temp in order to avoid having to provide benefits.  Very disappointing."
good,"Management is extremely near sighted.  More open to using consulting firms via off shore hiring then within the US.  Even with economy, upper management bonuses rise while employees salaries and bonuses do not and continue being laid off.  Change is necessary, however unrealistic."
good,"A typical day at work was to first greet my employees with a positive and welcoming attitude, followed by a morning huddle, we then got our morning duties done (such as ATM processing, night drop, cash ordering, preparing cash for shipment, process any deposits, etc.).  What I learned during my years of banking is every single person matters just the same!  In management finding a well balanced employees with regard to job well done and ethical issues is imperative.  Respect your co-workers and employees as you expect to be treated.  The hardest part of the job is to terminate employment with no cause.  The most enjoyable part of the job is when your entire staff work well together, happy employees are productive!"
good,"Tools are poor, management and pay are mediocre. Very large organization."
good,"The job itself is a good job, it pays well and it is a clean working environment. It does a good job training normally, and for the most part has a secure site and many luxuries missing from other companies (Free coffee, a cafeteria, nursing rooms for women, etc)."
good,The potential for growth really isn't there unless you get in good with upper management other that your have to work 3 times as hard to get promoted.
good,The pay is a little above average but it a lot happening where each manager makes there own rules and regulations. The company is going through so many changes.
good,Well organized training provided. Great group of employees to work with.
good,"Pros	"
good,"No hay estabilidad laboral, realmente no valoran a las personas por su trabajo y desempeño, los ascensos son muy esporadicos prefieren contratar gente de afuera que no tiene idea del negocio esto afectando enormemente la productividad diaria el clima laboral, ya que las personas que contratan esperan que todo lo hagan y no se les ve la disponibilidad de aprender, el salario es muy bueno y los beneficio también pero el recurso humano, a desmejorado notablemente."
good,pretty good environment to work in but not enough stability.
good,I do not wish to summarize or submit a review at this time for Cit Cards at this time.
good,A growing company with a busy and fast-paced work environment with room for improvement on training and development and also work/life balance.
good,"During my time at Citi I worked in a call center.  I would help homeowners figure out options to save their homes.  My manager was great, but some of the team leads were not so helpful.  "
good,"Sempre tive bons colegas de trabalho, além da chefia ser muito competente. Porém a política de cargos e salários não incentivava os funcionários à ascensão na empresa. "
good,I have no comment about this job.  I was told that if you don't have anything nice to say about someone then say nothing.
good,"High call volumes at time, but could sometimes be easy solutions to happy clients. I learned how to strengthen my negotiation skills. The work environment for employee recognition was fun at times. Hardest part of the job was micro management."
good,"Sr Management not good, lots of politics."
good,"People and culture is enjoyable to work with, but middle managers are lacking communication. Upper management shows commitment & direction to company."
good,Great for Temporary work but not for Stability. I would call the office ask for available work. Sometimes it would only be a couple of days or up to a month of work
good,No set policies or procedures in place. Pretty much do what you think until someone tells you you're on the wrong track.
good,Citibank is a very good company to experience IT work. Their weakness can be summed up by lack of domain knowledge in IT on management levels. Citibank has a very high turnover rate due to communication issues and a culture where there is very poor project management. On a good note Citibank has many wonderful and fun people to work with. There is just poor training and a lack of fundamental IT knowledge. Another sad thing to note is this company would rather outsource their IT dept rather than retaining NA people who in my experience have been leaders in quality and performance just to save a few thousand dollars. I have seen some poor management decision making which leads to higher costs and degraded quality of software development.
good,"A typical day at work is filled with hustle and bustle.  The phone constantly rings.  I take inbound calls as well as make outbound calls to customers.  I've learned how to give great customer service, sell products beneficial to the customer, and collect mortgage accounts currently going through the loss mitigation process.  I've learned that educating the customer. listening well, and providing excellent customer service are all keys to success.  The management team is aggressive and pushes me extremely hard.  My co-workers and I all have great camaraderie in the office and all support one another.  I don't find anything hard about the job at all.  There are a lot of federal laws and regulations that you have to follow and pay close attention to.  The most enjoyable part of the job to me, is interacting with my customers."
good,"There is a ceiling for advancement, unless you are willing to go into management.  You have to change jobs frequently if you want to advance your salary, and with that comes reaching the ceiling fairly quickly. Large company that provides great benefits outside of salary, but ultimately is too large to care about lower level employees."
good,"Hohe Innovationskraft, gute Sozialleistungen und Arbeitsklima, Behandlung der Mitarbeiter mit Respekt"
good,"Retail banking is filled with daily routines."
good,my co workers for the best and the best part if interacting with the clients. The upper management are always experimenting with new ways to try and fix the company. Such as 30 min lunch breaks and they're not much room for improvement unless you know someone.
good,"incoming call center, accepted and placed calls, reviewed incoming emails and distributed it to representatives. Rotating managers, most co-workers were team players. Hardest part was when I needed to transfer call if I wasn't qualified to answer the question. Reviewing and answering the emails."
good,"No surprises if you've worked in retail banking. All banks are putting big pressure on retail employees to increase sales, expand relationships, and close loans. New regulations and the current economy puts everyone in a position to perform or be replaced. Citibank offers a lot of tools and resources to help you do your job. They provide consistent recognition, and good incentives. Overall, good management, and if you perform well, good opportunity for advancement. Beware of closing markets."
good,Enjoyed working there but no room for growth or pay increases.
good,"Managing groups troubleshooting issues with clients and working with disk to disk and tape backup technologies.  "
good,Nothing but personal sacrifices can be expected with this company. Expect limited to no time with your family and prepare to spend your eight to ten hour shifts being screamed at by customers on the phone. You can expect to be given a hard time about using the restroom facilities while not on your breaks.
good,"Good company to work for, but has a stressful work environment. Must his loan production and sales quotas."
good,I did enjoy my time at Citibank the training was good but could've been better do to the fact certain parts should have been more extensive. The type of work and the customers made the working experience was very rewarding I had the opportunity to interact with all types of people from all over the country and some internationally. I had a chance to use all my world class customer service skills while assisting with all questions and resolutions to billing resolutions. I really enjoyed myself while I was working there.
good,I like working at Citi because nothing was ever the same.  It was always changing and growing.  I liked working as an individual and a team as well.
good,"A very nice working enviroment, management and co-workers were the nicest people to work for which made it fun"
good,"Excellent interpersonal, strong communication and presentation skills"
good,Excellent learning experience in this high demand - fast pace environment. Very competitive employee / contractor ratio
good,"On a typical day my duties is to collect on mortgage payments to bring current and to prevent FCL proceedings if an account is in jeopardy of being sold. We have a goal of breaking ""buckets"" delinquent accounts from 30-89 days past due, 90-179 days past due and 180+. We are responsible for breaking/collecting 2 out of 3 and must break the 30-89 bucket. My job is not hard but it can be a little challenging. We have Operation and Unit Managers yelling across the call center floor attempting to engage in making workers work harder. With management being aggressive and somewhat unprofessional it creates a hostile work environment. Though there might be challenges at work, you are rewarded for going above an beyond your job duty and I usually receive the benefit of that. What I enjoy most about my job is my peers. I have great friends with good work ethic."
good,"If you are a business developer, strong in sales and pipeline management then it is the right fit for you. Business does not walk through the door, but if you can make it happen, you'll be successful."
good,"•a typical day at work"
good,"Collecting on delinquent accounts daily."
good,"	Manage existing and developed new MME client relationships with top-line of $50Mil up to $2Billion. "
good,"Busy day doing dev work,requirement gathering and level 3 production support"
good,there benefits are great but the constant changing of policies and procedures and the harsh scrutiny of compliance is very stressful and there is no security in the job you do it can change or even go away in an instant
good,"•	Responsible to provide genera information: account balances, credit and debit details, checks clearing status, copy of DDA Statements, process stop payments, and any other possible information needed by the customer related to the products and services offered by Citibank."
good,"I was an account manager with 150-200 Mortgage accounts per month.  I also had to have inbound calling as well as high profile accounts in the Bankruptcy mortgage modification department.  I learned to listen to the clients because they could possibly los there home.  We worked as part of a team, and the last team I worked with was very help as we all worked remotely."
good,"•a typical day at work"
good,"The company is a good place to work in general.  The immediate supervision is good, I had a very good supervisor."
good,En general buena. Es dificil explicarlos en tan poco espacio tan solo comentar que aprendí muchisimo.
good,"A typical work day would be reviewing emails, priortizing workload that would enable me to work productively, efficiently and effectively.  I have learned that you can't judge a person by the outside appearance and that not everything is what it appears to be.  Research, documentation and learning are effective tools that will accomplish most things."
good,"Great organization. What makes it so great, is the people. Citi has some of the hardest working and dedicated people in the industry."
good,"The company offers good benefits, but lacks good managerial personnel.  I was given the opportunity to learn about the mortgage industry."
good,"Was a great place to start a collection career, but the bonuses was enough to survive on after all the bonus structure changes"
good,"Working in CITI used to be a great thing, until so many unnecessary and useless company re-organization occurred. The project I am working on is running on the top, but the team structure and management is not very good. This is the only reason I want to leave my current project and find some good opportunity with my 5+ years application support experience."
good,Overall good learning experience. Doing all investor services job. Having in-depth idea about the hedge fund industry
good,"A typical day involves wearing many hats, doing a lot of adhoc stuff and producing many reports that do not always get used."
good,"une très belle ambiance profesionnelle, un apprentissage basé sur un coaching ."
good,"Excellent work environment, best paymaster, advanced and up to date products and systems."
good,I love the work environment. Call center look. On site cafe and pretty landscaping for lunch time. Managers are motivators of production and quality. Benefits are wonderful. Great place to start your career.
good,I work with customers to fix they're issues as needed. Dealing upper management can be a pain. The day to day is alright
good,"A typical day at work involves working on a number of different workstreams. "
good,"A typical day a work included logging into a dialer to contact clients due to delinquent accounts. The calls were both inbound and outbound, which taught keep me actively engaged. Some of my time in this position was remote from home.  It was still easy to remain in contact with co-workers through chatting and emailing.  The hardest part of the job was not being able to reach each person that is called."
good,"Good work life balance"
good,"Costumo dizer que estava fazendo outra faculodade trabalhando no Citi, pois o aprendizados novo era diário.Havia troca de experiências bastante proveitosas e invadoras entre os gestores e colegas."
good,"A typical day of work consisted of answering calls and emails regarding accounts payable/receivables, technical issues, and order purchasing inquiries. Management was recently changed when I started working and was still a little lost at what we did and they wanted to implement. Co-workers were great, I don't think I'll ever find such a great group of people to work with, but the pay is low for the workload and there is absolutely no room for moving up in that particular department."
good,There is a lot of micro-management and bureaucracy which is expected from a large corporate bank.
good,Great company to work for if you are interested in working outside the US because of its global footprint.  Outdated systems and poor communication. Great base salary and benefits.  Managers are constantly in meetings.  A positive was the involvement in the local community and participation in various events in the city.
good,"I have had the pleasure of working with very professional individuals and with them accomplished a lot of big, complex initiatives. Management either lacks experience or nerve to actually manage. The environment has become more negative with both layoffs and the lack of support for the current employees."
good,"laid back work environment"
good,"I really enjoy working for Citi, great hours and benfefits."
good,Cit is a well positioned financial services company with very talented people.  Very talented people with many available resources provides opportunities. Management turnover in recent years and workforce reductions has impacted the culture and presents challenges in balancing short term objectives with long term investments.
good,CitiMortgage was a great opportunity to grow and learn about how Mortgages operate. The customer service training was very in depth and covers most situations. In servicing customers over the years. It became much more difficult to help the customers as the options for individuals to stay in their home were few and far between. As a customer service agent/Escalation agent it became our responsibility to provide the best customer service and provide the best solution for each customer that requested our expertise.
good,"Citi was a decent place to work. I worked as a sales and service manager for both the credit card and retail divisions. Management at the local level was solid. Company wide there was little to no direction. The bank is entirely reactive, and even the same recurring patterns seem to catch them off guard over and over for years."
good,"a typical day at work"
good,Most of the people at Citi are nice and smart. But the organizational structure is confusing with overlapping roles. This means that accountability and ownership get diffused. Makes it harder to get things done
good,"Citi used to be a good company until the mid 2000's then all they did was try to protect themselves and how to fire someone to get someone cheaper.  "
good,Multiple project streams need continuous calibration to ensure consistent program delivery. The most interesting element was the ability through hand on activity to transition from a sell side view of the world to a buys side view of the world.
good,Over the past 5 years one thing has held constant.. they are always changing..
good,Worked with a diverse group of people making the workplace fun.
good,"Typically a day at Citi for me was monitoring of the Domain Controllers for the NAM, LATAM, EUR, ASPAC domains. Performing any Quarterly Maintenance (QM) for those domain controllers and other infrastructure servers under our management."
good,"enjoyable work hours"
good,A typical day at Citi consists of a call center environment. I have a cubicle and a personal computer and phone set that i only use. I log in my systems and begin taking calls. 
good,"Typical work day was dealing with customer and handling cash, had a manager that was out of her league....was good but had no people skills. Other than that i loved the people i worked with and the customers, i still keep in touch with some of them!"
good,"Typical call center mentality.  More interested in bringing in new hires, than keeping on experienced staff.  Below industry pay.  Merit increases are based on team leads subjectiveness, usually a dime.  Bonuses are few and far in between.  You''re able to make bonus, but management makes sure you won't receive it.  "
good,"Pros: Good work-life balance.  Onsite daycare in some buildings.  Flexible hours and remote work days (for some areas).  There are a lot of job opportunities internally that span the globe."
good,"It was a high paced environment, calling people with past-due accounts. Sometimes stressful because I wanted to give extra form of customer service but for most of the management it was all about just getting enough checks from ppl instead.  Semi hostile environment but I did like that I got the experience of working in a call center using office equipment. I felt professional & proud to wear the name ""CITI"" overall. Just wish I wouldve been given more training & support to actually fully enjoy working there. "
good,"Overall a great place to work if single.  Not family oriented at all.  Management was ok, but focused more on objectives than quality staff development"
good,Completed a contract job with Citi Group. I learned a great deal with Citi Group and would go back.
good,"- Day at work is normal with Oracle DBA monitoring and administration"
good, I rate a 3 out of 5. Citibank offers benefits from day one and daycare and a gy for its employees.
good,"Extremely high paced; under staffed; constant changes of direction and strategy; many silos; teams do not work well together or in partnership."
good,"• Received and managed calls concerning"
good,A typical day is processing payments to accounts. I have learned how to identify customer accounts and how each payment is to be posted or retracted. Management needs work. Not everyone is on the same page. Co-workers are family. The hardest part of the job is being production based when I am a quality and not quantity person. I believe in doing things correctly at a pace where there is no room for error. I am not a production person in a corporate office. The enjoyable part of the job is all of the people that I do work with.
good,"no room to really grow, management does not really care if you do or not. Taking initiative or questioning anything causes arguments. Very able to balance work and life. Pay is fairly low and no bonuses and raises are little to nothing. Callers can pretty much talk to you however they want and you are not allowed to defend yourself or disconnect"
good,"This section of Citigroup is not the place you want to be if you want to go anywhere- unless you luck out and a manager leaves, there's no room for advancement."
good,"Good company to work for, can be nerve racking with the constant changes"
good,Citi is a good place to work and has many opportunities for a variety of jobs.
good,"Job is great. Good boss. Just wish Sr Management understood that they need to be loyal to the employee because they hemorage talent like crazy because they don't take care of people. Cost of living keeps going up, cost of benefits to the employee keep going up. minimal to no raises or bonuses make it difficult to remain with the company because you can't afford to live on compension that does not even keep up with inflation. Merit raises are fine, but they need to give cost of living increases as well."
good,Some mangers actually care about their employees and some just push paper and promte busy work
good,Answer phones all day long. Able to hear from people all around the United States. Able to help solve customers personal problems with billing issues.
good,Been with company for 15 years and saw the transition from BISYS to Citi. Learned quite a bit over the years from a Fund Accounting perspective. Work - life balance improved when Citi took over with the ability to work from home offered. In a position now where there is not much room for growth based on current company model.
good,"Citi was the most fantastic work experience that I have had. For those motivated to build new processes and do extra ""stuff"" for the experience value, there was no better place in the world than Citi during my tenure. It was all there for the learning. The culture was a bit rough and hierarchical, but when Citi had the resources to throw at a problem, there was a beautiful sight to behold. It also offered unequalled experience at a global level for fortunate participants; I was one of these."
good,great people to work with. great team work. learned how educate people on credit. hardest part of my job is when i am not able to help out customers as no tools to do so.
good,"The benefits were great there, management on the other hand was a little rude. Very unapproachable."
good,Very busy branch to work in that keep employees busy at all the time.
good,in this organization i learned how was the meaning of word (system)
good,The old CITI was great to work for until the 2008 collapse in the sub prime market.
good,"Good and love to work , Latest Technologies have been used here"
good,They could have offered us a lot better incentives and better health care plans
good,The database marketing department was an interesting place to work. I enjoyed the New York City atmosphere.
good,Not a lot of room for advancement. Quality work/life balance though.
good,"My typical day at work starts with phone calls to customers that's already on the bank list. I would offer customers inside the store since I was working in a bank inside the grocery store, and make some announcements for easy banking and fast service with Citibank. I would help my tellers to work on the lines especially if we are busy. One thing nice about Citibank Management, they provide good training and let each individual grow on there respected field. I always make sure that I treated my co workers as not just a co worker but friends and family. I normally bring some food to share or if given same days off, if I have nothing to do at home, we go out and during Christmas time we exchange some gifts. They are still my friends even on facebook.. The hardest part of my job is to exceed every months goal...It's constant assurance for myself that I do much better next time. The most enjoyable part of my job at the bank is to see customers leave happy and satisfied. Because most of our customers in the bank wants to find the solutions on there financial concerns and it's rewarding if u can find the right products for there problems."
good,Colleges can be very cut throat and aggressive. Management seemed to be all about money. The core values didn't support management sales style. All government regulations were closely followed.
good,"Reviewed a team of 20 to 40 agents, all with different levels of experience and job duties. Each call to be reviewed could be short as one to two minutes or 15 minutes long. Each call is monitored for customer service, efficiency, and correct resolution. Agents must use the correct format when answering the phone and when ending the call. Agents are rated by the score I give them. As a Quality Assurance Agent you must be an expert in the applications and tools the agent is using plus an expert in Customer Service methods. I learned to really listen and analyze tone, delivery, and variations in the manner agents deliver advice and assistance. The hardest part of the job was being deemed as the enemy by your fellow customer service agents or that you didn't work as hard as them, when in fact you worked harder, the burden of proof was up to you. This where experience, research, and knowledge came to play. My fellow co-workers were very knowledgeable and cordial; they never hesitated in helping out."
good,"I enjoyed working for Citi Cards. Although the type of work I performed was not always pleasant, the management and my co-workers would always find new things to keep up the moral of the company. They always had contest for the representatives to keep us motivated on the phones. There were plenty of groups to be invovled in to make working there a more rewarding expeirence. The hardest part of the job was constantly being mirco-managed and no matter how good your stat's were, it never seemed good enough. The most enjoyable part of this job was being able to help the customer's who truly wanted and needed to be helped."
good,"The company has many talented employee. Most of them are very supportive to get things done. I learned a lot within the organization and the most important factor of all it is the people who drives the organization. I've been challenged multiple times in my capacity as an analyst and I can say without my team, I could not complete what I need to complete."
good,I reviewed and processed annuity applications.
good,Very micro-managed. Constant changes without any notice.
good,Work well in high presure inviroment.
good,The best thing about Citi is the amazing people that you get to work with. Work life balance was also extremely important to the team I was on so that was a huge plus as well.
good,Culturally diverse workforce. One of the largest financial companies globally. New technologies gets adopted in this organization although sometimes delayed.
good,I enjoyed working with Citi. I worked there for 15+ years with the last 5 + years working permanently from home. I loved working from home. Much more productive. Citi moved my division to Missouri and let 950 of us go from the Hagerstown facility.
good,"It's global reach and diverse businesses allows employees to explore opportunities outside of their current role.  "
good,"people aren't motivated, or are unwilling to change even though we know, a lot of things are redundant or useless but still have to work on them. Technology is lagging."
good,People treat well over there and transparency and rules must be in place to safeguard employee interests and career path.                                                      .
good,Was just another call center job for me. If that is the type of job you are looking for it is an okay place to work. Nice building and setup. Nothing else to say really.
good,Daily and monthly Productivity and Quality Scores are the focus of the company. Cases are assigned or they may be re-assigned from other people. About half of the cases have omissions or need corrections making it difficult to meet daily requirements. Management only wants numbers. The best part of working there is your co-workers and the on-site gym. There is also an on-site day care for those needing one.
good,"Not the worst place to work but tbh no one really wants to work in one of these. Much cleaner and brighter than most other call centers, treatment of employees is ok, pay and benefits are good."
good,"The culture here was one to be excited for, but as changes began to be implemented the culture changed drastically. They promoted the idea that they were easy to work with and provided a good understanding of life/work balance, however, this proved not to be the case,"
good,Good Company but most of the jobs are getting outsourced. You can learn some good technologies but you should be willing to relocate as most of the NY/NJ Positions are moving out.
good,I worked the evening hours and often didn't get home until after 1:00 a.m. Many times customer calls would be forwarded to our department simply because the customer was angry.
good,"the culture was strict just like a corporate company, as I was an intern there, my manager was a very strict person. they ask you to do work but they wont explain what is the purpose of doing it"
good,"Not much room for advancement due to low employment turn over, or advancement.  Bonus plan changes and you just have to work more to make the same...."
good,A Citibank is an okay place to work. I work in the Kansas City location. This location is medium in size it’s hard to advance if you’re not in a click. However Citibank is a good place to work.
good,"committed to adding shareholder value is number one priority.  That is not necessarily a bad thing, but understand that is priority one for the organization."
good,Les opportunités de carrière sont très limitées. Pas beaucoup de possibilités d'avancement.
good,The expectation to perform perfect is expected yet in slot of situations information to help the customer was not communicated well. Shift bids are not helpful when you have school age children.
good,"I enjoyed my time at Citi.  The only negative was you had to learn everything on the fly, as there was little training.  Hours were good, along with the benefits"
good,"Good place to work, I don't have much to say about the Client as the name it self tells a lot about it self. Management is Super, I am very happy to be a part of the team."
good,"I love working from home, the job can be easy if things are working correctly, however when you have a lot of customers who are upset about things you cant control can take a toll."
good,"To be quite clear - doing everything but the job was alright, at minimal. The cafe in the florence building was unrivaled with their kitchen staff - they were like family. The training is relatively easy, and the training staff is great, there's lots of ammenities. The gaming room was stellar, the fitness room was great. Breakrooms on every corner, almost. Great snack selection, and always coffee everywhere. Many of the departments in the building felt like they scored the absolute pick - and they probably have."
good,"Citi is an excellent company to work. Only few old school managers are pain. If you do not fall under their managed projects your life is set. "
good,"Good Company to work for. Nice people, nice management. Long hours flexible pay ok. Remote working. Open plan. Good benefits, free medical. Good Pension"
good,"My functions was fast pace and provided me almost no breaks. The role was extremely demanding. I provided support for a global Bankers covering several regions (i.e EMEA, APAC, NAM etc.)"
good,Ownership of strategic initiatives by creating valued partnerships with global partners to expedite operational advancements and financial results while protecting or improving customer satisfaction.
good,"Convergys is a stable company, although Citibank pays them good for collections dept., but Convergys is always complained by employees for giving low salary versus the experience of the employee."
good,Received nine years of experience working for the company at two locations working on international projects and other activities. Made many friends along the way.
good,"The work is great, The policies are great, The customers are great.  The Salary and Benefits were industry standards"
good,"Working environment is good. This is a fun workplace with Ping Pong table.The commute is too far from home. But the food is very good. Overall, it is a good place to work."
good,"ok company to work for, most dont have travel and very overworked. dont work in anything that has to do with records or archiving, it is awful and you will hate it."
good,"I was laid off with no warning. The manager and supervisor treated the call floor like high school. They even made jokes about it."
good,"wonderful company to work for, good work and life balance. hours are good so is the benefits. paid PTO and sick leave. benefits start from day one. easy to move up"
good,Very good company culture. Ability to work from home. Very supportive supervisors and peers. The workplace is very enjoyable with various areas to organize meetings.
good,"it is not bad, management ok, job it not bad, everything is not bad, pay is not bad, customers are not bad, everyone is pretty nice doing their work and not bad"
good,"It is a Decent work place "
good,"Okay place, but lack of organization in management . Many opportunities to switch positions, but the management is very disorganized. The job can become stressful."
good,Citi is a good place to work. With many different locations it is likely that one will interact with different culture and people all around the world.
good,Citi kept you busy all day long.  The culture was very rewarding and promoted from within when needed.  They are very cost conscience and if you are will to relocate you will do very well.
good,"Overall this company is a good company to work for.  Competitive pay and decent benefits.  There is always room for improvement,  but my current experience with the management is good."
good,"Just fine as it was same culture like working from off shore locations, not much of feel that you work in Canada and the location is also very isolated, but yes from technology stand point they are using very good framework and nice learning experience"
good,Drive by technology in a very silo structured organization. Struggles with communication and consistency. Good pay and benefits. Often will outsource positions and/or move them to a lower cost country.
good,"Citi is a great brand but the quality of work is not up to the standards."
good,"accomplish your goals is the way to get an increase."
good,overall good company to work for if you are not too ambitious. Opportunities to advance your career are far and between. But it offers great benefits overall
good,people were always helpful and there was a common theme to do the right thing and whenever things got really crazy people were always around to contribute.
good,"company offers great training and experience. there is a lot to learn. you are responsible for opening trust accounts, business account, citi gold members."
good,good place to work  good in environment  people are friendly . great benefits . Always working in the community to make it a better place .I would recommend people to work there.
good,great place to learn. but no job security.  always walking on egg shells around upper managment. rate of pay was decent but bonuses werent great. i wouldnt go back
good,"Lots of downsizing and position shifting, this does not create stable environment.  The movement and changes in management leave alot of people confused and concerned."
good,"I interviewed for a position that was exactly the same as what I was laid off from in May 2019 due to Mortgage Transformation.  I had an on-site interview with the Director and felt that after working as Executive Administrative Assistant for more than 12 years that I would be a top applicant, only to find out that an External person was hired!"
good,A lot to learn in proportion to the pay which stays stagnant from year to year because the raises do not rise as fast as the rate of the cost of their health insurance. Promotion is very difficult unless you are a person who either has connections high up in the company or you're just an overachiever.
good,"Exactly the type of lumbering bureaucracy you would expect from a corporation this size.  Pay and benefits are decent, but you will be a nameless, faceless cog."
good,"Good culture and nice environment. You get to work on something that billions of people use, good compensation, interesting projects. Get to work with some really smart people."
good,Citi has a great overall culture. If you're looking to get promoted based off talent then Citi is the wrong place to be. You must know people in high places to advance.
good,"typical money work. this is the place where i have enhance my skill in the span of few years of my service here. although i still work here, there are some majot problems that i have found out specially dealing with the needs of the client,"
good,"It's a large company where you get exposure and can see different things."
good,"Pros: Good as a start up company for fresh grads; lots of leadership trainings and mentorship"
good,Work life balance was nice when I was able to work remotely; however they took that away and things went downhill from there..    The morale is low and makes for a frustrating situation day in and day out.
good,"they are pretty flexible with their hours. Some branches are slower than others. "
good,"Excellent benefits, great work/life balance, bonus."
good,"25 Years of dedicated employment and exemplary performance rating."
good,fast paced call center helping customers with credit card information. team members super fun. very competitive with sales not mentioned in application
good,This is a corporation that is focused on revenue and growing client relationships.  The environment is results driven where employees drive their own grpwth.
good,Very fast paced environment. Every day was something different. Would recommend as a place to work. Very fair pay and benefits package. Just too long of  a drive for me.
good,"Citi was a great place to work and there are a lot of talented, hard working people who work there and make it an enjoyable experience.  Upper management is very hard to read and is not transparent at all.  There are a lot of constant changes and that equals a lot of layoffs regardless of how well the company is doing.  Everyone I know that worked there with me always worried about layoffs.  It made it a tense and sometimes unenjoyable place to work.  A lot of people get promoted based on who they know, not what they know.  I worked there for a total of 11 years on the mortgage side and I learned a lot, but the fear of layoffs caused major stress and always had you worried.  It is good place to start your career, but probably not a great place to stay for a long period of time unless you are friends with the right people."
good,Sales positions are stressful to meet metrics and you can easily lose your bonus for not meeting some metrics. Hours are not flexible and managers show favoritism to employees who earn bonuses because they bonus from that also.  So much drama and many employees are hired from the street and earn more than current employees.  Citi used to be for young professionals who had fun but were still professional and now its like a college campus.
good,processing tax documents for corporations opening accounts and following up to collect outdated documents. very fast paced; need to be well educated in excel. understanding some tax background very helpful.
good,"I worked with Citi in Jacksonville for a whole year. They do not appreciate good employees. Poor culture. No diversity but that which is verbal. You offer them community opportunities and they do not want them. Racism, Bullying of good employees, Appreciation and encouragement towards bullie. Customer would be racist constantly and it is counted as low points to employees, though this is illegal. I couls say so much more but I'm not into loosing more time"
good,"The Mission statement changes regularly. The processes change regularly and management changes regularly. How quality is judged changes from one sample to another. All these changes create extra stress in an already stressful job."
good,"Citi group back office has a multitude of departments with training and opportunities for growth. Management has an open door, workplace culture for the most part. Unfortunately they are plagued with recurring company wide layoffs."
good,"Contracted consultant for 7 months "
good,"You can make a career in this company if you want, or you can let the stress of the job coupled with life take you down an uncharted path. Its a very stable and decent company to work for."
good,Wonderful environment with an amazing leader willing to teach.  Great learning experience for anyone looking to enhance their career to the next level
good,"Good company, great benefits. Good managment.  LImited potential for growth.  Very involved in community and employee relations.  Very large campuses, lots of diversity and inclusion."
good,"Outdated software for a large bank, long hours, senior managers were ok , some of the people on my team were new to the country and barely spoke english."
good,"I will update it next time."
good,"Productive work place, fast paced environment, and satisfied work day."
good,"Experiences vary based on location and division. Generally it's fairly bureaucratic so it's difficult to work across different divisions.  However, if you're role is client facing then this aspect is less important."
good,Teller position is a good Experience for a College student. Flexible schedule . You learn a lot about everyday banking. Paid training to Long Island City The culture is very corporate
good,It was alright. I had no knowledge of credit cards and all the terms with them before i worked there. Still didnt really know much after training. It was far from home too. Left after a month and a half. Pay wasnt worth the gas used.
good,Work life balance is great considering I do work remotely.  Citi offers good benefits and a great 401k match program.  Downfall is the size of the company and not having much of a voice as a middle management employee
good,Fast paced call center. On and off auto dialer with customers some very angry. Data entry of customers information. The best part was helping customers complete the needed documentation that had to be collected.
good,"Productive Place to Work. I supervised a team of loan processors. We accomplished a lot as a team. Good company overall to work for. Do not work there anymore, as location closed up."
good,"The stability was good for years."
good,working for citi went well. pay was great flexible hours.  the employees were helpful all the way around the table. I really enjoyed my assignment....
good,"La metodología de trabajo y las herramientas son excelentes pero el ambiente de trabajo no es bueno, no hay sentido de equipo."
good,"Although the company benefits were great, all the opportunities I tried to take advantage of were given to outside applicants. "
good,Was a fun place to work at.very different type of call came in from the vendor. It was fun in the training classes. but it could be stress full at times.
good,Lack of advancement opportunity for minority groups was my major concern and the reason I choice to leave the banking industry. I have a negative impression of the bank
good,The work was rewarding because you had an opportunity to save homes and you had an opportunity to make a difference in a homeowner's life and the life of the families involved.
good,"Very good training programs.Good affordable insurance.Fast paced when on calls,while giving excellent customer service and resolving any issues for the costomer"
good,It was an ok company to work for. I don't like the fact that they micro manage. I like to work with minimal supervisor. I don't want to work there again.
good,"Not a job I took on expecting to turn into a career, so I do not want to be unfair with my review. It was not a hard job, stress levels fairly low....All I can say"
good,Working at Citigroup was my first professional job that provided me with the exposure I needed to ensure I really wanted to pursue the field of Accounting.
good,"Every day was an opportunity to use my knowledge and skills acquired in IT to work in a fast growing Global environment.  I also provided support to System, Application, end users, and training process for  new VM/Linux IT professionals."
good,Good training provided and development on-going.  Learned a lot.  Company was prepared to invest in employees. The most enjoyable part was the connection to people.
good,"Job environment was challenging at times.  Good people to work with. Department was much better under Associated National Bank prior to being purchased by Citi, but all in all, can't complain too much."
good,"Citi promotes fairness and equality, they have a good workplace culture.  They provide numerous education and learning tools to increase job performance and promote good customer service relations.  You can expect to work hard and be accountable for your work ethics, in turn Citi provides great benefits."
good,"Citi provides standard benefits like most financial companies. You will get 401K, pay about 50% of your health insurance, and you will get a small bonus ( if you performed very well in your work."
good,"Citi has a unique culture with it's employees. They make a large effort to make the workplace a fun environment. Good cafeteria, ping pong tables, amenities on site."
good,"At this time, Citi is focused on the bottom line instead of retaining institutional knowledge... this will save money in the short-term but will leave the firm in worse shape in the years to come."
good,typical banking environment.  Not worst or better than any other ones.  Place is cleaned and well maintained.  Environment is adequate.  Many layers in place.  Not much work flexibility.
good,"Training class needs to improving feeling loss even after the third week of training .  TPS assistance don’t like to repeat themselves , don’t want to help . Make you feel like your question is dumb . hFeeling very rushed in Not prepared for the customer"
good,If you are a natural born salesman then this job is great pay amd bonuses. The time off is great but stress if you aren't a natural born salesman makes it hard to enjoy.
good,"It was a good place my first year being there. However, getting a bonus is made impossible with the unrealistic expectations set to do so. Their management are bullies and they do not protect their employees. I had one who did but once I was forcefully removed from his team due to management having no call in the shift bid process I was placed with someone who made it clear she wanted me gone and because she is a chairwoman on a committee, they would not punish her despite multiple complaints against her"
good,Good Company would say its a good place to work in Finance and would advise working here. Flexible working hours good management. Not good career progression
good,Citi is a big bank with big bank rules tied to regulatory and corp. earrings. If you get in a good department it can be a great place to start your career and grow.
good,"Highly politicised team environment. Feels more like a govt office than a prestigious MNC bank. Hence, work life balance is better than any other company. Too many holidays is a plus. Ideal place to work if you want to stuck in one place till retirement."
good,"Performed loan reviews and provided with competition on every file within limited time. Assuring a valid loan every time.  Once complete, the funds will be provided."
good,Poor management but it as a pleasure working there . It was a great opportunity for me since i was student . They offer great benefit for part time worker .
good,This is a great company to work for because the management is always willing to help you advance. There is lots of room for advancement and learning is never a problem.
good,"Best of the company gave great family environment."
good,"start the day by logging into computer phones and follow-up on anything that was left from the previous day, check voicemails and emails, return calls and reply to emails and start the day by company pipeline."
good,"Typical day at work here is data entry for credit card application. The manager give target daily and we must to achieve the target. I try my best to complete my task succesfully,"
good,"Good compensation but no work life balance. Business too pushy."
good,"even though  i did not liked that place, I learned something new there as well."
good,The culture at Citi is very diverse and the teams are always willing to help and learn.  Management always try to guide you in the right direction.  The only con is that they are outsourcing most of the administrative jobs over seas
good,"Good company that needs to be more upfront with their employees, that way they can better understand the company's positions on a lot of issues and be able assist the customers better."
good,"Always work with best manager and prime location. Always system has issue slow ,and internal customer service always have double answer. They transfer employee averagely 2 times."
good,"A good place to work, but depends on the person you will work with. Great location for staying social and great transport connectivity. to much bureaucracy going from temp to perm."
good,"Good place for those both new and experienced. Some policies felt questionable, but that's coming from someone who has only worked with one bank, so I could be off. All in all, not bad, though very particular on numbers. Better hope someone doesn't want to have a conversation, or your manager will be pulling you for a conversation on taking too long."
good,Cater to clients needs especially when it comes to using mobile application and website. Digitization is happening and reducing options to talk to phone officers with extreme exceptions on emergency situations like lost cards stolen and travel tags.
good,If you work in a call center for Citi it is very stressful. Just like most call centers management is poor and there is a lot of drama. If you're a manager or banker life is very different at work and has a positive vibe.
good,"lots of training, a great place to work, very stable workplace, there were a lot of opportunities to advance and all the managers were very friendly, definitely would work there again"
good,"citi had  labor diversity better than other companies, strict work environment, work like a military boot camp. wage does not match with work performed, "
good,while in training they would amp up the benefits of growing within the company and how citi was one of the top paying companies. training was roughly about 4 weeks and mainly doing compliance stuff not actual training to prepare you for the floor. management half the time did not know what they were doing. after working there for over a year I never received a pay increase like I was told. I did get to take on new rolls and job tasks all for the same pay as I started.
good,This was my first 40-hour job.   It was stressful due to it being collections. I loved the company but there was little flexibility with school. Wish that the role had been different and better hours
good,"Jumped head first into this one without looking to closely around the structure of the team. Ultimately, a friendly group of people to work with but the knowledge base was lacking as well as the dedication to getting things right the first time around"
good,"Old system and many errors, they need to improve their technology, push on sales and new money which is out of the banker control. I like the check system to avoid scams and people who takes advantage of banks. Also the good thing at Citi everybody knows everyone, good communication to block fraud."
good,"Great colleagues; the team you work with will drive your experience. It can be very hit or miss. There are many people that work here that do not know much given their titles. However, there are people that are extremely knowledgeable and drive revenue for the entire firm."
good,I'm thankful for the experience acquired while working with Ameriquest Mortgage. Ameriquest Mortgage assets where acquired by Citi. Ameriquest thought me a great deal about greed.
good,This is a fast pace and continuously changing environment. The agents make the environment a great place to be. Management could give more feedback and growth tools to move upward.
good,I learned with this job that I do not like underwriting. It is too technical and repetitive. I would prefer a career that has more variety in its duties.
good,Loosely defined requirements allowed for autonomy and allowed for a glimpse into an ever evolving organization trying to keep up with other FINTECH spaces.
good,it is a call center with inbound calls. We help customers with whatever issues they are dealing with and then we attempt to sell them one of products.
good,"A empresa é bastante receptiva, agradável de trabalhar."
good,Citi bank is a fast paced and professional place to work for.  I've learned how a corporate company operates on a day to day basis by being employed with them.
good,"A big global company culture. Not much frills."
good,"Citibank allotted me the opportunity to advance my career in banking. As one of the largest banks in the world, there was a lot of room for growth. Its been many years since I was employed at Citibank. I did experience a few ups and downs but overall a good company."
good,"free lunches, table tennis table, co workers, training courses, continued education, flex hours, the projects, the flexibility, the consistency, 401k plan"
good,"Pulled daily work projects."
good,Its a fast pace working environment with great incentives. Management could use some restructure to make the branch thrive and make it a very profitable office.
good,Yes they may pay the best salary wise but from the systems to the closing of businesses ac cross the country is it worth the headache.  If you are in one of the 6 major cities then you have more security then the smaller markets.
good,it was always a great working experience when i am working with citi as it has been productive the workplace culture is always interesting and the most enjoyable part of the job is team lunches.
good,Professional working environment. I was in grad school while working at Citi. I worked about 50 hours a week. I was in grad school while working at Citi.
good,I left Citi for opportunity that Chase offered in the city.  It was necessary to grow and change from community banking to banking with people from all over the world
good,"Citi has good benefits, however the cut throat atmosphere makes it difficult for most employees. The employees are good hard working people but not really appreciated by senior management."
good,the work itself is not difficult.  Unfortunately quite a few employees have a sense of entitlement and are not as productive as they could be which causes my department to be very numbers oriented.
good,"Grate people to work with                   "
good,"Expanded my skills and knowledge. "
good,"Plenty of career opportunities within the firm, would recommend to anyone looking for broad banking and finance experience.  Smart people with receptive management style."
good,"The company was great but I felt that I wasn't given enough preparation for the on the job part of the training , later felt that the position was just not for me I do want to work in a financial institution but with one that makes me feel ready for anything."
good,"Prepare for a general talk about overall performance, and use broad statements as a framework for the detailed sections of the review. This is an excellent time to hear each employee’s thoughts on the store’s operations."
good,"When I worked at Citi, I was expected to leverage products that weren't beneficial to the customer. I had to offer these products regardless, and many customers told me they could tell it was forced."
good,"Citi had many departments within the O'Fallon location, which provided opportunities for movement within the company.  However, raises, if they occurred, normally didn't exceed 2%."
good,"There are so many employees that you are just a number. Additionally, good work is only rewarded with additional work. There is also high turnover across the company."
good,"This was a place I endured and unfortunately did not thrive in.  "
good,"Citi has some questionable policies that can really leave a bad taste in your mouth. I had a sleazy manager and busted myself to try and impress her for a good word, but she threw my under the bus at the first opportunity. There are many other things I could go on about, but I'm not entirely sure it would be legal."
good,Citi is down seizing the company so no room for advancing with Citi. Before the change Citi was a good place to work. Pay was on the low side but the benefits were good.
good,Lots of training and lots of quality reviews of work.  Their required amount of work was not realistic based on the reviews and not making mistakes.  Unfortunate to spend so much on training just to lay off people and then hire new people a few months later.
good,I was able to start out at the lowest rung and work my way to middle management with in a few years. I was mentored and they graded me on measurable performance standards.
good,Great benefits management changed alot. They said the C in Citi is meant for change and it was true. Always changes there. Generous with gifts and Citi merchandise.
good,"I like my job I started out working with Mortgages and transfer to the Banking part of it, they hired to many people and laid off more than half of the people they hired."
good,"I recently moved from MetLife to Citibank for a position that paid $15,000 more per year. I was very excited to have the new position at a higher salary. While the working conditions are average (open plan seating) and my manager is just average there are other things I have discovered that make me think that my move was not that smart. For starters the health coverage is very expensive. It is $3,000 more per year than what I paid with MetLife with the same insurance company (Aetna). In addition, the healthcare benefits are no where near as good as they were at MetLife. I recently went to the doctor and had to pay $100 because I have a $500 deductible. They do not offer any plans that let you pay a copay to go to the doctor. You pay the full cost of everything until you reach your $500 deductible. This is a bad situation because many people will not go to the doctor if they know they may have to pay up to $500, it discourages people from getting help. At MetLife I paid $35 to go to the doctor and testing/lab was covered at 90%. I have an appointment with a specialist coming up and I have $400 left to reach my deductible so I will be paying for the entire thing. This is basically just like high deductible coverage that is costing me 7k per year ion premiums. The other thing I recently found out is that the bonus plan is not good. At MetLife I always got a 15 to 20% bonus. At Citi the bonuses are about 5%. I was not told this when the offer was made but my coworkers are telling me that is what they get. So my 15,000 raise is basically covering inflated health care premiums, deductibles,"
good,At Citi I was able to learn about chapter 7 and 13 bankruptcies which assisted me at other position in other companies. I like that Citi offered a gym if you wanted to work out.
good,"Never had a CSR position before and would never do again.  Coming from an admin field being tied to phone was not for me.  ""Heath Breaks"" were severely frowned upon if no during a scheduled break."
good,"Reviewed and documented commercial and consumer loan files.  Tracked and worked exceptions, worked with lenders to make sure files were properly documented."
good,"This position gave me the skills to know and understand the process of underwriting SBA loans - working directly with customers; attended training classes outside the organization when needed.  "
good,"However, after the many changes that have been made recently. I dont feel like i have any job stability. I really dont like the fact that they terminate senior mgmt that has been with the company for 30-32 years, it doesnt make me feel safe in my job"
good,Citi provides you the opportunity to take control over your career. IJP or mobility is the advantage for any employee. Citi culture and policies are easy to understand and act.
good,"Great people, great company, low pay, and never ending work. The company provides all the training you will need to complete your work but you will not truly know the job for a year, so give it time. If you stay longer you will receive annual raises and might even move up the ladder. Or take the skills you learned at Citibank and leverage them to get a position in a higher paying financial institution. "
good,It was great opportunity to get the Fraud experience.  I really learned a lot and will use the skills and knowledge learned in my future endeavors.  Thank you
good,Training is unique and there is an opportunity to grow. I would work there again. I was only a temp. I have nothing more to add. I have nothing more to add
good,"Reviewed and Granted Credit for the Home Depot Credit Company. Made necessary changes to account information, and took payments for accounts as well. close to home"
good,I was with the company for many years doing many different jobs.  Some i really like and others i didn't care for.  The management was okay depending on which department i was working in
good,"Fair company to work work. Flexible work environment, good culture. Things move slower then one would like, but that is expected because of the size of the company"
good,"I've had a very long and illustrious career at Citi, which span for 21 years.  I loved working there, during my tenure I've had the opportunity to work in many different areas and Businesses.  I started in the Retail Bank stayed there for 5 years then was promoted to working for the Head of Citicorp Investment Services, followed by the International Retail Bank then moved to the technology area, working in Operations &Technology. I was promoted to working for the Vice Chairman of the Investment Bank (ICG) and finally to CBNA (Citibank,N.A), where I worked for seven years."
good,"A typical day would be waiting for short sales to take place and the documents come through our department. We would also post those short sales, then submit them to our supervisor once done. Based off of how many we were able to do we then would benefit from bonuses. I learned a lot about dealing with mortgages."
good,"Typical day with Citi, was reviewing account and calling clients to help them with their financial needs.  Renewing accounts, payments processing, and data entry."
good,I liked the pay at Citi. However working in a call center became very tiring very quickly. You were stuck on the phone for 10 hour straight throughout the day. It got the point where the phone ringing caused me anxiety because i dealt with constantly unsatisfied customers.
good,I worked at Citi for just over 3 years and then was fired for transferring calls I wasn't trained to work to those who were and was told they consider that call avoidance. It was a good job for a while but they screwed me big time.
good,"Smith Barney was a great place to work, gave me the opportunity to work for securities Industry.  Good working atmosphere.  Branch manager was a great guy at the time I began my career."
good,I enjoyed working for Citi very much for over 35 years. We had flex hours and on Friday could wear jeans. The most enjoyable part of the job was working with good people

good,"I left the company in 2007 due to expense reduction initiative and am not sure certain how much the environment in the company has changed since my departure.  Therefore, my review of Citi will not be appropriate."
good,"Citi empower their employees to progress and advance in the market place,They develop, train and reward their employees.  The investment they make goes noticed by all."

good,"Great company to begin new experience with. Very nurturing to employees. Very stable company with longevity when the economy is doing good. Positive work environment, with professional people."
good,"If it wasn't for the inconsistency of managers and policy it would be be so bad. But there was someone always playing favorites and the C in CITI stands for Change, the turn over rate is so high its crazy."
good,"Fast paced work environment. Friendly staff, multiple shifts to choose from. Management is okay. Good parking and onsite food for those who do not bring lunch to work"

good,Started out with some cray cray bosses.  Ended up with great people to work for and to work with.  I still keep in touch with them and consider them friends.
good,I have nothing negative to say about Citi. They have been good to me for several years. The people that I worked with were wonderful. I am grateful for all of them.
good,"Good work environment, work life balance wasn't out of whack too much. Hardest part of job was pressure to meet goal nonstop. Compensation pay was lacking."
good,"repetitive workload and fairly enjoyable, good colleagues. long hours and ungrateful management,"
good,"I enjoyed working at citi, the pay was based on my work and the workload was fair; however my job was outsourced to another country. The management was easy to talk too and we worked well together."
good,Good company. Friendly atmosphere.  Casual days/months were the best.  offsite location allowed for casual days all year around which mad it relaxed for everyone.
good,"The job was alright, the job as a highschool student paid alot but for a job where you are trying to climb i would say is not the best job to choose. The hourly pay is great."
good,Overall its a job at Citi Trends Distribution Center. I like that we have weekends off and its a easy going job. The management is okay. Only thing you really need to worry about is your attendance and making production.
good,"Citi is a well diversified company that is open to new ideas and is always changing to make your experience better.  As far as management, it depends if mgmt takes ownership or not.  The Client Experience is suppose to be number one but at the end of the day its all about their metric system.  Come correct with the numbers and you will succeed."

good,The surroundings of the office space was very friendly and the coworkers always helped when I had a few questions. The training wasn't very efficient and I had a lot of questions about the new system I was working on
good,"Like any large company, Citigroup has constant change. However, it doesn't handle it well. You may feel you are simply a number instead of an appreciated individual."
good,I enjoyed working with the people more. I was blessed to have managers who treated you as an adult and let you do your job. You received paid vacation time and a limited amount of paid unplanned time. While the salary was less they were generous with paid time based on seniority.
good,you had to meet goals of low deliquinebt acct had to close a lot of loans had to collect paymetns had to follow all kinds of guidelines had to work many hours and as the branch manager had tons of issues to deal with
good,"A lot of the same everyday while the job is not too full of rewards or appreciate for their employees, it is stable and a manageable place to work, so makes it possible to have a work and life balance."
good,"Experince not the best at CITI.  After working at Wells Fargo, disappointed in overall experience.  No support from management and poor underwriting.  Would not recommend this position to friends and colleagues working in industry"

good,"- opportunity for responsibility at junior level"
good,"Doing credit analyst."
good,"Close to home, good technologies used at work.  On shore and offhsore co-ordination is poor and work is stressful mostly.  tight deadlines and stressful schedules"
good,An ok place to work. A lot of good people that work very hard. Fair training with high expectations. communication could be improved. Constantly changing
good,This is an ok place to work. Good opportunities to grow your career. Citi is a fairly large organisation with presence across the major cities in the world.
good,My background in having studied law made it easier for me to understand contracts used in trading - like futures and options and mortgage agreements - and gave me an advantage in coding these applications.
good,"	Sell and develop relationships with mortgage brokers, mortgage bankers & mortgage lenders for profitable loans."
good,the over goals that is required about citi are overwhelming and to stressful to keep up with. they want their employees to be robots and to constantly be on the phone. the moral is low and the turn over rate is ridiculous because they do not care about the mental health of their employees
good,"Citibank is a good job for young people. The longer you stay on the job the stressful it becomes. Management is stressed from upper Management to make sales. They implement a lot of upgrade program to better assist clients. Which can be a good thing for the client, but they still want you to be able to produce the same way. Clients are doing a lot of their banking online, in which the foot traffic is not the same. Therefore the productivity slow down. Quite a few people have had major illness because of pressure to product. Short  staff everywhere and real pay increase.  The same way that they want customer excellence they should make there employee's feel  valued as well. Boost the moral of the employee with all sincerity."
good,I was able to advance through my years at Citi. My experience varied depending on the direct manager. They are pretty big on promoting from within. Benefits are decent

good,"I really did not work here very long.  It was just a temp job, but it was fine I guess. I am only writing this review because I have to.  I do not have enough experience at this place to have anything to say about it, positive or negative."
good,"Overall it's a good experience to work at Citi. Average rating for all. There's definitely good and bad in every workplace. If you're comfortable in where you are/where you will be, it's good."

good,"Had worked for 6 years.Great place to work and grow with the company's development."
good,If your interested in banking this is place for you.  You can start here at ground zero and work your way up.  Very demanding and fast paced environment
good,"Citi is very average in all respects when it comes to what the company has to offer, but the demands imposed onto the employees sometimes can be unreasonable. This makes for very stressful environment."
good,"Citicorp Services (India) LTD                   					                                     Apr 2013 – Oct 2013"
good,Great culture and staff. Good pay.  Terrific first job for graduates in finance looking to learn the business from the inside. very good benefits such as medical dental and vision. This includes a 401k from the first day of work.
good,Work can be stressful at Citi for some positions. Worked for over 5 years with no annual increase.Top management believes you should be happy you have a job.
good,Support for branch manager at a Smith Barney/Citi office many years ago.  I learned the basics of financial services there.  Workplace culture was stressed and sometimes frantic.  For this company people at my level are a means to an end - typical at a large financial bank/brokerage.
good,"Enjoyed working here. Needed to be living and working in Frederick, due to senior parents. Work Life balance, health ins, 401 K, eat in restaurant for lunch breakfast and snacks"
good,"Good company but you require a good network for career advancement. Not easy to cross business lines or move into different roles, career mobility van be difficult."
good,"Great company to work for. Great pay and benefits.   The company offers training and pushes individual to excel themselves.  I got a very good impression of the corporate life at Citi, and I learned what my skills and strengths were. Most of the management assisted me in developing my skills, and I learned a great deal."
good,"The people were nice, I learned a lot about credit card marketing it was very interesting to see how the marketing for credit credits were put together ."
good,"Typically, we take around 80=100 calls a day on a busy day. I usually help people with any problems or questions that they might have about their credit card."
good,"Good working environment. But, a lot of jobs are moving out of the Greater New York area. So, there is no job advancement unless you relocate to a different location. The job work/life balance is good and they allow people to work from home."
good,Company is going through major changes as they are selling off holdings. Constant fear of jobs being discontinued. Systems need to be upgraded but unwilling to do so due to costs. Wall Street driven.
good,"Citibank was fun, I enjoyed my time there. Great coworkers, Great managers, amazing benefits, amazing paid time off. For the most part respected by upper management. "
good,Benefits were great.  But you must be able to weather the highs and lows of a fast-paced call center.  A busy day a work could mean taking back-to-back calls for 2-3 hours.
good,Typical day answer phone calls to be able to get payments from customers to bring their accounts back current and setup programs to help customers keep the account in good standing.
good,Empresa sem flexibilidade de horario e sem chances de crescimento interno no backoffice.
good,my part time job when I was going to school.  I enjoyed talking to different people.  it was a fun place to work as well.  I liked interacting with different people.
good,Comply with bank operations and security procedures by participating in all dual-control functions. Help assist clients with basic account handling...
good,"It is a great company, but you have to know someone to move up in the company.  Also, they can change your position at the drop of a hat so you could have been hired for one job and switched to a completely different job based on business needs."
good,The culture and expectations at Citi didn't fit well for me.  There is a lack of loyalty of supervisors to the people they work with and the expectations for work hours is a minimum of 60 per week.  I was told that if I was working less than 55 hours a week to let them know and they would give me additional work.  The claim of work life balance is fictitious at best.
good,"It was good, initially. I worked there for 17 years so something was good.  It changed so much during the latter part of my tenure at the company.  It may be good for some."
good,"Lots of client contact, which provides varied environment to respond on the spot. Visiting clients on their site, taking about their requirements. Good place to lean."
good,very stressful always had managers watching everything the representatives did on and off the phone not able to take bathroom breaks when needed and very rude
good,"•	Serviced 60-80 inbound/outbound calls daily pertaining to payment inquires, credit line increase, travel notifications and optional products on their credit card account."
good,"I enjoy a fast paced environment and this job did not offer that. Way too political, and too much standing around. Nothing was ever really accomplished"
good,The most enjoyable part of the job was working with my co-workers and helping the customers. Management was somewhat supportive of people's situations in general.
good,Took inbound phones calls and cross sold bank products. I did learn a lot about the type of products and processes Citi had to offer. Management was always there to lend a hand and hard working knowledgeable. The hardest part of the job was talking with customers I couldn't help and try to make the situation better. The most enjoyable part of my job was making a difference to all the people I could help with the issues they had on there credit card accounts.
good,"The salary is too low, there is no fix salary, commissioned based salary for all the employees. But the workplace is ok, the employees and workers are very friendly"
good,Good work output is rewarded and recognized through compensation and bonuses. Opportunities for growth have been less due to constant business transformations. Investments in technology is needed to be more competitive in the industry.
good,"When I started in '06, It was a great place to be. Plenty of room for advancement, great work culture. Now its less about the client and more about $."
good,"work with high level clients, make changes and recommendations, help your clients evolve and make profits, improve processes and train associates. every day a new challenge and a new task to work on"
good,"Working on a dailer through out the day. Reviewing documents. helping to do modifications on clients accounts. Keeping clients in their home, Making sure all documents are correct"
good,"It's a great company if you have the right management team. They give you the best customer service training. I learned a lot being at Citi Bank, especially about my finances."
good,decent company. some groups are great and others are not. dissatisfied with management in compliance testing. Snr mngt does not care about the employees
good,"at Citi you will find a more sales driven environment, focused on customer satisfaction and up selling whether the client needed said item or not. employees are awarded by metric and often there are competitions between sells teams"
good,My time at Citibank was ok. When I started bonuses and the type of business we managed were so much better. In order to save money the company has but back on benefits for the employees and different portfolios that paid a higher bonus.
good,"Good global bank. very competitive. Middle and senior management have been there too long, HR in the West Coast favors and protects senior management and tends to look awa"
good,The environment of Citi is fun and you make lots of friends which helps pass the time but the schedules that are in demand are hard and they do not work with you to change your schedule fully. They will flex a day or two but not the full schedule.
good,"Best for beginers, leart basic job their, got basic knowledge about bank products, specially about credit card. Don't know about about management as their was not much interation."
good,It was a decent place to work . the location is pretty far so if you donot have a vehicle. you cannot work there. they are not willing to work with you either.
good,Providing Excellent Customers in showing ID and signing procedure.Provide  translation in English and Spanish. Have a good work ethics in being respectful and polite to others.
good,While working for Citi I felt like i was told to sit in a chair and don't talk to the people around my desk. If you were trying to help a coworker with a question or problem that would be frowned upon. I was told we have to look for our answers in the internal database. I constantly had the feeling of I just had to go through the motions like a robot to meet expectations. The company made my feel like i could't be human while assisting our clients. Within a year a was passed along through 3 managers. each one had their own expectations and styles they wanted you to follow. Constantly have to switch gears to find what exactly what they wanted out of my work.
good,"Verry stressful work, customers  are only mad about their own credit being bad and give you no bathroom brakes,  Good pay,   good schedule  very hard work, stressful and anxiety-inducing work"
good,"Managed daily activities of the reconciliation team. Was the primary first point of contact for staff members. Learned how to network within the organization to troubleshoot escalated issues. Since this was a new product that was being developed by Citi, I learned to work with different departments in order to get the job done.The hardest part of the job was being the first to develop a new product from the ground up. However I learned a lot by working with other people in the department."
good,There is large free parking space around the office. And there is different food available in cafeteria with reasonable price. There is gym inside the building.
good,"Everything was good, great and grand. As a contractor expect to be treated politely but expendable. If something isn't right, use your brain power to figure it out. Don't ask questions and definitely don't 'complain' in any fashion."
good,Information not communicate and no time to access all information to do assist customers due to limited time allowed on phone call and management not inform about what is acceptable
good,Stiff culture and not conducive to young people. They need to find some way to attract and retain young talent. At least they have kept away from the negative headlines for the most part.
good,good place to work at and get to know the product training was great and management really helped out when needed ... not much more to say have to continue typing
good,"Currently working in Jax. Not sure if it's the company or the people itself that are just cut throat rude, not a team at all. Forced to work together with people you don't get along with, god forbid you complain and you're the one looked bad upon meanwhile the lazy person gets a better job opportunity. It's what you'd expect from Jacksonville.  If you work here, you don't have to work too hard and you'll advance quick"
good,"The growth opportunity coupled with the fun, hard working environment, and the ability to make as much money as you want is like no other job I have ever had."
good,I went to Citibank on an internship.  They treated me well and trusted me with the level of responsibility for my current skill set and challenged me when they felt I was ready
good,"You come in and have tasks to complete. You work hard, and consistently to complete the job. I have learned to install servers and decommission old servers."
good,Highly target oriented job.
good,"Good company to work for. Great benefits. Some discrepancy with information that is provided. Training wasn’t the best, but you got the jist of what was being taught."
good,"Review accounts for fraud indicators to determine possible treatments to reduce fraud losses"
good,"Citi was a great place to work, they kept employee moral up. You had room for advancement and the people were all very nice to work with. The job was challenging and rewarding to help people save their homes."
good,"Citi is a good place to work but they are eliminating jobs from NY and sending them to Texas and Offshore. Staff reduction is a continuous project. It was fun working, good environment. They have work from home which was great."
good,The most enjoyable part of the job was you are working as a team. I've also learned a lot on how to sell smart and be smart. I really miss working on Citifinancial.
good,"Citi's digital teams provide historical financial industry practitioners an opportunity for growth and learning in some cutting edge "
good,its a very good company . you have all the benefits in citi. very nice place to work. but very less salary .you will have all facilities in the company .
good,"I was on the weekend shift so the workplace was pretty relaxed. I enjoyed working with the people. I learned how to key in numbers real well. Management was really nice, if you needed assistance they were right there to help."
good,Hours and days were pretty fixed which made for making plans outside of work pretty easy.  Training was a little rushed but overall they instructed you enough to get by.
good,Good people to work with but upper management communication down to staff is poor.  I enjoyed working there and travel was important to keep lines open with NY staff.
good,I would not reccomend working for tis company due to the cut throat environment & the lack of communication from management with employees & the job security.
good,"There were a lot of people who didn't care for the average person.  Unless you had some special ""quality"" you were on your own.  I felt very unwanted."
good,"The work life balance and training process at Citi needs some revamping. Citi could definitely provide more training for the management team and they are in need of process streamlining. The culture is great, the people are awesome and the products actually work as designed. The internal teams are a bit distant which causes implementation times to be too long.  I did not get the impression that this would change."
good,Citibank is a great school teaches work and life which you can learn so much in short time.
good,no advancement to better your skills on to work on your skills very little team bonding time very competitive atmosphere with no way of exploring your creative ideas
good,"Answered inbound calls."
good,it is good to get your foot in the door. You can grow with this company. I would recommend starting here in customer service. The hours are 24. so your schedule can vary
good,A normal work day can be very demanding due to the client to employee ratio. You will learn how to work in every department due to COB policies. Not too much room for advancement
good,"I did not enjoy my time at Citigroup.  The volume of work per people ratio is quite large.  The work environment was fast paced, stressful and very challenging to say the least."
good,Citibank was good while it lasted but the advancement option was hard and what we did as an employee the pay was not the best. When was told to move to another department only got a little training the rest had to learn on my own. After being there for 5 years I was made to move to a department that I didn't want to.
good,Great Company with a lot of opportunity for people in Collections. Multiple trainings for all levels of employees. Company involved with United Way and other charities
good,"Un buen posicionamiento de marca prestaciones superiores a las de la lay, cuenta con autobús para transportar a sus empleados"
good,Extremely boring company with regulations in place that make organization very subpar. All about making a dollar instead of keeping up with the current changes in the industry.
good,Very hard working group of people.  All are very committed to get the job done.  Technology guys are quite knowledgeable and reliable.  They are good partners.
good,"*Good place to start your career"
good,"good place to work where you can maintain good work life balance. Based in Rhodes, travel is inconvenient. recently remote access has been revoked. management is generally co-operative and encouraging environment."
good,"The stock symbol ""C"" actually stands for ""change."" Citigroup changes quickly and is a fast paced environment with opportunities emerging constantly. There are no dull days!"
good,"I have overall enjoyed my employment at Citi, I am sad to be leaving. company offers good benefits  and an amazing vacation package.   ........................."
good,Room for growth. Many unhappy employees in retail side. Every branch is different but beware of the micro-managers. Poor incentives for sales growth and minute bonuses. Surveying that inspires cookie-cutter approaches that pressure staff to pressure clients into rating them highly on surveys. Breeds insincerity.
good,Citi is a difficult place to work. It is definitely high stress because of what they demand from you. Sales goals are really hard to reach but if you have a  good team you can do it.
good,"Constant learning on the feet required in a fast paced environment. Good team structure and decent hours. Great benefits, market rates with management providing a culture for growth."
good,"Citibank can provide opportunity for advancement, but culture has made a turn towards valuing quickness over quality despite lip service to the contrary."
good,"very condusive and relax , if you know your responsible especially when dealing with international people and market.Besides a good customer service knowledge we also need to know about the finance in order to provide and solving customer needs."
good,"Typical work day included speaking to customers over the phone in regards to loans  / credit card service and sales. Good work place culture, timings for the job were not so beneficial, not so stressful"
good,"I have 5 years of experience in IT. I am looking for a change in roles as data analyst, business analyst etc. I have worked with clients closely and also lead a team in offshore"
good,Overall good company and many good people but lacked career advancement and organizational structure. Was too big and a lot of bureaucracy. Benefits were good.Worked in markets division
good,"Citi us an organization dedicated to the numbers.  Hiring salary is probably where you will stay for a awhile, there really isn't a raise incentive unless you move positions."
good,"Possessing diverse career credentials, I am a well-qualified business professional who has developed "
good,A typical day at citi was working in a call center in which I can no longer handle. I have excellent customer service skills but it is not the same face to face as it is over the phone.
good,"Great place to start if you are looking to get your feet wet in the Corporate world. Hard to balance family life and work life with this Company, you must choose between the two."
good,"Boss only cared about himself. God forbid you needed to take time off. Very much a good old boy club. I don't think I would work at Citi again, but some areas of the company are good. I just wouldn't want to work in the area I worked in ever again."
good,Collections inbound and outbound calls working with customers with past due accounts.  Good vacation and holiday benefits but days off are hard to get approved.
good,Citi is a great place to work There are many career opportunities as there are many divisions to this company. They offer good benefits and located everywhere
good,Aprendes a relacionarte con personas de diferentes posiciones y lugares.
good,Big Company. You can create your own opportunities. Networking is key to carving out a strong career path. Not all groups have a work life balance. Work load is demanding
good,"worked at the bank for several years and changed names several times!  Great people but not like a regular bank. It was basically a sales job where you sold loans to people,"
good,"If you do you job and avoid as many people as you can you'll be fine, otherwise it will be difficult to adjust to the culture of Citi. At Citi the C stands for a lot of things but primarily Change is one."
good,"best banking systems and processes as far as the banking fraternity i know, they let the employee understand and learn from the systems and implement the same"
good,"Provided me with a opportunity to use my tenured skills from previous employment.  My strenghts were utilized thru problem solving, multi tasking, and knowledge of Microsoft Word, Excel, and Power point.  "
good,Call center environment is not for me.  Was told I would advance to management of some department because of my degree. I was only moved to the fraud department.
good,Auto Collections. we collected debt from 30 day delinquency to repossession.....Pretty much managed your own accounts which gave yo manage skills in terms of well thought out and policy decision making
good,"It's a great company to work for, unfortunately, my manager was not as big a joy to work for. She was rude and snobby and definitely had favorites. You do get great benefits though"
good,I would prefer not to provide any review at this time. I was a consultant working on a contract with Citigroup and therefore limited direct interaction with citi management
good,Great folks to work with and constantly learning. Low pay and tough to advance.  Lots of politics and favoritism.  Work could get monotonous. Culture was good.
good,I prefer not to comment about CitiBank. I still work there. It is steady employment and provided a comfortable living. That is all I would like to say.
good,Management at Citi was very poor and lacked integrity. A very weak company. I would only recommend working there if the salary was very good. My experience ended up not being very positive.
good,"Nice place to work, management is good. Typical day will be like from 9 am to 5 pm. My team is awesome, very co operative and understanding. Over all nice place to work."
good,"Pros"
good,nice place to work but very high stress. thank goodness for the mute button on occasion because it is definitely necessary at times. great staff and management
good,La entidad como tal es exelente lo malo es la jefe qie ejerce una presion muy alta y fuera de contexto es demaciado mi renuncia fue mas que todo por la manaera como presionan al personal a todo momento es que te van a echar si no cumples es algo ostigante demasiado
good,"Deepens portfolio understanding"
good,"great money, but poor management, great bonus system and gym and lunch room, I enjoyed working four ten hour days as well. They pay good so they are high on pressure on sales goals."
good,"Was an exciting company to work for given all the changes it lead within the financial services industry. Started in the banking/brokerage service arm of the company. This gravitated towards insurance product wholesale.  In terms of personal growth in the industry, couldn't of picked a better organization."
good,"This job is pretty much the same day in and day out, taking incoming calls for the most part for credit card collections. Occasionally we would use a dialer to call out. Very diverse workplace culture which was nice."
good,If you get the desired role then it is fine to work. But the work environment and management is something like that you will be bound to feel pressure and that's where problem starts.
good,"Got to learn processing skills "
good,"To be an active employee who contributes to the Mission, Vision, and Values of the company, and to interact, on a professional level with other employees. To give excellent performance, and to translate my experience, knowledge, skills and abilities into value for the organization."
good,It's a high paced.  It can be stressful at times.  the industry is unpredictable.   The colleagues are the most enjoyable.   It can be a fun place to work for if we are not busy.
good,I love working for Citi! It is a great company to work for. They are very diverse and really want you to be active the various teams. They are family oriented and care about the community. You have the ability to promote within very quickly.
good,Citi was a great company to work for but when they brought in management from Wachovia all things went downhill from there. They had no idea how work environment plays out in NYC
good,"it was a fun project. learned a lot about banking "
good,A fast paced job in a pool run organization. Difficult to build a career when the organizational structure was constantly changing. The billing of expenses to various business units seemed arbitrary at best.
good,"In the position I am in, they have limited our advancement opportunities severely by removing the positions between phones agent and managers. While the company offers a pretty impressive benefits package, overall unless you plan on staying a phones agent, most job titles off the phone don't seem to have stability. I've seen entire departments closed down, majority of those being off the phone. I will say, they do make an effort to move you to another position in the event your department is shut down, but that normally means you'll wind up on the phones."
good,"If you do a good job, chances are they will get rid of others and give you more work without extra pay. "
good,"Okay place to work. Benefits and perks are great. The work is mindless and easy, however, mentally taxing. For some, it is not a good long term job. Building was always clean and nice to work in."
good,"Atendimento ao segmento premium com alto padrão de qualidade, um dos melhores bancos no segmento."
good,I worked their for 5 years and my department relocated to CT .  It was disappointing that we wasn't able to follow our jobs.  Therefore the entire department was surplus.  A few years later they moved it back to Texas due to CT did not work out.  It was to late everyone had moved on.
good,Citi is a good company to work for and I enjoyed working there for 10+ years. Moved along internally with different divisions and noticed that sometimes the management lack internally communicating with employees about the expectations and also providing timely feedback.
good,Phones were very busy and never any down time.  Worked for three senior level individuals.  Work a lot with Equity Traders and gained knowledge in regards to Rule 144 stock
good,"My experience at Citi has been that you will have to create opportunities for yourself through networking and continual efforts to improve.  Citi is very much about teamwork, so every win should be viewed as a TEAM success.  This can be difficult for someone who feels that they deserve special recognition, but no job is done individually."
good,A typical day consisted of coaching's or answering calls to help a representative in resolving an issue or navigate them through a process. I try to assist my manager on anything to simplify the workload. Keep team morale up. Hardest part was escalated calls. Allow the customer to vent. try my best to resolve the issue. best part was receiving compliments from both internal and external customers.
good,"I have worked for this company for 4 years and I have notice there are great benefits and days off. Advancement within the company is based off of who you know versus skill set,"
good,"Challenges and fast-paced environment lead a great learning experience."
good,"Good benefits, below average work experience. large cyclical lay offs and hiring. benefits are good, but poor training, upper management changes frequently, which is never a good sign."
good,Citi was a very nice place to work.  It has a decent work/life balance with good benefits.  The Compensation is moderate.  Learning and employee development is encouraged.
good,Sem muitas oportunidades de crescimento e extremamente rotineira
good,"Good location to work."
good,Job is not challenging. you will put up with the same issues on a daily basis as far as how many people need to open or close accounts. you need to convince them to keep the accounts open.
good,Productive place to work. Work environment is pleasant. Underwriters are knowledgable and capable. Underwriting training is effective and well planned.
good,worked there temporary.. benefits ok hours ok pay ok.. always fun dealing with customers in the lending business... happy to be getting some money.....
good,Citi Bank is a stepping stone on your career path. They have a very high turn over. No one stays long. They rotate managers every six months. They have their on way of doing things. The CITI way!
good,"Citi is a fun place to work for and they have some great people, workplace culture, value preposition, work life balance and opportunities for career advancement."
good,"Citi used to be a wonderful place to work, however, the only thing left that is any good is the benefits."
good,"laid back work environment, great team building, decent pay, great benefits, schedules could be little more flexible but overall the company is okay to work for."
good,"The review summary above describes Citi very well. No more description is needed. Benefits like insurance and paid leave are excellent, but it is very difficult to advance within the company due to nepotism."
good,"Good company to start out in the mortgage business, unfortunately the move a lot of the positions around all parts of the United States.  Uncertainty comes into play when this is a constant factor."
good,"goals are ok, everyone at citi works really hard, and as a long time associate I can guarantee that, however sometimes management wont help, specially when it comes to the end of day process, now it could have been the branch I was in , maybe other branches have a management team that actually earns their paycheck."
good,This company was my first job out of high school. The pay was very good as well as the benefits. It was slightly stressful since we were required to close a certain amount of loans per month and sell a minimum amount of insurance. What was also more so stressful was we had to collect payment on all loans made at our branch so we had to do our own collection calls. Sometime hundreds a day.
good,"Productive and fun .Ok to be here.Carrier growth is ok. No standards."
good,Citibank production was a good place to work. The company had to achieve there goals of operation for the day. I was trained on multiple machines in the production shop. The production was very detail oriented.  The company decided to move there production operations to Atlanta GA.
good,Good Work Life Balance. Management is encouraged to  work with employees to give as much flexibility as possible. Compensation is lacking. Room to advance.
good,Love my job! However I do not agree with everything they stand for. I am embarrassed by the display they put on in front of our building. I cant believe they would allow such things to take place on the grounds of this business.
good,I was a temp so it was really not a friendly environment outside of the other temps I had come in with. I didn't feel welcoming to the people around me nor helpful by management which lead to me leaving and moving on.
good,"In the positions I have held, I have learned a lot about Collections and Risk and Control and have had the opportunity to expand my experience from financial analysis to project management"
good,"This job was different from other positions I have held. Being a Bond Counter was fun.  l learned their are different types of bonds, securities that people have. The environment was easy going. Everyone helped each other if you had an issue."
good,"great place for an MBA summer internship, though was there in summer of 2008, so as you can imagine was quite a toxic place to be at that time. enjoyed my time"
good,"excellent sales and product training both via webinars and seminars available for sales representatives to advance;"
good,"Standard bank job.  Focus on a specific set of tasks, coworkers are great for the most part.  It's operations so, stress usually comes from front office."
good,"To start my corporate journey with Citibank has been a critical learning process that helped me transform swiftly from a fresh college graduate to a competitive and dynamic professional. A typical day at work mostly encompasses juggling countless client- centric as well as daily hygiene activities in the limited 24 hours. From analyzing client's wealth portfolio, to keeping myself abreast with the latest news in the world of finance and the rest, to meeting clients and discussing more optimal ways to enhance their gains from money- in- hand, to fulfilling business targets, the role of a Relationship Manager requires wearing several hats at one time and being proactive and aggressive at every second. Through my stint here, I have excelled at cross- functional team management, teamwork and leadership that are essential for progress at work."
good,"Good atmosphere to work. Good and flexible office timings. Very good understanding relationship manager and team leader, Quality administration. Friendly and cooperative senior staffs."
good,"I was responsible for preparing mortgage documents for closing on real estate.  Answered a multi-line telephone system, responsible for having copies ready a prepped for the mortgage processors when clients were scheduled.  Worked under four mortgage processors."
good,Good supportive teams and robust training platform for career development that facilitates in carrying out your core responsibilities seamlessly. A lot of team building activities that provide work-life balance.
good,"During 3 years it was a great place to work, learned a lot about the industry and gave me the opportunity to travel and get education. It has a large turnover because they want to get rid of their retail businesses in LATAM. That has made the morale of the employees to go down."
good,"Citi has a huge palette of products and services as well as a global foot print which brings you into contact with many different subjects, interesting people and complex matters that will grow you. "
good,"the brand is well known and pay is good, quality of management strongly depends on individual manager and can vary"
good,"This job had great benefits, the management was good, and the compensated well. The only downside for me was that I did not like talking on the phone all day."
good,"have good team, great workplace, nice leader, less workload but less bonus.little bit favoritism in team (but little only), frequent changing procedure."
good,Great place to work and grow. Management is kind and fair.  Employees are willing to help and grow your career. There are technical growth and imagination at this company.
good,they request too much from you and for you to find out when policies have changed on your own what makes it extremely difficult to succeed without failing first. Compensation per sales isn't the best either. didn't seem worth it to work there for poor pay and long hours
good,The typical day at work is as any business process outsourcing offices.  But it is still very exciting to be working in such a place because of the fact that you will be challenged even though it is just a project-based employment.
good,Direct dealing with the customers and make them happy everyday. Citi is the costumer eccentric organisation and provides very good services to its consumers.
good,"very stressful environment "
good,City is an ok place to work with great job security depending on what department you are in. If you work in the basement you can be there for life if want.
good,I was work in citifinancial. i am verified some document and issue all details in system. i did full work for citifinancial work example for book printing and card printing done
good,Ok job.  I guess everyone just have to work there in order to know and find out all the good and bad things from a company.  The first step is to try it out.
good,A typical day is busy from the moment you arrive until the moment you leave. Often more than 8 hours is required each day. The piers have always been helpful. The culture is very competitive at all locations.
good,"This was a standard callcenter position. It was fine for what it was. I enjoyed my team and my manager. Left, because this just wasn't the job for me."
good,Was a good company to work for and management was on the ball. Great leaders and lots of room for promotions. Always had change the company was always trying to get better.
good,Good place but demanding. There are plenty of opportunities for those that are assertive and innovative. Depending on the area there can be long hours. Pay is ok. Benefits are decent/standard in the industry.
good,A typical day was very srtessful and a very fast moving pace. Learned very little. The managment team was very unreasonable. The culture was very stressful. The hardest part was to maintain client services. Managing the staff
good,"Otimo Banco. Apesar de muita pressão, é uma empresa que acolhe seus funcionários e os valoriza."
good,"Good company to work for, but the oppurtunity for growth was limited due to broken promises. Enjoyed the work atmosphere and co-workers. The overall experience was solid."
good,"Citi is a good company to work for.  They provide very good benefits for the employees. The Campus contains, a gym, day care center, cafeteria, medical office, bank, print media shop and a shipping/mail center."
good,"My Role"
good,"Citi was a nice place to work, benefits and pay were great just not as much room for advancement as i would like. Constantly changing so always something new going on and never stays the same"
good,Currently work in a call center.  It is a good place to get experience. Benefits are good but pay is below average. Corporate surveys employees numerous times on how to improve job experience.
good,"Recommend to anyone. Working remote was a wonderful opportunity.  However, underwriting will likely be be moved offshore by 2018.  So, don't know how much stability."
good,"I took inbound call for the most of the day from customer and the personal banker "
good,"Can not recommend this position to anyone. Too much stress on meeting required on call scoring. Even though managers tried to be helpful, they had to meet their goals as well and all seemed over stressed."
good,"I've worked here for several years, and it's been a great place to be. Lately, they've gotten a lot of new management that doesn't understand what is going on, nor do they take the time to figure out what is going on. LEARN from your tenured folks, develop and get them where they want to go."
good,"All in all a great company to work for. Great benefits and really mentor you in what you're doing. If you're looking for a job to move up in, Citi is definitely the place to work for."
good,"I enjoyed working in Citi and would work for them again if work balance could be improved."
good,"Great company and product. An opportunity to grow."
good,"Great company and product. An opportunity to grow."
good,Aprendi que nem sempre devemos acreditar no que as pessoas falam. Tive que me superar dia-a-dia para fazer minha carteira de clientes.
good,No a fan of the mixed shifts and working weekends. Company has great vacation and insurance benefits. Work environment is fun and enjoying. Need more time not attached to the phone and on other projects to make the area a  better work place.
good,"Citi was a great place to work. I learned a great deal about creative Underwriting and Project Management there."
good,"Great work-life balance here, however it is a bit slow paced. Support front office teams. We are the converting agent between our local custodians and our clients."
good,"I do not wish to rate this company.  I have worked here and learned a lot of things, but do not want my opinion to affect decisions of anyone reading my resume in any way."
good,Typical day at work would be working on tasks given. Meetings were held once a week to see how many tasks have been finished and what are the next tasks that will need to be done before the next release.
good,"Good place to work and no pressure. Lot of opportunity for learning technical skills and develop your knowledge on account and  business. Developed Microsoft Excel reports, automated manual reporting process and responded quickly to the usersreport request"

good,"The company pays well and has good work environment as well. But the senior management and immediate bosses or leads are not supportive. "
good,"great people who work here, its just to bunched in together where you don't have enough privacy  ......................................................"
good,"work is challenging on a daily basis"
good,Many different clients. Was able to answer calls to several different clients in one day. Very versatile in multitasking. Learned strong customer service skills and learned strong customer client ethics.
good,This is a stable job.  Not a bad location in Getzville.  New building.  The people are nice.  Many projects going on throughout the organization globally.
good,"I was a temporary employee. I learned quickly due to great training and on the job experience. The team I worked with was great and supportive. We processed mortgage payoff packages. The day was always busy and there was never a ""slow"" hour. Great work, decent pay. Unfortunately the temp project was soon over."
good,The people make it an enjoyable place to work.  Good benefits with bupa cover and a variety of select benefits. Not great at rewarding employees.  Bell curve approach adopted when grading staff.
good,"After spending summer vacations working at Citibank, I was offered a job after graduating from college in 1986.  It was a good place to start, though the work I did was far removed from banking."
good,"If you like to be on the phones 98% of the time you are at work and not seeing people face to face it would be okay. However, I rather have half and half on the phone and fact to face with new customers to talk with. Management very nice people."
good,A typical day at work is pretty interesting you have many of clients to service and help on the phone lines as well as coming into the local office. You have to be able to control the conversation as well as build a relationship with the client in a short window.
good,Typical environment is working on Firm initiatives and projects in the New York office.  Majority of line positions have been transferred to Low Cost Centers leaving project jobs to enhance and streamline processes in Finance.

good,"good place to learn, difficult to move up. culture is ok, could be better. good percentage of international, diverse people. excellent brand name recognition"
good,"Stay productive and busy, while remaining professional and friendly, and you'll go a long way.  During my tenure there, I worked on many projects.  However, the projects scope wasn't long enough for me to remain there."
good,"Good at MS office, and other tech skills and good at analytical skills as well and a quick learner for new things, ability to share new ideas to the organisation for process improvement."
good,Proud bank with 200+ year history. That history can some with its pros and its cons. Under the right managers and in the right role can be a great place to work.
good,Huge work environment. High opportunity for interaction with several people from several parts of the world. Overall a great work environment and a good brand name too.
good,"A typical day at work revolved around sourcing STPL loans and disbursing it. CitiFin operated on a cost centre approach and hence learning was immense and so was work pressure, however duly rewarded."
good,Great company to work for and with. Very professional and fun at times. Team meetings are great and the management actually cares.
good,I was bank trainee and was treated well. I was assigned work that did not match my education so my days were challenging.  After my traineeship was completed I realized I did not want to work in banking.
good,"cit actually good platform to earn and fun working environment. i really have learned so many new things at citi. e.g , how to handle difficult customer and negotiate  with customer. basically how to deal with customer. the hardest part of job is doing cross sell via phone. because the department target keep changing based on company productivity. really challenging for staff because the target just getting higher and higher. the most enjoyable part is meet new people and promoted as mentor."
good,Fun workong place but not a very good place to achieve career advancement. Overall was just okay and not much work life balance. Need to improve more.

good,"My typical Day at CITIBank was from 9 - 11 pm. In Pakistan Consumer Banking was being introduced so I was one of the first clerks to establish all departments for consumer banking, Of Course with help of others. When I was transferred to HR Department, I took on a responsibility of 4 jobs and finally after 2 years was assigned Personal Assistant to HR Director."
good,They were very friendly and ready to place you in a position. Went out of their way to make sure I got my check when it got lost in the mail.
good,I worked with this group as a contract consultant. Great team to work with very energetic and engaging. As a consultant they treated you like a team player
good,My time at this company was great. I was promoted twice within an year and a half. They would recognize us that worked hard and always rewarded us with something to show how much we were appreciated.
good,"Working for Citibank was a great experience especially when the bank purchased Cal Fed Bank, it was a challenge for our customers and employees but by working together and professional follow up it all worked out great."
good,"The pay was not fair, and the training was not clear. The management staff was not helpful, and it was unclear what the benefits structure was. All in all I would not work for this company again."
good,"Depending on the manager assigned determined the degree of training you received for future advancement."
good,Great company to work.  The most enjoyable part of the day is making new home owner's dreams come true. They also have a very nice full cafeteria.
good,typical day at work make sure resident are doing fine give them there medicine. And keep there health good exercise daily an exercise groups.
good,Salary is low but they are pressuring you regarding sales targets. The bank and managers has too much demands to the sales agents.

good,"Its really a great experience working with ICICI, the knowldedge I have gained is good."
good,"Not able to move up very often. Good pay and benfits. Not very organized."
good,Citibank had a very formal environment in the past. In parts that is related to the industry the company is and the old brand image it had in the country.
good,I had worked in Citi from 1998 thru 2013. It was a great experience working in different teams in technology. I had learned a lot. Had worked with talented people and learned a lot.
good,"red tape, top heavy, face time is far too important. However, the people are extremely smart and willing to teach. Great place to start a career regardless of where you end up"
good,"There is no work life balance in this company, Thus for those who can work over the working hours which is regular of 8 hours could work here comfortably"
good,"Not Available, Currently working for Citi will update in the near future. Each Branch is different based each employee. Citi itself offers great products which sell themselves."
good,"Citigroup in Jacksonville understood the value of family, community and workers. For those with families, the community team always organized a fun time for families. There's a daycare on the campus for those that have young children and co-workers spoke highly of the daycare. For those that love to give back to your community, Citi cared greatly about the community and being involved. So much so that they rewarded those that went above and beyond. Finally, as an employee, there were so many benefits that you could take advantage of. My favorite was the onsite gym and it was not high price to be a member and it got rid of the excuse that I have to go somewhere else to workout. I miss all these features."
good,"1. Work was ok ok in citi"
good,"Company expects you to work extensive hours to get the job done."
good,"	Real Estate Account Servicing (Adjustment of terms, Short Sale, Deed in Lieu, Settlements, and Deferments)"
good,"	Loan underwriting skills based on customer loan application and credit reviews"
good,very set job.  got to be tedious and boring.  there are just so many employees that everyone is extremely specialized.  I already filled this out once.
good,Citibank was my first job out of college and the pay was decent coming from college ($13.50 hourly) I think i made $40K my first year after a few bonuses (which is not that good now that i make 100K). The benefits like health insurance was hands down the best. Culture was actually pretty good. Personally i can't be on the phones via customer service it sucked.
good,"Finance is not for everyone but for those that like it, it can be very rewarding knowing you can help people when they need it most. Must be able to put business first."
good,"Given the right management, you can really succeed here. Unfortunately, with it being such a large organization, some corporate decisions are made that you will have no control over. For example, corporate's decision to relocate departments, not everyone is in a position to be able to relocate. Benefits were good, work/life balance, flexibility were key for me when I was there."
good,Manage rm sales strategies and balance with sales revenue plus training.
good,"Project Management exposure"
good,"Work with Citi employees on HR issues. Research and help resolve any issues, take phone calls and cases regarding this matters. Payroll, Disability, Garnishment, Tax"
good,"A lot of opportunities to advance but management is old school and because of that work is limited. Management is the worse part of Citi group, all the worker bees should be promoted."
good,Exceptional customer service experience. High volume . Sales can be tough because not trained enough on each product but learn as you go. Tough management but tolerable! Overall great leaning experience.
good,"The pay is marginal, the benefits are good. You are replaceable though.  The hours can e tough to manage home and work life."
good,"A typical day at this institution was very busy and hectic. For those who are into chaos and extreme fast pace sales environment, this is the place for you."
good,Positive team leaders . Perks were going to team building seminars and traveling.  Hours were flexible and everyone at work had great personalities.  Great working environment.
good,This job is very drama out I don't like it that's all its nothing else to say I put in 2 week notice and I will be leaving very soon because that's not a good work place
good,"A typical day is anything but atypical, I work in a fast paced and high energy environment, with cross function and cross team cooperation. I have learned not just the mortgage industry but team building, individual management, team management.  Working within confines while being able to be able to work alone meeting goals and restraints."
good,"•	Issuing and cancelling certificate to affect changes in the ownership, acting as intermediary payments and letter of credits"
good,"a lot of trainings provided"
good,"In all fairness, I believe every manager does what they were hired to do and do what's necessary for their department.However in my opinion I feel as though my most recent manager was more concerned with helping out his friends. A typical day at work can be from moderate to extremely busy depending on the trading day. I loved being busy and taking care of customer needs. I learned how to function in a fast paced environment & taking care of customer needs in a timely manner.  I loved my past management team they were concerned about their employees welfare. I didn't have much interaction with present manager, he behaved as though I didn't exist (which ultimately led to my dismissal). I had excellent co-workers, I was part of an integrated team. The hardest part of the job was trying to complete job clearing function whilst experiencing system issues. My most enjoyable part of my job was completing my daily job function in a timely and accurate manner without incidence."
good,"Fast paced environment until you get the hang of working cases then everything slows down dramatically."
good,"Citi is a well structured company with endless opportunities.There are a lot of layers which can be discouraging at times, but overall the company has a lot to offer."
good,Currently the role and the bank is focused on network optimization and uncovering future prospects of growth. A typical day incorporates dealings with 17 markets in the regional network across various growth agendas.
good,I was a back up receptionist and set up windshield appointment.  I typed form letter and drafts daily.  I worked in the mail room and also order supplies.
good,Citi is a wonderful place to work.  You are allowed a great work and life balance.  The people continue to leave Citi for other outside positions which scares me.
good,"I stayed in the same position for 6 yrs, there was no where to go, no room to grow. The metrics were sometimes too hard to get incentives."
good,Great company with a fast paced environment and competitive benefits. One of the drawbacks is that advancement can be difficult in such a large company due to 'red tape' from HR.
good,Citi is good company to work for if you are starting your career.  A great learning atmosphere with a focus on results and accountability.  It is a highly matrixes organization which can help one build good relationship skills.
good,"Managing a team of 4 employees. Managing 10 million in PL and RE receivables. Collection calls, Sales calls. Interaction with client. Making financial suggestions and decisions for clients. Compliant to company policies and procedures. Ensure that the team follows the policies and performs ethically.  I work with a great TEAM. We are committed to success and providing a warm welcoming branch environment for our clients. Provided a very open and happy working environment for my staff."
good,"Daily task:- "
good,"Challenging workplace with fast moving international business. "
good,"all activities are geared towards results, number of ""widgets"" sold daily, and customer service scores.  Not much support in overcoming individual market challenges such as the number of vacant stores in the vicinity, competition with other branches in the area."
good,"The employees were all great, however they kept lowering our compensation and raising goals, so it made it hard to work for them after about the third time of this happening."
good,"Nice to work here with friendly coworkers."
good,"get breakfast, learned how to save accounts, helpful co-workers, saving customers accounts from issues they may had & asking probing questions to better understand their needs"
good,Its ok i was there 13 years i was able to affect different lines of business which makes me well rounded in banking as well as customer service also credit cards and wires department

good,Great company to work for. Great health and retirement  benefits and culture. Career advancement and opportunities for all employees. Company focuses on clients needs
good,"Approve mortgages, credit cards, personal loans. Solicit clients to apply for personal loans with the company. Approve and deny clients base on credit history."
good,"Was a great place to work met a lot of good people and learned a lot- great company to train."
good,I enjoyed Citi. I really enjoyed the challenges of working in fraud. I almost felt like a detective when i had to occasionally speak to the person who was committing the fraud.
good,"Helping clients with their financial needs was the most enjoyable part of the job. Co-workers always helped each other as a winning team, as well as management would give constant feedback to make sure we provided superior customer service."
good,"Citi expects individuals to manage huge workloads with small pay to match. More funds are spent on sponsoring other entities than employees. Management is not up front with employees when it comes to layoffs. They trick you and tell you that everything is fine, then lay you off."
good,"I worked as an executive assistant at Citi for five years. I enjoyed my work and peers very much. Even though I was laid off due to a department closing, my overall experience was very good."
good,bonus failed to pay. pay rate is below other company.  poor quality supervisor due to poor hiring scanning.  the supervisor got mad when the female employee reject his flirtation.  he started to give her a hard time.
good,"lot of scope to grow for beginners, career mobility to moce tyo different teams ,open culture,"
good,they have a high turn over rate and it takes for ever for you to get anywhere in the company. other than that it was okay working there I just didn't like the collections scene and that's why I left.
good,"Running machines including opening mail,scanning and running the transport machines.batching mail,cleaning up,restocking supplies. I tried to be helpful in any way I could..Towards the end of my employment things changed.. Most of the managers over the years seem to be kind to me. I felt that some issues were not resolved fairly but I continued to do my job to the best of my ability. The enjoyable parts of my job were casual dress,fun activities working as a team and accomplishing our goals.,"
good,very advance technology and resources available. decent incentive program. no long hours. great environment and love the customer base and customer service.
good,Great company with a lot of people willing to help you with your career.  Great work-life balance and managers who care.  Fantastic benefits and great compensation.
good,Nice bunch of people who enjoyed collecting payments for the company. The company had many collection incentives which made the job competitive as well as fun
good,"pay was very minimal, I worked on the Citi Gold and wire team and only made $14 an hour, should of been $18 easy. I don't like banks."
good,"No formal training, almost everything was on the job learning."
good,Good people to work with and environment is fine. Ability to get promotions is hindered by management though since pool of employees is so large.
good,"Learning experience was good "
good,"It was fun, and very friendly coworkers, I learned just about what I could because I was there for a very short period, and everything was great for the period I was there"
good,I was at CITI for 10 years and had more than a dozen direct managers. Some left the company but most were through reorgs. It made it difficult to build any relationships with managers and learn from them. The diverse workforce made for a good exchange of idea but the communications proved a difficult barrier to get past. Many times we had to do rework because requirements were not communicated/understood correctly.
good,"Interacting with our customers and understanding their requirements and deciding the facilities to be granted."
good,"The hardest part of the job was processing sensitive documents, daily audits daily meetings with management."
good,"working in an office servicing mortgages right in the height of the Obama mortgage reform was extremely bust work, things have settled down a lot since than and i would recommend working at a mortgage company if you are good with fine details"
good,"When I started at Citi it was a very strong and stable workplace with it's own culture. It stayed that way until the economy tanked several years back. After that time it began to change into more of an environment where everyone in every department was fearful for their jobs. Departments started to merge, and everyone started taking on several peoples workloads. Eventually my department merged with IT and pretty soon I was thrust into an IT Desktop Support position, learning on the job. It wasn't long before even managers were scrambling to hold onto their jobs, and executives started announcing mass lay-offs. Within a few years working in this uncertain environment brought the quality of working for this once-great company down dramatically."
good,unrealistic goals set at times and work life balance not always taken into consideration. out dated systems doesn't allow you to work at full capacity
good,"Lot of meetings"
good,Challenging work environment with good and knowledgeable co-workers. Ran global overnight batch operations & monitored multiple related global systems during overnight operations and ensured all previously agreed upon SLA's were met daily.
good,Citi attracts good talent in consumer banking esp. on the asset side; laser sharp focus on P&L; wide product range; well developed cards portfolio management technology; just a very interesting business overall
good,"lovable workmates with exceptional offices and bosses,has a tight security in workplace."

good,"no tuve posibilidad de ascenso, lastimosamente trabaje mucho para consegurio pero ni fue posible"
good,"Each day is essentially the same - record your every movement, answer similar calls over and over, receive pressure from management to make sales goals. For some, the sales environment and repetition is ideal. For others, it is stifling. The benefits are amazing and my manager was very good about working with me on personal issues."
good,"Salary is ok"
good,"banque dans un context international"
good,"nice and friendly co workers"
good,"It is a strong and solid company to work for. There are comfort in working for a global international company."
good,"fun enviroement, team work, flexible, great manger... would come back and work for them again"
good,"A empresa me deixou um grande aprendizado, pois aprendi muito a resolver problemas burocráticos e adversos, pois a Cultura implantada pelo grupo estava um pouco fora da realidade cultural da cidade, percebido depois de feedbacks e reuniões regionais. Mas foi muito bom ter trabalhado nesse grupo."
good,"Excellent organisation built over years, Very bright people working in a focussed way, too much politics and favouritism, some amazing co-workers and some average ones."
good,"Overall it is an ok place if you are truly passionate about sales, the pay is just entry level and the sales goal is hard to hit. so again your experiences is depended on you branch manager and location."
good,"My typical workday consist of projects and help desk resolution."
good,Great place to start off if you do not have any customer service experience. I definitely recommend them. Great staff and co workers.
good,"Great place to work and Work culture is good, helping co-workers, good management."
good,"As a Major Incident Manager, we are the top escalation path for franchise critical outages.  Outages include reputation, monetary, trader impacting, regulatory & internal / external impact.  I must enter a situation with minimal information, question to the void utilizing Kepner Tragoe / ITIL deductive reasoning, be the voice & leader of the call, direct & push business & support teams to perform troubleshooting & triage in the quickest possible manner.  Extensive executive write-ups, heavy documentation & multi-tasking 5-6 things at one time.  Issues that are escalated to Incident Management could impact any of the 160 countries that Citi has a presence in as well as the ~85,000 applications supported by Citi Technology Infrastructure.  You must have the ability to handle enormous amounts a stress, make neary no mistakes throughout the lifetime of a Major Incident & be able to perform 3-4 different functions while also driving the technical bridge."
good,"A typical day at work normally starts at 7.30am. I like to organise my day and emails as early as possible. By 9am, a plan is created to call clients to provide updates on existing requests or just to say hello. At this time of the year its all about account planning and understanding clients short and long term objectives. "
good,"Citibank is embracing the standards of IT practices. It might be confusing at first and sometimes there is too much red tape, however, it is important that they follow the proper standards so that it will become a norm. They take very good care of their employees and vendors that is why there are a lot of people staying here for a long time. I have learned a lot in my time here such as customers are very important in their core business."
good,"I make a fair salary and get to work from home one day a week, but there is not much budget for merit increases, our work space is crowded and don't feel my job is secure. My direct managers have been good but I don't agree with the direction of upper management."
good,"My typical work day consists of me making outbound and taking inbound calls assisting customers with possible fraud on their card accounts. My co-workers are always friendly and helpful. "
good,Didn't really work here long enough to review.  They are very flexible with your schedule and the training is moderate to difficult.
good,"You have an opportunity to learn about a lot of different departments because of the fact you usually take calls for more than one department/type of customer (i.e. you may take calls for New Account servicing during the daytime, then when that department closes, you take Citibank banking calls)."
good,"A typical work day consist of reviewing new to bank customers, which are mainly Non Resident Aliens. The case logs consist of about 8 to 10 procedures which need to be completed in order to accept each client. The typical daily work requirement is about 6 case logs per day. I typically work about 10 or more cases a day. It's a pleasure working with my team. As far as management, these are new AML procedures to Citi, so a lot is changing as we progress. The hardest part of the job are the company software errors and updates. the most enjoyment part of my position, is knowing I'm working my cases correctly as I do them and getting each day I come in to do my job."
good,it is too big so lack of efficiency. you have to work in a global team environment. good benerfits and vacation and medical plan.
good,"good benefits, lots of time off, 8hr work days, a lot of information to learn depending on the department you work, comfortable work stations,"
good,Good benefits but lacking in compensation for someone with a higher education and no room for growth from a long term perspective.
good,I really enjoyed being able to interact with colleagues all across the globe and to achieve our goals by working in teams of individuals with different points of views.
good,Great company but I won't recommend because I'm not here to influence anyone. I don't have anything else to say about this company. It's not relevant to my job search.
good,"Avg. Comp,, "
good,"Small location, where everyone knew each other, great people to work with, and fun activities for the staff on a regular basis."
good,"The majority of my day consisted in managing my contract employees who handle site maintenance, mail, supplies, printer support. Other duties included troubleshooting for employees with desktop help where access or computer issue requiring a ticket; meeting with vendors who serviced our site; staffing report, tracking system issues on SharePoint, process bill payments for services."
good,Senior Leader job cuts mean no upward growth in the near future.  Future cuts at lower ranks mean more work for same salary.  Not a good environment right now.
good,"I perform surveillance for Gifts and Entertainment and Travel and Expense reports for Citi employee-- to identify Government owned entities and State owned entities and employees. "
good,"work culture is like just another bank that hires millions of engineers."
good,In the beginning I enjoyed this job.  Then when I was being demaned to stay late (till 10 pm) towards the end of the month to meet our target on collections I decided this job wasn't for me anymore.  The hardest part of this job was collection on past due accounts.
good,I enjoy working in my company but there was days when it could get very busy to get the job done.I had about ten years of financial experience and regulations.
good,Great technical environment. Offices are at very convenience location. My past experiences in the work place have been rewarding
good,I prefer not to comment as I have reservations on matters. It does have good pay and benefits. Good for people just out of school.
good,"When I started working there 5 years ago it wasn't too bad; however, things are changing and they are making it more difficult to do the job as a one on one with the customer."
good,"For such a large company, sometimes it seems strange that technology at this firm seems behind the curve. "
good,I worked at Citi for almost 14 years.  The culture and work environment are great!  Citi has a long history of volunteering in the communities in which they are located and they highly encourage every employee to volunteer.
good,"Large, full service. international, financial firm.  Extent provides many opportunities to branch out, take on new aspects of business and interact with different cultures."
good,Well manage company and can easily adopt to. We have the change to meet new clients and explore the outside world of the organization.
good,"flexible work schedule, good management, peers were great, we worked as a team and always helped out each other whenever needed"
good,"Citigroup was a good company to work for. Training was excellent. Unfortunately Citigroup outsourced this department outside of the contiguous United States. Therefore, my job, and eventually the whole department, was eliminated."
good,The work environment can be stressful at times. People are nice and work together as a team and look to do a great job each and every day.
good,Working as Field IT Support for Citibank branches the employees are stressed out making work environment not a good one.
good,There are a large amount of responsibilities involved with this position but pay is fairly low. You mostly learn everything on the job.
good,"I worked for a sub contractor of Citi Group, not directly for the company so I don't have the best input on the company itself."
good,"employee supportive and freindly managment. Many new and exciting challneges faced during tenure here. Helpsed to grow in may areas like technical skills , personal skills as well as managerial skills"
good,Flexi working hours is nor redundant for us.fun working with citi eventhouh there is stress. haaoy working day and with friendly manager and being perform very well.
good,"I held to many different positions within the institution."
good,"Part of a complex project, with lots of moving part. The team I was working for was great wished could have stayed longer and contributed to the project"
good,"This company use to be great to work for, but anymore it is just all politics. Even the clients are starting to realize it and moving on. Half of my training class quit before we were out of training class because of the politics on calls"
good,liked the customers and liked that the bank didn't place as much pressure on you to make sales. Liked my supervisor and people I worked with.
good,it was my first call center job and i didn't know what to expect but overall it was nice. worked in collections and it was a lot of people not answering really.
good,"Nice place to work plenty of opportunity to grow and their are programs to help in your career growth, The benefits are a plus too. Overall, I would recommend Citi to others."
good,"My experience has sharply increased regarding the mortgage industry in concern of Foreclosure, short sales, DIL's and modification acceptions for home owners. For the most part the co workers were most helpful but due to the lack of time to make their numbers, if help was required if was difficult to assist when requested.  If I had to say what was the most difficult part of the position, it would be the numbers that management required as an unrealistic view while working under the threat of being laid off for over a year and a half and that it could be ""you"" at anytime.  The most enjoyable part of the position was the sense of accomplishment when the day was completed and you know the numbers and the work that were done were well done... and to the best of your ability."
good,"It is an international institution where we can learn a lot about backroom administration of investments from opening, maintenance, accounting, taxation up to the closing; and even extended up to the administration of estates."
good,"It's the typical commercial bank mindset where it's all based on production.  I think I am well compensated for my position but the work load is high volume and I work 10 hours a day including eating lunch in my cubicle and I am not in managerial level.  It's not required to work 10 hours but there is an expectation which has been expressed verbally.  Overall the working environment is acceptable.  It's different for everyone.  Basically it's just comes down to what you want in life.  I am just there for the time being but do not expect to make Citi my life long career workplace so I just take my paycheck, do the work until I decide my step."
good,Productive workplace with generous flexibility.  There is a lot of opportunity for training. A great place to learn within the company and gain a wide range of knowledge.
good,I was very fortunate to be there ......  except with the manager ....... I was able to move freely ...... I was able to learn many things
good,An interesting internship at a time where financial products were not fully implemented or allowed yet in China by foreign banks. So it was mostly limited to some FX products and deposits linked accounts.

good,"Working at Citi pond was an enjoyable experience. I've worked with different customers such as teenagers to seniors. Citi pond was a winter adventure skating rink, hot chocolate,music and full of love"
good,I spent 18 years with the company.  The growth potential was slow but overall it is a good company to work for.  I gained a lot of experience and knowledge
good,Little or no technology support. No advancement opportunities and horrible compensation. There is no job security at Cit. The people you work with are great the cost cutting they do only goes into the pockets of the top executives.
good,Processing of Corporate Action in Securities is always in the learning stage as global securities are always enhanced. You will never be bored with the job.
good,monthy target achive is always a very hard job and as easy as anything else and meeting with different customer and convince them to have a account with us is always challenging
good,Citi is not a bad place to get your first job out of college.  It offers valuable work experience and networking opportunities.
good,"communicating with customers of the bank."
good,"Bureaucratic and not a meritocracy.  Some great co-workers and others who are just there for the ride. Management pays lip service to ethics, but they don't put their money where their mouth is."
good,really fast passed large call volume. I really liked there especially because of my co workers they made it a reallt fun place to work.
good,Its a financial company which market financial products.They are one of the pioners in insurance seeling brokage and some new products and reforms in the industry
good,"Productive workplace with a very well articulated vision, and well defined goals and expectations.  A place that allows a decent amount of freedom of expression and foster a culture in which quality comes first."
good,Huge company if you're willing to relocate for more opportunity back east.  Not such a good company in the midwest due to consistent layoffs.  Good starter company.
good,"It's not awful when you have good management. Easy job to do, good day time hours. Full time doesn't work weekends. Flexible schedules for part time employees."
good,Great group of people to work with. worked for same company just different departments. Lots of work activities and workshops.
good,I was a Fraud Specialist and worked night shift and was on the phone with customers at the point of sale.  Would have to verify identity and verify that the previous charges on their credit cards were correct in order to remove the hold from their cards.
good,"fun workspace"
good,"I love the customers that appreciates my hard work and service for them. "
good,Citi has been a great place to work in the past. Typically it was good but customer service was enjoyable. Wait time too long for waiting period before benefits kicked in. Just had to wait before this took effect.
good,Overall experience was good.  The co-workers were very helpful with the training of the functions being transferred to the Owings Mill location.
good,When I began working at Citi it was a wonderful working atmosphere with very smart individuals. It is a good company with a great mission.
good,It's a tradeoff between the benefits provided with management. Lacks transparency and a big thumbs down for the management style.
good,"Promises of full time employment from staff but , assignments and work environments are good .Applied for position going in that this would be it , 40 hours a week coming close to end of probation period  hours declined to 25 hours then the shuffling began .I thought they just handled application processes for the company , not that I would be with Citistaff applicate ....I want to be a company's employee to work hard everyday and help them prosper along with myself ."
good,"If you don't mind large corporations, it was a good place to work. Coworkers were really nice. the only thins was the massive layoffs That being said, when they had layoffs, they would host job fairs on site."
good,"Citi Bank has great benefits for their employees. The salary is reasonable, however, the bonus is near impossible for most to achieve.  The management is personable and they coach at every opportunity. This is a constantly evolving environment. There are opportunities to transition to other departments after the required time and tenure are met as well as a positive track record at your current position.  This is a great place for someone who enjoys an extremely structured environment with opportunities to transition within the company."
good,"its fine. Challenging and exciting."
good,"What I learned while working here, every department is ran different and what works in one department doesn't in another. The schedule you pick when you are hired, will stay with you for years, so choose wisely. Hardest part of your job is keeping up with all the changes.  Everyday procedures are set to change any minute.  Always keep up with them. Moving up in the company depends on your scorecard, your yearly review, and your manager. Any manager you have can hold you back from moving up with this company or pursuing opportunities to move within this company.  The best part of the company is the benefits."
good,"Learned Infra work"
good,"I learned a lot about the stock market, analysis and how to do reconciliation's. My co workers were very friendly people.  I also feel like it was really easy to move up in this company."
good,"If you are looking for a company which gives high salary, you'll never go wrong with Citigroup Business Process Solutions Pte. Ltd. The hardest part of the job is handling complaints which already reached presidential complain status. You have to check every detail, patient and focus to help out the customer."
good,"the campus itself is really nice and the cafeteria is wonderful. there's a lot of cultural diversity but not much age diversity (walking down the halls feels almost more like a college campus than a corporate campus). everything about citi is on a very tight purse-string, so maybe there's some hidden agenda about not hiring older people (for instance, less chance of a workman's comp claim, etc)"
good,"provided a clear understanding of the tasks, responsibilities and competencies involved in the customer service management job."
good,"The culture is wonderful, but management, oftentimes, had less experience in the mortgage field than those working for them.  The few of us who had made careers in the field were often fighting for change and a streamlined system with our recommendations falling on deaf ears. Consequently, lay offs ensued."
good,in sears customers could be very rude and spend their time yelling at you. but in best buy they were young and tech savvy. they knew what they wanted and moved faster then sears. a lot of drama in the people that work there. you spend your break listening to everyone complain about their jobs. management will stab you in the back every chance they get. they are nice to your face but can turn around and talk about you or your performance. i was witness to this very behavior on several occasions. and it eventually happened to me.
good,"First job experience. Taught teenagers about responsibilities, professionalism, and independency. Learned basic job duties from key boarding and etc."
good,Work environment varies from one extreme to the other dependent on management style. There is no clear sight on this to prevent disruption of proper job execution. I was first in a team with an excellent manager who allowed the team members to manage their time. A lot was accomplished with more satisfied users. Communication in the team was great and reliable. I made the mistake of transferring to another team and reported to an extreme micro manager who interrupted project schedules and offered the users even more than what they wanted/needed without consulting those teams involved in the process. This manager provided dates of delivery to stakeholders without any idea if these were feasible. Evaluate the management style. If the manager follows the protocols of the company you may have a fulfilling career.
good,"No comments- Nothing much to disclose as there is no work life balance here. Compensation is not wise, eligible and experienced candidates are left behind."
good,"Typical day at work involves sitting at a desk taking phone calls from banking clients. Management depends from each team, most managers are very inattentive while some are rather strict. the hardest part of the job is being stuck in one spot for most of the day."
good,"good place and working environment, work life balance and fun activites at times. Challenging work and new projects are good in vision plus."
good,"What I have learned is how to processed the applications and to communicate to my co-workers with whatever concerns I have regarding the work that we do. A typical day at work is when I start a new tasks. As far as my manager go, we have good managers but the problem with management crew is that they are not looking at the candidates goals to help them with their career development. My co-workers are great to work with. There is no hardest part of the job."
good,"Eu era uma simples jovem aprendiz (terceirizada),salario baixo,não podia fazer muita coisa (alem de limpar a maquina de cafe e organizar documentos).Porem gracas a este emprego aprendi uma rotina de um banco,muitas informações de bancarias,fornecia um bom vale refeição.O grande problema e não haver oportunidade de efetivação,pois o quadro de empregados ja estava completo e ao contrario de muitos bancos tem 1 agencia em toda a região de minha cidade,e quando abria uma oportunidade,ja tinha a pessoa certa,os gerentes,caixas,estagiário em si entra tudo no esquema de indicação.Fora isso,essa oportunidade me fez conhecer um pouco da rotina bancaria,e me abriu oportunidade."
good,"The C in Citibank stands for change and I mean this literally on a quarterly basis, so if you're not keen on change be ready to learn"
good,"The company is good when it comes to service to people. But the welfare of the employees is not always its priority. The first five months is considered contractor period, and the next 5 months is probationary period. You have to work almost a year before you are considered a regular employee. No medical card for regular employees, unless you have rendered 10-year service."
good,"My Review working as Control Unit officer - "
good,"quality training within the company"
good,Citibank North America has great benefits and great training programs.  They have a true commitment to employees and want to see them succeed.
good,"Citi is a global financial company, one of the largest in the world.  It provides opportunities to work on just about any facet of markets and technology.  But the trend in recent years, like most corporate giants, is to focus on tightening the belt.  While this can certainly help the company refocus and emerge a better player in the global arena, Citi has a bad tendency to sacrifice employee morale and betterment, for the apparent short term gains on the bottom line.  A giant push exists to offshore talent, when the majority of the big players have already tried this and are in the midst of bringing the talent back.  Employee incentives have all but dried up, even while more and more is asked of the individuals.  Initiative and excellent performance is rewarded with more work and responsibility without compensation, leading inevitably to talent attrition."
good,we're on acquisition we are selling/offer credit cards for the customer  we're on a commission basis with a little monthly salary as well
good,My experience working for Citi was a very productive and yet challenging one. Never without something to do or learn. Each day presented another opportunity to learn more about the mortgage industry.
good,The company continues to have a lot of work and then laying people off. The people that have been there for a long time does not receive the compensation.
good,To monitor the ATMs globally. Help to solve the problems on glitched ATMs. Contact between the technical team or operations team and branches of Citibank to make all necessary need to fix the error on ATMs in order to make ATMs work functionally.
good,"- quite far from my house in pasir gudang"
good,A dialing system would call customers from a database of delinquent accounts sending calls to me. I worked with individuals whose accounts were over 6 months delinquent. My job was to offer solutions and problem solve to improve the accounts status and their financial outlook overall. It was a very competitive environment and our functions changed frequently once Citi acquired the company. The hardest part of my job was operating within the restrictions and still maintaining success. The most enjoyable part of my job was helping customers understand how credit works.
good,"Enjoyed working with my boss, IT personnel and co-workers. Also enjoyed working with our clients. Like learning about real estate property."
good,"Good workplace, Provide opportunity to work in various departments."
good,"Coming from another large company, I think Citi can build a better work culture. Nothing exciting going on to keep employees engaged. Commission structure is complicated and it is quite difficult to surpass monthly goal required in order to earn commissions."
good,This a Good company to work but lagging in recent technology to use.Work life balance is good but Need to improve employee role
good,it was fun job and it provided tuition reimbursement which was a big plus. you also got every holiday off and they worked with your schedule as a student.
good,Very challenging place to get things done due to shear size and poor process.  A good biut has changed since I left and I believe improved with the sale of large businesses.
good,"AML analysis at Citi is a demanding and time intensive position. Strict deadlines require constant work, so the stress is high. That being said it pays well and the campus is great."
good,Competitive but bureaucratic. Though working here includes a lot of learning. Management at times does not value talent.
good,I had an amazing time working for Citigroup.  They are a very big organization and I was analysis charged with going through the many layers to analyze for cost savings.
good,"I work as part of a team of 5, we spend our day laising with supplier and various team to improve the turn around time for set-ups. It is a very fast paced job and multitask is one of my strengths as there are various requests that must be handled at the same time."
good,"working in citi is good. it is great learing experiecne and aslo worked it gery good"
good,"system go down"
good,"Great people in the HR function but as a large Corporation it is very bureaucratic."
good,Citi is a great place to start a career.  You get the opportunity to learn from highly educated managers and leaders.  Citi is also a place which advocates innovation and ingenuity.
good,"A good brand to work with, a great experience, lot to learn. Good management, supportive collagues, Excellent workplace. Excellent employee benefits."
good,Very fun and laid back environment. Teams play games to keep you motivated. Excellent company incentives and bonuses. Excellent support system if you need help with a customer..
good,A company that was mismanaged during the time I worked there. The company was on its way down and out. The company was in transition at this point.
good,This is a place that you can work and expect something different every day. there is no room for boredom.  The pace is hectic at times.
good,"place to learn,"
good,"Interesting place to work, hard to navigate made up of several silos.  Needs to streamlined; I've worked at many other large companies, but they were easier to navigate and get what you want done quickly."
good,"Good opportunity to assist with a project but since it was just a summer project, I can only provide limited information."
good,"Very fast paced and dynamic work place complete with all the perks of Wall Street complete with gym and day care. "
good,"Lavorare in banca mi piaceva, e anche molto. Le persone erano molto gentili, ma spesso dovevi faticare a fidarti. Il lavoro in se' era bellissimo, ho conosciuto molte persone viventi all'estero, avevo il mio pacchetto clienti e avevo le mie belle responsabilità. Portavo a termine ogni giornata lavorativa con il sorriso."
good,A typical day at work is analyzing cases and writing comprehensive reviews on negative news and senior public figure status.  What makes Citi a great place to work is the coworkers are friendly and very helpful.  My manager is a good coach and mentor.  The hardest part about the job is always running into new and unique situations and how to go about handling it.
good,"Worked on the migration of the Citibank through a consultant agency called Computer Merchant.  Assisted with running scripts, verifying domain changes and exchange changes.  Ensured the system was stable after the migration and user's could log in properly without any issues."
good,"Working at the Company is very hectic as everyone were all busy. It's like a slave culture.  There are a few good people but they have gotten used to the culture. Not a lot of room for advancement. "
good,"Provide exceptional customer service, managing irate clients, troubleshoot/resolve issues with efficiency, and communicating competently with purpose; all while in compliance with retail banking policies."

good,Helped customers with their accounts that were in the red and setting us payment arrangements or taking payments from them. Helping then try to make the payments alittle more managable for them to handle.
good,"Making the number 1 priority are my customers at the bank."
good,"Easy to get lost in the crowd. Must way over-perform to get any pay increases and advancement. Bonuses are rare in the technology end of the corporation. Good healthcare plans, a bit pricey but good."

good,"Opening procedures, and being promptly ready to assist clients."
good,I had a wonderful time working with company although I only work as part Time Teller.I've learned new banking systems and also share some of the knowledge I had regarding with my previous job same banking institution.I had a good relationship with my boss and officemate.
good,compensation is not great however since we're allowed to work remotely which results cost savings in transportation/ commuting. Working remotely also translates to better productivity.
good,Ok company to work for.  High expections with little training.  Has a lot of system flaws. Low traffic so it is ideal for a college student.
good,"A typical day working at Citi Financial (Student Loans N.A.) consisted of mostly taking and making inbound/outgoing debt collection calls. Contacting payees and establishing payment agreements for delinnquent balances was our purpose. An additional billet that some of the more seasoned collectors were given was skip tracing. Skip tracing involved the use of classified, highly advanced assets that allow creditors access to more personally identifiable information of their clients in an attempt to contact those delinquent on higher balance accounts."
good,"good company"
good,I have worked for Citi for 15 years.  13 of those 15 were great.  Management is the key to your happiness and success at Citi.  I am lucky to have had 13 amazing years with the company.

good,"Good place to work and need to spend late nights because of client meetings. Need to work with US timings, based on the projects."

good,Compensation on downward trend bank wide though work flow continues to increase across the board.

good,"Typical day in my role at CITI consists of collaborating globally  with numerous business units (Banking, Research, Sales & Trading) in an effort to maximize their current Market Data Exposure. By that, I mean, are we using the right tools, are we spending too much with a vendor, are the costs accurately allocated, are we negotiating the best rates, etc."

good,I have learned so much from the mortgage industry from the whole sale upfront process to the Document Collection area working with internal and external clients in being a 100% productivity and have no errors. I even learn the default end of the mortgage industry when our customers are in foreclosure and try there best to either reinstate or payoff there loan to get them either back on track.

good,It is tough to learn the ropes due to the size of the organization and the frequency of reorgs.
good,"Citi has great benefits but being in sales is a stressful area for their company. In today's economy, it is really hard to get someone to pay for balance transfer opportunities. I have learned the exact way interest is calculated, cash advance vs. balance transfers and general details about how a bank runs. My co-wokers were great but somewhat one minded since sales is how they keep their job they are soley focused on trying to sell something to a client vs seeing after what it is a client needs. Hardest part of the job was trying to satisfy a client who only wanted interest to be waived knowing it was no way possible to help them. The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to personally follow up with clients making sure I do what I promised and resolving issues on first call basis."
good,"Good work experience, old processes and technologies used"
good,"A typical day at work consisted of completing tasks related to budget management, reporting and procurement related activities to name a few. In addition, I was managing the needs of the multiple divisions' ad hoc requests for trouble shooting issues or deliverables to meet their client needs. The most difficult part of my job was being able to manage individuals that were reluctant to cooperate with our group and our budget requirements. In addition, it was difficult dealing with the conflicting objectives between Executive Management personnel. If we followed the direction of one of Executive Manager, we were often going against the direction of another one. The most enjoyable part of my job was being able develop new improved processes that made our processes more efficient, reduced expenses and improved the documentation process overall for future audits. Secondly, becoming a mentor to others within our organization was also very rewarding to me."

good,Citi was a very good company as far as taking care of employees and benifits was not easy to move to up and company and i did not like that
good,"I was the primary person for watching the monitoring alerts for the servers we supported.  I can tell you that not all the alerts were the same.  Everyday I would run into an alert/issue I had not seen before therefore everyday was a new learning experience.  Some of the alerts generated would be network related, hardware related, software related and OS related.  I was exposed to many things, for example SAN, VM, system crashes that needed to be brought back up ASAP due to it being a production system, system losing connectivity to the  network, network outages and the list goes on and on.

good,A typical day at work for Citi is answering customers calls and meet their needs. Outbound calls were requested as well to remind customers of their balances and collect on them. Work flexibility was a plus.
good,People are very professional and have strong teamwork. Balance between work and life is hard to earn because the work is intense.
good,"As a Teller, you deal with most of the clients. Most of the time it's really easy and there are no issues. The problem arises when people are already mad and frustrated, so they tend to take it out on you. You have to have a lot of patience and heart to work the front lines. But, if you have good people working in the branch with you, it's easy to deal with. It's when you have heartless, unreasonable people within that the job can be tough. "
good,"A typical day at Citifinancial Auto would be to service automobile dealership loan applications and loans as well as personal loans for walk in customers.   My job responsibilities were administrative, loan approval and closing, loan servicing, and back up teller.

good,fast pace enviroment keeps you on your toes co-workers are helpful
good,Project planning and Implementation.
good,"This is a great company to work for especially if you have no experience because the training is awesome. Of course, your true training is actively working hands on, the training to learn is over 4 weeks and you can learn all he aspects of the company. The benefits are wonderful! I had surgery and only had to pay $35 out of pocket total! The managers are understanding, but hard to advance if the company is understaffed. Great contests and rewards and certificates are given. I learned alot here!"
good,to much fear from supvr that are afraid of losing job loses employee trust because of inconsistencies
good,My start of day was looking at all faxes received.
good,My typical day at work is going through transactions like any bank normally would but the difference is the stress level. The micro management as well as high than expected goals gives the employees stress and no life outside of work. The most enjoyable part of my job is my fellow tellers. The tellers are relaxed as possible when we have the chance to.
good,the hardest part is to get new account to the bank. It is a residential area and we see the same group of people everyday.

good,"Dynamic environment that fosters learning, achievment. Great people to work with both from the client side and the Technology side."
good,"Great place to work for the self motivating individual. Enormous bank offers wide variety of opportunities to learn various aspects related to Finance. The hours vary throughout the month. My coworkers are enjoyable to work with from day to day. I learned an exceptional amount of detail pertaining to financial instruments and markets with great exposure to Financial Control, Risk Management, and the Front Office."
good,I write chronologies for Citi Mortgage. It's nothing really hard about the job but it's a lot of changes that take place. I love that the job is very flexible. Working with a great group of people also helps.
good,"Citi Sales and Trading has a diverse array of opportunities. I seem to have stumbled upon the two groups with the worst culture. The culture is abrasive and they seem to interpret mentorship as the role of a sports coach more than a white collar professional. Analysts are expected to work without a single day off the entire year, and taking lunch orders without error is almost given more weight than executing a trade with equal precision."
good,It was a fun place to work all around.
good,"our morning started at 700 am and it was a very hectic time as we took a turnover from the night shift, the work load would stay steady til 9 am and slack til 11 am. after a steady period turnovers requests and jcl fixes were very busy from 3 pm thru 6pm and the last hour was dedicated to closing out problem logs on our shift. we learned to work well under pressure and also when we were"
good,"I work in the customer service - I feel that to a certain extent Citibank does listen to the customer, but rarely listen to staff. I'd have to say the benefits with Citibank exceed any other organization I've worked for - they take a great concern in the employees well-being. The pay is low - great for a first job, or a step toward a career."
good,I worked in Citi for one year and found that there is no recognition for individual contribution.
good,Handled different types of calls on a regular basis
good,Citi is a fast paced company that challenges you for advancement

good,"I worked as a teller, helping client with financial transactions such as deposits, withdrawals, and check cashing. I was also in charge of balancing, foreign exchange and credit card payments. The most important thing at Citi is to sale as many products and services. Every teller has specific daily goals that must be met by the end of each shift. Ours was 2 products (new checking, new savings, new credit card, new loan) per day."

good,"Diversas atividades relacionadas a concessão de crédito tanto da modalidade cartão como na modalidade produtos de crédito, aprendi que sempre temos pontos para serem aprimorados e que todo esforço tem sua recompensa mesmo que não seja naquele momento mais em um futuro próximo. A direção / gerência sempre tive um ótimo relacionamento, meus colegas entendo que foi a melhor acontecimento no período que estive na instituição. A parte mais complicada da nossa atividade eram as cargas de horas extras, chegávamos a trabalhar muitos dias seguidos, a parte que mais me agradava era o relacionamento dos colegas na área o ambiente simplesmente fantástico."
good,Financial business knowledge
good,"Great place to get experience, very difficult to move up, don't expect large (meaning above 2k) bonus's unless you are in senior leadership or management. Very old school style of management."

good,I enjoyed this job...the pay was great...the people were very friendly and professional.
good,"It was a fun place to be with sales games going on throughout my shift! My co-workers were pleasant and we became like family. The downside was the aggressive sales. I was hired as customer service, but once training started, it included sales. I had no idea I was stepping into a 'dog eat dog' atmosphere! The manager had me in tears when every review reflected that I just wasn't good enough as a sales person because I didn't press elderly people into getting a second credit card or a balance transfer. I believe in treating people the way I would want to be treated and I would not want to argue back and forth about why I'm refusing a credit card offer. Especially in dealing with the elderly people, I felt like I was going against my personal morals to persuade them into furthering debt."
good,"I have improved my communication skill very well, especially the coordination between client and the management."
good,"On the day of the whole banking project launch, all the project participants needed to perform production testing according to tight schedule. There were many test cases which couldn't be executed one by one. This made me understand that test planning became the crucial determinator for the meeting the deadline."
good,I had the opportunity to work with nice people but the company underwent difficult times especially through the financial crisis. I would recommend that people have an understanding of the division that they will work in prior to accepting a job with the company.
good,"While the benefits are good, the hours involved are extensive. Management rarely hires enough staff, and the compensation isn't adequate for the type of work that is being done."
good,"The people that work there is awesome, management not so much.."
good,Good Place to work. Compensation is fair. Great facilities.
good,Too many changes to reporting structure

good,Citi has a decent entry level salary but there is no room to grow and be promoted.
good,"Tellering is a nice stepping stone job. Cash handling, sales of products, phones, dealing with clients."
good,"Lot of stress, and learning to work in a clicky environment."
good,it's a bank. Money rules all decisions made there. I made it through 2 mergers there. Decisions are always money decisions never staff decisions.
good,"I enjoyed the people I worked with in the retail branch, and I rooted for the company, and was proud of their long history and international presence. It then all went downhill when Wells Fargo bought Wachovia out from under us, then Citi stock broke under a buck, then the Treasury rescued us, and finally the layoffs came."

good,"I have learned alot from Citi I entered fresh out of high school and has been there for four years within this time i have been at two locations.Typically I get to work around 6;30 do my claims,interims,short sales supplements and follow ups.The hardest part of my job is when other people not in my department slack and we have to figure out what the meant or what they missed to do ,but my team come together and get all the answers management is ok I think that they could be a little more intuned with the team individually and as a whole.They isnt so good for example I have a co-worker with a masters degree and has been there 9 years and they are only making $2.75 more than me and I dont even have an associates another friend of mines applied coming another bank with wonderful experience and Citi offered him $6 less thatn his hourly pay and that was max......Best part of my job is getting my assignments done knowing that I accomplished my goals and made others happy that I meet the companys need."
good,"Citi was a very organized great company that was ahead of a lot of companies. They offered training, benefits the first day and they believed in team morale (retention). I really enjoyed working at Citi. I would have stayed if I could have changed my manager. She was very racist. She used a racist term before out loud in the HR department, would talk down to you and did unethical things behind my back. Luckily she was laid-off a month or so after I left, so if you are thinking about working for them you don't have to worry about her. I left Citi because of my manager, no growth opportunities and because they were laying off people left and right. I have never heard of that many lay offs in an organization. In my small department (of less than 10) about 4 people got laid off. That is not including the other lay offs outside of my department."
good,"This was a great job for someone just starting in the business world. This company was in a Union and they only hired part-time shifts working 36 hours with overtime. I needed a job but after 6 months or so, I recognized that this company was able to get full-time employees without having to provide Union benefits. It was disgraceful in my opinion. I knew a girl that felt she was wrongly terminated but due to the ""part-time"" status, the Union didn't have to represent her. The pay was mediocre and the benefits were average. I enjoyed the people I worked with and I really liked working downtown."
good,Day to Day attend to the tickets in Remedy also help out with the
good,The company is a excellent place for an ambitious individual who is seeking a competitive work environment. There is a lot of opportunity to learn and achieve to the next level. The most challenging aspect of the job is managing many relationships for a diverse portfolio of deals.
good,The company is ok. It can be very challenging listening to people whine all day long when you have your own problems. It can be very draining some days as well. One good thing is its hard to get fired.
good,Crecimiento personal y profesional. Buen ambiente de trabajo. Muchos beneficios extra laborales
good,The most enjoyable part of the job was that the co-workers were kind and friendly.
good,Got an excellent platform where I could understand the practical working of economic research.
good,I was only able to complete training before my husband was relocated however during training the managers made it fun and easy to learn.
good,"Seems to be the same as any other large company: the pay is average at best (unless you're senior management), management doesn't always seem to have the employees' best interests at heart, and meritocracy is at best a goal, definitely not a reality. However, in the right parts of the company, the work is enjoyable and the work-life balance is decent."
good,"Good place to work, capable people but upper management to political."
good,The environment is diverse which is a great thing about the company. They do not micromanage but do have a tough time managing over-all. I believe that at times they have more obligations than they can handle.
good,A lot of team work required. I learned a lot and have made friends for a life time.
good,Opened and colated checks and invoices on a daily basis. Checks would then be sorted and filed.
good,"A typical work day is very long with little down time. ""Citi never sleeps"" is an accurate description of the staff's hours."
good,Not much room for advancement but a decent place to work. Co-works and management are great.
good,"It was a very interesting place to work, we are very hard workers. I love working for them because I am a team player and work well with others. The hardest part of the job is when we do not have any help, we have to figure things out for ourselves. The most enjoyable part of the job is when we get the job done right and on timely manner."
good,• Cross Selling to existing customers and acquisition of new customer.
good,"Great job for someone interested in the banking field. If you are not, I suggest you find a job elsewhere, they expect you to make them the first priority in your life and for a student like me, it just simply isn't. They cared too much about rules and regulations than about values. My manager is super pushy and demanding. They just don't understand you may actually want to do something else with your life than be there all day. Also many of the customers were rude, but that can be just more of my area. I also had problems anytime I was sick, they just expected me to go in rain or shine. I believe most of this was based on my manager for ive heard better stories from other employees. I also had to wait at least a year most likely 18 months to move up to a better position or a pay raise."
good,"The potential for advancement within the company is good which is a plus for someone that has little experience. However work like balance is bad, as you are expected to fit a maybe 50 hour workload in a 40 hour, no overtime eligible workweek. work load is high, benefits are great, but salary is not comparable to the amount of work you need to put in in order to make monthly variable compensation part of your salary. Great for someone with no outside responsibilities."
good,"Responsible for investigating certain legal matters, per attorney's request. Most matters consisted of taking photographs of automobile accident sites and enlarging photos for trial purposes."
good,"The company is a great place to work however, the customer make the job difficult. You have to remember to not take what they say personally."
good,Little opportunity to interact with customer.
good,The company is good but the management sucks. It a popularity contest and advancement is about who you know not what you know.

good,"Hot in summer time, cold in winter, friendly co-workers. Sorted and filed paper work."
good,very long hours of work. a normal day would be 10+ hours and you would feel lost in its huge size.
good,Location by the lake with beautiful trees and cared for landscaping.
good,"My job at Citi required me to be on the phone all day everyday to assist cardmembers with their problems. I learned alot about how credit cards work. The hardest part of my job was being yelled at or disrespected by cardmembers because they forgot to make a payment and received a late fee, or their card was put in default, etc. The most enjoyable part of my job was being able to help people when they needed it say if their card had been stolen."
good,Typical investment banking platform. Cannot disclose much due to NDA.
good,Is a smaller bank than I am used to working for which has pros and cons of course. Company has many great products in comparison to competitors and tries to stay ahead of the times with technology but the systems are a bit archaic.
good,International banking providing services to branches and subsidaries of the Bank internationally
good,"Occasionally fun workplace, colleagues work together to accomplish goals. Compensation is lacking, raises and incentive pay/bonuses are almost non-existent since the financial crises in 2008. Surprise layoffs common, normally on an annual basis and not tied to performance. Healthcare costs becoming increasingly expensive while benefits decline. Silos between different divisions"

good,I truely enjoyed my time at Citi Cards.I always gave my best every day.
good,If you are just starting your career Citi maybe the place for you. I have a total of 18 years with the company. I was grandfather in from another company.
good,The ever-evolving threatscape requires both team and individual ability to be flexible and think out of the box. Information security is challenging at various levels. We worked together as a team. Which made us very successful at protecting Citi assets.
good,"Amerikaanse bedrijfsvoering en cultuur (niet gek aangezien het een Amerikaans bedrijf is 😜). "
good,"I was a challenge and interesting working for EMEA, Asia and Latam at the same time. The challenge is providing quality service to clients with the different time zones."
good,"Very good company where the culture of diversity is a priority. Professional people, good place to grow up professionally. "
good,"You’ll meet good and bad people, have amazing and awful bosses. It’s just difficult to navigate what is or is not going to be outsourced in the next year so be careful which job/promotion you take as the whole department could be gone the next quarter"
good,You can only advance if you have good relationship with several managers and area director. Really hard to get experience if they don’t let you advance.
good,"Benefits and bonuses are not so good. Processes are not nimble since its a bank. If you are ok with that, then it might be a good place for you as development teams are good and the culture is mixed with people of all ages and backgrounds."
good,"great benefits decent pay overall good place to work however they do lay offs alot     you get decent time off and sick time, they do raises every year"
good,"CITI is a good place to work, the benefits and pay are pretty good but not as good as comparative roles on the street.  "
good,"It is not a place where most would want to work and make a career out of. Good place to work, as a first job. But it wears you out quickly. Benefits are good as well as the pay."
good,"Management needs to be stronger, advancement and promotion opportunities needs to be stronger. No real accountability for employees. Culture is disconnected from company missions. Citi is known for underpaying its employees."
good,The work with listed employers was not consistently busy.  I prefer a position with heavy workload and can handle diversity.  Management was not easy to work with.
good,"Productive and detail oriented. "
good,"Depending on department and if you get lucky and get a good manager which overall you won't, always can be laid off!  CITI IS CORRECT THE C STANDS FOR CHANGE!  TOO MUCH CHANGE!!"
good,Management's decision to move many Tri-state area positions to lower cost locations has caused a problem with employee morale for those who are still employed here. There is a constant feeling that the other shoe is about to drop and there is no real sense of job security. It is also difficult to maintain a positive outlook as upward mobility is extremely difficult above the SVP level.
good,"The company is always hiring externally but it is very hard to be promoted once inside of the company . Very diverse and promotes work/ life balance . Very flexible , company morale is great . There is always a site activity to bring family , friends and kids"
good,given lots of responsibility with many deadlines.  excellent professionals.  ability to work remotely.  easy commute to long island city location.  long hours.
good,Very left leaning Urban coastal culture that influences working and hiring decisions. And can creep into business decisions around business relationship choices.
good,"I started with a group of over 30 people in a class ready to move forward with base pay and commission. We didn't even have desks as the site was full."
good,"Great people to work with"
good,"The people make the firm.  Smart, curious and driven and talented.  Good balance of Citi experience and new to "
good,"Not good for vendor companies. They are overburdened with work. Despite putting in efforts, vendors are humiliated. No work life balance. "
good,My review is based on my stay at CITI about 22 years ago. Maybe it is changed now with fewer benefits for people working there. I am informed that 401k and pension are reduced close to zero.
good,"A typical day would be to process any property access request a third party company. Complete utility reports and occasionally cover the ""title"" desk. Good work environment, but the job became tedious at times. Enjoyed working from home."
good,"- Banking culture"
good,A typical day in an operational position is fast paced and results driven.  The culture is collaborative and requires interacting with other teams. Training is on the job and can be challenging when seasoned employees provide little guidance.
good,"It's a bank call center. I was in several departments during my time here. Most of them, you take incoming customer calls. Sometimes the customers are mad, sometimes not. The job was not difficult. I learned a lot about banking and credit. My favorite thing was getting selected by the training department to assist in new hire classes or work on special projects. Pay and benefits were good."
good,Working at Citi is relaxed with many options available to adjust your career potential.  Locations are flexible.  Work/life balance is excellent.  Citi offers many cultural benefits.
good,"i'm a enjoyed the customer service experience the provided understanding of banking that i will prove beneficial in my lifetime. Overall, a stressful and aggressive yet knowledgeable establishment."
good,"The people were great. Management was rough at times. "
good,"Not sure how the benefits would be for a family. Good place to work if you are working toward obtaining a better job, depending on your situation. The monotony can become trying, but if you don't mind doing the same thing over and over again all day long than it won't be that bad."
good,"Opportunity to work with different countries and cultures. Also, you get to travel and work with different teams in different countries."
good,"the culture change serval times of the 27 years I was there,  in the end, I was not impressed with management or the culture.   the firm was too big and had conflicting goals."
good,"Financial Banking"
good,"Job culture at Citibank is great, A typical day at work is very busy more so at month end or quarter end. The most enjoyable part of the job is the people."
good,"A great place to work but you have to be liked by your Supervisor/Manager even if you are doing a great job. If they don't like you for what ever reason you can forget about getting a good rating or given any opportunity to gain new skills."
good,"The department that i was belong was not a great experience for me. very pressurize environment,  finger pointing, negative and harsh word seems to be normal.In a positive approached, With this kind of working place i had learnt and develop my good working attitude habbit."
good,"nice working environment, company is good company but not the "
good,"Citi has great benefits but it depends on management who is willing to support it.  Three years ago, my job was 9 -6 with very flexible work schedule.  After the reorganization, I reported to someone else and the flexibility was diminished and my work load increased with little mentorship or guidance.  The health insurance and 401 K is great.  Flextime depends on the manager and you have to manage your own career or maybe you will have a good manager to mentor you.  There are programs to get mentor outside of the group."
good,"It was a pleasure to work at Citi; however, growth opportunities non existent.  I attempted to move upward, but the opportunities were not given.  That was the main reason I left."
good,"Customer Service By being hired into one of our Customer Service jobs at Citi, you’ll be a key member of the Citi team. Professionals in Customer Service careers come from a variety of backgrounds, bringing an assortment of knowledge and skills to every area of our business."
good,"I had to take care of everything besides wiping the bottoms of 6 Financial Advisors, but only one of them paid me any ""backs"", which is the standard for Sales Assistants elsewhere."
good,"In my role I take escalated calls for those who want to speak to a supervisor and calls for people experiencing financial hardships.  Calls are back to back all day, especially if you work past 5:30 pm EST.  I've learned a lot about finances which has helped in my personal life.  Due to a changing culture within the senior leadership area, the department has changed in a negative manner for this location.  The people you work with in my department are great, however the entry level position employee's act more like a typical ""high schooler"" despite their age.  The hardest part of the job is keeping your cool on calls even when clients are cursing at you and being unprofessional.  The most enjoyable part of my job is ""idle"" time when I am not on a phone call (which does not happen very often) and general maintenance calls that only take about 3-5 minutes."
good,"the only thing i hated about Citi is that unlimited working hours , you start at 8 am and you never know when you are going to finish . usually 14-16 hours later ."
good,Strong performer in some key market areas. Communication and clarity from management was lacking. Advancement through career is possible but guidance of how to do so is sparse and the requirements seem arbitrary.
good,"Overall my experience at Citi was a good one. Despite the fast paced  atmosphere, my colleagues made my experience a good one for me. I was able to learn various job functions at my own pace and was given every possible resource to aid with my development."
good,Very busy and not organized. Great benefits. Hardest part of the job was the work load and lack of help. I opened and closed checking and savings account. I processed over 400 accounts a day.
good,"Good job if you are placed in a well managed branch. Does not seem like Citi cares about the well being of their employees, and expects too much from you without giving you the needs to succeed. Understaffed and stressful."
good,"Great workplace culture, diversity and equal employment. Exposure to diverse clients and challenges. Management making sincere efforts to keep up with the times."
good,"The job itself is redundant, but it is a steady schedule with decent pay. Very predictable, but they do lots of fun activities throughout to make it interesting"
good,"Citi provides some great benefits and some great opportunities such as both maternity and paternity leave. They also do a great job being involved with the community and encouraging volunteer work. For the most part, it is a good place to work with dedicated people. There is a great café on site with multiple lunch options as well as a free clinic with doctors and nurses on staff. Where it is lacking, in some departments, is middle management leadership that finds it hard to maintain a consistent work environment that follows through on it's projections and planning coupled with poor overall communication to its teams."
good,Management is okay. Not enough opportunities for internal. Not a company that promotes people. very bad policymakers. not enough resource to learn and improve.
good,"Most of my days are spent working on various projects at once, with no relation to each other."
good,"my position was stressful due to the legalities but extremely interesting"
good,"Working at Citi Bank was one of my first jobs. "
good,Great environment to work and good people. The trainings offerings are good to take as increases your empowerment and also helps to develop your career.
good,"Working in a bank requires me to be more careful and at the same time, fast. I need to process all the application forms and key it into the system by a certain time of the day in order for checking to be done by other colleagues. I have learned about how difficult it is to work in the back end of a bank. However, the most enjoyable part is having nice colleagues who are willing to help me out despite being busy with their own work."
good,"Overall good place to work, but pay is not on par with other companies. Some managers are great, but many others are horrible with no people skills. Job security is terrible with constant threat of lay-offs."
good,"My daily responsibilities consist of carefully analyzing and judgmentally reviewing customer applications and their credit bureaus while taking inbound calls. I document data on credit exposures, execute proper approval levels per policies and programs, assist to inbound and outbound calls in a professional manner all while maintaining a steady work flow. The most difficult part of this position is ensuring applications and calls are completed within the required time frame as well as ensuring I am up to date on all the most recent changes in procedures to avoid any poor quality reviews on your calls. I enjoy the customer interaction and the work environment,"
good,"Management was easy to get along with as long as you were productive. Had to leave due to conflict with a scheduled surgery."
good,I worked at Citi more that ten years back for a relatively. The division has since shut I had great fun during the time I worked though and made great friends at a personal leveldown I believe. So my review as limited significance.
good,"Quite flexible company to work. The manager gives all flexibility the only thing is work should be timely finished."
good,"I worked as a teller for about 2.5 years, had management harrasment issues my first year so I transferred to another branch. Overall loved the relationships I made at Citi with my coworkers, but the managers were never top-notch or trustworthy. The company is only worried about referrals and making every customer sign up for something they don't really need. You will only advance in position if you can sell their products to any and everyone. I will say, it was easy money and comes with great benefits BUT be willing and ready to be a selling machine."
good,"People are nice, management not always capable of addressing business needs. Leadership is supposed to be clear and structured with metrics but at the end of the day, decisions are made somewhat subjectively."
good,I started out as a contractor and it took Citi 12 months to transitions me to a permanent position. My paper work sat on the approving managers desk for a long period of time. Once I did transition to permanent position I was on a project. The position I was hired never launch in Texas. Citi is definitely abut who you are connected to. Not your skill set.
good,"The more management found out what you were capable of, the more work you were tasked with; unfortunately, compensation didn't follow suit. Corporate mentality with silos that compete against each other even though they work for the same company."
good,"bonne communication"
good,"A day filled with out bound calls and problem solving collection activity, my supervisor was great and it was 10 mins from my home, I wish the office didnt lose"
good,"CITI financial is a well established international brand, great company for anyone who wants to go in the financial sector. Great opportunity to grow."
good,"There wasn't much special with working at Citi. No one gets promoted because they don't want to pay anyone more. I had 5 managers leave the company in 4 years, so that speaks for itself."
good,"Pay is decent, it's just that they pay vs work you're requested to do doesn't match up. Great benefits though. And as far as management, depends on who you get. My initial manager was outstanding while my current manager is the complete opposite. When it comes to advancement, it's unfortunately not always what you know it's who you know."
good,Citi has been providing opportunities for high-potential employees with good educational background. Rotations in different units and exposure to Senior Management Team gave us an edge upon joining.
good,"While at Citi I have greatly improved my technical skills- excel, word.. etc.  On a team of six, we worked to efficiently streamline processed related to trading futures and options currencies.  We also worked to improve relationships with clients by way of salespersons."
good,"The Asset Services department is responsible for managing notifications and transactions across the firm’s positions for relevant events. These events and transactions managed include reconciliation and entitlement postings for Voluntary and Mandatory Corporate Actions, Dividends and Income, Proxy, and Conversion events in the Market."
good,You become a family working at Citi they really get involved with their employees but you never know if they are going to just one day cut your job and decide they don't need you anymore.
good,"I worked in the credit card division. It was purely a sales position. I understood it was sales, but you were written up for not offering. And the next step would be termination. That places unnecessary pressure on an already stressful environment."
good,"I love the branch I work in and I absolutely adore my co-workers as well as all my current and previous managers. The reason I give a 2 or 3 star for most of the categories are that for the amount of work I do for the branch (which is far more than my job title requires) compensation is very low. I'm not only a teller, but a banker and sometimes even end up being management as well because we are always too short staffed."
good,"The health benefits started on your 1st day, "
good,"Nice place to work, professional environment, good benefits, but limited career opportunities for my profession as a Loan Officer, the one think I do not like is to have a draw in my compensation plan."
good,"below average benefit. mediocre and cold heart management. if you want job security, forget about this company. They lie to you till the last minute. They treat you like a robot. They only need a puppet, not a creative thinker."
good,"Management defined very clearly the goals for the position, this was helpful. However, trying to develop and complete projects that involved other areas was very cumbersome and often resulted in bad results."
good,"Fun working place, learning something new in this finance field. Good co-workers. Helping each other."
good,"As a collector, I took inbound and made outbound calls. I encouraged past due clients to bring their accounts current and to set up recurring payments. There is a great deal of pressure from management to not get off the phone without getting a payment from the customer. Many clients are angry and upset and getting yelled at throughout each day is quite routine. As a collector there are many state and federal laws that must be adhered to, as well. Nearly every second of your time at work must be accounted for. Citi expects no more than 1% of work time to be unaccounted for. Citi treats it's employees fairly well. The job can be very stressful for many people, though."
good,"Interesting work"
good,"Same thing everyday. Must be able to put up with angry customers. Nice work environment, great benefits. Monthly insentive bonus if you qualify. Good place to work"
good,Hands on management with the aim to let staff ran their own projects. Aim is to ensure items are delivered on time and within budget to allow for resource management.
good,"Working at Citi Cards was okay, but I got burned and it got infected and I got looked down on.  I must have been truly ill because I immediately got picked up on Social Security Disability.  I was not faking it."
good,"Working in Middle office is a very fast paced, high volume and stressful environment with long working hours. However, I enjoyed my time at Citi as I learnt a lot everyday and although the hours were long, the days were quick as we were always busy. The hardest part of the job was that there is almost no work experience to prepare you for the role. It is 100% learn on the job. For this reason as well as the long hours, there was a high turnover rate with employees. However, the challenge of this made the role exciting. The most enjoyable part of the job were the people.The team I worked in was great and a lot of fun which made coming into the office enjoyable."
good,"When I worked their the people hired were not really professional. It had the classic call center environment. Management is ok. I would work their again, but I didnt like my pay"
good,heavy turn over of senior staff and no proper management to take decisions. Lots of surprises and unknown facts during the project life cycle. Lack of consistency in all policies
good,"A typical day includes, investigating multiple cases, working with 3rd parties to resolve cases. The environment is constantly changing to achieve the most productive workflow. "
good,"It's a call-center, so I wouldn't necessarily compare this job to a job planting trees or saving animals (which I don't think is a secret to anyone). But if comparing to other call-center jobs, it's alright. Honestly I don't intend to leave because it's a bad job, it's just that I personally don't find much passion for finance. Interestingly enough, it's entirely possible my next job will also be in a call. The difference is that I plan on working technical support, which to me would be a totally new ball game. People get pretty upset when they have to call their credit card issuer, but you have to go in with the mentality that you are there to fix the problem someone is having, not necessarily to make them fall in love with your company. As it turns out what makes people like your company is addressing their issues."
good,"The job isnt terrible, its just boring and its the same questions from the customers over and over again. this is truely the only downside............"
good,The job is quite repeative and very competive much like all banks if you dont  keep up with them you lose the long term goals of the company. The pay was acceptable but the work was a drag. Though I enjoy the positive sides of Citibank. The costs have a toll on your body. Though I would reapply if I needed my loss was only temporary and put me off the ladder again. A good company to work with but you need to have a banker-like personality ro stay with them. Unfortunately I was not a banker-type and I loss the benefits I wish I had.
good,Offers some of the best benefits for a company currently out there and offered many different shifts to work.  I had a great manager who really supported me with work and personal goals.  The company did foster in some ways a work family atmosphere.  I cared tremendously for my team.
good,"Great culture diversity and community involvement. lack of developing internal employees. Everyone is very friendly and willing to help, however, the results are not very effective."
good,"easy work, learn to do sales effectively, customer service is important. was not a fan of the fact you were not paid for washroom breaks if you had to go you wernt paid while you were in there"
good,"Citibank for my is been my longest task, i been there for log I menage to increase my skills and CPD, is been a good start for me, is good place to work but not for long"
good,"Calling cardholders to collect on overdue accounts. This job required being on the phone for your entire shift, it became sometimes hard to do that when you have really irate customers."
good,"I work in Sears Collections. The benefits are amazing - paid maternity leave, ~12 paid vacation days, ~5 paid sick days, great insurance available starting day 1, free basic life insurance, Citi matches 401k up to 6%, etc. The main issues I have with the company are upper management and pay. For what we deal with daily, we aren’t paid enough; they make it really hard to get insentive to even make it worthwhile. My UM is great, but management above her is out of touch and seem to not understand how difficult and stressful our job is. If you’re not excelling in one department you aren’t able to move to another one that better suits your strengths, which is extremely frustrating and disheartening. Also, we started with 10 hour shifts which I loved, and they just decided to switch us to 8 hour shifts...they didn’t even get Citi’s permission, they just switched them and made us fight over the more desirable shifts. It was honestly BS. Citi needs to realize that the “lower” positions in this company make it go round, and try to do more to keep people here so they don’t have to have so many training groups a year."
good,"This was a Business account credit call service."
good,Citi is an awesome place to work you must know what you want and why your there; if not you can get caught up with office politics.  Awesome advancement if you are aligned with the right team.
good,Job is stressful with overtimes and night time work. May be it is due to the front office CIB application. Working for the middle office was much easier.
good,The pay was decent but the hours were long. Upper management did not want to give you a chance to breathe in between calls. Kind of makes you feel like less of an individual and more like a number.
good,"Great benefits and time off, but difficult to move up within the company. A lot of favoritism is shown for promotions. Promotions are not based upon performance. Sometimes you can even be too good at your job and your department can even block you from getting a promotion."
good,Citi is a productive place to work. The climate is friendly and there is a high turnover rate. Advancement is challenging in spite of frequent postings.
good,"Its not the best, but better than many others. 1 thing I loved is that, you don't take any work stress home, but that was probably only because I was a teller. May be banker have to deal with more stress."
good,"Spent a few weeks working here."
good,I have been with Citi for 10 years and I have been able to move up within the business quite easily. Fast paced environment means never a dull moment.  C stands for Change.
good,"I receive around 35-40 calls per day and send 15-20 emails"
good,It could have been a really fun place to work as fellow employees were great and the nature of the job was enjoyable. The branch manager however was extremely aggressive and harmed the harmonious balance. It all depends on the branch manager.
good,I enjoyed working at CITI for the past 16 years. The support and the guidance provided to me during my CITI career was excellent. Very diverse environment to work.
good,Opportunity to learn various roles in department. Although company is going through various changes so job stability not there.  Good employee focused events throughout the year.
good,"I was managed by a very demanding boss.  I was fresh off the boat in Asia Pacific projects doing Data Centre maintenance and integration of new services, when I was plunged to the deep end of external client service integration without any knowledge of the present infrastructure.  I had a difficult time to adjust and the learning curve was very steep without any encouragement from my present team.  I was able to survive it through."
good,Client puts too much pressure and work is dynamic. you can not be sure when and what work will be there and what errors will be coming out. so nothing is certain
good,"work hard all day but still not happy"
good,I was going through a lot of personal trials and issues so I think it made it difficult for me to keep up with this position at this juncture in my life. I was overwhelmed in areas where I normally wouldn't be
good,Great company to work for if you just want a pay check. it's a very hard company to move up. agents are very diverse. Training is great. they answer all and any questions.
good,"Overall, Citi was an excellent place to work.  However, they decided to move out of state which placed several employees in an awkward position.  My typical day at work was overwhelming at times.  I learned how to multitask my daily duties. Management was very even with personal needs.  The most enjoyable part of the job was the ability to meet and interact with new professionals."
good,I thought Citibank was some where I could retire from but I quickly learned it was a lot of smoke and mirrors and started to get treated badly so I went to work fast food.
good,"Great atmosphere, great pay, and benefits.  They work with you on your schedule.  Also great incentives.  Unprofessional work place.  This company really does not care about employees.  When the hurricane hit, we still had to work.  Other than that, it's ok"
good,"Citi is such a big company so your experience depends on what department you are in.  My overall experience with positive and would recommend this company to other individuals looking for a job.  "
good,"Processors are responsible for seeing the loan from the time of origination to closing. Many times, we are asked to assist post closing due to our relationship with the borrowers."
good,Can arrange for flexible work hours. Able to work from home. The workplace culture is good where you have many cooperative colleagues. Easy to get things done.
good,"I have been working at Citi for the past 2 years. As far as the work life balance is concerned its great. fun at work is very good. Job culture is also good. But when it comes to Pay and benefits and promotion, the growth is slow. have learned  many things while working at Citi.  We have lots of training to learn  in Excel and other things."
good,"At Citi, i got an opportunity to learn about the multinational banking culture, an exposure to work with various nationalities and received valuable insight from superiors"
good,"I really can't say much. I was there for a year but half of that was as a consultant. They paid me what I asked, and that was more than I thought they'd do. That came with good vacation."
good,Overall it was not a bad experience just a little too much favoritism going on with the managers. Still not a bad place to work apart from that. I would work for there again if allowed.
good,"The management style there was very interesting to me. The workplace culture if you were liked then you were good. They did have a lot of activities to attend, so that was cool."
good,"Worked there as analyst for some time, and my direct supervisor was a blast to work with, but our higher management was often times more worried about their own promotion rather than the success of the team."
good,"Multi culture work environment"
good,"Great work-life balance, especially for those with the ability to work remote.  Upward mobility and advancement is way too rare, and the benefit package, given the company's size and scope, is mediocre."
good,"The internal talent is not prioritized for growth, instead the talent is hired at very high cost from outside. This is more visible in APAC region. The policies and management is very different from North America"
good,"Learned to manage a team across the delivery of the solution. Immediate supervisor has been so open to ideas and suggestion making the path to grow in career."
good,"Citi is a great place to work, however it is important to climb the ladder here."
good,"An overall rating is a good company where you can get a lot of experience. Just get experience and get out of Citi to get the salary desired. "
good,"Way too many projects and not enough people to keep up with the workoad, expected to put in a bunch of time to complete items regardless if you have family plans or not.  Some managers are great, others are not."
good,Basic 9-5 call center work space. Clock in a start to prioritize the workload that is presented by management. Micro managed by management throughout the day to ensure daily task will be completed by the end of the day or in order to meet the deadline. No hard part of the job. The enjoyable part of the job is being apart of all the groups and committees within in Citi.
good,"I worked there 14 years, and enjoyed my work for the most part.  The hours were not that good, I worked evening 12:30 - 9 pm, but had to be at work at 8 am on Sunday.  This was not the best hours for an evening person."
good,Citi is a good place to work if one enjoys the fast paced environment. Hourly wage is more than fair and sales bonuses provide the chance to earn a good living.  Benefits are excellent
good,"There were many pros and cons for working for Citi.  Main pro is most managers were laid back.  great work life balance , major cons are little to no access to senior management.  company does nothing to weed out bad managers."
good,Huge company that has all of the trappings that go with such an organization.  Difficult to manage and little in the way of different groups working together.
good,Citi sold us to Source One Direct and we continued the same work. Nothing really changed except the benefits. Everything was about the same management stayed in place.
good,"The company is great, they management is a different story.  They have some managers that do not know company procedures and the manager makes a mistake they turn it around and the employee gets in trouble.  They refuse to do anything about it. No matter how many staff complain or leaves."
good,"I have never met before so strict rules and supervisors as in this company; on the other hand, it had nothing to offer: old building with damaged air-conditioning, bad view from windows, no money even for stationery"
good,"Poor management skills, very bad communication. The pay was great which is what made it all worth while, there is room for growth, however training lasts a very long time and being full-time there is no room for social life."
good,"Boa empresa para se ter uma experiência profissional."
good,Difficult to advance.  Most important skill is navigating managerial politics.  To be successful most managers manage up - little care for the employees under them.
good,"I though it was Great"
good,"assisted with first and second mortgages, entering data and selling on upsides of 2nd mortgages. I loved the sales aspect and liked to get people approved for a loan and their dream home."
good,"Salary is low for this position."
good,Onsite workout facility and cafeteria. Very diverse work environment. A lot of fun company activities. Decent place to work.
good,work and life balance is not good. Management has no value for the old employees. They are not given what they deserve. Citibank as a whole is good however the management is not good. Long working hours for girls too.
good,"As my job requires me to ""wear many hats"" my days change dramatically from one to the next. I work with excellent people, and enjoy the interaction and energy of many of my coworkers."
good,The environment is very diversified and technologically well versed. Big management depth. Good work life balance. You have to work under strict dead lines to meet ongoing requirement.
good,I gained a vast amount of experience from Citigroup. Areas of expertise were constantly expanded. Always challenged to learn something new.
good,Citibank is a good company with up and downs as any other company. Citi has amazing benefits but is not always there for there employees'
good,This is a very easy job which only requires the employer to monitor and collect market data with reestablished procedure，yet carefulness is an important character.
good,"Citi is a cheap bank, so every vendor and benefit, is the cheapest provider they can find.  The gym, the cafeteria are all sub par.  I am used to working in places, where they furnish their employees with great perks and nice amenities to demonstrate their appreciation.  Citi was not that, even the janitorial staff was lousy and the place was dirty."
good,"best bank for the consumers. work life balance is better than other financial institutions. the vacation days were not great, but other than that there are no real complaints."
good,Very friendly environment. Targets are easily achivable. Great boss to learn from that adds to your experience. Flexible working hours. Salary increment every year.
good,"All of our positions were given to India after we helped train the teams. We were lied too and told not to leave. Management was a joke, only way you could move up is if you were a favorite."
good,"Pros"
good,Citi was a great experience.  I was lucky to meet a lot of great people along the way.  There was a lot of areas for improvement within management and who's running the departments.  Needs a complete overall to get the company to run effectively again. All in all I learned a lot and was able to expand my career while working for citi.
good,"Good company to work for.  Their wages can be a little higher for customer service based careers.  Customer service goals were pretty hard to maintain,"
good,"2 years experience in banking as a junior credit analyst at Credit Initiation Unit, processing all the credit card applications in line with Credit Policies and Procedures."
good,"They pay well and demand as much in return as would any other American organization."
good,"Company is strained by regulatory and street expectations, creating a cost / people cutting culture that is not counteracted with an eagerness to see the company succeed"
good,"Decent pay."
good,"Good benefits."
good,"Being into wealth management / client relationship management need to be in touch regularly with clients. Meet client and provide them update on markets periodically. Review portfolio of clients and advice if any changes / re-alignment need to be done. Service clients requirements if any."
good,take incoming calls from customers and try to determine their needs; take applications to determine who qualifies for citi accounts and who doesnt
good,"Depending on what department you work in you can have a very busy work day. However, after nine years this has taught me how to conduct myself in both high and low volume work environments. You will need to learn to be self-sufficient and manage your time well. The skills you learn can definitely assist you in career mobility."
good,"Very fast paced environment, challenging."
good,"reviewing accounts and calling out to homeowners to see if they needed assistance with there mortgage."
good,Citi is a good place to work because there is a good work-life balance. The team that I've been working with is creative and dynamic.
good,"Citi gave me an opportunity i mean a complete change over from a BPO operations to a banking sector, where i learnt about custodian activities."
good,"managers micro manage a lot"
good,"Always very busy. Multiple projects/duties are always needing attention. Little to no downtime. From the moment you arrive until you leave, there is constant work. Varying deadlines and 'fires' that need attention.  At times you end up doing the work for more than one person or working late due to a last minute project you are handed that has an immediate deadline. Ability to learn new skills. Promotions or changing of positions can be difficult once you are in management. "
good,Good place for personal life and work balance. Flex hours. Work environment and certain policies depend on the department you work for.
good,"This was my second time coming through Citi...the last time was 18 years ago.  A lot has changed, however, I found the training seriously lacking this time around.  The trainer was obviously knowledgeable, however, her teaching method was not good.  I had discovered I had a serious hearing deficiency and was not accommodated very well.  Had indicated I have difficulty navigating the many different web site areas in order to do my work, but was not given proper training and leadership along the way.  I was holding up the class.  I resigned out of embarrassment."
good,All aspects of a HR generalist's duties.  Management was not in touch with employees.  Co-workers were great and hard-working.  Difficult to be so large and spread across the country so communication was a shortfall.  Working with all the people and helping them out was gratifying.
good,I gained vital experience in how to stay productive in a fast paced environment and utilize my resources and time to benefit the company goal.
good,"I worked for Citi-Onemain Financial for 9 months.  The training that I received was very poor. The work load for the office was so overwhelming that the managers did not have time to train, so the training was trial and error without very much help.  Manager and  District Manager seemed to think that belittling their employees was the way to manage.  I'm not sure why it was this way, but such behavior is not one that is going to keep good employees that are truly looking to climb the corporate ladder.  I believe this could be a great company to work for, if there was a cultural revolution in the work place.  Much training on how to encourage, assist and be a team is needed in order for the culture to thrive and for employees to feel as if they are a vital part of the company."
good,I spent the last 18 years of my career at one branch where I was dedicated to the role of business banker. I had nearly 500  small business customers that I had provided the best service to. I enjoyed building and retaining these relationships. The bank decided to go into a different direction which I was not in favor of. I left on good terms and was provided compensation.
good,Good temp agency to work for if you want to be a temp.  Taken care of and provided with benefits. Would continue to work here just would like something more perm.
good,"It is a typical call center job, the people you work with are great the people whom call you on the phones are terrible.Too bad they let people talk to you so terrible."
good,Citi believes in diversity and is very dynamic in this field. Management needs to be more proactive in resolving the problems before they happen
good,"Great place to work I enjoyed the co workers that I worked with."
good,Very flexible work schedules. Lots of politics and red tape. Great benefits. A non-friendly environment. Not much room for advancements.
good,Okay company it just depends which area you work in. Not all affiliates are the same so you need to chose your area wisely. Citi family is pretty big
good,Benefits start on the day you start. Management willing to work with you and your life situations. Relaxed dress code. Friendly co workers. Computer generated training as well as classroom training available.
good,The Management Training Program for the Lower Manhattan Region was a good introduction to professional life.  I learned to apply my training and to justify business innovations by thinking outside the box.
good,"Citi Private Bank is a great stand alone business and has been performing very well. Unfortunately there is the rest of Citi which has had its share of problems which affects pay and comp year over year. Citi is just too big and the strategy doesn't seem to be working. The firm is global but unfortunately its impossible to get the simplest of things accomplished globally. Every business has their target markets so its still very bureaucratic. It seems like businesses outside of CPB spin their wheels changing strategy and focus every few years. Corbat is rarely heard from - a CEO should be having firm wide calls, sending announcements and visible - driving home the strategy, re-assuring employees etc. "
good,"I have worked with excellent people, one director who was a mentor and other managers who were very encouraging in my career path. "
good,Working at the Citibank World Headquarters became a summer position as I was unable to continue as a part-time employee due to a rigorous academic schedule.
good,"8:30; I arrive to the office, read FT for 20 minutes"

good,I learned a lot about credit card accounts did provide excellent customer service.I did have good schedule management was great to me.

good,"the location if very far, there is barely any parking, their food is amazing and their gym is convenient along with the day care"
good,"Manage risk and compliance at all levels. Learned how to implement operational, technology and governance risk programs. Great work/life balance programs."
good,In my time with Citi I've seen numerous lay-off's its scary. The C in Citi is known for Change. It does have it's ups and downs. In today's economy one is just lucky to have a job.
good,"On a typical day I would work to handle upwards of 80 loans in my pipeline at any given time.  Co-workers made the day go by easier, but job stability is always in question.  The opportunity for advancement was promised but not followed through with."
good,"My work day starts anytime from 8 to 5pm with my team on site and offshore in India. We have meetings all day and have some administrative work throughout the day. The most productive day for me is the mornings after I get the day started with my coffee.  Management is in a different state and we communicate via Phone, Email or IM."
good,Job is overwhelming for the amount of money you make. Job opportunity is there but it may seem hard to reach. You can make a living there are a lot of rules and regulations. Management is good to okay but they are their just to collect a pay check and go home.
good,I have enjoyed my time at Citi.  I have been extremely challenged over the last 13 years which I believe has set me up to exceed at my next position.
good,"Nice place to work, with interesting people. "
good,"I experienced exceptional leadership, however, since it is such a large corporation, jobs tend to be repetitive without much variety. You are one of many doing the same thing."
good,It was great place to work  and manager was very supportive.  I really learned alot about the credit card industry. i was a novice.
good,"Large American bank with very international, diversified workforce."
good,I was able to work locally utilizing my skills and experience.
good,CitiFinancial is a fantastic place to work but the pay is very low.  The training was incrediable and a very fun work environment.  I am a single mom and I could not afford to stay working for CitiFinancial which makes me disappointed because the staff and training was amazing.
good,"Presented high level customer service over the phone (inbound)."
good,"Co-workers are easy to get along with."
good,"Good people, lousy compensation. I have had different jobs discontinued. Benefits are good and the advancement oppurtunities are there for those who put in effort."
good,"Reviewed and analyzed overall credit profile to established a sound decision. Income, appraisal, assets and credit scores."
good,"Company does not compensate you for your time and efforts at all. A billion dollar company that is stingy to the last penny, rewards you with pizza and ice cream parties as if you were a child. If you're a teller they force you to become head teller and increase your workload without a pay raise."
good,"Organization offers a great compensation and benefits package that exceeds most organizations in the demographics.  Organization is corporate and offers employees a method of reporting grievances and general concerns, which is important in a right to work state.  There are multiple facets for advancement.  The organization, however, does not have a healthy balance in comparison to most when considering home/family life.  The corporate machine places a high demand on employees, who often have to forfeit family time to meet these demands."
good,"For the first 2 1/2 years this wasn't a bad company, then they got a new CEO who obviously started cutting costs (employees bonuses and other benefits) Ex: Having to transfer a sale you just completed to India so they can lose it for you because they can't properly read a script :(  Became a pretty bad place to work. I know a large number of other employees that also left the company after getting tired of being treated unfairly. Plus they have a nifty satellite that can intentionally send you nothing but bottom of the barrel sales calls to drastically decrease your bonus when you are on schedule to do well. Thanks Citibank!"
good,every step is routine. you may feel boring after one year. but you will find the balance of life in this type of company
good,"Good company; secure, good about employees leaving and returning"

Assisted customer with applying for deferments, forbearances, modifications, short sale, deed in lieu, and settlements and using critical thinking to come up with the best possible solution or program."
good,"I loved all of my clients. I built relationships with them as to make their visit to the bank more enjoyble. With good clients it is easy to keep high energy. I had good co-workers with whom I got along very well with, but I was not a fit for the team according to my branch manager which why I am no longer with the company."
good,I love the flexibility that is offered to me in managing my professional career and my family.
good,"Handling various cash related process as a part of BAU like DDS,ICCS,draft issuance /cancellation,Processing of FCY cheques,Outgoing and incoming collections."

good,Big company with a lot of neccessary restructuring that does not seem to be happening.
good,Great collaborative environment with focus on meeting clients needs.
good,"A typical day at Citibank Card Member Services involved logging in at the designated start of shift and taking customer service related calls on a variety of credit card products. Production management and middle management were great. Every manager I got to know was professional, hard-working, and cared about employees. I learned a great deal about customer service and staying calm while being berated and threatened over the phone by strangers."
good,"Typical day at work was answering or placing calls to customers to verify transactions on accounts and assist with processing of new applicants for lines of credit. Also assisting with fraud prevention strategies if fraud was detected on customers accounts. I learned how to process applications and how to work in a call center environment. Also how fraud can take place and how to prevent from becoming a victim. Management was decent. Sometimes they were available, sometimes nowhere to be found. Co-workers were good. The hardest part of the job would be dealing with disrespect or rough tone of voice from upset customers behind their accounts. The most enjoyable part of the job was when customers understood what was happening or in between calls a chance to catch your breath a bit."
good,"compared to other banks this one is not bad. not the highest paid. inexperienced management, rude unsympathizing risk staff who should be taught a lesson on empathy and how to train other than that decent pay for decent work"
good,"-Competent and Accomplished peers"
good,At Home Depot credit services you provide excellent customer service while explaining bill details. The average handle time per call was the hardest part for me. I like the way their attendance policy is structured and they offer a full day off paid to volunteer for community service
good,A full service operations center in the Western New York area.  Great exposure to many different professional and financial fields.
good,"very demanding"
good,"Typically take scheduled daily and weekly conference calls followed by ad hoc requests received via email and telephone."
good,excellent work life balance with work from home privilege.
good,"This was a smaller, call center-type location that had decent pay and benefits. The managers were great to work with and had great personalities. They were very understanding of your personal life and always were flexible with work hours if you had other things going on in your life such school, kids, etc."
good,It's all about the numbers! I never realized how sales oriented a teller position was until now. One of the good things about this company though is that customer satisfaction is a very big deal. I love that about them.
good,A typical day at work can be very hectic supporting the EMEA & CEEMA regions. Fortunately there is a lot of support from co workers in the team who are able to assist you. The hardest part of my role is dealing with the huge volumes of work within the team but it is also enjoyable as the work does make the day go very quickly and ultimately the reward for doing a good job for the client makes it worth while at the end of the day.
good,Lots of coordination as organizations lacks overall processes. Good salary and talented people to work with.
good,Marketing at Citi used to be very focused on strategy and account growth.  In recent years the focused has shifted to process and execution.
good,Hardest part of the job is meeting your numbers. Most enjoyable part of the job is helping customers with issues and/or providing the products that best serves their needs

good,Have really enjoyed being able to work remotely when needed and my managers are great people to work for!!!
good,"I had excellent managers, I couldn't ask for better. However, I wouldn't count heavily on CITI for job security right now."
good,"I really enjoyed assisting customers with their credit cards. The most difficult part of the job was dealing with irate customers, however I did overcome the difficulties of dealing with the irate customers."
good,A difficult place to work. You were not supported by any management.
good,"Establishing methods, rules and been able to re-engineer weak processes in a discipline I have learned in a short time, gives me a lot of pleasure and pride."
good,"I worked at Citi, in a different market, many years ago.  At that time I had a great manager who identified my talents quickly.  I was promoted almost instantly.  Compensation was a bit lower than I would have thought it to be.  But the atmosphere in the branches was good.  Not sure how things are ""today"".  But my experience was a good one many years ago."
good,Hires only friends and not interested in retaining talent. Brought in to move all functions out of NY
good,"- Good incentive paying company"

good,"steady workflow"
good,"typical day is coming in reviewing emails, from title company, daily pipeline organizing upcoming closing, review and gather all information from processor and underwriting, Learned more about corporate relo loans, understanding new program benefits, management was easy going but mainly focused on growth of employees. Loved my co- workers if someone was out they will be there to help out with your pipeline. Hardest part end of the month and rushes."
good,Site closure forced me to end my career at Citi. Was offered other positions within the company out of the state of Maryland & coud not move.
good,I enjoyed my contract with Citi and would definitely return for the right role.
good,"The hardest part of the job is asking people for money to pay on delinquent card account and having them tell you they don't have any extra money to pay on the account -- they're just trying to keep the electric bill currrent and keep food in the fridge."
good,"A typical day starts early because we a had 9:30 a.m. deadline on some functions, other functions could be worked at your own pace but we all have and end of month deadline that had to be done by a certain amount of days that was the most hectic time. Management was good he was someone you could come to with any qestion or problem and it was handled graciously. The hardest part of the job was the balancing of accounts that were out of balance and trying to adhere to the deadlines. The most enjoyable part was the staff we had, whoever needed help or had a problem we all pulled together to get the job done.   "
good,"Though I doubt it is the same way in other departments, I currently work in the GNCC and cannot say that it is the best work environment."
good,"Çok yoğun ve çalıştığınızın hakkını alamıyorsunuz. Fakat çalışma ortamı rahat, çok güzel bir arkadaşlık ortamı var. yöneticinizden düzenli geri bildirim alabilirsiniz."
good,The main drawback of working here is the lack of dynamicity. There isn't a culture of promoting from within so at one point is necessary to leave the bank in order to take on new professional challenges.
good,"very busy, continually learning, does a lot for the world community"
good,"Management was very unorganized, fast paced environment, learned how to give excellent customer service, goals were impossible, co workers were great to be around.  The best part was helping out the clients."
good,Hardest part of the job is the type of calls that are taken but I was provided the necessary training to handle the calls. I have built a family bound with my co-workers. 
good,"The people there are great, I just didn't care for the hours required to do this job."
good,"Work day is typically 9-10 hours at minimum, quite busy, but not too brutal."
good,Location was a bit of a drive. Management was pretty good until you had any issues on the job. Pay was ok for a call center.
good,"The benefits are great and the work schedule is not bad. The company offers a monthly bonus each month but makes it almost impossible to achieve! Lots of hard work goes unnoticed. You have to be able to adapt to change very quickly with this company, they are always making changes! Company needs to do better as far as the monthly incentive that is offered every month."
good,Un día Típico:
good,Work in the Financial Accounting and Reporting part of the business. Small niche business for the big Citi giant. Good staff and management handcuffed by corporate directives.
good,"Citibank was a great place to work. However, management lacked the skills to see good workers. Otherwise, a good place to work and great benefits as well."
good,Typical day at work involves Daily Functions. Report generations. etc.
good,"Citi provided a great place to learn about financial services and gain recognition for hard work. At times it can be bureaucratic and disjointed, but overall it is a place filled with very bright people who are capable of achieving their shared goals."
good,1)Every day is a working day
good,"As one would expect from a large bank, the culture is fairly formal, however it certainly varies across units."
good,It was a pleasure working for this company from the start but doing the recession things got crazy. Pay is not great compared to other companies but the managers are great. This company works in a team environment so co-workers are always a joy to work with. The thing I'm miss the most about the company is the co-workers and ex managers. During my five years of being employed with this company I met so many great people. I miss my old co-workers the most.
good,Employees help each other to succeed but competition is at the heart of this company.
good,typical call center. Still using out dated computers and programs to assist clients. Management is good. co-workers are diverse.
good,"Project manager working with marketing team on several projects. Laid back, casual work environment."
good,Good exposure to daily operations of large financial institution.
good,"Good work life balance, progressive environment given that it's a large company."
good,Company was bought out by another.
good,Very friendly workplace environment. Management treats you with respect. Unfortunately the pay rates seem to be on the low side and advancement opportunities seem scarce.
good,The work is pretty straight forward. System driven work with much emphasis on data presentation rather than data analysis.
good,"Good company. If you like sales, then this is the perfect company to develop sales strategies."
good,Working in a stressful enironment to meet deadlines. Learned how to reslove issues when they arise. Performing management tasks when a manager isn't present. Working with co-workers as a team. The hardest part of the job was meeting deadlines when a problem existed. The most enjoyable part was satisfiying the needs of the users and company.
good,"Approving, Funding, Collecting auto loans is a detail oriented business. It requires constant vigilance of a number of factors and a high level of customer service skills - both on the phone and face-to-face. I enjoyed working in our branch setting with a tight knit group of co-workers. The fast paced environment provided something new each day."
good,The company is great but when ina commission environment its not always good to have your bonus structure changed every 45days....
good,"At Citi Private Bank, a typical day in the Client Reporting group entails working with technology to track and resolve multiple data issues. Responding to numerous inquiries from clients and several business lines is the norm."
good,"Gained a great exposure to the financial world of business.Managed, coordinated, and executed different aspects of income generation and development, where I carried out consultations to customers and potential clients in matters of regulations, lines of credit and insurance, and loans certifications; this included supervising and observing monetary and legal aspects of clients’ dealings"
good,"* at least 10 hours a day, very typical for investment banks"
good,A Good Company to work for with great compensation. One of the most rewarding companies I have worked with.
good,do not do sales it will ruin your life it is the most stressful and so not worth it in compensation
good,Citi Financial is a great company with a comfortable and friendly working environment. Working for Citi Financial gave me the opportunity to enhance my multitasking abilities and prepared me for future working opportunities. My fellow staff members at that time where nothing but spectacular and where always there to help with any issues I had. Some even took it a step further by sacrificing their breaks to make sure that my work was always done to the best of my abilities.
good,I worked at Citi felt like family. There was room to grow with upper management assisting and approval. The ability to wok from home as an option. Diversity is promoted.
good,This job  is good for entry level customers service.  You get full benefits.  Citi worked with my school schedule do I could finish my bachelor's.  Thet offer tuition reimbursement as well.
good,"The Company is a large global enterprise so it can provide individual opportunities across the full range of finance and accounting processes.  However, the size of the Company can result in jobs that are very specialized limiting the employees development.  Further, the Company is in a full court press to off-shore jobs creating job insecurity."
good,A great International & Reputable Company to be working with. One has to always be prepared to face challenges + new SOP's introduced by the Management.
good,"*typical day at work - tend to complete the most priorities set work first for the day,  Go through my checklist reading noting down the various activities that have to be done during the day."
good,"Citi has great benefits, especially for parents with the on-site daycare. You don't take your work home with you. The call center is about what you would expect from a call center. Great people working there, and there is some room for advancement."
good,Pay and benefits great but job is very stressful.   Incentives are getting harder to obtain.   Not many opportunities for advancement. Insurance is very affordable
good,"A typical day at work for me, is assisting the tellers, bankers and the management team with any tasks or assignments that need to be done and reviewed. Making sure all documents are double checked and the staff are ready for the auditor. Finally, the most important thing is making sure all clients are happy with their banking relationship with Citibank,and that their financial goals and needs are in the right path."
good,Increased knowledge based on opportunities to participate in new opportunities.  Found messages to be inconsistent depending on management in certain group.  Colleagues were bright and helpful.
good,Citibank is a great place to work management. A lot of meetings to work with your team.  Citibank believes in training and diversity.  Great peers to work with.
good,As a whole Citi is not an awe full company to work for depending on your department. I found myself to be constantly doing OT just to keep up with my work. I tried to inform my superiors that I was overwhelmed and needed help but it was given a blind eye and came back to hurt me in the end. The pay was great on top of the 6+ hours of OT I had each week minimum. The culture was not the greatest and training was terrible.
good,"Busy place to work, so time can go by quickly. The day starts with a group meeting, and you discuss the goals for the day. You bring out and set your cash drawer accordingly, and get ready to meet sales goals."
good,Don’t feel that I was treated fairly when I was there towards the end after I got hurt I was walking on egg shells. They treated me as though I did something wrong when I got hurt.
good,It is a ponderously large corporation.  Getting things done can take a long time until you know who the real movers are.  Promotions are often not forthcoming without a god-parent.
good,"It is a a good company to work, but work and life balance is a no go... they are not willing to work with you on your schedule if you are a single parent, working 10 hrs a day puts you in a situation, but I keep hearing Citi is about the employees but that’s not true."
good,"Project Overload, great people, not great training, too busy to undertake any certification courses, pay is pretty descent, too much expected in a day"
good,Great place to work with its own restrictions on management culture. Job location is based out if New York City. Definitely the person in any role will learn a lot but there is a learning curve.
good,"Citibank takes good care of their employees. That is why I have stayed with them so long. Recently though, the focus has changed from servicing our clients to selling to them."
good,"Pros:"
good,Favoritism and sucking up goes a long way here! It became more micromanaged and people have quit/quitting because of this. Citi is expecting you to be “perfect” for some what of decent pay. Definitely more of a call center environment now. The only good thing Citi offers.. is their benefits! Alot of employees stay there because of that!!
good,The job is ok. Management could be better. They don’t really give you much work life balance and their system is outdated. If the system were newer things would be easier
good,"Productive environment, however too many changes in leadership results  in challenges to morale and motivation.  "
good,"Loved working here, the branch I worked at and the people I worked with made my time there the best. You learn so much and if you have a good support system at your branch, then advancement can definitely happen."
good,good work environment.  lots of volunteer opportunities.  flexible work hours.  on site gym and cafeteria.  no micromanaging.  open door policy. employee  recognition program
good,"As a senior staff it appeared that my value as a staff was limited. Even though my job was pertinent, there appeared to be a lack of respect for the position."
good,"• Selected by the Healthcare Team"
good,Very good working experience guideliness and their steps of monitoring client account and transactions. They  have a very good system which help us to access more to make the conclusions. I enjoyed being a part of CITI and has coach around 10 staff on a small project.
good,"If you leave it up to me, I would still be employed with citi. They were over crowded I had to get payed off I wish I can have / get that job backed I really felt the love there"
good,Empresa dinâmica e agradável de trabalhar com boa localização.
good,Citi has been a great place to work even with the heavier workload and no overtime due to being salary.  The benefits are really great and the flexible work arrangements go along way towards making up for the negatives.
good,"You are on a dialer, so your log in times matter to how many accounts you work per your work time. Goals are aggressive. Collections is not for everyone, so if you are more customer service comfortable, this may be too stressful for you. Collections takes a sales personality type to get through the calls and get the payments."
good,"Participei do projeto para implantação de novas agências de varejo no Brasil. Projeto audacioso, mas não deu certo, pois a média salarial para abertura de conta era muito acima da média dos brasileiros, além do Citi ser visto pelos prospects como banco investidor."
good,"Citibanks AML/KYC department procedures change weekly making it difficult to maintain high quality scores which negatively impacts your scorecard. Recently upper management made the decision to switch analysts to inbound/outbound calling essentially turning the site into a call center while also completing BAU production work under strict timelines. It seems that upper management has no concern for ""the little guy"" as they make decisions that impact the work/family life. These changes also do not take into consideration the strengths/weaknesses of the employees and have caused good talent to leave for other companies which causes overall morale to remain low. I would avoid the AML/KYC area if you are not comfortable with client contact/phone calls and constantly changing procedures."
good,The work is faced paced and detail oriented but was fairly relaxed in the environment.  There is a gym and food court available.  Breaks are short but you are required to take them.  Good place to work.
good,the system was confusing 
good,"I haven't left the company yet because of the team I work with. Citi puts a lot of work load on someone's shoulders, even as a teller. We are one of the hardest workers within the branch and get paid the least! The pay is better than most financial institutions but that's because we do way more than most tellers. If you don't do well under pressure and stress, I do not recommend Citi. If you are a person who can push through the pressure, by any means, go for it. Citi pays well and it is very easy to move up. I've been here for 2 years and have received offers for higher positions a handful of times."
good,"Worked in office. Learned about Sears products. Talked on phone for the day. Enjoyed being able to assist customers, the bonuses, rewards for activities"
good,"Citi is a large global organization.  If you work to make positive relationships, demonstrate ambition and competence, and remain focused on your goals, you will be able to leverage the Citi network and have access to a variety of roles.  "
good,Empresa muito boa para se trabalhar com benefícios diferenciados como Auxílio Combustível em cartão para eventuais visitas.
good,"Learning environment"
good,They have outstanding benefits. I didn't have as many problems with the clients as I did management. I was on two separate teams. One manager was better then the other. I realized why the one team was always number one on the floor and the other was always last on the floor. Managers and the ability to manage makes a difference in being number 1 sales team. I didn't like the sales compensation strategy either. I get dinged for adding or subtracting a word which lowered my compensation check but you didn't remove the product from the client based on the addition or subtraction of a word. Sales benefit the company not the employee.
good,the management of the company is good. Typically the reason to leave this job is that I am looking for job oppurtinities related to my field as a CA. long working hours
good,Citi has been a wonderful company to work for and I appreciate the opportunities given to me throughout the years. I have experienced so many changes and growth throughout the 32 years I have worked at Citi.
good,"Typically, I would have plenty of work to do daily. I would sit at my desk/cubicle and produce or verify audit trails for different company credit cards who have sold to Citi. The management is not as great.  I have not had an issue with any certain manager but in the past month, I have been through 4 managers. The hardest part of the job is when we run out of work.  This week, we have had voluntary time off all week because there has been no work.  The most enjoyable part of my day is working with great people."
good,"Enjoyed working and growing with Citi, fast pace atmosphere.  Citi is great about training and work life balance.  "
good,"I only worked there for short period of time, supporting the HR team on performance management projects and daily HR operation. The culture in investment banking industry is different from a professional company, and I left because I was poached by my ex-boss and joined UL international."
good,"Citi preach about ""do what's best for the client"", however is more like ""what is convenient for citi""."
good,Citi is a great place to work although the fairness of the compensation can be questionable. They do provide the tools to work well and are flexible with work/life balance.
good,"People are really nice. Lots of promotion opportunity."
good,Stressful IT environment in support of 24 x 7 x 365 requirements.  Always on cutting edge of technology upgrades / enhancements in   support of business goals.  Technical management team was outstanding.
good,"Citi is a good company with extremely challenging expectations.  There are excellent benefits which include, medical, dental, vision, tuition reimbursement; discounts"
good,Great company with great vision.. Plenty of opportunities around all sectors and global functions.. Some region/country and state has more job openings than others
good,Training was the biggest part of citi because the company believed the world is ever changing. with every new law or altered legislation we were trained. I would go through six to seven training a month.
good,Was  never going to be a profession for me. I did not enjoy the working environment. You are treated like just another number on a payroll. Tried to enjoy our time as much as we could
good,"Very diverse atmosphere, global company.  The workplace culture is very fast paced and you are expected to work a lot of hours when needed to complete deadlines."
good,Citibank had a much more positive perspective to their employees and I appreciate it employees all the time for job all done and also appreciating their employees and works in one together and I like that terminology that use we all are on this together that's what I liked about Citibank
good,"Foi um importante passo na minha carreira, uma empresa com processos definidos, claros... A atividade que desempenhei não estava totalmente aderente ao meu perfil, foi uma oportunidade dada por mim e pela empresa, tentativas são importantes e aprendizados valiosos foram extraídos."
good,"Good work life balance, as alternative workspace strategy or remote working was a way of working in my department. Management did not work well with me during a time of family strife."
good,"Clock in, start taking calls.  Offer different services to card members.  I would go to lunch and come back and take more calls.  I would have 2 15 minute breaks."
good,"Great group of people to work with and abundant opportunities outside of NYC.  However, management changes occur every other year and the direction of where you fit in those changes is not always communicated well."
good,I was on my final year in college and it was a part time job.  I gained valuable experience in sales that polished my communication skill significantly.  It helps in getting me real job after I graduated.
good,"I learned a lot things in terms on banking system, loan process."
good,Good work culture with good learning and self development opportunities in organization are more than any other organization.
good,In customer service you learn something new each day as you deal with different people from all walks of life. It made me fill satisfied each time I was able to solve any problem for the customer.
good,"Depending on the department you can either have a great manager or the worst. They aren't flexible when it comes to schedules, but the people there are nice, has great benefits, and pays fairly well."
good,"The good things"
good,"Manager was great at teaching, very clear on expectations and deliverables, however, not flexible on working hours or location (frowned on anyone but himself working from home)"
good,Call center positions can often be challenging due to the stress of dealing with clients who want what they want when they want and how they want no matter what the policy is or what level of involvement they had in the situation
good,Working at Citibank is very fast paced and you have to keep up or you will be left behind.  At times its hard to have time to sit down with your manager due to their demanding schedule. You will be rewarded for your hard work and it does promote a team atmosphere.
good,"It all depends on management. Ineffective managers can spoil the culture of the company. Citi offers a wide range of benefits/work life balance opportunities. Individuals not equipped to be effective managers will create dysfunction resulting in employees leaving a work group or the company on a whole,"
good,citi was an ok place to work although over the last year things had really gone downhill from a retail domestic service and banking side of the business. In particular the sales department splintered and was a bad department to work in and i felt under appreciated for all the hard work i did.
good,"The last job I had at Citi was working as a Customer Service Rep and I would go to work, sign in and start taking calls in reference to clients calling in regards to their credit cards with Citi.  I would answer and take care of the as accurately and in a timely manner.  The hardest part of that job was when someone would call in and start yelling and cursing at you for no reason about their credit card.  The most enjoyable thing about the job was able to help the clients out."
good,"I had mixed experiences with manager's I worked with, but none were significantly adverse.  The pay is alright, and the opportunity to advance is very present and based directly on how well you perform and what you bring to Citi. I feel Citi speaks a lot to fairness, but the lower level's execution of overall policy could improve.  Additionally, I feel that employee growth is limited due to a lackluster system that fails to provide accurate and consistent feedback."
good,"Citibank hires and keeps good employees, but is also constantly in the process of changing and moving the workforce as the demand of customer service changes because of technological advances"
good,Citi group was not a bad place to work if you know what your signing up for. I was in late stage collections which is very difficult. Whatever the reason why the didn't pay the bill. People felt harassed by the constant calls. Which made collecting pretty difficult.
good,Call centre adjudication for a private label credit card.  A mix of calls and activities related to reviewing personal credit and commercial credit to approve credit limits for cards and credit line increases.
good,Company is a strong supporter of diversity.  Communications within the organization could be better from mid level management and up.   Teams worked together to become successful.
good,"My tenure at Citibank lasted over 10+ plus years. The salary scale required review, job work & life balance were encouraged at my location. I am not versed enough to speak of other locations."
good,Great benefits at low cost to the employee. Pay is on the lower end of the scale across all levels. Good work environment and life/work balance is valued for the most part.
good,"A typical day at work is auditing, and going over excel spreadsheets. I learned a lot; my excel spreadsheet skills improved, time management skills improved and started training new employees and fellow coworkers. The management at Citi is very respectful and treats every one fairly. Workplace culture is busy and you have to be accurate with your numbers. The hardest part of the job is it gets redundant. The most enjoyable part of the job is the compensation that includes bonus and benefits."
good,a typical day at work is answering phone calls. i learned that anyone can do whatever they need and want to if they just put their best efforts into it. citi has great leaders to help and guide you in the direction that you need to go.
good,Competitive and Cut throat work environment. Call Center not really customer friendly.  Pretty good bonus structure.  Management need more training lack qualities.
good,"worked in new accounts, customer service and fraud.  Loved fraud.  Probably would still be working there if a new boss hadnt came in and made us start working nights.  Wasnt going to work nights again after I had worked my way up to working days. hardest part of job, was they would ""cross train"" except they would hardly train you at all once you were on the floor, then they would stick you answering phone calls that you had no idea what you were doing."
good,"Citi is a comfortable place to work. However, there is no room for growth unless if you move to other positions within the company. It is a 9:00 to 5:00 job and it is a very open atmosphere."
good,"After 14 years with a company that I truly enjoyed working for, I have noticed a consistent decrease in employee moral. Corporate Culture is on a decline. I've experienced it a couple of times here before, but now it is getting harder to ""wait-it-out"". The company is starting to pay better here in San Antonio, just not sure if that is enough to compensate for the declining moral anymore. I sincerely hope, for the sake of others, that this takes a turn for the better soon."
good,It's nice to work in citi bank. Work life balance is great.I have learn a lot about network and security bank standards in this company.Need work on weekends some times.
good,Company provides good benifits. Flexible in terms of working hours. Have internal portal to go through new training. Come to know overall project dependencies.
good,Management was great and supportive.  End of month was some what stressful.  I lost my job due to job relocation.  I worked in the Servicing Division for most of my time there.  I liked the work and people I worked with at the time.
good,CitiGroup is a multi-national company with a multi-national work force. The diversity creates a very unique environment in which it derives strength from its diverse culture. The halls are filled with dedicated and intelligent staff focused on their jobs during the work day but the lunch room takes on a life of itself due to the diversity of its staff and provides a nice place for a break. The work is fast-paced and fairly stressful requiring focus and energy to complete tasks and resolve problems.
good,O Citi é uma empresa muito boa - com ótima remuneração. Por estar sob grande reestruturação - dada a venda do Varejo para o Itaú - tende a demandar mais dedicação dos seus funcionários.
good,"Known for employee turnaround, layoff is very high. 3 time was enough for me. The pay or yearly raise wasn't good. To many so called managers and continues change."
good,"Customer Service Fun environment, I love to motivate and mentor my employees to move up within the organization.  I have certification in behavioral interviewing with recognition in high percentage numbers with retention for JP Morgan Chase."
good,"The most enjoyable part of the job was that you get to travel and meet and work with different people from different cultures, and in the process, form lasting relationships."
good,"Πολλή πίεση, αρκετές φορές χωρίς παροχή βοήθειας από το μανατζμεντ. Συνεχής εκπαίδευση, καλές παροχές."
good,"I've been with Citi for several years.  It has good benefits and work life balance.  In general, its a good place to work, however don't expect to change anything as the environment is very traditional, bureaucratic, and management heavy."
good,Nice place to work.  Good to work with lots of people from different locations and background.  The people are respecting each other and try the best to achieve the goals.
good,"Entry level pay is okay, however not very good when getting promoted from within. Management is hard headed, and promotes the company yet fall short. Wonderful benefits!"
good,"Public Sector. Successfully processing applications in a fast paced environment in which there is high levels of focus on quality, detail, and accuracy for our client. Wonderful team that I work with. Needs some work as far as management goes."
good,"i have to say something so i am saying something"
good,Citibank has a good culture and is global. The pay is competitive and the compensation can be considerable. However the technology is very far behind the competitors and their isn't a lot of room for advancement at the higher levels
good,Citi is a place that offers a lot of opportunity to learn and grow your career.  It is a huge organization located worldwide with many products to service all types of clients.
good,"High phone volume, and fresh coffee."
good,"In my position as a call center rep, we were trained to service the customer, then make offers relevant to them. In practice, the most important aspect of job performance was sales, so sales was the biggest priority regardless of relevance to the customer. Typical day, a few minutes to sign into the computer , then take calls until end of shift with 2 paid 15 minute breaks and a 30 minute unpaid lunch. Management; For direct supervisor it's really luck of the draw, they're expected to discus career goals with you and coach you, some did more than others for their teams. As a former employee, I would still use of some of their products, but first time I call them I would give very clear instructions to never make sales offers over the phone."
good,"Citi Bank gave me opportunities, they came with great benefits and also gave me a chance to learn with very little experience in that field. They were patient with me and gave me a chance to prove myself. The environment was very professional, yet it had a home feel due to great co-workers."
good,"Working at Citi requires total commitment and dedication. If you don't have a personal or a family life, Citi is the place for you."
good,"It can be a very stressing day, or a very smooth day. It is a great place for one to learn and grow as an employee. The hardest part of the job is working under stress. Besides the stress, it pays great, clients become very friendly after getting to know you."
good,position no longer exists in TX. so there is no real benefit for reviewing the position. Mortgage operations was moved from TX. But Citi was a good company to work for
good,"Typical day at work was fast. Don't have much time to breathe."
good,It's what you would expect working in Customer Service for a large bank. Overall I value my experience with Citi but ultimately it wasn't the right fit for me.
good,I worked at Citi until they outsourced all the accounting jobs to India and then sold the remaining line to another company.  It was a great company until this happened.
good,I think this is a great company. I was there a long time ago and still keep up with what is going on over there. The only thing I would say that is bad is the technology.
good,"As long as you can Handle change , Helping your peers , trainings and team off site outing you will find citi a great place to work. They have many perks"
good,"I have been miserable for months and also my co-workers have been miserable here. It has its pros and cons, but I feel the cons beat the pros. They do have nice benefits though and great managers."
good,"A good place to work with a great work culture and colleagues. However, hard work is not always recognised and there is a significant amount of office politics involved when it comes to compensation/promotions. Salaries are poor and technologies used are sometimes outdated, which can be a disadvantage to those starting out in their careers."
good,making outbound calls trying to help people with very high statges of credit card debt become current using an auto dialer system.  the benefits and management were good with a lot of room for advancement.
good,Enjoyed working at citi. Very family oriented. I had very positive role models. I also had a great shift Monday through Friday 7am to 3:30pm. They also have great benefits.
good,"Worked with good people on most assignments, but managers often out of touch with employees, and such a large company allows for some to advance that aren't qualified"
good,Citibank is good company to work for. The best part is the multiple training organized for learning and development of an individual. Overall good company.
good,Happy and busy department. Learned accounting principals and record keeping. Manager was always pleasant. The hardest part of the job was when the team did not balance at the end of the day.
good,"If you want, you can have work life balance."
good,"Multinational company, with great chances of growth because it has an organized business structure in some sectors that facilitate the resources that every client or employee may want in a practical work environment"
good,"Good company to work for.  Great work/life balance but this depends on specific management.  Great company history, a company where career growth is possible as it's a global company."
good,"Citi is not much different than the other big banks in California, like Bank of America and Wells Fargo. They all seem to adopt the same culture at the same time."
good,"Always come in to work at night"
good,"AFast paced environment, customer service orientated.  Management set a helpful and friendly workplace for employees.  Opportunities for  advancement."
good,As a contractor I did not have full access to Citi's overall management structure. Management is making an effort to include all of the employees in understanding it strategic objectives.
good,"Overall good place to work only downgrade is what they call KDS - they will call your customers after your transaction and ask a series of questions, depending on what the customer rated the transaction experience they evaluate your customer service skills and that affect your bonus - if the customer does not give you all TENS to all of the questions your are already in the red mark."
good,Worked in Citi on a 6 month internship during college. Citi provided a view into the professional world through a hard working team based structure.
good,"Hours are sometimes crazy but overall a good place to work."
good,Citi is a great company overall. The benefits and work life balance are great. I enjoy the atmosphere and the teams I have had the pleasure and opportunities to work with
good,Great company to work for. Lots of opportunities. Great training and development. Breadth of people is extremely diverse. Work / life balance can be a challenge.
good,I was given the opportunity to gain an in-depth product knowledge covering all operational areas and work overseas in the US. Progressed to VP level from a junior clerical role.
good,"-	Ensure for achieving sales targets every month"
good,I worked in a smll branch and in no position to speak for most employees regarding the work atmosphere but I can say the company have good pay and benefits
good,"It was my first Corporate job in the Big City.  A learned a lot."
good,"There is a consistent amount of work and plenty to do.  Sometimes working for a large company, sometimes the changes are slower than you may want."
good,"They are CHEAP.  Unfortunatly they are cheap Bank which treats its employees like they do not matter, hence the extremely high rotation."
good,Citi offers good benefits and a quality 401k plan.Management at Citi is trained by other managers and not an actual training course even if you have never been a manger before.
good,"Spent most of my day SAS coding on legacy IBM zOS MVS/JCL.  Co-workers morale was good, given that CITI was shedding 50,000 jobs.  Not unusual to find an employee celebrating their 30th anniversary with Citi. Learned how to code on a main frame, how to analyze FICO segments, how to create contingency funding reports."
good,The overall company is great but as contractor things are not as great. Communication and the timing of the communication needs work.
good,"the job just wasn't for me. Had a very friendly environment. If you get stressed easily, this job wouldn't be for you. they do teach you a lot ; how to handle calls, basic computer skills and phone skills."
good,A very good Organization with the opportunities of advancement and a leading ministry in Government sector. a good office which facilitates the work lifebalance
good,"Achieved upper production quintile all years. Advised clients, top brokers and management on all facets of asset management and portfolio construction. Appreciated the structure."
good,"Reviewed required loan documentation that was reviewed and approved by underwriters.  Based on findings, would critique and provide written feedback on problematic issues.  The most enjoyable part of the job was that my I enjoyed doing the research in making sure that the loan met the required guidelines."
good,"I would open accounts for clients"
good,I learned the different banking process that the full time employees do on a regular day basis. It was rather difficult at the beginning for I had to adjust with the time.
good,"A place you look forward to work at everyday, ample opportunities to grow, allowed to work independently with supportive management and cooperative peers."
good,"A typical day at work is sitting down processing applications and talking to my co-workers. I have learned a lot processing applications, how you put the app together and put it into the system. The management at Citi are very welcoming/nice and concerned about all of there employees. I don't have a hard part of my job. The most enjoyable part of my job is interacting with all different people and communication with them."
good,"Great brand to work for. Great perks and discount programs."
good,"I am fully qualified to solved the end point problem, to manage the seniors user, managing the site network and hardware related queries"
good,"Pay is good for Belfast"
good,You can definitely move up and shine within this company if you know the right people. Some managers are not nice and others are great and supportive; it is not consistent. Work hours were too long until recent changes were implemented however to many conference calls make up for the early closures.
good,"overall is a good work good benefits,"
good,"Well, if you are going to find a place that has less work and more casual time, this is the right place. But if you want to learn high technology and improve your skills, there is nothing for you here."
good,The managers are very supportive.  The Retention department is very stressful and the company underpays for this position.  It is very understaffed and the turnover rate is extremely high.  The company should really evaluate the problem in this department.  It is too stressful of a job for such little pay.
good,"It is a busy job with good benefits. In a typical day, there are multiple tasks that I need to take care of. It is an intense position."
good,"The commute to work was very long and hard."
good,Analyzed challenging loan packages. Co workers were great to work with and sociable. It was wonderful learning different procedures from surrounding areas of business.
good,"Good company to work with and for, I enjoyed my time at Citi and always felt appreciated for the contribution that I made."
good,"as a normal call center agent you will start your day with calls and end up with calls also ,its fun to inter act with different types of callers every day some are good and some are irate.you need to be flexible no matter how hard it is .the most enjoyable part of the job is during break time because aside from eating you may discuss the type of callers you had."
good,A great place to work when your hard work is  noticed and rewarded. Management should have focused and cared more about their employees. Advancement was depending on your stats but there was opportunity. Compensation was not fair for all the task that we where asked to do for assignments due to time restrictions. There were great bonuses for those who made their numbers each month on a incentive program.
good,"Time Management, Time Management, Time Management is the key to making sure your day is productive."
good,"Work life Balance is good."
good,"Every day at Citi can be a different day. the environment is challenging, and the culture is hard and fast paced."
good,"I learn a lot from this position, it greatly helped me improve on my customer service and administrative skills. loved my coworkers, but there's no room for career advancement."
good,"Attending inbound calls for home, car and personal loans"
good,"I learned a lot while working with the organization,"
good,"Worked with loans that investors owned and CITI serviced,"
good,"I start my day with a positive note and look for business growth. Every day is new experience, like dealing with different clients and different situations and that helps me learn new things every day."
good,Offers good work/life balance but everyone is for themselves...not very helpful to advance career. Didn't get support and always worried about people  stabbing you in the back to advance themselves.
good,A very professional Company. Job stability is questionable since they now go by sales quotas. The benefits were great the best compared to other companies I have worked for.
good,"I am working in TCS for Citi client. Employee salary and benefits are not good enough. Also had to handle lot of work pressure, work on the weekends, which is definitely disturb to balance between Job and family."
good,"Challenging, fast-paced work environment. Very diverse team with various work experiences. Great exposure to different areas of AML and other aspects of Compliance, such as Advisory and Legal. I have a true passion for AML investigations. It is very rewarding to know you're part of the ""greater good"" and helping make a difference."
good,The job is easy if the clients pick up the phones and you can keep them on there. Also they require that you break 2 or more buckets every month. if you go without breaking for 2 months you will be on a pip plan which requires you to do better or you will lose your job. they have great benefits but the team leads and some managers are very how do you say they are all for themselves and if you have  a complaint with the team lead some managers will cover for them and try to talk there way around the reason you are mad at the team lead.
good,"I enjoyed this job when I thought it was about taking calls from customers who had questions or concerns about their credit card account, but when they went to the sales portion of the job and that everything has to be done on a time frame I quickly learned this is not something I can do. I was hired for customer service and not sales because i can not do sales."
good,"They pay is great, but the job security is lacking.  You never know when you, or your whole division, might get laid off."
good,"•	Utilized various systems for receiving electronic mail from Oil cardholders."
good,"Creativity and initiative are praised and welcomed at all levels."
good,The most enjoyable part of the job was the competitiveness. We were able to improve our numbers because of that competitiveness. Also the atmosphere of the workplace was a lot of fun. I consider my coworkers as family. I would say the hardest part of the job was the harsh work schedule. We were required to do overtime all the time just to meet our goal and be able to finish our workload. Finally i learned to be more focused and goal oriented because of my job.
good,"ok place to work, good benefits, pretty flexible with your life schedule"
good,"Over the various positions at Citi I have learned the management you directly work for makes the biggest difference. There is something nice about the largeness that is the Citi, they do a lot of things right, continued training and monthly feedback to employees makes a huge difference in a person's demeanor."
good,did alot of bill consolidation... took payments. helped manage office...helped to collect past due accounts.. helped office reach its goals
good,"A lot of good opportunities in Citi. However India based staff makes working difficult."
good,"answer phones from credit card members"
good,"iş yerinde çalışan -yönetici diyologu mükemmel"
good,"1.  Call Center therefore, on the phone 7 hours a day."
good,"CitiBank is a great place to work. Advancement in the company is hard , however there is enough overtime and work to make the salary you desire."
good,The company has great benefits and the co-workers are the best you will find.
good,"O trabalho era extremamente corrido. Trabalhava com prazos.  Aprendi a trabalhar sob pressão. Meus colegas de trabalho existiam aqueles que por uma promoção puxava seu tapete, mas também aqueles que se tornaram meus grandes amigos fora da empresa e que mantenho a amizade e contato até hoje."
good,"I would answer all phone calls, collect all payments, collections, complete loans and mortgages, solicit, filling, all office duties. I learned alot about how to run an office and complete loans and mortgages. My co-workers were encouraging and help ful. The hardest part of my job was the constant soliciting of the same lists. The most enjoyable job was the interaction with the customers and the job its self I enjoyed working in that enviroment and the great hours."
good,Good management. Could use more staff. Benefits were pretty good. Not that flexible
good,"Moving up in Citibank is a definite, but one has to prove their worth.  I started out as a teller and over a period of 4 years moved up to Universal Banker and then to Assistant Branch Manager.  I learned that through hard work and dedication the sky is the limit."
good,"The was good for what I had to do. Sometimes I wonder if upper management is in touch with reality, they expected a lot from our branch that wouldn't be possible without more staff. Overall a pretty good job."
good,"A bit hectic, but fun and our clients are very special and important.  The day goes by very quickly.                                                    My peers are the best, always willing to step in and lend a helping hand."
good,"Citi is great place to learn new technologies. The company innovates and adapts to the ever changing landscape of technology. It's a fun place to work, meeting and talking to people from almost all across the planet. "
good,Great place to learn explore things got great knowledge improved communication good growth etc etc
good,"O Citibank Oferece uma ótima oportunidade para obter conhecimento. O dia a dia é agradavel."
good,Most of the work came through email. It was necessary to respond to all emails as soon as possible and to complete the associated work generated by them within a prescribed timeframe. Time management was a vital part of the daily routine along with the prioritisation work. The co-operation of work colleagues and problem solving together with them and the sharing of work at peak volume times was essential. There were a lot of reports which had to be completed on a daily basis and these fed statistics into management reports and so had to be very accurate. The most enjoyable part of the job was at quarterly section meetings good results couold be shown and people were recognised for their efforts
good,"Working for Citi has prepared me for challenges that I will face in future roles and positions.  I learned to work in a very fast paced and challenging environment.  I worked directly with distressed homeowners to prevent foreclosure.  In the years prior to my tenure in our mortgage division, I worked with consumer and commercial credit card accounts to reduce net credit loss."
good,"Loved my job but it was outsourced. If the job hadn't been outsourced I would have stayed. Great culture, excellent bonuses and benefits."
good,It was a good place to work. I did meet a lot of new people and learn a lot of things. A lot of the managers were good but some were on different pages so it did make it a little confusing at time. The benefits were good for someone who was still in college at the time. I think the hardest part about the job is there was a lot of on the job training and the things that we learned in our training class really did not help. I would say the most enjoyable part of the job was the people I meet and the team building skills that I learned
good,"I worked on the retail side of Citibank.  Worked as a teller and worked my way up to a Service Officer.  I enjoyed my employment but Citibank, at the time, didn’t have the best mobility.  Also, there was a lot of pressure on Banking Centers to sell product and solutions, which is standard, but Citibank I think has unreasonable expectations.  The responsibilities of these goals were placed on the managers and it ended up being a bad environment for everyone.  Citibank has GREAT training programs and team togetherness."
good,Citigroup has a balanced work place specially with families.  Citi is now open to AWS which is a work from home once to twice a week.
good,"Depending on what department you work in, management can be good with flexible work options, but very political. Good people to work with and can learn a lot from each other."
good,I've learned that the key to success is learn skill sets that will set you apart in order to advance.  I have had great experiences with my managers at Citi Mortgage.  I really enjoy the fact that they have an open door policy which makes me feel comfortable to come to talk to them with any concerns.  They are also very encouraging and want to actually see you advance. I enjoy working in a team setting and the support of my co-workers.  The most enjoyable part of the job is when we have quarterly events that allows us to interact with other workers in the company.  The hardest part of the job is making the strict deadlines during the end of the month.  It's a lot of pressure to have all expected sales proceeds posted during a particular time frame and to know others are depending on you to make it happen.
good,"every thing was very good and funny, co-workers are very cooperative, the most enjoyable part of this job was  the award function."
good,"Boa empresa , mais a rotatividade entre uma agência e outra é muito grande."
good,Working with Citi was a fulfilling experience. The management was supportive and I learned a lot.
good,"Citi Mortgage is a great company to work for. Great benefits, diversity and community oriented."
good,"Work life balance is very good . Also, has very good pay and good workplace."
good,I like that I can make my our schedule and the people got along well.  The work was rewarding and when we finished a projected it feel good.
good,citicards is a place that I have learned a lot.  I have learned a lot about client customer service.  This place is what you make it!
good,"I loved working for Citibank. I""ve learned a lot being with the company skills that canbe transferrable to any organization but I felt for the amount of time that I have been with the company that I wasn't challenged enough nor given opportunities to move up within the company."

good,"Your typical day at Citibank as a Teller would begin as soon as you open the teller line to your window. You have to:"

good,"Citibank is a very exciting place to work.  "
good,Very knowledgeable managers; certain managers have no trust in employees
good,Citi is a good job to get experience and then move on.  Working at Citi you will always be on the low end of the spectrum compared to its competitors.

good,"-Desk job but very busy"
good,Its a call center what can you say!! Just take phone calls and your be the managers top favorite.
good,"They did provide very thorough training for you to do your job at your best and to know what your doing when you come onto the floor.  Also have very good benefits as soon as you start your job there.  Co-workers are good as well, everyone always seemed to get along mostly and work together.  About the only negative thing about the job was alot of the managers at one time that were not really good for the job and did not get along with their employees which resulted in the employees not being treated well.  Loved the work itself and what I did there, always looked forward to going into work everyday even after being there for ten years."
good,"I have had a good experience so far with citi, the bonuses are good and I have a laid back manager who doesn't bother you. there are alot of changes that could be made with the policies and how upper management handles things, but overall its an good place to work. really there isnt any room for advancement either"
good,"Good fast paced setting, varied work and projects, open door poliy from management."
good,Corporate culture advances mostly bases on connections in the company.
good,"Initially, the incentive program was perfect. Due to the simplicity of the job itself, if you actually did your job you could hit the minimal metrics with no incentive payment. If you did your best you would be rewarded with an incentive payment bonus plus a team incentive payment bonus that really gave you a nice bonus. After numerous employees began to hit the incentive program monthly, changes to the program took place that eventually raised the bar so high that it was impossible to be reached. Consequently, the incentive program was intentionally changed each month so they didn't have to pay high incentives to a large amount of employees as they had before. During my first 6 months I exceeded the metrics but after they continuously changed the criteria as little as 2 people hit the impossibly high targets out of 250 people. During the last 6 months, our manager changed every week, our job tasks changed every month, and finally after 2 years of service I was laid off. "
good,"My beginning years in the corporate world.  Learned the basic tools about working in the corporate world.  I enjoyed working with Citibank, learned about the banking world and their corporate clients. "
good,Work is very challenging since you'll be dealing a lot with clients from different walks of life and will be indulging yourself in the work environment to which your patience will be tested and even your mental handling of stresses.

good,"I enjoy working the typical day shift Monday thru Friday.  I have learned that you must be able to work individually as well as a team.  I am very flexible when needed and would appreciate having a company that is dedicated to our clients and customers alike. I am able to work with all types o people and adjust accordingly based on their work style.  The most difficult part of the job that I have found is dealing with an unknowledgeable leadership team.  Yet, the company environment and co-workers are a blast to work with    "
good,I answered incoming/outgoing calls from clients. fun relaxing love  talking to people
good,"A typical day is very busy, receiving queries about documents etc."
good,The job itself is very easy. You come in do your work and leave. It's not like some places where your job follows you home.
good,"A typical day at work you stay pretty busy and are multi tasking quite a bit. During my employment with Citi so far I've gained a lot of experience on a forklift, and operating print machinery. Troubleshooting and using all sorts of programs is part of my day to day activities. The people employed by Citi are easy to work with and the work atmosphere is very pleasant for the most part. As far as management goes I am undecided, some of the management I think very highly of but others I have not been impressed with so far. The hardest part of the job is resolving some of the issues that happen on the printers and constantly adjusting to make up for lost production if down time occurs. The most enjoyable part of this job is the work, i like doing it."
good,Its a decent profile wherein the wealth counselor is aligned for revenue generation basis client engagement and advisory on Investment products. Have learned a great deal about positioning the products and analysing investments. Its a decent work environment in terms of co workers and the staff if very helpful.

good,"Wonderful place to learn all about the mortgage process, they give you training or if you want to learn more about a process they will help you see that dream. One daily basis I would train employees on data entry process scanning underwritter packets to be delivered. verify processes weekly with managers to verify process is working, change process and grow with the department as needed with retraining updating proceedures."
good,"Generally, I liked working for CitiBank. The pay was competitive, the benefits were great, and there were lots of opportunities to impress upper management. The schedule was always a set schedule, and there was quite a bit of paid time off available, as well as paid holidays. The only reason I left was that I moved to another state. I would definitely recommend this company to anyone who enjoys working in a call center and working fairly independently."
good,"O dia-dia, recepcionar clientes na agência, auxilio aos gerentes Pessoa Física e Pessoa Jurídica, preenchimento de contratos e documentos relacionado a clientes da agencia, atendimento telefônico, envio de relatório."
good,"The position that I was in was good at the time, and the funds were pretty good. However working in collections makes you a hard person."
good,Current situation with economy is not good. Constant layoffs. Was a very good company to work for before collapse of economy.
good,They encourage work/life balance but they are not always very good at backing it up with action.
good,"Experience in testing risk controls in production and non-production environments. Also, involved with Continuity of Business and Records Management."
good,Great company to work for. Great benefits for health and for anyone who is futhering their education. Growth within the company for sure. You will have to work hard at your common goal to achieve growth.
good,I answered typically 80 to 100 calls a day. I learned customer service skills as well as financing. learned top understand credit reports. I also worked on many types of systems and had to multitask. There was not much opportunity for advancement the management is not very responsible unorganized. The coworkers are friendly. The sales were stressing. I enjoyed helping people understand their credit and how their accounts worked.
good,"hired for sales; enjoyed it for a while then goals and compensation plans changed too often, it was hard to keep up with the demands and changes happening. Enjoyed the operational side of running the branch much more"
good,The hardest part of job is too many changes in bonus structure. I enjoyed the working at remote location. aIt gave savings in money and time for family
good,"Overall a good place to work with nice benefits. Citi has been good to me the last eight years I have worked there. They have a opportunities to move up in the company, and value the education on their employees. At this time I have gotten everything I can from them, but it is a great place to start a new career if your interested in providing excellent customer service."
good,great place to work where a typical day consisted of taking inbound and outbound calls dealing with delinquent personal loan accounts.
good,You never knew if you had a job the next day. Projects were interesting and the people were very nice and cooperative.
good,"It was a great job to have after grad school but being a very big company, there were lots of bureaucracy which impeded opportunities for advancement."
good,"this was my first position after college, and I did learn some selling tactics through my short time with this company also some analyzing financial information"
good,The company is awesome with great benefits. It is a family oriented work atmosphere.
good,I worked here as a summer intern in the wealth management group and had a great experience.
good,I work on the trading floor. It can become hectic sometimes. Intensity is high and one must always be ready to take on a challenge presented. Competition is high.
good,the company is involved in the  community . I have learned to be patient with people  and help them  . its a very   nice place to work. you work with  all different  types of people .
good,"When I was there, I felt there were so many things to improve. After leaving, I found Citi is really at a leading edge. It is a good place  for young employees and people there are always struggling for work-life balance."
good,High volume calls with high rewards.  Lots of teamwork required for high payoffs and to succeed you must provide exceptional customer . Over time is a must to move up the Citi star rankings.
good,"It was really a good place to start my carrier. It was a cool place to work ."
good,I dont have nothing to say . They fired me for something i could not handle. They put on a good front for you but they are very nasty. There was a system issue and they fired me for it
good,The typical day is working more than 12 hours. makes you exhausted by the time you reach home. you do not get enough time for yourself which ends up making you miserable.
good,"Citi provides benefits that beat all from day one. There is an extensive paid training program. Lots of support for minority groups, which is always a good thing. The job itself can be and usually is very stressful. It’s constant, long hours on the phone, often mandatory overtime, etc"
good,Citibank offers great benefits.  It can be a very stressful place to work.  It is very difficult to maintain a job /life balance when working at Citi.  Management requires you to put the job before your family.
good,Worked there for 22 years. really is a good place to work as long as you get a good manager. I haved had several bad and several great ones over the years. Was a big shock when servicing was dissolved
good,Citi is a great company to work for because they offer great benefits and will try and help you every step of the way. Citi is also a very high stress job. They are constantly busy and continue to grow every day.
good,I'd rather not speak about it. Everyone's experience is different. I've been there 6yrs & the stress is bad. Call volume is very high & fast paced. Training isn't always proficient.4
good,I've worked for CitiGroup for a while and just within the last 5 years management has been so hard on employees and some managers had their favorites and I did not like that.
good,Good pay and benefits. Good people to work with. Had plenty of advancement opportunities. Good work/life balance. Very diverse and plenty of employee recognition.
good,Citigroup is a nice place to work. The environment is friendly. Typical day is mostly on calls collaborating with teams in different geographical locations.
good,Company only carred about how much money their employees could bring in. There was no morality to the process itself. Not recommended unless you don't care how you treat others.
good,You couldn't move up in the company. They were very closed minded and wanted only friends I'm high positions. The company wasn't very successful at all.
good,"Citi tends to compensate well.  Although, when the economy slow down or the bank has losses, they don't hesitate to cut staff.  Otherwise the work from program is very nice"
good,company held Chinese lunar year celebration day activities. They bought dumplings and invited Chinese calligraphy master to write names in Chinese. Quite interesting.
good,"Performance appraisals and salary increases were predicated on evaluations that were all too often plagued by the Halo effect, negative biases, and overly-focusing on a single deficiency which, in turn, would cause some of the bubblehead managers pressed for time to predicate their rating in other areas of an employees performance on that one-single deficiency - thereby impacting the career paths and prospects of employees who were, otherwise, superior, results-driven customer service agents. The Texas service centre's progressive disciplinary action system was basically meant to keep the company from paying out bonuses and/or salary increases. For example. if you were placed on a disciplinary warning for attendance you were barred from posting out of your job, for a different position, when the opportunity presented itself. As long as you were on one disciplinary action or another you were kept from posting out or receiving salary increases - even though you were not on any disciplinary action, leading up to the 11th month before completing an otherwise perfect year of job performance."
good,The management was great with the employees and felt appreciated. The only negative is that citi is getting smaller as a company and laid off lots of people
good,Citi has a flexible work schedule which is great because I have 2 children that are in afternoon daycare.  They also let you make up time if you need to leave early one day.
good,I had a nice work experience with the company.  I learned a lot about credit cards. The pay was not enough for the job. I would recommend a friend to citi
good,Citi has great benefits but not much ability to move up in the company. I would love to work remotely from citi but have never been given the opportunity. management is hit or miss
good,CITI NEVER SLEEPS. Always tight project timelines. Lot of pressure and no work life balance. But lot of leanings and opportunities in Citi. Workplace is friendly too
good,"I have had a great experience with Citi under strong management and room for growth/development. However, recent changes across the Risk industry have negatively impacted the culture/energy of the department."
good,"Met a lot of amazing people, but everyone was so stressed out and uptight. Which isn’t a good atmosphere to work in because working in a bank alone can be intense in itself. They want you to be robotic, and if you have a manager anything like mine if you’re going to school to do other things that you want to Pursue, and take school serious more than working at the bank you wouldn’t be fit for that branch. Lunch is only 30 minutes even if you work from 8am-6pm. They want you to contribute to promotions, but most clients state that citi has the worst rates."
good,Empresa valoriza muito a cultura empresarial e tem excelente remuneração comparada ao mercado. O que estraga um pouco o ambiente são alguns gestores que acham que são deuses e não tem o hábito de compartilhar experiências e aprendizados.
good,"Citibank (HK) is a very busy and high pressure place to work at. But the co-worker will stick together and the managers will do everything to support other staff which is great. "
good,You literally are on the phone from the time you end a call to answering a new call. Can be very stressful and must maintain an upbeat and positive attitude in assisting customer.
good,"This company is typical as compared to other big banks - corporate bureaucracy, foster work/life balance, compensation is ok.  regarding with Job security / advancement, it really depends which group you are part of.  On management, that depends as well."
good,"Very productive but also very fast pace, sometimes. The job"
good,"with great benefits and great people.  I miss the people th pay and potential to earn more. I hated being screened on calls, but I was able to pall all calls"
good,"Direct Manager and lead are excellent, is a big supporter of work/life balance, and always work with schedule changes. The company has great health/401k benefits and paid time and sick time off."
good,High Stress level with month end pressure but nice place to work with international standards .Good pay and rewards when job well done. I was happy to be part of Citibank .
good,the pay and benefits are very well worth the hours. the hours are long and it can get tiring very fast. it is a call center and expect to deal with angry customers every other call.
good,"I work in CitiService, this is the name of the area. My job tittle is Customer Service Analyst and daily I work with the back office and the customers of corporate bank in Costa Rica. I tracing requests and all banking processes that big companies have with Citi. I've learned to work under pressure, having perfect management to support the requirements, by this I mean a perfect match with tools, teams of different areas, systems, platforms and confidential information. Also, I've learned to have the customers expectations in a high level, have a good relationship with my work team, and to achieve the indicators of the area."
good,"Call handle time is the most important aspect to the job.  Lack of team manager support hurts your career with Citi.  Some managers care enough to help you, others don't."
good,"There are lots of scope of learn new functional Regulartory filing things. Enjoyed working in Daily Filing, Quarterly Filing & Annaul filing reports. "
good,They have made constant changes and seem to make the job harder and harder with the requirements on each call. I know change at a call center is always expected though it gets hard when they continue to raise the expectations making them almost out of reach.
good,"citi is a great place to work, but they just wont work with my schedule. being a single mom, i can not work late shifts. i wish they would so that i can stay working here."
good,I was good if you just want a foot in the door to get into banking financial. The culture was nice. The managers where a bit pushy when it came down to credit cards. The hardest part of the job was going into work on Sat.
good,"At the time when I worked for the concerned department , the work offered good exposure into practices of marketing analytics and predictive modelling. "
good,"It was overall fun to work their.  Colleagues were very helpful. Our team leader were very helpful at tough times. Salary was always at time never delayed it. They always said that we understand the work pressure you have to face, so we will never delay the salary what so ever."
good,Day start with meeting with Manager and see the pending tasks for the day. Then check mails and respond to it. Then work on tickets assigned or critical cases
good,"I was in the call center for online banking when it first was being setup at Citibank.  A very professional atmosphere, I learned how to walk customers through setting up there online accounts."
good,"Life in Citi Bank was amazing, you learn a lot of things. In Citi Bank very day is a learning, u meet a lot of customers with different queries and not only that u can cross-sell various products of Citi bank and become a brand ambassador and earn incentives in for of point on credit card/ cash vouchers . Your seniors are like family members and they mentor you."
good,"I have the flexibility of working an 8 hour shift between 6am-7pm. The workload tends to fluctuate depending on the time of year (holidays, tax time, etc.). The culture is pretty diverse and people are generally respectful of peoples ethnicity, heritage and differences. I enjoy my current team of co-workers. The hardest part of the job is career advancement as being an individual contributor."
good,I learned that if I wanted to get promotion I need to work very hard to  networking with manager type of people. Workplace culture is diversity and people tend to respect each other due to our company culture. The hardest part of the job is applying job internally if you don't know many people in the company. The most enjoyable part of the job is many networking activities.
good,"My manager was brilliant, but extremely demanding right off the start. The hardest part of the job was to be an expert on issues and problems without having enough time to come up the curve. Technology education was available but there wasn't enough time to take advantage of it, so it made the job even more difficult ."
good,"Securing Goals is all important"
good,You are on the phone ALL day long in a call center. You learn a lot about credit card processing and disputing charges.  The first manager I had was awesome.  The workplace is a friendly culture.  The hardest part of the job is learning to speak verbatim to customers.
good,"* Good place to work if you have previous cashier experience but if not they are willing to train"
good,It was a good work experience at Citi in the short span that i worked there. Major part of my work was in Ford Business service center. There was good work life balance.
good,"As Citi has a brand value and i feel good that i worked there. but the working hour is very stressful to balance work and family life. because of long working hours, it becomes stressful for the employees. but the culture is very good. i really liked working there as i was an intern at that time"
good,Excellent work place with excellent benefits. I would most likely recommend employment with them. I have every little complaints about there company. Thank you.
good,"I met some great leaders at Citi, and learnt tremendously from them. However, in operations, staff are not as smart and efficient; they are not as willing to learn and improve either. It is overall disappointing."
good,Citi was a great company to work for. Management for the most part is very understanding and stands behind their open door policy 100%. Its is not easy to move up with the company. There is amazing benefits.
good,"Typical day at work was reading letters from customers and trying to figure out what happened to their payments."
good,"CITI is a place that can make more money and noisy "
good,"Citi provides a good work/life balance for the industry, offering remote work were possible and ample vacation benefits. It is a fast pace environment, with an abundance of meetings and mandatory training in addition to meeting the demands of the job. The people are friendly, and management is approachable."
good,I am a public sector who handles daily mail drops and high volumes of mail through different processes. The daily mail volume determines the work load. The job itself is fairly easy. With the correct training and drive for success anything is possible.
good,"The compensation is good."
good,"Work hard to drive the project. You will probably never meet your manager. Work day 9am to 7pm. Upper management does not let go of your assigned project (control). The projects do not follow PMI's project methodology. Citi-Group uses Planview instead of MS Project. No support to learn Planview. Great for senior management, but difficult to use in project management. Workforce is older, because staff seldom quits. Coffee is free and food is great."
good,talk to customer all day to help bring account current. I also help with any question the have about the accounts. The workplace is very divers and friendly.
good,Company was great to work for with full time hours and great benefits. Not flexible with the position I was in. Management only tried to work with me under extreme circumstances but to no avail.
good,"A typical day at Citi is very busy, productive, intense, long and can be frustrating. The management is okay but not all together on one accord, The workplace culture is great, there so much of a diversity here and I enjoy that from a company."
good,In Citi you will find management giving special importance for employees work life balance.They provide transport facilities for all the employees.Thanks
good,I lost my job after my son was born. They do not except sick days or doctor notes. Decent pay and great chances to advance in the company.You get Vacation as soon as you get hired. Really good benefits.
good,"I actually enjoyed working at Citi and am grateful for the opportunity that was given to me. Unfortunately, the mortgage industry is quite volatile and so is Citi, resulting in mass layoffs and rehire every 1-2 years."
good,Citibank is not easy to handle. It always was a hectic day at work.Long shifts and lot of mental pressure. The hardest part about the job is that it needs your attention for 9 hours a day without any distractions. Also dealing with people who were so impatient.  However it was enjoyable for some part i.e interacting with some really fascinating people. The workplace culture was super great. Full of different kinds of races and getting to know them by conversing was one of the best parts.
good,A great company to work for. The company offers extensive training to prepare you for your role to be successful. It is a male dominated work environment.
good,Good Team support and provided with aided tool for assisting enabling individual to perform in full capacity to bring out its best from the indidividual
good,Learned a lot from working at citi bank. This is a excellent company to work for. The hardest part was to accept the work culture and security systems to keep integrity.
good,Very Diverse work environment. Job can be very demanding at times some clients are very hard to please. call handle time can be very hard to meet. management very helpful
good,"Typical day of work clocking In"
good,It a  nice  workplace where we had our gym and Tim Hortons coffee shop and lots of facilities. I had worked in collections where i acquired a lot of experiences
good,"The company puts a lot of focus on compliance and numbers. The compliance makes sense, you have to follow the law, but it seems that actually helping the customer comes second to how the company looks."
good,"It would be good if everyone that's in the same office are on the same page. Management can be more people friendly, more friendly personality. Everyone should know what they are doing. Employees should get fair share not just base on their position because we actually do more then our position, especially helping management with their duties. I learned a lot and taught a lot. Always expect changes. Overall Citi is a good place to work if you are thinking about a career in banking."
good,Citibank overall is a good company. Hours given are not that great. Job advancement is also difficult. Hardest part of the job are teller referrals
good,"Nothing really exciting; constant change and miscommunication on some things, but work gets done. things could be better, which I think they will eventually work on, just gets crazy at times."
good,"like my role, i really like getting to help people with there financial goals/ help newbies learn how things work"
good,"Great work place, enjoyed working with co-workers, great team work, learned alot of customer service skills, helping customers, enjoyed it 100%,"
good,"I usually work long hours but the work culture and the ppl that I work with are great. Salary and raises are not good.  But overall, it is a good experience."
good,Nice place to work with helpful people. Busy environment that also included fun at times which made the days go by fast. Co-workers were nice and helpful.
good,Citigrouop gave me the experience starting my career to put me where i'm at today.  Learning to network and provide the best programs that we had to offer
good,"Very professional and Supportive management.Work in a great team environment, achieved professional satisfaction, progress and personal development while worked in an professional environment."
good,"Openly trains many new employees by way of staffing agencies. This is great for people looking to gain experience, but are hired in as ""temporary"" employees. These employees very often get hired on as permanent employees, but it is also quite possible that these employees get laid off quite easily. The workplace is filled with great people, but the atmosphere is inescapably corporate."
good,"My typical work day was to assist card members with their new cards. This job helped to learn how to interact with customers and get to know the different types of people I came into to contact with. The hardest part about the job was meeting quota every month. Once I was able to understand my product, the job became easier and I enjoyed it more."
good,A typical day at work was quite consistent for me. The work kept me involved and motivated. My management was fair and honest with me and my progress as a worker. I really enjoyed my co-workers and their hospitality. overall I had a great time working for Citi.
good,Great company to work for you are laid back dont want to stress about your daily work. Good worklife balance. Headquarters is awesome place to work at. Many opportunities to advance and move around with in the company.
good,Working with Citi was a great experience for me. I learned how to work in a corporate office and learned to be more professional. I think this was a great way to get introduced into the business world.
good,"Everything I know is because of Citibank's competitive environment, where we worked our heart out and learned something new every single day."
good,Citi Bank is One of the World's Finest Banking Institutions!! The Work Culture is great.. Its was a pleasant experience ..
good,"10 hour days, not too bad"
good,"My experience with Citi has been bittersweet. I really love the vacation time I have earned over the years, over 3 weeks, almost 4 when you add in floating holidays. Keep in mind as you read this that much of my experience at Citi is from a Customer Service background, mostly on the phones taking inbound calls. Customer Service can be difficult no matter what company you are working for. Someone applying for a different position within Citi may have a totally different experience than I have. Those working in Customer Service often deal with a variety of situations, that can include lots of irate customers who can be demanding and verbally abusive to you at times. A big part of being successful in a Customer Service environment is that you have to let a lot of things people say roll of your shoulders, this can sound easier than it really is. Not every caller is rude, angry, or demanding. In fact, the vast majority in my experience just need help with something and you are there to help them. I currently work in Online Support, which while still on the phones feels more rewarding because I feel like I have really helped someone by the end of the call. There are lots of websites managed by Citi, so I am constantly busy taking calls and managing website issues that may arise. If you are on the phones, it can be very busy at times where the calls are back to back, sometimes for the whole day. This can mentally wear you down, especially if you are dealing with a lot of irate customers. However, there are also slow times where you will wait for calls and have a little down time to"
good,"Citi was pretty great in the beginning. Then you realize you're greatly underpaid and overworked. My department did the jobs of 5 departments and still only got paid $1-$2 more and that's not okay. My manager was great although not that attentive. My coworkers are what helped me stay for so long but after you've been with citi for 1 year, you're tenure. That's how bad it is. BUT still better than many other call centers. If you're in customer service at Citi, you don't have to up-sell and that's rare to find!"
good,"In Daily Banking Team, where I work I am processing  Cash Monitoring and Asset Register of few investment alternative funds."
good,People there are great to work with and to learn from just this particular department is terrible to work for because of all the guidelines it takes to actually be able to receive incentive and it's based all on production nothing else which was difficult but overall great place to work for other than personal loans collection department.
good,"A lot of creative freedom "
good,"I liked Citi when I first started but all that glitters isn't gold. You either love it or you hate it. There is no work life balance , they try to work with you as far as scheduling goes but its only for the short term, after that you're on your own. It's very repetitious and boring. Screaming customers can get under your skin after awhile. They gave very good pay which they should because you put up with a lot and the responsibility list is endless. Coworkers keep you sane however communication with them is not too often as sometimes your calls are back to back without a breath in between.You have to be accounted for 98% of the time so a measly 5 min bathroom break outside of your allotted break time takes you down; take two of those and its detrimental. I have learned patience and a lot about credit cards. They have excellent benefits and when you actually help a customer and satisfy their needs it does feel good. I cant wait to finish with school (they have tuition reimbursement) so that I can move on to a more satisfying career. I do feel Citi cares about there employees and it's the only call center I'd recommend. It's really just the nature of the business."
good,Stay out of the dramam and focus on you work and you can definitely advance rather quickly. West has many companies they contract with so it depends on who they are hiring for when you go apply.
good,"This job is one that will always be appreciated. A typical workday involved 200-300 accounts per day that range anywhere from three days to eight months past due. This was an inbound and outbound call center facility with most inbound calls being fed through an auto-dialing system. The call would then be routed to your particular queue. As the customer connects to you, you would ask for the customer's demographics that are relevant to the account. You then must set up some type of payment or payment arrangement on the account that will bring the account current. The job gave me the tools necessary to perceive unfavorable conditions and have the capacity to identify and initiate alternatives to circumvent certain situations. Management changed quite a bit, so we were unable to get to know our collections manager very well. The co-workers, however, were awesome. They were very friendly and someone was always availble to help. We would have monthly competitions to bring out the best in everyone. The hardest part of the job was the ever-changing schedules. With the management and/ or team changes came the onset of several short notice schedule changes. The most enjoyable part of the job was the environment. The team I was on would celebrate the birthdays of our team members as well as monthly goals that had been met or surpassed."
good,"The typical day at Citi is to assit every client as quick and as courtious as possiable. I've learned alot while working at Citi, management skills, patients, and a number of other things"
good,There were new policies that was put in place that I couldnt keep up with.
good,"Overall my Job at Citi is very professional. I enjoy the benefits and time offered to me for my position. I cannot complain about what was offered to me when i originally applied for the job here. The hardest part about my job would be miscommunication between management and employees when it comes to new updates on important information. I enjoy working around all of my employees. One thing that i truly dislike is how private management can be at times, sometimes it makes me feel like job security may be an issue pertaining to Layoffs, termination, etc."
good,"Great benefits, set chosen schedule after training which was 12 weeks long, if you like being on the phone with clients then this would be a great job for you"
good,Great company to work for. Great company to be part of. An overall great experience.
good,"CitiBank is more for a single person just starting out thier lives. They offer great compensation and benefits but not much time to live ones life."
good,"•Provided analysis across multiple information security programs to evaluate risk. "
good,"Fun job, with great people.  Double shifts and over time became tiresome over the years."
good,"Fun - clad and lively place. Good work culture. The hardest and most enjoyable part is about mulch-faceted assignments. Working with banks all across the globe, makes it an 24-hr job. Understanding business and implementing it with ease."
good,"Was a fast pace job with i did enjoy.  There was not a lot of communication at times, it was very unorganized.  Staff was very nice to work with though."
good,"Very nice working environment, company culture, and nice people. just the job is not secured at all."
good,"I was employed by citi bank for appx 2 years. When it comes to citi bank, yes they do take care of there employees and they are always involing work with family for that enviorment. It is pretty simple if you show up do your job like you are supposed to you will work out, but you have to be committed to citi bank, I always like to say you need to be married to it LOL My supervisor was outstanding, I certailnly can't speak for all but mine was wonderful, outgoing, personal and caring, yes she was defintely part of my wonderful experience with my career there. The reason that I deceided to leave citi bank was to pursue my field of nursing, it has allways been a life long passion of mine and I am grateful and thankful that I am finally to a point in my life to be able to pursue my dreams. So if antone is looking for a new career path or looking to move forward in the customer service and sales end of your career yes look at citi. Just remember the C in Citi stands for CHANGE :)"
good,"The climate of banking is changing. The financial services industry is filled with banks, and Citibank is one of the best to work for. The company has been great to me and my family. Banks now are more focused on pleasing clients (which is great!!) and less on financial security."
good,good management at branch.  Very supportive manager.  Flexible.
good,"Great job, really felt as if I were helping people. Just ha to leave to help my grandmother that was passing away."
good,Started out in Student loan collections moved to customer service/sales. Citibank has one of the best management team I've had to work under. 
good,"Learning about money laundering and system used by companies or natural persons to avoid government requirements, all this in countries in south America and central america"
good,"Good place to work"
good,A typical work day is answering incoming HR related inquiries.
good,On a daily basis I was in charge of making sure that everybody on my team was being productive and reaching there set goals. I learned how to manage a group of people and the employees was all fun to work with as well. The hardest part of my job was to decline the re-location to Dallas and what I enjoyed the most was the call center atmosphere.
good,Process customers inquiries and changes on credit card accounts
good,"I believe Citi can be a great place to work. As with any large company it will take time to figure out how to navigate the system. However, there are some very talented people and if you are fortunate to land with a good manager, job can be fulfilling."
good,"The company provided very good hours, with a decent amount of over-time in busy seasons. Though I cannot speak for upper management, the supervisors placed directly over us in the department were very caring individuals who worked very hard to make sure their employees needs were met."
good,Good and learn a lot. Training is robust and highly encouraged.
good,Great benefits and amazing 401k match program.
good,I enjoyed working at Citifinancial the first few years that I was there. The business however got a little tougher to enjoy when the economy went down.
good,a typical day at work is me processing and assisting clients with their bank needs such as deposit/withdraws and balancing check books.
good,"A typical day at work; going in knowing what is expected of me, trying to come up with different ways of communicating with various customers. I learn different ways of getting the same results in different ways. Managers does what managers are expected to do. Coworkers are team orientated. The hardest part of the job is watching the upbeat moral float away. The most enjoyable part of the job is when management and employees work together for the common good."
good,Good benefits chances for advancement. Very large company. Veried hours
good,"O dia dia no Citibank é bem tranquilo. O trabalho é rotineiro e sem grandes mudanças. Aprendi a trabalhar em equipe e ser mais organizado com documentações de extrema importância. A gerência do banco é exigente, porém, não existe muitas promoções para funcionários antigos. O mais interessante de trabalhar no Citibank são os colegas, que te deixam sempre a vontade para aprender e desenvolver o melhor trabalho. Acredito que a parte mais difícil era ver funcionários novos, sendo contratadas para cargos que poderiam ser de funcionários mais antigos. O momento mais agradável sem dúvidas era o dia dia no banco. O trabalho era muito gratificante, e mesmo não tendo uma remuneração a altura, era bom trabalhar no Citibank."
good,"Very friendly environment, wonderful workers, comfortable working environment."
good,"I have learned a lot during my time with Citi, but I feel under appreciated as an employee."
good,"Ok place to work, work life balance is superb. Managment is working constantly to improve."
good,The team really made the company. The work was dry but that was because I was in a back office role. What really made this company special were my colleagues.
good,"Great benefits"
good,"I loved my job at Citi for many years, They are a big company that used to make the employees feel valued and were treated with respect in a very positive atmosphere with Quality customer service being very high on the list. However things have changed in the last couple years and these  changes don't give me the satisfaction of doing a great or even good job anymore. The company pays really well and has great benefits, flexible shifts."
good,"Pekerjaan dengan target,pencapaian sesuai target mendapat insentif"
good,"Unfortunately, Wall Street and FinTech are slow to change.  Sexism reigns supreme, and sometimes it was just too hard to get things done.  Some days were very long as well although for the pay it was hard to complain about that."
good,My experience with management at Citibank was top-notch the training received from my manager was excellent and it allowed me to do my job efficiently. The downfall to the job was not enough training and ongoing education. If you weren't selling you are doing your job whether you talk to people or not.
good,Great work environment with a potential to learn and grow. The projects and business problems came across helped in learning new techniques. Overall personality development
good,"Working at CITI Bank in a call center is not as easy as it might sound, personally to me it was not too difficult, but remembering how many people left after 6-8 weeks tells me it is not a job for everyone."
good,I think people all have different experiences based on the department they work in. There are a lot of great reasons to work for this company but it's not a perfect place to work either.
good,".Productve, fast paced work place . My experience was working with institional traders, different from financial advisors who traded stocks, bonds & commodities.  Management gave me the opportunity to work in other positions. The opportunity for. professional development was a big part of the work culture."
good,Understood tiered client benefits and having divisions focused on specific areas who had expertise in those areas. They one downside to that was the silo approach to client benefits which the leadership tried its hardest to rectify. Before finally making the decision to get back to what the areas that they truly could succeed  in.
good,"at citiank as a teller, you have no time to sit for a moment, you are either helping the customers with transactions or you are filing w-9's or signature cards or run other errands for managers, bankers, and the closing process that includes runnig the checks and preparing everything for the back office, and you need to focus so well all the time, this job demands a lot of brain energy and physical energy,no complaint about it ,but this volume of work deserves a better payment and income than the current one."
good,"Shows a sincere interest in employees and the solutions to their problems. Lends support and guidance to employees by [task]"
good,Good life but very slow paced career growth.Not a place for someone who is aggressively looking for growth prospects. Very diversified teams. Good place to learn about cultures and soft skills. More emphasis on behavior than on skills or capabilities. May turn off high performance individuals at times.
good,Citi has the culture common to very large companies. There is no shortage of bureaucracy and only soldiers are successful. Setting up benefits is very painful and time consuming and it poisons the onboarding experience.
good,For the most part depending on who you know will get you far at citi. If not no one knows you. Outside of that it is pretty nice working at citi and all the new people you get to meet.
good,"Citi is a great corporation with lots of opportunity for advancement and growth.  if you work hard and play politics well you will do well. "
good,This was a good job for starting out.  It has been a good experience in customer service.  The company offers good compensation and excellent benefits.  They are average for the industry in offering advancement opportunities.  The hardest part of the job has been inconsistent leadership.
good,this is not a bad job if you like phone work. Benefits are good. Hours can be very long and stressful. lots of overtime available however overtime can be mandatory.
good,"this job paid well, full time, exceptional benefits, management was strict on time of phone calls. the hardest part of the job was when people would cuss you out because an installment did not go right and there was nothing we could do to fix it or we had to report to credit bureaus. Very stressful."
good,"As a collector you can deal with all sorts of calls. Some are good, some are not so nice. People have legitimate reasons for being in debt others are just irresponsible."
good,Didn't really care for the management. If you spoke out on something you thought was wrong they would fire you.  It was a very paced environment with a lot of demand. Pressure was focused on Audits which required a lot of knowledge and accuracy.
good,Environment was good  i had to work from 9 am to 9 pm but i just love to work there..we all were in seviour under pressure..i hv a very good supervisor..he taught me all the banking job which i need to do..as i am very quick learner and confident I just love to do..
good,"Citi is a great place to work at if you have the patience for them. Although the people there are great to work for and the culture opens your mind to a more positive way of thinking, their policies differ from other banks. Some policies are understandable since we handle large amounts of cash and private information. But when it comes to some other things, Citi is way behind the curve compared to banks like Chase."
good,I worked with a third party so that is not much I could really say about them.  From what I saw they seemed pretty professional and their staff that worked directly with them seemed happy.
good,I give it a three. Too much required for type of pay. Some days are great and some days are not. Too many expectations. Alot of things changing making work environment more difficult.
good,"Eu gosto de trabalhar no Citi, a empresa respeita os funcionários e possui um bom ambiente de trabalho."
good,It was a great place to work. Due to regulatory changes certain sales opportunties were taken away which equated to less than adequate pay without sales incentives. Very low base pay for the stress you deal with each day.
good,"fast paced customer service environment, back to back calls helping card members with account concerns."
good,"A very large organization and very fast paced environment.  Learning was never ending which was nice and therefore never a dull moment.  There was always a lot to do, from preparing early morning reports, mid months, end of month.  Assisting DM with branch audits, human resource information from new employees, questions on claims for employees, etc.  It was great!"
good,Citi does a great job of developing its employees and offering opportunities to those who apply themselves. Being able to accept change often is a must here.
good,"Havia bons beneficios, salário condizente, mas eraam desorganizados no RH, nunca recebi um holerite, tinha que ir sempre atrás, Apesar de um grande banco com investimentos em 2006, tinha uma variedade para apresentar a investidores de bolsa."
good,This job is very sales focused. Management wwas very strict and required a lot from you. Stressful when slow and management showed the stress they get from their management.
good,Overall Citi goes above and beyond for its phone agents.  It trys to provide a fun and productive work place.  The management is very involved and really strives to help develop the workforce.  There is a awesome balance between work and life when you are a phone agent and the company has very competitive benefits that make this a great place to work
good,empresa que fue una escuela de aprendizaje en cuanto al conocimiento en la banca y en cuanto a las personas se debe destacar la ayuda y compañerismo que existia.
good,Citi was a wonderful company to work. I would advise anyone to work for Citi. The work atmosphere was always positive and the managers were always inviting.
good,Good company to work for if you like being on a phone all day. has good benefits good employees. ability to move into to different fields
good,There are many different departments and areas to learn and grow with. It is a team work environment so everyone looks out for each other.
good,"My manager was good to give me good leeway and guiding me, giving useful information. Upper management only concerned with coming and going in time and sitting at the desk working. So lot of people were surfing the internet."
good,"Buen ambiente laboral ."
good,Great time off and insurance packages that's it. Café food is good and onsite gym. A lot if people in management positions who are not qualifies. Its all about who you know here in order to move up your skill set does not matter
good,This is a great company for people who excel in sales and customer service. if you dont have a sales drive you will not last long for this company.
good,"It is difficult to review this company since a year after I joined, the financial crash was starting, this company was one of the hardest hit, the moral was not good, I left for another job."
good,Very stressful environment. Goal oriented and primarily about numbers while being forced to provide above and beyond customer service. No help from management.
good,"1. Trade authorising & trade settlement transacion "
good,"Providing customer service to our cardholders, discuss options to bring credit card accounts up to date. Enjoyed working with my co-workers, my first manager was supportive and encouraging and always helped me meet my goals."
good,"Embrace challenges- customer complaints"
good,"Laboré para citibank, pero era subcontratado por medio de la temporal Centaurus"

good,Strong knowledgeable employees who work as a team and share knowledge

good,I actually enjoyed my time at Citi. They had quite a few activities & some good employees that made the work place fun. The only problem was Citi's management. Management played favoritism so at times it could be unfair.
good,"Citibank is an amazing place to work at. "
good,"Really enjoyed working here, was able to be myself.  Wish they were still around."
good,"I have definitely grown as a professional at Citibank. I have built many relationships, both personal & professional. These relationships have helped with customer relation and my customer service skills. Citibank offers great benefits and bonuses. Although I have been able to deepen client relationships through rapport and service, its has been a little more difficult to communicate with management. The banking industry is very competitive which can sometimes lead to stress and tension in the workplace."
good,"Citi is a very good company as far as work benefits and work culture.       I love talking and helping people. The most enjoyable part of my job is talking to different people each day, there is never a dull moment."
good,"This company expects a lot of work for way to little pay always making goals too high, But it does have great benefits and very nice work place."
good,"I learned a lot about the financial industry at CitiFinancial, and how to match customers with products that truly benefit their loans. Hardest part of the job was making collection calls. I loved talking to the customers and finding best solutions to their problems."
good,"Continuous review and upgrading technologies and pioneer in the banking and financial sector. A good place for the people who love the challenges in work environment, enthusiastic place."
good,I m good in this branch but it was too far from home. nothing much to tell
good,"We come in, get extra time to set up our systems, when on the weekends we normally have pot lucks."
good,"The job was tough but rewarding, I got to talk to alote of peaple great peaple and it was rewarding when you could really help some one. "
good,"Overall, I have learned alot from working at Citibank. I appreciate the management's team direction and consistencies in delivering results."
good,"Enjoy working at Citibank, a typical day at work is very busy, clients call all day and I have learned to be patient in my job position."
good,"As a fraud specialist, I would review credit card account recent activity and compare it to the card member's spending history to see if the recent activity is fraudulent. If I deemed it suspicious, I would verify the activity with the card member; otherwise, I move on to the next account. When I call the card member on suspicious transactions and the card member denies making the transaction(s), I would close the account and send out a new account number and card."
good,"I have worked for Citi for over 13 years. In that time, I have have worked to make significant improvement in the area of financial transparency. My day to day responsibilities entail working with various lines of businesses to identify areas in need of improvement within their product lines. Perform analysis in order to make recommendations on how improvements can best be made. Interact with TI and devlopment teams in order to produce functional requirements, work with Project Mgmt team on the implementation of solutions design."
good,"Strong company with a large footprint and respected brand. However, there are a lot of opportunities for improvement with compensation and opportunities for advancement."
good,"Worked as life insurance agent. Duties included customer service which involved product information, sales procedures, claims handling and the management of complaints and disputes. Also offering insurance policies, selling mutual funds, annuities, and securities and offer comprehensive financial planning services, including retirement and estate planning services, some designed specifically for the elderly customers."
good,I was initially hired at Citibank in a temporary reception and administration position and was promoted to Documentation Manager in March 2011. My day to day duties included:
good,Started out as a Telemarketer soliciting business and maintain customer database. Promoted to Mortgage Consultant processing Pime and Sub-Prime loans.
good,"I Really loved working for this bank it had lots of perks that came with the position , I also loved the customers that would come in day in and day out very fun and great company to work for ."
good,"Had a great staff working for me. Always, always willing to go the extra mile when needed, despite the general opinion that the company did not value their performance."
good,"Had an oppurtunity to be involved with various aspects of banking. From the front end, to the collections side."
good,"If your looking for a career that wont go anywhere, Citi is the place for you. No one has been hired into a management position in over 4 years. Many managers have been let go or pursued other employment in the last few years also. Citi could be a great place to work if they really valued their employees, they say they do but employees don't really feel the appreciation. Very demanding job but can be extremely rewarding when your able to help to provide relief to people experiencing financial hardships. Many requirement to be successful in this position and many of the tools initially provided to you to succeed have been stripped away making it difficult to overcome objections from clients to pay bills they owe. Required to stay on the phones majority of the day which isn't a problem, however, the cheap computers are constantly having issues which makes it difficult. Not to mention the auto dialer runs extremely slow during prime time hours making it difficult to speak w people, you can go 20-30 minutes and not speak w anyone, hurting your numbers at the same time. The more people you speak to, the higher your chance at making incentive."
good,Management and staff at Citibank were always available for assistance.
good,Working for Citi has provided me the opportunity to grow not just within the company but also branch out and do other things. I have learned a lot on information regarding what may or may not be done during an active bankruptcy when it comes to secured and unsecured loans. The management here is very eager to assist any agent with assistance for them to grow within the company.
good,je pense que professionneleent ce fut agreable.l'entreprise a une dualite adaptartive pour les bilingues ce qui permettait une culture de travail aderquater
good,taking many productive calls for supporting clients local and nationally; resolving production issues.
good,"typical day:  You clock in via signing into the computer, you typically have (depending on the department) 5-10 minutes to pull up all your tools that you will need for the day, read any emails, catch up on any alerts, etc.  Then you will start doing your job, either taking calls, working on email requests, reviewing credit applications, etc.  You'll get 2 15 minute breaks and a 30 minute lunch (unless you work 10 hour shifts, then you will get a 3rd 15 break as well)"
good,"Very Friendly environment, Multiculture... they offer a lot of activities to the employee.  Salaries are very low vis the amount of work done every day"
good,"- There are ample exciting challenges at the job to keep you motivated."
good,Job was how one would expect working a sales role for a large Corporation or Bank would be. Lots of meetings and reports to get out on daily/weekly basis. Overall was a decent job with good pay and benefits.
good,Citibank is an international institution which allows employees to learn different dynamics of banking.  Having the ability to work with lending and investment representative at my office helped me grow my knowledge daily.
good,As long as you adhere to your schedule and do your job they recognize that and reward it.  Job postings are done every day when available and you can apply from h
good,"A place to learn and grow, with ample opportunity for advancemwnt.  Citi could do more to own a bigger share of healthcare costs, which would mean greater relief for workers"
good,The work at Citi was boring as a fund accountant. Otherwise it was a low stress environment. Was later sold off. Being in Hedge funds was better treatment than in mutual funds.
good,"a good job with plenty of benefits and very friend people, also is very fast paced taking inbound and out bound calls very good managers and people at work are very enjoyable"
good,Una entidad muy establecida con oportunidades de aprendizaje y crecimiento personal
good,Citi offers an excellent work/Life balance and benefits plans to all employees.  Employees are able to work in a diverse group with different people.  Hardest part of the job; too many meetings which are not productive in many cases.  Most enjoyable part of the job is the people who work in the company.
good,"More than likely you'll work a year for a one dollar raise. They have opportunities to advance, however they're typically already filled, making it hard to actually advance."
good,"Citi is a relaxed atmosphere, competitive pay, paid time off, and incentives for doing your job well. Management is always eager to help and provide feedback."
good,"Being a teller at Citibank was good for networking and for potentially learning more about banking on a technical level. Citibank (and the rest of the banking industry) is going through a lot of changes, so it was hard to keep up sometimes. But they continue to strive to improve in the realms of technology, convenience and customer service."
good,"there really was no typical day, each day was challenging and eventful. The securities markets are face paced and rapidly changing"
good,"El trabajo era tranquilo y con buen ambiente, pero era temporario"
good,I've been working for Citi for about 4 years now. My goal when I got hired was to ultimately work my way up to the corporate operational side of the business. Its been a challenge because the career development at Citi is very poor.
good,"mi puesto era de asistente de director regional. interactuaba con la mayor parte de las áreas del banco y eso ayudó a que adquieriera conocimiento de como funcionan en cuanto a intereses job despription de los gerentes y  direct reports."
good,I am comfortable within Citi but fell that it is time for a new path.  Citi is a nice place to work though i feel that i am undervalued financially and it would take too long for me to reach my expectation both position and salary within a reasonable time frame.
good,"From what I understand every department (organization) differs - the department I work in is high-pace, chances happen so frequently you have to learn to adapt quickly or you won't last long."
good,"citi was a good place to work, great manager, fun events, easy to learn, easy work place. great team flow, there I learn to properly  collect on credit cards."
good,You make good money for what you do and no degree required. I have learned a lot working there. I no linger want to work weekends. Management is good.
good,"Pros: "
good,"I learned a skill I didn't think I had. To be able to speak infront of large groups. I helped my manager with showing others how to build confidence, and increase their production. I enjoyed my job a lot."
good,I worked for Citi from 2004-2012 throughout these 8 years it was a lot of transition. The company have layoffs but try and assist their employee's with work place enforcement and rehire eligibility in other departments.
good,"Experience Summary"
good,"Wonderful environment and learning experience. The work can be challenging dealing with customer problems, however Citi bank always lets you know that you are appreciated!"
good,"Management has provided me an independent work space and agreed and encouraged every work that I do."
good,"Management needs more experienced employees in there industry."
good,"buena empresa excelentes reconocimientos a el trabajo ,mucho compromiso y trabajo sobre presion"
good,"Citibank has a strong management team which keeps the staff motivated."
good,"A typical day within my current position is answering up to 100 phone calls per day. Making sure customer hang up with knowledge regarding what questions and concerns they may have had. Co-workers are what make the job so enjoyable, you are allowed to make sure everyone is covered with what questions they may have regarding work related questions. The hardest part of the job is you are sitting in one spot for the whole eight hours without being around people, the only people you get to communicate with are through instant messaging."
good,Working for Citibank has given me a broad span of knowledge in processing different portfolio's and learn how to operate different types of machinery. My co-workers were like family to me and I miss them terribly. Management has definately allowed me to broaden my horizons and allow me to grow. I think the hardest part was leaving Citibank after so many years being there. I will truly miss working there.
good,Phone work is not my thing. I'd rather work in the food service industry.
good,"Not stable to work for.  Numerous layoffs. very good with work life balance,  My manager was great but as layed off.  Upper management is not very supportive"
good,"I am an objective person that set daily goals. I like to do my multi-tasks with different methodologies everyday because I have I passion to continue learning. I enjoy making new solutions or new steps to achieve it. I like to work in a team because I can look at all points of view about a general situation. But, when I need to think about a specific situation, I prefer to put all my energy and concentration in it.  And, after I like to share my opinion. The hardest part of the job is that although I have communication skills sometimes making a balance of different opinions is hard. But when I can discover the best way to communicate or find an equal agreement, I can improve my tolerance skill."
good,If you're a restaurant guy.  Do not work executive dinning.  Just warning you
good,The typical work day was always exciting due to game we played and incentives that the company would allow during the working hours. Overall company tried to keep thing motivated for the employees but just was the right call center job for me due to unable to get my collection goals met per company requirements.
good,"My position provided me opportunity to work on several projects, which encouraged innovation and change.  Managing progress of projects following up on close deadlines was a daily operations.  Leading a team of entry level staff, and resolving questions on the floor as well as providing guidance coaching and encouragement to the team.  Learning the importance of listening and integrity because people count on you daily to help them.  My peers include Unit Managers such as myself who also manage several process and entry level employees.  Monitoring key performance indicators, metrics of the department to minimize any risk to our clients and business.  I really enjoyed being at the fore front of projects,  reviewing process and seeing how we can make it better and implementing changes that have lasting positive impacts to our team and clients."
good,They have a good training and installation facilities. job is stuff and the ruthless of the business is not for everyone
good,"A typical day on the job is communicating information to customers regarding their account. I've learned how to manuever through 10-15 screens of information at 1 time. How to inform customers about the status of their credi card accounts. How to direct them to the correct department suited to their needs. I.E., customer service, forbearance. My co workers are a very important part of the day because if I'm ever stumped on something they are right there to help if needed and vice versa. Management is close by to help if situations escelate and their assistance is needed. The hardest part of the job is to listen to very upset customers when they are yelling, cursing and you have to stay calm to de escalate the situation. But what I enjoy most is being able to help customers who are in financial distress to get them financially back on track."
good,I love working with the co workers that I have.. Also the best part of my day is when its busy because it allows to keep focus on my customers and the hardest part is when the business is slow.
good,"MY job was satisfied "
good,"My typical day at work included me speaking to my clients on regular basis, doing transactions, assisiting my relation ship managers and team to prepare for client meetings and handle any trade and daily banking transactions.I loved working and talking to people. I was more organised and alert at work. My co workers were fun and we used to try have lunch once a week together."
good,"credit risk is a very laid back and the the management is all cool. the work is steady and easy to learn. sometimes its slow then work picks up and it is non stop, loved it."
good,Called on passed due accounts. Setup payment on on loans accounts
good,"In my last work most of the type of client/costumers I have met, It was a very serious and typical type of work. I learned many things about my last job, I am now knowledgeable in handling costumers, dealing with them, greeting them in a best way and especially making their 100% satisfaction guaranteed. The management makes me to become more professional in my work. My co-workers respected me as one of the member of their family. We give support and advice to each other."
good,"working at citi was just okay. It did teach me to never get a credit card, because of the ridicoulous interest rates and late fees though."
good,I like working in a call center environment.the grams are very helpful. No day is typical and every call is different.
good,"Took inbound calls all day long to assist customers with their checking and savings accounts, CD accounts, and other types of accounts held with us."
good,was a great place to work with many benefits anf flex schedule if needed.
good,"Citibank cares for their workers , it is a call center environment so you do sit in front of a computer for hours with the same calls. But the overall experience was great . Love Citibank"
good,some days were fun some were not. Clients were in high demand of their needs. We had monthly goals to meet that weren't impossible but were challenging.
good,"Citbank has some great thinsg about it! Offers great benefits, rewards it's empolyees in various ways. However they do jot offer raises annually like they state they will and their bonus system is very hard to maneuver. Everyone is very kind, but no one offers much help to others on their team. Very micromanaged."
good,Since this was a stepping stone of life i would like to say I have learnt a lot in this organisation. Starting from team bonding to work enforcement system. Coping with the corporate terms. I can relate to my Montessori school where I always wanted a finger to hold on to  and walk through the process. Overall this was my career launch pad which gave me immense confidence in myself to face the world.
good,I've been gone from CITI for over 20 years. The company has changed names and management so many times I have no idea how it's being managed at present.
good,citi is a good company to work for.  The only issue is when the calls get slow or not being able to take a day off using your vacation time...........................................

I've learned alot about how credit cards and applications are looked at. Management changes very freq... The work place is quiet and confined. Hardest part of the job is learning the new systems.

good,"A typical day with Citibank involved researching and processing a high volume of checks that were not typical deposits for member accounts. I learned a lot about financial institutions and their process. Management was fabulous as well as the co-workers. The duties were fairly simple and repetitive, but I really enjoyed learning new things during my employment with that company."
good,"Advancement becomes really tough after a while. If you work on the phone part, then job is just tough."
good,My typical day at work is monitoring clients account and attending to their financial and other needs. I learned to build good relationships with internal as well as external clients to work together to get things completed accurately in a timely fashion. The hardest part of the job is some moment that can be critical in being completed and approaching cut off times. Most enjoyable part of the job taking satisfaction when client needs are met.
good,I have learned here many things.Receiving deliveries properly.The hardest part of this job is when there are too much deliveries and corrections.But also enjoyable because all employees work as a team.
good,Assist various companies with collection calls. I learned you have to be stern yet compassionate with collections.The hardest part is when situations are out of your control and you can do nothing at your level to assist customers but have to forward for upper management.

good,"There is always work to do but it seems that the the people who work alot faster and put our more production while maintaing quality scored above the requirement are not recognized as they should be. The folks who only come to play on the computer and do minimal work are not penalized and at the end of the day we are all a team. Other than the small management issue mentioned above, it's a great place to work. Diverse people from many cultures, great benefits, flexible work schedule depending on the manager and close to major highways."

Unfortunately, while I was still in my 6-week training time period, I was hospitalized for the first time in my life for nearly a week. During this time, I kept my manager/trainer informed of my circumstances and she seemed very understanding. However, when I returned to work the following Monday, my other trainer was very rude and not understanding at all of my situation. I had proof of my hospital stay and everything, yet he continued to treat me as if I were lying."
good,"lots of room for advancement"

Also I maintain structure as well as understand my team members. Making sure that all of my team members were very knowledgeable about the job as well as making sure they had daily assignments to complete projects.

The most enjoyable part of my job is customer service, I love all my clients and love the fact that I can help them and see them leave happy."
good,"Citigroup / Citibank was a great place to work over many years. Often requiring extended hours and working on intense high visibility projects. Management, though not on a technological knowledge par with the staff, did recognize and reward accordingly for the successful project completion and supporting of the business."
good,"The compensation and raises are good.  Like with any job, be prepared for work/life balance to suffer a little if you're looking for advancement.  Citi is very big so there's a lot of opportunity."
good,I do not wish to type about my time at Citi. If someone has a Question I would be happy to talk about it in person. I worked 40 hrs a week 10 hrs a day
good,"Citi Residential Lending was created as a result of the great recession and acquisition of Ameriquest Mortgage assets. "
good,not provided - no disclosure - no information to provide this is not any opinion or any information that is not publicly known - I do not reflect any opinion
good,I found this job to be stressful and not trained effectively. I felt they cared more about sales and collections than they did the customer. I do believe they provide good benefits and the gym on site was nice too.
good,This is an excellent company to work for as long as you come into the company on a good team and under good management. WLB is very important to certain managers but not others. Culture of the company also depends on the group you are in.
good,I have learned how to deal with different type of people.How to achieve the given targets.
good,"teller it speaks for it self, Loved my co-workers and the customers was so loving"
good,"Citi is a good place to work. I worked there for 5 years 4months. And I really liked working there. "
good,We came in early before anyone was in. It was a quick and easy way to make money when I first started working. It helped me to learn skills I'd need for later jobs.
good,A typical day at Citi can be stressful sometimes because you're more so prompted to sell and make referrals. There's not a lot of people advancing especially if you start off as a teller.
good,Citi is a good place to work they are closing their Mortgage Departments down. It is in the process of selling their Mortgage portfolio to Cenlar. Our Management team was not good in Irving Texas they showed favoritism it was just a mess. However in the other departments (not mortgage) other associates of Citi loved they're job. It was just in the Mortgage division of Citi.
good,"I love to work for citi, because of the relashioships i have built over the year and also the benefits they provide; However, there is a lot of favoritism when it comes to managers delegating work and there is no stability as they are always restructuring departments."
good,"Unable to retain leadership.  extensive turnover.  Due tot he instability of our leadership, we lost many highly qualified professionals.  Absolutely no work-life balance. Position monopolizes your life."
good,"The set schedule in branches is great with the typical ""banking hours"" although add on Saturdays and call nights every week brings the hours to about 50 per week, along with high sales pressure with extremely high goals with very low payout for surpassing goals. The actual branch employees in the area are amazing and great work culture within the branch; but upper management has terrible leadership qualities."
good,its a good company but they need to  get rid of their outsourcing they send to many jobs overseas and the ones who they outsource to here are very unprofessional
good,"Great people to work with, professional, although stressful, environment. Felt like part of a team and that the work was important. Teamwork and collaboration high. The problem is that a lot of work is moved to low cost centers and the compensation can be below market in some areas, roles."
good,I just think the move of this department made those of us stuck there feel over worked and under appreciated. They were not allowing paid time to go through due to all the overtime and not showing any compassion for the workers whose whole lives were turned upside down.
good,"A very boring job.Sit at a desk all day on the phone listening to ,and trying to help people. it gets very discouraging at times. Every once in a whilewhen you are able to help someone, it does feel good."
good,"A typical day is that you do your job and if not up to par you will most likely be micromanaged until you improve."
good,"A typical day at work was very busy.  I learned a lot about its command operational center IT systems.  Management was insensitive to employees needs.  Many managers left the company when I started and others were talking about leaving too.  Workplace culture was filled with deadlines and pressure.  Many got sick because of this culture.  The hardest part of the job was sitting for 12-hour shifts, enable to take restroom breaks, etc.  The most enjoyable part of the job was actually doing the job itself."
good,Valoración bastante positiva aunque mejorable como en todos los casos y también por la mía como es lógico
good,"here i work as a team leader and my job is to lead the team to his\her work...This is the person who is ultimately responsible for the overall performance and budget of the centre. They will make decisions regarding the people, the process, the technology and the customers that are part of the call centre and the future strategy and development of the centre. The Centre Manager is usually the person who liaises with other departments such as HR and IT, and if it is a sales centre, then typically this will be Sales or Marketing departments."
good,I would work where ever my temp agency manager would assign me to. The hardest part of my job would be that i was not included in company activities and i was not allowed to be recognized by managers.
good,Co-workers call me for direction and management does not have knowledge of mortgages
good,"Good training opportunities, Poor personal relations bysr management"
good,"The work starts at 9:30 and that's when you trigger yourself with clients calling up along with the previous day's files to be submitted to operations team for further processing. Then it continues with instructions from clients via Fax or Post. This includes funds transfers, account opening, assigning nominees, demographic updates, repatriation of funds, closure and many more."
good,The people whom I worked side-by-side with were the greatest. The management just lost track of the fact that we were people and not just a body to keep their stats up.
good,El trabajo era muy bueno pero un tanto estresante porque después de muchos esfuerzos para hacer una refinanciacion no la admitían o les falta algo
good,"Citi is not a bad company to work at if you land in a department where the management got chosen due to their experience on that field and not due to the fact that they've been there for 25 yrs and they know the upper management and they know that even if they mess up everything they got their back covered. Inwas the unfortunate one to land in the wrong dept. No advancement after 6 yrs being a senior in my position as always the managers pets got promoted, sometimes twice/year with a raise. In my case they expected more and more and paid me less and less. Basly corrupt management in that department."
good,"it was not a bad place to work - my direct team were great and my direct manager was hand on."
good,"Citi lacks consistency. You will change managers, shifts, and seats a ton of times. I’ve only been here for 7 months and I’ve moved 3 times and changed managers twice. And I’m about to have a third shift change. Citi needs to be more organized."
good,Productive and fun place with a ping pong table. You can move up or to other departments but be aware that the company policies and your performance may limit advancement
good,They are amazing people that work there just the targets are sometime a little crazy and what they ask you to pass is not like any other call center even open on most holidays
good,"Uma empresa intensa, com seus processos voltados a desempenho e metas."
good,This  company work with temp agencies to define the people that they place within there company. This leaves a lot of gray area for the company. Working for this company has it advantages and disadvantages.
good,"There was no formal training or official explanation of how to perform your job function.  In the 4 years that I was there I never met a person that ever received any formal training when they were first hired.  Everything is hands on learning by trial and error.  There is no effort made to document what is expected of you.  At some point you receive your first evaluation and that is when you finally are told how your performance measures up to their expectations.  There is a VERY diverse culture that is very present and visible in Citi, however I saw no effort made to invest in training new employees so that you can get the maximum worth of what they are able to contribute to the business as a whole.     The benefits are great, the facilities and the employees are great also, it's just getting yourself to that place where you personally can feel like you have arrived and are doing what you came to do."
good,"It has given me a chance to experience what it was like to work in a diverse multi-culture company. The salary was not enough and they have long hours. Medical benefits are great too but we most of the time render 10 to 12 hours at work. But aside from that, I have learned discipline and good work ethics."
good,"Work culture is good and environement."
good,"In the morning , we have a huddle and speak about productivity from the previous day and speak on referral and goals , My manager don't  really give me support , I need some guidance and someone who will push me in the right direction, she more into who she like more and conversation with them about personal life instead of sharing knowledge , the hardest part is coming in to work everyday and doing the same thing and no new tasks ."
good,"N/A do not feel comfortable furnishing at this time due to current employment and situation."
good,"I think it could be better, for the work you performed, we need have more increments per year.  the company is good but the people at that time 2015 were suffering long hours and low payment"
good,constantly changing shifts without care to employees and no time to work out other options for your family no compromises. and never awards for performance only based on  who you know.
good,"I was hired to take calls , i worked there for a period of about 6 months, led  Best Buy customer service as number 1 rep the whole time. applied for CEM team and was told I interviewed to good and was denied the position. was told I interviewed and answer questions as i was looking for upper management position."
good,"Good people but corp culture taking over everywhere I guess... every year they give you less and less, salaries are at a standstill and bonus' are becoming obsolete."
good,"As an Account Executive at CitiFinancial, it was a good work environment, but not a lot of room for advancement. I loved working directly with our customers in person for personal loans, home loans and working the cash drawer."
good,"People are generally very nice and open minded."
good,Need more opportunities for internal advancement. Citi tends to promote or hire from the outside than promote internal candidates
good,"My first bank job and so far so good!"
good,"Citi is a great place to work except for the fact that once you are in customer service, it is hard to leave the department or even the position. I have my degree in business administration and am not able to us it to further my career within the bank."
good,"Overall the company is good, and opportunities are immense. For the workoholics, there is no end to work. You need the right boss to recognize your efforts and direct your energy correctly to ensure the growth."
good,"The top level management have vision that needs to be translated into da-to-day goals by the middle layer of managers. Many organizations suffer here due to incorrect choice of candidates. This co is no exception to it. When the immediate manager does worry about the amount of time the subordinates have to give to support international teams, then lower layer suffers."
good,"Citi provided me a wonderful start to my career. It proved to be full of opportunities as I advanced into mid-level management learning several different skills and functions during my tenure. My position called for long hours, but showed great results and acknowledgment. Outside of truly enjoying my job, the most enjoyable part of working at Citi is the number of great people that I had a chance to work with over the years and learn from."
good,Good company to work for room for advancement. Work life balance can be stressful at times. The layers of procedures can at times be  a challenge to getting  your  work completed. There is room for improvement.
good,"With this experience i would set personal goals for myself. Push myself to the limit, go above and beyond. I'm an over achiever and like to set the bar high."
good,"I helped customers with deposits and withdrawals on accounts.  Cashed checks, and balenced customer checkbooks."
good,"I was able to work all systems at Citi and was part of many pilot programs. In the end I was providing customer service for bank questions, debit card issues, home equity information, internet banking technical support, bill payment issues, check orders, foreign currency, credit & debit card information. Most of my co-workers were younger than myself, but were fun to work with. The hardest part of the job was staying on script when you working with our customers on difficult problems. The facility was a good place to work and most of the supervisors were helpful."
good,Cit was a good company to work for; the office manager for the branch was very unprofessional.  Created a harsh work environment.
good,Citicards was a great place of employment. The benefits were awesome.  I enjoyed the training that this job afforded me.
good,"•	Greet parents and created a safe environment for children "
good,"a typical day at work consisted of quite a few tasks from customer service, client follow ups, new bsuiness accout opening, daily sales spread sheets, daliy confrence calls, client meetings, expanding clients product portfolio, and the every day operations functions of the bank."
good,like doing what I did there. liked working with the people in the office liked the office manager.
good,"With the agile transformation implementation, everyday there is something new to learn which is interesting. "
good,"Your average collections job. Call people, get yelled at, leave messages, the whole deal. Nothing good or bad to say about my time here."
good,It was a good internship.  Staff and brokers were supportive.
good,"I come in to work clock in, inspect my forklift, feel out a inspection sheet, warm the forklift up and them wait for my supervisor to let me know what container to unload. Sometime 2-3 containers at a time. I learned how to commuinate with the lamper that was assign to me. Treat them all equal. The hardest part was in summer when its was hot the lamper that was assign to me slow down at lot and production was not getting done. So I would always have water ready. The most enjoyable part of my job was when the day was over I would see if I did more then I planed to do. And if I did that was a good day."
good,Printed credit card bills and credit denial letters. stacked the print outs in the proper area
good,"I had a great time working here until I switched departments. When that happened, management went down the drain. I was on a team with a manager who did not do her own job well, so took it out on the rest of us, to the point where she accused me of detrimental to the company ( hanging up on someone)."
good,Great Company to work for. Do not feel comfortable writing about the company.
good,"Reviewed measurable campaigns, Designed new campaigns and ideas. Reviewed all POP material and mailings. Revised uncollectables and tracked new business."
good,I was working as teller at Citibank.
good,Modern office design with sufficient supply of office equipment.
good,Permite um desenvolvimento pessoal e crescimento profissional
good,"I had pleasant interview experience but what came after in the open space as an AML Analyst was barely acceptable: I'll never work with Poles again in my life. They cannot communicate, always complain, never do anything about it to improve the situation, take no risks, are grumpy, jalleous, mean, unresponsive, talking off-topic, god, terrible co-workers. Plus, the company pays such peanuts, that it literally becomes a waste of your life."
good,"The company is consistently growing and evolving. With the focus on diversity, it looks at employee acknowledgement and acceptance of differences, as led by senior managers. The company is constantly developing although the level of technical improvements will take time to reach smaller divisions of the company, due to costs."
good,Citi has a strong executive presence and the ability to create positive impressions with C-suite executives through many channels of communication and engagement. High on thought leadership.
good,"I enjoyed working at Citi. I worked in collections, so wasn't over the moon about it, but if I was in another department I fell like I could have enjoyed it more. My downfall was that my manager was unwilling to help me with getting FMLA when I became pregnant and had a minor case of hyperemesis, but I have heard that said manager has retired. I would love to work there again though."
good,Good place to work overall. There are opportunities to advance in some groups within Citi and a wide variety of jobs to take advantage of various talent and experience levels.
good,"Really enjoyed working at Citi for close to 3 years. You are recognized when you do well and feel appreciated. There is lots of training and you are constantly learning. They talk a lot about promoting and career advancement, but it NEVER actually happens. You work hard and if you meet the impossible sales goals consistently,  suddenly now your goal is doubled.... Not only is your goal doubled, but also commission pay out is less and less every year. You are told that in order to get promoted, you have to be a ""High achiever"", but all that really gets you is a higher goal.... which i figured is normal in most banks."
good,"Job is not guaranteed but it's easy work. Management doesn't involved themselves with the workers, only cares about numbers. Work is simple, you can more to different areas to gain more experience."
good,"repetitive workload and fairly enjoyable, good colleagues. long hours and ungrateful management,"
good,"The job is dynamic and demanding, which makes it very interesting. As part of the big organisation, you always have opportunities, it's all about making connections."
good,"Data Governance area is busy and could involve long hours. Work culture generally is good, but Citi overall has changed over the years. Not Citi but the people can sometimes demonstrate lack of empathy toward their work partners."
good,"A good place to learn numerous enterprise technologies and gain exposure to numerous lines of business. It is a very large company reaching a world wide audience, providing international opportunity to those seeking them."
good,Gained valuable experience.  Depends strongly on your manager/team.  Enjoyed the team and had adequate work/life balance - workload went through cycles of ups and downs.
good,"A good place to work at. Managed to learn a lot things related to the job as well as to management skills. Location of the office in very near to an LRT station, hence makes it easier to travel to and from."
good,I loved working there but didn't like the way things were handled with the layoffs. its like they didn't care at all for their employees. like 12 years was nothing and I do think that we were treated very unfairly
good,fue un trabajo free lance por lo tanto era impersonal buena supervisora
good,I was in the HRIS department.  That location also was closed.  Citi is a fast paste company.  I also learned a lot from there.  It was very easy for me to get another job after that.
good,"Overall CITI is a good place to work, but the various lines of business and teams will dictate the culture and much of the experience. If you chose to work for CITI, make sure you find a great leader."
good,this job is all about the money. my personal boss is no good but many others are great. there is no open advancement in my current position. i am looking for a better work life balance where i am not doing repetitive tasks and am challenged.
good,"No work pressure,  good place to work"
good,"New building with views from the 39th and 40th floors."
good,"It was great to work at citi except the pay. "
good,Good company but not much room for advancement. You have to be top of your department to even have a shot and that’s all based on the quality of customers you get to talk to. You have a bad month or two of irate customers calling in and you might even lose your job
good,"You will have the change to work  in complex projets and with a multicultural team."
good,"Stressful, rewarding, but lack of communication and ability to move upward in career are definite possibilities when working here.  Environment is great, benefits are there, however the ability to feel proud of the work you have done is sometimes a distant idea/dream."
good,The company is well organized and provides reasonable compensation. The ability to move throughout the company is a bonus and the jobs are well defined.
good,"Well balance work schedule for there employees, work every weekend with three days of during the week. Management are always available to help when needed."
good,"CITI is a great place to work in terms of pay, benefits and additional discounts. However it is also stressful and made more so by management that is hard to work with. When you find yourself avoiding doing duties as to avoid interaction with your supervisor and instead contact other supervisors it is a hindrance to doing your job."
good,"Citi Private Bank is a highly competitive environment. Management tries to instill a ""Team Culture"" but most of the times, that does not happen. Compensation is a little below market and hour of work are long. The bank has become too attached to regulations and lending has become more of a clerical work with no deep credit skills. Most of the times loans get delayed because someone with no credit experience sees a discrepancy in the ECOA dates, etc. So bureaucrats are taking over the lending process and have no skills or knowledge to manage the credit process."
good,Overall a good company if you are looking for money. Helps you build your career into fruitful one if you are joining at a mid managerial level. Check for work life balance.
good,A lot of valuable learning. Strong process makes you focus on your core job. Management was good but not very approachable. Work was almost 7 days a week but the friendly work place ensured you don't miss home.
good,hardest part of this job is when you have to man a booth in specific mall because i'm not into mall when it comes to work. but it's all worth it in different aspect of handling this job eapecially my colleagues here.
good,Networking at Citi is great because there are a lot of meetings and opportunities to meet mentors. Management cares about their staff. Work itself is stressful because you have to reach the sales goals.
good,Layoff happen a lot (when it was citifinancial) sold to springleaf. another lay off. good benefits and time off but you can not use your time without being reprimanded
good,"As an Operation Manager, I enjoy working with my peers and the people who report to me. I have moved up 2 levels in my first three years at Citi. If you're aggressive, you can move up to the level you are comfortable with."
good,Fun place to work but job advancement is not easy. The job can be very boring. My coworkers are very nice and easy to work with.
good,"Face paced, information overload if that's your style. Plenty of room for growth. Team work is highly valued. Policies sometime change with out proper notice."
good,"Travail intérimaire, environnement agréable,"
good,"I cannot put in any information here. I do not want to disclose unnecessary information anywhere.  "
good,"Not a bad place but I would recommend better computer systems. Other than that, I wish you luck if you decide to work here."
good,excellent work experience.  Should have more time to study for exams.  But worked to keep the business going.  Work environment was always exciting and great clients to keep in touch with.
good,"Ambiente agradavel, limpo e organizado."
good,"Rotina constante, tendo as mesmas tarefas todos os dias. Aprendi a manter controles das atividades, e conheci o mercado financeiro. A parte mais difícil era ter que fazer dois turnos em um só, e a mais agradável foi ter oportunidade de apresentar um projeto que viabilizou a melhora na entrega diária de informações, facilitando a execução da tarefa e minimizando retrabalho."
good,"Overall not a bad company.  "
good,Promotions are most often done through personal relation  and diversity quotas than performance. Bonus levels constantly being reduced
good,"Great place to work, however, not a lot of room for advancement. "
good,"I joined this company with the intention that I will learn one new thing everyday and I managed to do so. The best thing about the work I am in right now is that everything is happening in real time. Moreover, the management and the co-workers are very supportive."
good,"Working at Citigroup is fun and it get tedious during release. got to learn new technologies."
good,"Responsible for coordinating the activities of project team members, Operations and IT, and Risk project team members, end-users and IT. Responsibilities include project planning, budgeting, status reporting, issue and risk management, reviewing the reasonableness of project success criteria. Enjoyed working with people located in different parts of the world and multiple time zones."
good,The job itself wasn't bad.  The benefits were non-existent due to the high prices they carried.  Company was good to the employees and had an outstanding attendance policy.
good,System issues which cannot be changed unless mentors of senior management sign off on all issues
good,I found working at Citibank quite an experience in the world of business and finance which strongly contributed to me pursuing my business degree.
good,Ecount Inc was acquired in 2007 by Citi Bank and renamed Citi Prepaid Services. The business prospered in the prepaid card market and is now in the process of identifying synergies within the larger Citi family.
good,"good place to start not like other banks.  while you work one-on-one with our customers, you’ll have the support of great supervisors who are available whenever you need them, not to mention lots of training to keep you up-to-date and help you further your career. You’ll work side-by-side with industry experts who can help you thrive in a fast-paced, yet highly collaborative environment by challenging you to learn more and voice your input every day."
good,I am unable to write a review due to a non-disclosure clause in my separation agreement.
good,Good work culture and HR policies. Liberal environment. Growth opportunities are ample but take time.
good,Extremely Dynamic and fast paced environment May need to work extra hours and also during week ends
good,"A large pipeline and  very fast paced."
good,"Worked with some wonderful people."
good,The hardest part of the job was trying to fit in with the staff. They all had their little clicks and it took quite a while to fit in.
good,"Review loan documents and determine best mortgage product for client. Most important thing I learned is how to read a credit report. Although lending environment has changed a great deal since. I left with general knowledge of lending requirements for residential mortgages. The company put a great deal of focus on hiring from with in. Management was very clicky and at times unprofessional. Staff demographics were college graduate to mid 20s. Small percentage that may have been over the age of 40. Made for a fun environment to work in."
good,"Working in the Citibank AML dept. has definitely been very convenient in regards to the flexibility my dept/manager has given me. I am able to work from home three times a week, which is very convenient being a single mother. "
good,Working at this company was great when it came to great benefits.
good,"it a good learning experience, with excellent experience staff, management is not giving any salary increment, and coulee's are highly experience it great to learn new format, I every joy able time and good to give hard work to achieved the given target."
good,A typical day at work when all odd has been overcome facing a particular project.
good,"Good job environment, help banks to set up printers, installed new software, add new accounts etc."
good,I worked in many different departments at Citi the last being Primerica. I was able to take inbound calls and help people with their IRA accounts.
good,"Production was very day to day. Sometimes we would have work to process some days we wouldn't. Tried many times to move up within the company, but was always overlooked do to not being in with the right clique."
good,"Stressful Stressful Stressful Stressful Stressful Stressful Stressful StressfulStressful Stressful Stressful. The most stressful job ive ever had. The changes were ridiculous and personally unethical at times, made me cut up my credit cards. However it taught me how to manage money and wisely use credit cards"
good,I enjoyed all I learned and was even promoted during my time here. The turnover for managers was very high. Higher than employee subordinate turnover-which was shocking.
good,I worked there as a temp for about 2 years. I learned how to capture checks in a machine.
good,"The peers at Citi were great to work with, as there was a great cohesion of the workforce at the 'worker' level. But, the upper management in NY still keeps their Good Ol Boys protection at hand. Lots of workers have been let go, in order to fund the hiring of a few Senior Exec buddies from their prior companies that do not actually DO THE JOB. Directors Direct, and Workers WORK. Citi needs to lose a whole lot of the Senior Executives and get back to the job of hiring people that can actually get the job done."
good,This was an excellent organization to work with. However there was a revolving door at the executive level.
good,"It's a great company to work at. Lots of learning opportunities."
good,"Due to the amount of regulation large banks such as Citi have to comply with, there are significant amounts of structure and reporting period secondly, there is little tolerance for being over budget or being late period this results and many long hours, especially at the beginning of the fiscal year."
good,"•	Supported the business with MSR (Mortgage Servicing Rights) transfer of loans to new servicers."
good,A good learning place. the management try to show equal opportunities and give every staff equal chance. a lot to be learnt from working with Citi bank
good,"Acquired experience in leading as a sells person as well as supervising and great customer service experience."
good,"If you like a changing work place, Citi is definitely it. It's a good place to work, I work in a phone heavy department so we don't always get to attend many of the functions that Citi puts on. They are very community driven. The work can be challenging at times but you make it through."
good,"Citi has been a great company to work for but they have been changing their internal ways of business for the last year.  They are not as worker-oriented as they use to be and it is probably going to affect their products and services.  Upper management is looking to make big changes and a lot of workers and members do not feel that they are good for it's shareholders, employees, and future."
good,The entire floor is filled with cubicles. The Tampa HUB is massive. The atmosphere is very corporate America and not much interaction between employees.
good,"Banking at the time was my ultimate goal. "
good,"The opinion of my direct manager and the individuals I work with day to day in my job location have totally different opinions of my work. "
good,"as per early morning shift, and for night shift."
good,Good remunerations and great work culture. Lots of learning opportunities as it is a global company. Opportunities for internal  movements and even global movements are also given
good,"Citi was a good enough company to work for.  I learned a lot over seven years and I appreciate that. I had some very cool opportunities and took advantage of them and that really helped grow my skill set. Citibank is like any other corporate America company. When it benefits them they want it done right now, but when it benefits you they their sweet time.  Some of the management I worked for was absolutely fantastic. They really wanted to build their employees and they were there for their employees. However, there was some really bad management and they seem to never get let go. I saw a lot of examples of nepotism through friendly relationships."
good,"Overall good place to work and grow, very good training on service and sales. Lots of movement with management and regionals managers. Compensation could be reviewed to be more in line with competitors"
good,Deadline driven job that was faced paced.  When having to work overtime they brought in food for the employees.  Very competitive group working towards production goals each month.  Strong team environment.
good,"Depends on the department you are with some are great but others are overly managed. Work life balance goes out the window and it can be very stressful. I have been with Citi over 10yrs there used to be lots of opportunities for advancement but they keep selling off and laying off. It's changed, not so family friendly or employee focused at my building at least anymore."
good,Citi IT Program Management is a culture of leading global programs across the Globe.  At Citi the cultures provides the opportunity for significant matrix management and collaboration across the organization. The Program Management office is an award winning team driving programs in the digital and ATM Security space.  The management team of the organization is forward thinking as expressed in the program management leadership.  Citi pursues diligently new technologies which sets us apart as the leader in the industry.
good,"Training is easy enough to get through but the workplace can become very monotonous. In customer service it's back to back calls most of the time. If you can handle that you'll do great. There's not a ton of room for growth, there is a type of glass ceiling working on the phones. Pay and benefits are fair but you have to weigh for yourself if that is worth it for you. Management can be tough depending whose team you're on and metrics are number one priority. Very competitive."
good,"Over 17 years there were good years with bonuses, comp days, etc., and there were bad years with 5am wake-up calls and 15 hour days for a 3% raise. Management was a mixed bag, some clueless, some wonderful leaders."
good,They hire people when its busy and layoff the minute its slow. No real job security. Most employees don't like it there but are content to just have a job.
good,"As a customer service agent, I Citi took care a customers needs during inbound calls, suggested different products to meet the customers needs, among many other things. I truly loved my job at Citi until they changed my manager. Most of the managers at Citi are wonderful but their are some that feel that it is ok to push you by constantly threatening your job. Then when you ask what you can do better you are told ""nothing, keep doing what you are doing."" It makes the work environment very stressful. It seems that you are expected to conform and the supervisors and treat you haw they want. Makes for a hostile work environment."
good,Is a very good company to work for now that I’m established with my moving looking forward to joining back at work as soon opportunity will comes available.
good,"A days worth of work its all about the getting the number in. So much talk about Quality being important but in the end, its all about the number. How many have you done? Why? Etc."
good,"Interesting work, good pay and benefits but no job security or stability. good culture, worh from home on Fridays hardest part of job, no security, not good"
good,"It was a good job, nice work environment, co workers were very cooperative, overtime was offered. It made my happy"
good,Citi was very fast paced and your typical work day was the same everyday. I learned the banking side working for Citi. The management was fair. The workplace culture was good. The hardest part of the job is being changed to another shift or department and speaking to customers who just are not able to pay their bill due to the recession. The most enjoyable part was speaking to the public and be able to help them.
good,"Advancement within the organization is non-existant unless you are in the clique with the management."
good,"I have worked in more than two corporate locations for Citi.  The first location was totally unprofessional and nepotism is very high.  They will not promote you no matter what skills you have - because they want it for themselves or their friends (who probably aren't qualified.)"
good,"Is BAU, normal hours, 1 hour lunch between 12 to 2, working as a teams sometimes because most part of the teams work remotely, however persons like me with the strong responsibility skills work remotely is painful because its hard to stop my day"
good,Productive and complicated at the same time. Four loan were the daily requirement. Each loan would have to be put into the system as a working loan all data collected and cleared for the title company and all additional step to keep the title company informed through e-mail of any unusual activity that may take place. Follow through about 100 steps to sending on UPS. Then get the next Loan on the way.
good,"Good place to work, like not being on the phones and vey fast paced. was trained in many different areas wish they didn't move our department to another state"
good,Typical day as a front end collector is to make sure you are ready to log in to the dialer to get in contact with customers immediately to bring their accounts current.
good,La Citibank est une école pour celui qui veut faire une carrière professionnelle.
good,"Company no longer operates locally, but at the time this was a fun place to work.  There was a lot of challenging things to do within the IT role; where one can not be silo'd and touch all aspects of operation."
good,"Spearheaded the management of foreign and domestic currency from Miami, Houston, The Bahamas and several other countries"
good,Good company and excellent reputation with a lot of learning opportunities. I had enjoyed working at Citi as it is the one of the best companies in the US.
good,"Very easy. As a security guard there was very little you really had to work on. It can be busy depending on your shift, but for most of the time you are sitting down twiddling your thumbs. Management can be a bit difficult, and breaths down your neck."
good,"Cti in general is a nice place to work with.  Most importantly you must be able to work with good boss and team workers."
good,Fun experience. Learn from your position as well as from other managers within the company. Learn how to work with high end clients. Make long term relationships that will benefit you in the future.
good,"No work and life balance, this job is too stressful but it also depends on the location. not all areas are the same. "
good,Citi bank is a great company to work for as they value their employees and family. However mortgage division is like an island unto itself totally different culture very stressful.
good,Typical fast past working environment were you are responsible for your job and everyone else's. They do not care if the timeline is delayed due to your actions or others in the project group. Get ready to have your hands in on everything.
good,"new CCO is changing compliance in a bad way"
good,"Citi was a great foundation. I would have loved to been there longer if there had not been a lay off."
good,This was a good company who consistently rewarded its employees with recognition and promoted growth opportunities to work within the community on various projects.
good,some people don't speak it does not feel like a family. We spend more time at work then home with our families a hello and good night is simple and free
good,"I thoroughly enjoyed working at Citi, but they were downsizing in the area I worked and moving jobs to Tampa.  Great people to work with and enjoyed the camaraderie."
good,"New hires are given HMO benefits right away with high max limit. Rice allowance is also provided. Great Sales Head, HR really taking time to look into the concerns of employees. Employees can escalate issues."
good,"Scan thousands of emails. Action one that were pertinent to me or our group, and start working on tasks scheduled for the day. Review Service Now tickets, and change controls. Ensure off shore SA doing tasks assigned to them."
good,Pay was not the current average for the job description but felt secure with a bank backing for the mortgage department until they decided to close the department..
good,"Citi does a lot of things REALLY well.   In my experience,  they make you feel welcomed, they try to keep employee morale and satisfaction stable if not on the rise and and least up to the direct supervisor level, seem to really care about you.  They have a robust benefits package and an on site cafeteria (which is not too bad for the price). The gripe I have is on the salary and lack of advancement opportunities."
good,Very competitive environment where people learn a lot due to the high tech and platforms used. Overall a great place to work! You need to be fast and be ready for the constant changes.
good,Lots of skill set to learn with advance technologies and also management in citi. Citi network is very wide so lots of options to grow in citibank environment.
good,hard place to work was stressful.  I wouldn't recommend it to a friend or family member. hours are horrible to begin with and always someone micromanaging  you
good,"I like my schedule, working four days a week, ten hour shifts. they have more schedules than that. I like the fact that it is laid back, and I am not being micromanaged."
good,Being that I was accepted to the work from home team was cool. The change in managers was not cool especially when we had supervisors that didn't understand the remote processes.It could make our day very long.
good,the rules and policies are not consistent. They don't support their employees when being disrespected but belligerent customers. there is a lack of overall communication among managers
good,"Productive place to work and many opportunities to growing up. Directed to provide excellent customer service, busy branches and different duties everyday to get the goals."
good,Some locations are better then others but overall met some nice people who made Citi a nice place to work for.  Really high net worth customer driven organization.
good,"In short and simple way:"
good,"Good place to work, but low on advancement opportunities.  Provides a good work/life balance as many work from home opportunities.  Good health care benefits."
good,"Excellent training, excellent benefits, good pay. A great place to work if you don't mind taking 130 angry calls a day. Not much room for advancement. If you're sick they don't care,  they'd rather you be half dead and infect everyone else than take a day off."
good,i like  a job where you are able to do different task. In this job you come in everyday to do the same thing everyday no change in the things you do. which i did not like
good,"Very positive working environment around colleagues and management. Also, there are a lot of sources to learn a new thing everyday. The working hours are also very convenient for the employees."
good,"A  corretora era terceirizada, com isso não tínhamos as mesmas oportunidades para os efetivos."
good,My experience at Citibank was an integral part of my growth in banking.  The fundamentals learned in my time there are invaluable. I left to pursue further growth.
good,"If you're less than management, you're a faceless drone bee. Once you're management, you're given a basic level of respect. There is no way to survive or advance once you're given what sounds like an innocous review called a Performance Improvement Plan. If you're given one, you can NEVER transfer within the conpany, even if you improve."
good,Citi is a huge organization with all the issues and benefits a huge organization has. If you manage to be lucky to be under a managing director with good knowledge of the business Citi will provide you the tools necessary to succeed and advance
good,Citi is a great company to work for. They reward their employees and make it fun to come to work. I dont have one bad thing to say about this company.
good,"I worked for Citi as a personal banker / business banker, and I learned a lot. at Citi everyone will have access to massive database of resources to advance his/her career and to know how to do the job properly."
good,"The life and work balance was great. Great benefits, culture, and lots of growth before the layoffs started. After the mortgage crisis Citi sold a lot of it pro-folio so everyone is just waiting for their numbr to be called so the moral is low."
good,Enjoyed my time and opportunity to work for Citibank.  I was a consumer banker with strict sales goals.  Sometimes goals were hard to attain but overall it is a good entry level job.  I didn't find too much room for advancement that's why I left.
good,I learned there are many ways to launder money and even more ways to catch it! My contribution makes a difference not only for the company but for our wonderful Country.
good,Great company to work for.  You are able to move up the ranks if you consistently work hard.  Company matches up to 6% towards your 401k.  Citi provides effective training methods to help you maximize productivity.
good,job was fun but is no longer in Business. the management team was always willing to teach you and to  push you to learn more........
good,Gostei muito de trabalhar. Tinha um horário flexível. O banco oferece   condições boa de trabalho. Com métodos que funcionam para que o trabalho seja feito.
good,Manage your own bucket of cases per month or on a rolling deadline depending on which area you work in and work at your own pace with a flexible schedule
good,Management created a hostile environment DM condoned treatment other Branches managed staff much different I have never worked in an environment like this before.  However Citigroup is a great employer
good,Citi has great technology and a great work / life balance. One of the perks is working remote and the opportunity to choose leaving the NY metro area for Texas or Florida for IT staff. The Bank is a global power house and the services provided to the public are first rate.
good,They require Managers to work too many hours where a typical work week can be from 47 to 55 hours ( salary employees).  The hardest part of the job was to get quality training that was validated. Being that it was all virtual training you could never gauge if you truly got the concept...
good,"This is a nice place to work.  However, metrics must be met and some are unattainable.  Management is aware that they are unattainable but yet employees are still driven to meet them.  Given a consistently strong rating for previous 5 years. Last performance appraisal given a rating of above average.  Pay is very good. benefits are very good.  Managers are nice and relatable.  There is opportunity for advancement in other areas besides in my state.  Work/life balance is very good.  Managers are willing to work with helping you find a work life balance that works for you."
good,Here the pros would be a good work life balance but lack of growth advancement becomes one of the cons which employees face.
good,"El manejo de una miniagencia bancaria, donde se atendia desde transacciones financieras, reclamos y hasta la aprobación de lineas de crédito te convierte en un multi-tarea. Y en realidad me sirvio mucho para el manejo de la presión y la atención del cliente interno y externo."
good,"es una empresa donde te haces con la practica, realizando cursos virtuales, donde debes demostrar habilidades en el idioma ingles para la realizacion de algunos cursos. es una escuela completa, porque creces como persona, te haces mas responsale y te mides a ti mismo hasta donde puedes llegar, ya que es una empresa que se trabaja bajo presion y constantemente vive cambiando metas y politicas. Me ayudo a aprender a adaptarme facil a los cambios"
good,your experiences as a teller would be dependent on your location and the amount of client your branch receives per day. in a crowed citi like new york most indiviuals may argue that this company provided little to no room for work like balance
good,The credit card division I worked for no longer exists in Canada. I'm not sure of the fate of the commercial credit card line of business in this country.
good,I appreciate the experience and the training that was provided in order to complete my job duties. Management and other analyst working were very friendly and helpful.
good,"Very Cooperative staff, Flexible work schedule. Convenient  work  location."
good,I enjoyed my time with Citi Bank just wish they would have payed a little more money. I enjoyed the people I worked with at Citi.
good,"client facing, relationship building, best part of the job is interacting with clients. Hardest part is not having a more client friendly system. I learn from management that the collective is primary and in order to accomplish client retention the team is primary."
good,Great benefits and plenty of employee appreciation. They hire several contractors to start then you may go permanent. Great place to work to expand experience and knowledge of banking industry.
good,"My job responsibilities were to help incoming call customers with their credit card services. It was not to difficult to assist customers with credit extensions, payments, card benefits and refunds. In this job, like all my other jobs, I learned more and more about customer service satisfaction and to understand  the culture of the company. Managers were located in different locations so there was not face to face interaction. The communication was all by email and it was difficult to feel the emotion part of the messages. But, my co-workers balanced the scale of comfort in the job. The hardest part of the job was when customers were upset about the card services they received, like the timing to resolve issues or restore credit, specially when they were on vacation out of the country. But, when the company provided free lunches and paid days off for good performance, I was nice to be there."
good,"I have been  working as shift lead, learned lot of things after joining Citibank NA, great place to explore work,always had an challenging duties on work.We deal with production environment on mainframe support."
good,"Citibank is a family oriented and productive work place. A typical day at work is very productive after assisting our customers with questions and answer's about accounts, claims or policies. My co-workers are well involves as a team. The hardest part of the job is telling our customers no because of policy and procedures. the most enjoyable part of my job is know that I have accomplished a goal that I have set."
good,"One thing I really liked about Citigroup, is the flex time we were given. I could come in between 7-9, which allowed me to coordinate my mornings based on what needed to be done. My typical day at work, would be to come in, and tackle all priority 1 tasks that need to be done first. I would then sort out my day with all given tasks, and make sure I had a clear understanding of what my day looked like. I learned to expect the unexpected, and not everything goes as planned, and that's okay. As long as you put your full effort in your work, and peers, you will succeed. The management at Citi just want to help, and are always willing to adjust schedules, work, or anything else that will get the best service to our clients, and our employees. My co-workers have been second to none, and the relationships I have formed over the past 4 years will stay with me forever. We are a team, and we work well together. "

good,I examined potential government affiliates that have the ability to influence laws that govern.

good,This experience gave me more courage and confidence. The hardest part of the warking was standing for long hours and giving leaflets. Co-workers were friendly and helpful.
good,"A typical day at Citi included day to day tasks needed to meet certain deadlines. If you enjoy challenging, high paced work environments, Citi is the place for you. What I enjoyed the most was the diversity and employee appreciation displayed day to day. What I liked least working at Citi was the hours of operation and management."
good,Citibank is a great place to work at.  I like working with my co-workers in my dept.
good,"• Responsible for managing portfolios of travel and purchase cards for both Government and Fortune 500 companies."
good,"Using a telephone and a mainframe to assist customers with inquires or to make payments. Also included upselling products to customers. (Even the irrate ones) Not a terrible place to work, if you like a job that seems like its the same thing over and over again."
good,"A typical day as an intern involved assisting the tellers in handling clients complains, filing and retrieval of documents as well as assisting in general clerical and administrative tasks. I learnt about managing accounts receivables and payable, preparing journal entries, appraising clients' accounts and performing data reconciliation. My co-workers were very resourceful and an exciting lot to be with. The hardest part of my role as an intern was exceeding big expectations from the manager and other senior employees. The most enjoyable part of the job was seeing a client leave with a smile on the face because of an obvious excellent service received."
good,"plucking escalation specialists from their jobs and giving them 5 weeks of training to be a unit manager does nothing for this group. the managers knit pick, show favoritism, come and go when they please, and care more about their own bonus then managing their agents. Citi has a great culture and the pay is great. Benefits were something that most companies don't have."
good,Every day is different but enjoy helping our bankruptcy customer with any questions or payments
good,"I worked for CitiMortgage in a variety of capacities for 7 years.  While their benefits are fairly good, (reasonably priced insurance, good 401k match), the job stability there is always in question.  The mortgage industry is a volatile industry (since 2008) and you won't spend any significant length of time in one position before you feel like you have to start looking again in order to be proactive to avoid losing your job to a layoff or reorganization that was not the kind of job you originally signed up for.  If you don't mind floating along and doing the new jobs they put you in (if you are lucky enough to avoid getting laid off in general) you would do well there.  I like to have more control over my career path than being at the mercy of a big corporation that has serious staffing inconsistencies."

good,"A typical work day begins at 8am.  It's a very busy, fast paced atmosphere.  Time management is critical.  Must be able to prioritize and not buckle under pressure.  The culture is very comfortable.  Mostly open door policy.  The hardest part of the job is balancing all the folks you support and giving them each the quality and time their work deserves.

good,Gained invaluable experience within both the Hedge Fund and KYC roles. Supportive management assisted with my overall professional development. this allowed me to pursue my career within KYC.
good,"Professional environment, highly competitive salary with potential for bonus, invest in employees and promotes from within. Too much micro-management treat employees like kindergarteners checking your every move. The managers and upper leadership roles barely open people have been in these same positions 5 yrs + if you want to climb up on your career I wouldn’t suggest it."
good,"Great company and great benefits.. Easy to grow but you have to commit yourself to a certain department and if you don't like the department, then you're kind of screwed."

good,"My time here was fun in the beginning. After 1 year in, people started leaving and was not replaced. In the end the entire desktop support team was just the manager, me and another colleague supporting half the building. Management is filled with a bunch of old men waiting to retire so they won't do anything too drastic that will make them look bad."
good,"I currently work in a client facing social media role with the company. This position currently only highers from within. This is a small group working from San Antonio, Florence and Tampa all servicing social media inquiries. If you are able to work with strong personalities you will do fine. Management is pretty hands off, the job isn't difficult if you understand social media and emails.  The interview was quick basic ""tell me about a time when you had to deliver bad news, good customer service, went above and beyond...etc."
good,"I was laid off from Citi in 2007. My comments, though required by Indeed to move to the next section, are very dated. The best years of my career, from a personal development standpoint, were at Citi."
good,"Citi is a very diverse company. The hardest part of the job was having to deny credit line increases when the system declined them, telling the customer ""no"".  Best part was the diversity of customers that I got to speak with daily.  All races, all ages and many different scenarios.  No two calls were ever the same.  Managers could use some training on how to help their teams excel."

good,My time with Citi was short but viewed well. My managers were very nice and gave me leeway on how to do the jobs. A typical day at work was busy but allowed to take a couple of 15 minute breaks. Workplace culture was a lot more liberal than other companies I have worked for.
good,not the best cultural place to work. They try to put on events to the moral building but half of the people don't get to attempt to the requirements to be on the phones
good,I enjoyed working for Citi Financial Auto.  However management was not truthful with employees.  They kept stating our jobs were secure and in reality it was not.  The auto division dissolved in 2008 and I was laid off.

good,"There are employee benefits "
good,Citi is good place work.  It is a meritocracy.  I learned a lot there of the years and worked with a lot of good people.  The downside for people based in NYC is the migration of roles to low cost centers.
good,"Financial services company offering broad range of services across many global geographies.  Like other large global organizations, this firm is constantly evolving to offer high value products and services and achieve operational efficiency."
good,"Lots of opportunities, but have to know the right people to get ahead, which takes time."

good,Salary is quite low compared to the standards within the sector.
good,I worked very hard and enjoyed the work however growth opportunities were implied but were never materialized. It seems if you were very good at your job then they wanted to keep you in that position rather than allowing the opportunity for growth
good,"Citi provides a solid job, good benefits and good way to gain experience and knowledge of the banking industry. It can also be quite stressful being yelled at for 8-10 hours, but that is customer service."
good,Very stressful working environment and micromanagement. Constant pressure from upper management on quotas and QA issues. Co workers were easy to get along with and very helpful.
good,Good place to work and gain experience; ability to relocate worldwide. Great bunch of people I have worked with over the years. Need to be comfortable working in a large complex company

good,"I think that Citi could be a really great place to work but it highly depends on the area and branch you are working in. Also, as long as the management for the area is knowledgeable and committed then I think it can be a very lucrative career."
good,Citi builds talent and teams by creating a culture of meritocracy and  enables a collaborative work environment.  Champions a culture of high standards.
good,This company required to be available at all times for customers accounts with making payments and going over credit card purchases and balances. In this position had to offer customers benefits to utilize their credit cards.
good,"While the position lasted, this was a good company to work at with good managers.  I enjoyed the work environment.  We were able to set our own daily goals to accomplish as much as we wanted to complete."
good,I learned different ways of collecting on delinquent accounts. Provided excellent customer service while assisting customers with there issue. Management was very understanding.
good,"Citi is a big organisation, which means there are lots of opportunities there, but it also means it's hard to change things because there are so many dependencies."
good,"This job was over 15 years ago, but I will say that there was job advancement that made me look and feel good about myself.  The team I worked with was great."
good,The call center has a very competitive environment and an extremely dynamic work culture. Management is very aggressive and the offered compensation and benefits are not really up to the mark.
good,it was a good experience working for Citi manager was very flexible and understandable. I would refer any one to work for Citi bank no one can match the flexibility like they do.
good,"Coaching staff, run meetings and do reporting. Learned the objectives of the company and how all teams work together.

good,The environment allowed for lots of work to get done while support was on a high level.  Colleagues were supportive yet expectations were high. I was stimultaed and challenged in a massive way.
good,Work day started 8am-4:30pm Monday-Friday. Management team was okay. Not the best that I've worked with before. The culture was very diverse. The hardest part about my job was the training was not great at all. The most enjoyable part about my job was talking to the client and my co-workers.
good,"Many opportunities to move if you find the right department.  Overtime expected in many department, but the opportunity for extra pay on top of your base salary is nice"
good,"Great work place. Great growth opportunities.  "
good,Citibank's SSC in Budapest is a really friendly and professional area.
good,Generally a good company to work for. How ever there are some departments to stay away from. They will tell you one thing but do another. You are expected to answer a certain number of phone calls each day making sure to meet call handle times of each business. If you are okay with just doing your job in lieu of bringing excellence to the table go for it. If you are one who strives for excellence then this may not be the place for you.
good,I had good time working with team members and team lead.    Interaction with the Singapore team was interesting and challenging.      Learned many things on inter personal relationships and the dynamics of work environment which was productive.     Was satisfied with performance as contributed for systems development.    Had good time interacting with clients and the challenges and opportunities had in resolving client's needs.

Able to explain complex financial management concepts to a wide variety of professional and non-professional audiences. Adept at working independently or as part of a professional banking team.
good,I worked here so long ago that I don't think my review is very relevant.  But I liked working there and still have a number of old colleagues and friends who work there and seem happy.
good,Utilized several system platforms to research and resolve client escalated calls and to support policy and procedures inquiries from the Financial centers.
good,"I always thought the Citi people were really great - truly diverse, collaborative, and far less ego problems among seniors compared to other big banks I know of. Too bad the bank almost went bankrupt and they are still recovering. The job moves from NYC to lower cost centers does not seem to be executed properly - i.e. getting less than lower salary they are paying for. Such aspect also stresses out staff in NYC."
good,"•	Oversee 2nd review process for Conventional/VA/FHA loans."
good,"Plano de carreira, fácil acesso aos gerentes, confiabilidade,ambiente agradável, muitos benefícios."
good,"Great platform for learning with a lot of rescues given the size and reach of the bank. While working for three years, I developed strong technical skills that will serve me well moving forward."
good,"Daily intercompany matching, observing an open door policy, being able to communicate with other  effectively."
good,"It's a high stress environment; meeting exceeding sales numbers is #1 concern of management.

They will work with schedule adjustments and changes as necessary to accommodate legitimate employee needs."
good,Good opportunities to build a career and training available.
good,"Was put out to pasture after a very long career. Managed lots of operations, onshore and offshore and after the mortgage bubble bust was part of a group of leaders that was let go."

good,Citi is a challenging work environment surrounding the regulatory and internal audit requirements that need to be followed in conjunction of daily reporting tasks
good,"The culture is very good and the people are easy to deal and talk with. However, the work itself may not promote technical growth in your field of choice. It can get very processor-like and monotonous, leaving little room for actual relevant input from the employee."
good,"I like Citi. great people and many oppurtunities to advance. My only issue is I must have a set work schedule, not have to switch hours and days due to mandatory shift bids. I went from a. bearable mid shift to the graveyard shift with no say so. Difficult if you are in school or have a second job or a single parent with young children. It can put a real strain on your family life. I don't feel they offer the work/life balance they claim they do."
good,"Long hours"
good,Strong pace environment. Company Requirements in terms of Financial Reporting vary according to the new general management. Citi had very good benefits.
good,Citi is a fun place to work with lots of room for advancement for the right person. The job itself can be stressful at times but also challenging. An overall nice place to work.
good,Malgré des journées très longues des cadences assez soutenues. Je garde de mes collaborateurs et collègues un très bon souvenir. Un grand esprit d'équipe entache parfois par l'absence du management a prendre position.
good,sometimes stressful had to change job or risk layoff good moral great benefits hard to advance unless you had family that works there reasonable hours
good,"Lots of bureaucracy.  Manager never tell you how career prospects actually appear and ultimately leave you to fend for yourself.   Probably not atypical in finance, but certainly not encouraging."

good,The job was interesting and fun to do because it was always busy and we were constantly doing something. You found your days to go by fast as well as making more money when being able to do overtime.
good,"Lots of opportunities to learn, grow and explore different products in the area."
good,"I really enjoyed my time with Citi. I was able to learn a lot in several different ares of the company. Great benefits! If given the chance, I would go back to Citi anytime."

good,My review is from my experience in the past now is not all that. Looks good on the resume. Like I said great in the past not so great now. Good starting point.
good,Citi was a great company to work for.  People were a priority and suitable management was a focus.  Integrity was valued and work/life balance was not only the expectation but encouraged!
good,"Great office size, large cafe, starbucks, huge gym w/ trainers, Dr. onsite for employees, etc. Great breakout rooms and lots of deskspace. Great communication and very involved in community."
good,"Citi is a fast paced environment with a lot of rapid change. The company is evolving rapidly, however at times the attention to employee development and advancement are missing."

good,"Por ser uma empresa de grande porte, o acesso e comunicação entre as áreas e os funcionários fica um pouco difícil. A falta dinamismo algumas vezes atrapalhava o andamento do processo como um todo. "
good,"I was a contractor. My interactions were with Citi Hedge funds, I've never been in Randstad office, but the person I was involved with from Randstad was a good profesional. Never had any issues with her."
good,"Citibank has great benefits, however, it is hard to advance in the company.  Citibank does offer paid planned time and paid unplanned time. If one works in the call center (depending on position) it is extremely hard to use the planned time on days you actually desire."
good,"Working at Citi was a fun and productive environment, great co-workers that was always willing to assist when needed.. Citi provided ongoing training and self Development  course"

good,Buena empresa pero esta en un proceso interno de cambios e inistabilidad
good,"Good company"
good,The Student Loan Corporation was a profitable subsidiary of Citibank in the 90's.  Corporate arrogance from Citibank took local control of the company and put it in the hands of those at corporate.  Became a terrible climate.

good,"Collection dialer environment with many calls in an 8 hour shift.  Fun and upbeat management especially on the night shift, great after college classes job."
good,"Citi is a great company to work for, even in my dept where first level mgmt has MUCH to learn about being fair. The overall organization is well run with much change to adapt to within their AML/Compliance group. Benefits are quite robust as one would expect and culture is energetic."
good,This was a good job to start out with the company and depending on the department there is and opportunity to move lateral. However to get into management you have to know the right people

good,"I worked here as a summer Intern during MBA., in the Credit card sales department. "
good,Citi has a strong global footprint that differentiates it vs. other large bulge bracket banks.  I'm continuously challenged in my current role and incentive to provide our clients with best-in-class service.  The culture is similar to cultures at other bulge bracket banks: competitive yet collaborative where top performers are rewarded with increased responsibility/benefits. The most enjoyable part of my role is my colleagues and the opportunity to leverage significant resources and relationships that are often not available at smaller institutions.
good,Banking schedule with long hours task with struck in process and standard procedures. Good benefits and given work from home twice a week. All my team are located in Singapore and india and I'm the only one here in the Philippines. Your task and responsibilities is quite big and critical since I'm handling global and projects
good,"evening shifts"

good,"Truly a global bank."
good,I do not wish to comment I was laid off so this wouldn't be a could review but the benefits are amazing and the pay is amazing as well. I would have liked to say longer

good,"My experience as a sales agent in CITI bank savings was very helpful in my career. I learn to be more confident to mingle other people, mingling another person is my weakness before I joined CITI bank."
good,Great job to learn skills and be able to further your career. The work environment is fairly laid back and is a business casual. So many great benefits with this company
good,"Enjoyed working there.  Unfortunately difficult to get into executive management without connections, but great through director level.  Compensation is decent but not great."
good,"Never worked over 40 hours a week. If work/life balance is your number one priority, Citi is great. However, upward mobility is hard to come by and the things do move at a very slow paced since there are many regulations and process."
good,Fun place to work with. It has a very supportive group of individuals (Associates and Management) with a friendly working environment and a sense of positivism.
good,"I have nothing to say as I still work here I am being forced to give a review when in fact I would not like to as you never know who reads these, or how the robot my feel when it does."
good,Always occupied with work. Love the weekly huddles meetings whereby we get to know new colleagues better through the introduction as well as recognitions for well performing staff
good,London 6 months assignment experience was good otherwise the work was primarily of reporting and automation involving standardization of reporting across regions.
good,The other employees are all quick to help and very cheerful which creates a pleasant atmosphere. The work itself makes for a very boring workday considering you just stare at the computer and talk on the phone all day.

good,"Citibank was a great place for me for awhile. It taught me a lot, their training programs were great, and the starting pay was more than I asked for. However there are a few things that I didn't really approve of. As in any big company they are focused too heavily on sales instead of service, and they hire externally rather than promote qualified candidates from within. Also the pay they start you out at is usually higher because the raises are terrible. But still even with all of that they have great benefits, and after working for a few different banks I can honestly say they were the best I have ever worked for."
good,"Overall this is a good place to work. Excellent training initially and as new programs and features roll out. My biggest criticism is that as new procedures for customer/employee interaction is ADDED, desired average talk times remain the same or adjusted much later causing some negative impact to performance record."
good,The work atmosphere is friendly and working hours are 9 Am to 5 PM.
good,Citi is a great place to work and to grow. I feel I've gained a great deal of experience and knowledge in each position that I held at the company.
good,"Great place to pay your dues and gain a lot of experience, but don't expect much compensation... Sr. Management is more concerned about their EOY Bonus Check than anything else."
good,Premium pay with no benefits. Perfect for a college student and summer job.
good,Most enjoyable part of the job was that everyday was different and I learned something new all the time.
good,"It has been over 10 years, since I was there, so my review would not be current."
good,"Citi provided an excellent opportunity for a young professional to become immersed in the financial world. Dealing with rapidly evolving legislation on bank lending and capitalization, the company has needed to reinvent its leveraged finance practice over the past several years and has successfully leveraged relationships with some of the largest issuers in the market. With a team that is smaller than those of most other large investment banks, the leveraged finance group pushes its employees to be creative in their advice, relying on this ingenuity without access to an unlimited amount of resources. Leveraged finance's development of its junior analysts and associates is something that needs to be improved as the group re-establishes itself as a top tier underwriter and lender in the leveraged finance market. However, the opportunity to interact with issuers and investors on a daily basis provides the analysts an opportunity to test their skills early in their careers."
good,"aquired daily goals,co workers are great,needed better management, always learn new ,bank policys and procedures."
good,people are great! HR is very cooperative and understanding. The organization is very human... not a machine or just a number on wall street.
good,Involved in reviewing and analyzing the requirement documents for the application.
good,processing deposits and withdrawls. Maintaining proper drawer limits. Answering phones and offer products to clients that will improve their financial needs
good,"Best people, best infrastructure and best salary/benefits in the industry is what CitiFinancial provides. The culture and values are respected and adhered strictly."
good,Very interesting.
good,"great benefits, opportunity of advancement, the only issue was that nothing was ever good enough and also that they would have you stay late with no notice"
good,At Citigroup I worked within the Public Sector Lockbox. I am required by law to not disclose the exact details regarding my position within the company as it pertains to the safety of information security regarding our clients. I performed many tasks across a variety of departments and was able to excel rapidly in each department.
good,City group is big name in finance sector. I have learnt all about assets and economy circumstances. Got a chance to work with very experienced team members and learnt a lot.
good,"Typical days consisted of assisting high tier clients with banking, brokerage, retirement, and mortgage accounts. I learned how broke i really was when dealing with extremely wealthy clients. Most co-workers were very friendly. Most enjoyable part was helping clients complete whatever tasks/complications they were facing."
good,"My day to day responsibilities as an Operations Analyst was not too demanding. Management was very supportive to all interns, providing them with any information and opportunities possible. The intern program is highly valued at Citi and it shows. The Intern project was the most enjoyable part of the job. It gave me the opportunity to learn about other businesses under the Citigroup umbrella."
good,"Lots of time spent on the phone, learned a lot regarding mortgages, mortgage investors and various loss mitigation options. Great immediate management, wonderful co-workers - some disconnect with higher management, but that's expected with such a large company. Best and worst part of the job were very similar: talking to a customer you could help and talking to one you couldn't."
good,"Citigroup is a great company where we can work using the top technology, working next to smart people and never get bored. Be ready to put extra hours. The number of every day emails is tremendous - should pay attention to all of them in order to not miss the ones addressed to your projects."
good,I wasnt happy with the demands they put on their employees. The pay and hours were decent. I would of stayed if it was nt for the company downsized
good,receive and make calls to clients who are in soft collection and negotiate repayment arrangements. For those who are in hard collection we transfer to appropriate collection officer.
good,"nice place to work, good people to work with, good benefits and good tuition reimbursement program for college students."
good,To meet and greet customers and clients in a positive and friendly manor
good,Working here was a good time for me. It showed me good and bad people working. It also taught me a lot about how to work computers better and how to do data entry.
good,"El ambiente de trabajo dentro del área es muy bueno y grato. Lo que más me gusta es el constante trabajo en equipo y apoyo entre todos nosotros. Si bien el trabajo es fuerte, lo más gratificante son las metas logradas."
good,Citi was a great place to work. It helped me get my start into the world of finance. I was able to work with a great group of folks who have helped me get my career off in the right path
good,"As a Administrative Technican I, I help client work out a payment plan so they are able to keep their Vehicle that they have Finance."
good,"Direct daily branch activities, executing operational policies, procedures and regulatory requirements to maximize branch profits and customer service level"
good,"My job function involves the management of operations, sales & the people management."
good,- Positive working environment
good,An office worker as administrative assistant that support the division of business small lending loans to small businesses. There's a weekly cut off period that is really very stressful to personal bankers employees.
good,"Citibank is a diverse workplace. Good place to work. I started as a customer service representative, became a supervisor a year and half later. I was a supervisor for five years then moved to back office."
good,Citi was a great place to work. I would recommend this corporation as a goal in life to work for.
good,Best place to learn
good,Working at Citi Bank was a temporary assignment. It was short lived as I found a permanent position a few months of working here. Everyone was friendly and willing to help my transition. Management was helpful in creating realistic goals and expectations.
good,"A day in Citibank is a busy day, lot of things to finish in a tight timeline, but there are lots of sense of achievement. The challenges are there that really shape a person to be more productive than before."
good,Intense atmosphere and they expect a lot of you but its a good place to work
good,Very enviromental friendly. The company always willing to help people in time of disasters. Very big on community service.
good, Assist customers with billing questions
good,I've worked for Citi the past 13 years and have had a great opportunity to work in many areas of the business in two great locations. I have worked with many talented people over the years and feel I have grown both professionally and personally over that time.
good,Was to satisfy the customers and help them achieve what they were wanting out of a mortgage.
good,many departments for career advancement. employees are very helpful and knowledgeable
good,"Citi was another great place to work, my time there I was able to move to to an assintant manager position. My managers were great to work with, the people there were great."
good,"Great Company to work for, good benefits, great staff. Enjoyed almost everything about this job, only negative was I felt that there wasn't enough training for the job I was hired for."
good,Great learning opportunity. One of the best teams of professionals I've ever worked with.
good,Every day has a new priority one to work on. The experience has been great and diverse and the pace has been extremely quick. The stress level has been high but I have gotten used to it. My coworkers are knowledgeable and dependable for the most part. The hardest part of the job is the political scene at the top management level.
good,"Maintained knowledge of Citi Bank’s automated systems, Reviewed files to remain in compliance."
good,•a typical day at work - BAU
good,I perform PMO Project Manager Work. Working at Citi is just like learning new technologies every day and working with a number of teams that are globally spreaded.
good,Very fast-paced and constantly changing to meet consumers needs. The day started with a self- review and sign-on to system in order to start recieving inbound calls from consumers and making outbound calls to those who were late on payment. Management were constantly involved in employees daily activitties for its a team- oriented atmosphere with supervisors who micro-manage you. For the most part the co workers got along well and friends were made . The hardest part of the job for me was dealing with the many different personalities and listening to people sad stories.....I enjoyed most the teamwork and talking to the various characters i met while taking payments over the phone.
good,Outbound and inbound calls.
good,"On any given day I am juggling the following: training my tellers, creating the schedule, face-to-face client interactions, follow up on customer investigations, monitor all of the accounts we opened, wires sent, transactions processed, etc."
good,Citi is a good company to work for. It has global presence. It has a lot of oppertunities as it is very big.
good,I enjoed the way everyone was friendly and house that had a great lunch slection and would be whatever you like and you did not have to leave out and go get lunch and the would have specials day when you could go to the movies and from work on the clock.
good,I learned alot from working at Citi. It was my first job and I was able to take away alot of knowledge about the financial industry from there.
good,"I enjoyed my internship. Any questions I had, everyone helped to answer"
good,"This job consisted of caring for and ensuring the safety of credited accounts for customers. The specifics included preventing and identifying fraud to personal accounts, editing information, welcoming new members and interacting with customers daily on the phone."
good,"I absolutley love this place they are really like a family, but when the BIG man decided to switch managment shift ex: first shift manager go to third shift and third shift manager go to second.If they declined they would be fired the teams became furious dozens of people quite including managers the place became a circus the hardest part about the job was the labor I don't think women should do some of the things they do there"
good,"I began my workdays at NM Direct doing data entry. I took the work that the warehouse workers did and inputed it in the computer system. After inputing info in the system, I filed documents according to buyers and shipments. Ocassionally I contacted buyers if shipments were incorrect, but it was on an as-needed basis."
good,"When I first arrived at Citi it seemed like a great place for advancement, until the call center closed. There were a variety of employee schedules, including employees who worked from home."
good,Excellent job to help new insurance agents get licensed in TN and KY. Afternoon and weekends a great time to work and learn
good,"Mein Arbeitgeber hat mir immer ermöglicht in viele Arbeitsbereiche reinzuschauen und zu lernen. Ich habe immer die Möglichkeit gehabt viel zu lernen und auch an andere Kollegen weiterzugeben. Ich arbeite mit einem sehr guten Team zusammen, mit dem die Arbeit auch wirklich Spass macht. Ich kann nicht sage was ich an diesem Job an schwierigsten finde. Mir gefällt am besten an diesem Job, dass sehr selbstständig arbeiten kann, Entscheidungen alleine treffen kann und man immer wieder neue Herausforderungen hat."
good,This company does offer you room to make bonus money on top of your regular pay. The only issues I had with this company is that they aren't very family orientated with their employees. I was pregnant got put on bedrest with my baby and was later asked to voluntarilly quit.
good,"Some of the best reasons to work including the opportunities to work in different job functions, receive training, develop professionally."
good,I liked the environment and the people. Would work again here.
good,there was great growth opportunity if you wanted to move up within the company
good,"handled inbound calls for clients with auto loans that were past due and needed assistance with bringing account current, offered loan modifications,amendments,deferments,payment arrangements. the most enjoyable part of the job was assisting clients in bringing there accounts current, the Hardest part was getting client to follow up on processes that required them to Fax loan info back in."
good,Always learning at Citicorp whether it's a new mainframe application or somebody's new training program -- Great people who ARE customer-focused!
good,* Trained to service High Clientel Clients
good,"A typical work day would begin with customer service and cash handling, Each customer you encountered was a new learning experience because not one client is the same and their needs are different as well. In order to be successful my greatest skill was listening to the customer and tuning in on what they valued most and I was great at it. The hardest part of the job was not being effective enough. Meaing if there I was a situation where a customer left the branch unsatisfied, where a resolution couldn't be reached which was not that often. The most enjoyable part of the jog was the rewards for doing a good jod. There were so many incentives that were put into place to motivate us employees to always do our best suc as; cash prizes, vacations to Hawaii,recongnition,dinners on the company, lunchon's,they would even buy your lunch at least two or three times a month. There were many enjoyable things there."
good,"A fast paced work place with positive employees, that worked hard to succeed."
good,- Enjoy the corporate meeting
good,Many traings and on the job coaching helped to improve skills almost daily.
good,"Granted, it has been almost a decade since I worked at Citi but I was impressed with the amount of training they invest in their associates. Cross training in multiple disciplines was encouraged with small pay raises. The compensation was on par with many other call centers but hours were cut short a lot due to call volumes."
good,"A typical day at work is usually routine. I manage four tellers, monitor the customer wait time, handle customer complaints, handle any discrepancies with the ATM machines. My co-workers are the most enjoyable part of the job. I have a really good team."
good,Started as teller when I was in college and worked my way up. Worked in many branches with in 10 years. Co workers were always great and managers seemed to change often.
good,"Typical day at work is calling assigned accounts, answering phones, taking payments, filing and general customer service on accounts. Management and co-workers work well together as a team. The most unpleasant part of the job is doing garnishments and repossesions. My favorite part of the job is when I can truly help our customers and the relationships I have built with my customers and co-workers."
good,Very high professionalism on on the management core. I liked worked for the company. Challenges was normally when i have to travel to a customer's premise to resolve a problem and get caught up with traffic for hours thus having a customer to be down longer than it should be. I enjoyed the team building events that we had monthly with my team members
good,cool company to work for. Not to far away just 20 mins from charlotte
good,The management was out of this world. It was a learning experience and I truly loved my job.
good,This is one of the best work places i have ever worked in despite a lot of challenges. People around you makes a big difference
good,"A typical day for me is checking in with my collectors and making sure they are ok with system issues and any new policies or changes. Then, spending a couple of hours working through emails."
good,Unvarying work procedures that require great attention to detail. fast feedback and incentives. Sales component requires shortcuts that prevent great customer service to the caller and inverse service for the company. Good team building and cooperation. Pay is low but consistent. Modern adherence to social demands by minority causes rather than Christian values.
good,"Worked with a great team, very helpful, and productive. The processing of information such as payroll, and creating accounts to grant new employees access was slow."
good,I have been an employee for citi for 3 1/2 years and I will admit that citi group is a great company to work for. They provide awesome benefits and great working staff throughout the company.
good,"Citi was a great place to work. My department was really friendly and co-workers were amazing as well as my team lead. Flexible schedule (great when you are children). However, the salary was not reflective of the pile of work and it was hard to be promoted. In sum, I will go back to Citi, if I have the opportunity."
good,Citi provides an outstanding pay scale for thier local markets as well as flexibility and benefits programs that make them a great employer
good,Good working environment in the general counsel floor of Citigroup. Helpful and productive environment.
good,I enjoyed my time here even though it was a summer internship while I was in high school. It gave me a good glimpse of what working in a corporate office would be like. Unfortunately I think management is slightly disorganized because it was never clear who our manager was. We only knew his name but never met him so we answered to non-management employees.
good,"Working at Citibank, not only did I help customers, I learned alot about managing finances which h.elped in my personal life."
good,"The bonus program was really great...until they kept changing it so employees made less, and management made more, like a lot of companies, too many managers not doing anything or micro managing. Otherwise it WAS a fun place to work,,after over 6 years working there I was part of a lay off of over 80 people. Outsourced to the Philippines. And they also then canceled 90 percent of all the credit card benefits, so I am glad now I no longer work there. Just going down hill."
good,"Twice daily briefings and follow up on work being done."
good,The work is very fast-paced everyday you have to deal with different clients it develops your length of patience and quite very stressful but they do give good incentives.
good,Much of the management at Citi is not leadership material.  They aren't informed on the overall vision or it is widely believed they are not managing to the larger strategy.  The goal appears to keep parity with competition and keep teams as status quo.
good,Good company to work for. Pretty decent benefits if you stay there. My experience with the company is that they only care about the bottom line. Our department was moved from Irving to Manila and Jacksonville so the department could cut cost.
good,"Citi's work culture has been very accepting with all types of employees may it be race, gender, age. All teams are connected to each other from different business unit and/ or departments which makes it easier to understand when looking for other opportunities outside if my current team. They promote career mobility heavily and this is something not looked down upon once you decide to move on to another role"
good,"Citi is a very good company to work for as they are competitive pay and benefits. "
good,"Great environment as long as business is as usual. High level of autonomy within a team structure is beneficial to productivity. Typical day involves servicing employee requests regarding time and absence such as updating time sheets, evaluating pay slips, editing employee absences, etc."
good,"For the most part this is a good place to work. The local team and management are down to earth and try to help if you need to escalate an issue to them. "
good,"it was a great place to work with excellent benefits, unfortunately I was laid off after 12 years due to company selling servicing side of the business"
good,"New management was very professional and human. They put professionals as a priority. Very cool environment, highly demanding in global requests. Concepts were difficult to understand, and training was non existent"
good,"Citibank, NA is a globank bank company with high exposure to the regional or global segment. "
good,It is a good place with many learning opportunities. I like their good developed systems and project Management Agile approach. Citi has good learning opportunities for engineers.
good,"Company is New York-based so broadest set of opportunities in Marketing are in NY, no Chicago.  Chicago retail credit cards is a bit of an ""old school"" business (e.g. large partner is Sears which is in downward spiral for years) and not innovative at all.  Decent work atmosphere but low growth product space translates into low growth career prospects.  Many employees have been there 20-plus years doing largely the same thing."
good,"A typical workday began with checking for daily meeting changes, preparation for metrics mtg. Coaching and mentoring of agents. Calibration discussions with agents. I learned time management skills. Time management was the most difficult part of the job. Citi culture was energetic, employee wellness was important as well as community service and volunteer work. Management was supportive and encouraging."
good,Citi is a good company to work for. On most days you can expect customers to challenge your customer service skills and you get to work with team members to offer financial solutions in a friendly and professional environment.
good,"Citigroup is a large multi-national financial services corporation."
good,"I worked with Citi for 15 years. Job itself was challenging but personally gratifying when completed. Pay was average, Benefits were great! "
good,"Just another workplace where it's not what you know, its whose butt you kiss to get ahead. Loved my job and coworkers, but management was disorganized and immature, and it was hard to have respect for those that only cared about image."
good,"Work Hard And You Will Be Rewarded!"
good,"work hard, good people, large global organisation that has many opportunities. "
good,fun place to work with different people. cool atmosphere. okay benefits. typical day involves checking emails and reviewing tickets and absolving them. also some team meetings
good,"Great place to work in terms of the content and type of projects, especially from a global footprint. Management style and collaborative working made the role less than desirable with managers responsible for people when they should be in a SME role."
good,"From a small entry level collections agent to a 2nd level AML Risk Analyst Officer.  Opportunities were available, until they weren't. At a certain point nobody goes anywhere else and the advancement runs out.  The benefits are wonderful and they really try to be who they say they are but like any company, don't always have the right people in the upper management roles who truly care about the people so it doesn't always pan out."
good,"Citi se mantiene como líder en el área de soluciones financieras y bancarias. Pero aun mantienen gerencias con altos requerimientos presenciales, eliminando así el balance vida trabajo, manteniendo horarios laborales de mas de 10 horas diarias, 5 días a la semana."
good,"Citi is overall a wonderful place to work, decent benifits and time off but somewhat boring at times and repeditive. I enjoy the people I work with a lot."
good,"If you can talk to people nicely and manage your time and be on time. You can do this job. Its very self managed, self start, self do. You are responsible for your work ethic."
good,I started right before the mortgage crash. I left around the time of recovery. There were quite a few ups and downs. I was able to see some of the best and the worst of the company. That said I would still return if giving an opportunity
good,"The work life and home life isn't as great as it should be. Management need to sit with some employee for a little cubicle training instead of being told to deal with it and figure it out."
good,"Regular hours, great staff and the culture make this an excellent place to work. The structure of the day and helping people with their struggles was the best part."
good,"I enjoyed working for this company, I learned a lot. Depending on who was your manager determined your work experience. I had good managers and some not so great!"
good,"Adorava trabalhar no Citibank, empresa fantástica, pena que alguns poucos gestores são uma porcaria!!!"
good,This was my first financial job and I learned a lot about the finance industry during my time there.  It was a very results driven and it was a non stop on a daily basis.  Most enjoyable part was dealing with the customers.
good,"Decent managers, paid well for performance, paid sick time, ample vacation time, paid holidays, ability to take unpaid time when calls are slow, ability to make up time, maternity leave offered."
good,"I worked here and enjoyed the campus and employee benefits. The only downside was lower-level management was very ""cliquey"" and if you were in the clique you weren't going to advance or move anywhere beneficial to your position."
good,"It's a fairly good place to work but more youth friendly.  It's difficult sitting for several hours and carpal tunnel is a given. Desks, chairs and keyboards are old and need replacing."
good,I have no idea on other department but in general this is young company in the Philippines and in many area still trial and errors in management and organizational structure.
good,"Citi provided me the opportunity to travel with my job and the option to work from home.  While the job was stressful at times, we were given the resources and tools to work effectively."
good,"Excellent quality of work, very challenging environment. Lot of office politics though. Talent was not recognized sufficiently, there could have been better transparency"
good,"Over all a good company to work for, nonetheless pay structure could be more beneficial and consistent. Nonetheless I enjoyed my job and many of the people and the opportunities that were provided i would still be there had not life events changed."
good,"It was a great experience for me working in a different environment of financial institutions.  Citibank was a wonderful place, work environment to work at.  "
good,"Citi Private Bank strives to promote from within. They have a strong culture of cooperation between management, sales, service and specialist. If you work hard there are a multitude of promotions and transfers available."
good,"Citi is a large company with many sub cultures. But the overall focus is driven by the desire to meet financial goals. It is currently undergoing a organization redesign under new leadership. People with the ability to influence others, manage multiple projects and navigate ambiguity will thrive here."
good,"Prod support environment is fast paced and challening  everyday."
good,"Usually starts the day with supervisor's call/meeting. Discuss the previous day performance, strategies and challenges to reach assigned targets. Sometime feels annoy if you are under performer. Late comings are strictly warned."
good,"Environment has changed significantly over the years. There is no accountability at senior management levels for decisions that adversely affect the quality and production of lower level staff members, to which those staff are held accountable and rated for yearly reviews and merit increases."
good,"I was a Consultant as a Processing Intermediate Analyst in the Fund Accounting department.  My job was to review the accounting prepared by the company's outsourced department which did the actual accounting entries.  My job was to ensure accuracy and timely.  I was also required to produce the Net Asset Value of each account I was reviewing.  In addition, I produced the Investor Allocation spreadsheets which supported the Investor statements each investor received on a monthly bases.  "
good,"Sad to see that Citibank has not continued to grow since the glory days of the 80's.  This culture and projects there is pretty old school.  Great place to get your start, not a great place to stay long term."
good,"citi is a good place to work, they emphasize on job development always look to help develop talent and help them grow within their own roles, the management is a great resource for development."
good,i love working at Citi. They promote from within. Depending on who you work for they help you correct mistakes. Be careful about advancing to quickly. If you have an easily intimidated manager or your not buddy buddy with them and you show your too good they will target you for removal.
good,Empresa que contrata temporales para su recurso de personal.
good,Working offsite in a Citi Service center is difficualt as managers very rarely show up to the site. Other than that the work life balance is superb and people are encouraged to work remotely.
good,"Increasing responsibilities with no increase in pay or help from management.  Had to work nights, weekends, and holidays.  Management does not help develop people for advancement."
good,"You can make a lot of money working at citibank is you are a high performer, but don't expect opportunity for growth in titles or salary increase. Base rarely changes and not much area for growth. Commissions are luckily uncapped and your control of how hard you want to work."
good,"Office Environment was OK."
good,"It was a great place to learn new things, but moving up the ranks was difficult due to the low presence of the company in Columbus, OH. Some managers are not open to suggestions from employees under their supervision."
good,"This a great place to work but I just need more. I am pretty sure, like most places, its not what you know its who you know. This place is no different. There are good people that work hare and get look over."
good,"I had a lot of friends that found good internal opportunities that have been successful. I enjoyed working with the team I was on and had a lot of respect for my direct manager. Unfortunately, the team I was on has been disbanded, but there are good jobs in IT at that location. Work from home is allowed and there are opportunities to travel."
good,Great place to work 20 years ago I am not sure how the work environment is today.  Not many locations to work in Florida but it was a great location in New York City
good,"While on contract at the Irving campus, I acted as department admin and also project admin to VP. The Campus is world class, capable of hosting any high profile company events. The meeting rooms are adequate technically but dated. The food services are top notch. IT infrastructure is well planned. Onboarding systems are automated and streamlined. Facilities team is responsive and very professional."
good,"Citi tiene muy buen ambiebte de trabajo, dotado de gente muy profesional, y con oportunidades de entrenamiento constante."
good,"Citi works lean and employees work very hard with full work load.  In return, Citi provides better than average salary and benefits and is very employee centric.  Training/Development and internal job opportunities are provided and encouraged."
good,"I enjoyed helping customers and found the credit card servicing interesting."
good,"The day I walked into Citi, people who were laid off were walking out.  I'd survived decades at Citi through lay offs that were AT LEAST quarterly.  Everyone in the group I'd started with had been laid off, or transferred to other companies as Citi divested itself.  I finally was laid off after Citi announcing they planned to eliminate 20,000 technology positions.  "
good,"when i first came into this company everything seemed fantastic, but as time passed i began to see the true colors, bad managment. and the stuggle to find coverage when one was sick or didnt feel well or time off for mandatory leave was not approved"
good,Citi has a lot of potential but could use help with helping the management be more professional. Citi management should be more willing to help agents promote themselves.
good,I learned how to open accounts for private clients and close accounts.  I did web- enrollments and live wire transfers.  Most of your day will fly by quickly because you were very busy.  Which was a plus for me.  I really enjoyed working for Citi.
good,"Bank is good but rather cut throat.  Difficult job but doable.  My supervisor however was a constant problem, trying to criticise everything I did. She was very unprofessional and I was a victim of reverse discrimination."
good,Citi is a silo company and to move forward and advance is not always on the table.  If people want to move forward it is more about who you know rather than what you know or how educated you are.
good,"If you don't actively educate yourself on newer technologies and better ways to do your job, your skill set will stagnate.  There was no motivation for me to increase my skill set.  Even if I went for more challenging roles, management didn't consider transferring me.  Citi is also consolidating many positions into very few mega-locations.  Keep this in mind and ask the hiring manager if there's any chance of the position terminating and re-locating elsewhere.  Like all mega-companies, if your senior management doesn't change focus and begin cost cutting, your position should remain active."
good,"Citi is a good place to start and grow your career, however it is a big organisation and it is possible to get lost in the amount of people that work there."
good,Citi is a great place to work for but the management staff is hit and miss some managers are great at what they do while others should have never made it to management
good,"Only worked there for 3 months before I had to relocate.  They offered me the opportunity to go to work for them in Parkersburg, WV but I took another job closer to home."
good,I worked in citi as a contract for 4 years. The work environment is pretty good and challenging .There is constant pressure from business with requirements and deadlines . There is lot of job advancment oppurtunities if you are fulltime.
good,"Es una buena compañia en cuanto a ambiente laboral, es estable y cumple con los estandares establecidos a la hora del contrato."
good,It is my pleasure working with citi. I am looking for a change only because of financial issues and to get a good role in the other company . Citi provides extra day allowance and provides food if we work on sixth day in a week. Starting we struggled a lot because the actual process am working in is been migrated from Singapore to india. So we worked for day and night. And process has been stabled and team working it with 100 percent accuracy
good,It had good challenging work. Management for the team was very condescending and spoke down to people. Patience was hard to come by as well with the manager.
good,"Working with Citi is an amazing opportunity due to its global landscape. I was earlier part of the FP&A team which was supporting the Outlook, Planning, Variance Analysis and Budgeting roles on the expense side."
good,"Nice place get experience if your just starting. This place is quiet slow so you will have plenty of time to learn stuff. Also, people are very nice and helpful."
good,For me working at citi was very good they really train very well their personal.  they are very professional but the treatment to the employee was unfair
good,"Could pay employees more. They recently eliminated all part time positions in my role. Good benefits, but a tad too expensive. Customer service was average and nothing to rave about."
good,This job is a face paced environment and not for the faint heart. Must take job serious and  be dedicated n every way. full time Is the easiest part of the job
good,During busy time it was very fast paced. Good training and updates on new procedures.  The company allowed for working remotely.  The management team was good.
good,"One of the best places I have ever worked. Very friendly atmosphere. Managers need to be more pro-active and defend their employees. Very little back up for the employees was the only issue I had to deal with. Other than that, a very good place to work."
good,"Fast paced environment, managing all aspects of employment for 20+ inbound phone agents. Coaching to deliver world class customer service, ability to adapt quickly to changes and keep abreast of regulatory and compliance changes.  The most enjoyable part of my job is coaching new agents to be successful and promoting staff to retain talent."
good,"I love working at Citi, it gives you ability to work with all culture of life, peers and clients. The best part I love is my customers, wonderful people we meet daily no two is alike. I have gained a lot working in the financial centers."
good,"You have room to grow within Citibank, international company with full of  tuition reimbursement if you are interested in furthering education. Working at Citibank is very fast paced and you have to keep up their demanding schedule."
good,Fast paced environment enhancing the client experience while working closely with internal business partners to ensure compliance risk is mitigated. Supporting business revenue goals by identifying opportunities to refer to bankers. Managing a high workload of client and banker email and phone requests. Providing feedback to management and other internal business units on how the customer experience can be improved. Working with a smaller close knit team to support each other to help the team achieve success.
good,"They allow the use of instant messengers. It's fun to use to talk to friends and ideal to use to communicate with other associates for tips and procedures, but it can also be used for harassment. "
good,"I have worked over 10 years in Citi Mortgage and had great time. My Overall work experience was great. Work environment was very friendly. CitiMortgage give at job trainings and provide all tools to be successful at your job. "
good,I would recommend this company to those who are simply seeking a part-time job or maybe a full-time position depending on their situation. I left this job ultimately because of management and the working environment.
good,"We received incentives to produce financial products."
good,"Very competitive and fast-pace environment with great benefits and job security."
good,"excellent paid time off and flexibility. great opportunity to grow, can be stressful at times but in general people are willing to help and share their knowledge"
good,"Good place for development, many different departments located in one place together with strong support for employees internal mobility"
good,"Great People, Great Culture, advanced technologies.   I've never worked so hard, with so many fantastic people.  Great opportunities to work on newest IT Technologies.  Fast paced Agile development environment."
good,"A typical day at Citi was always an adventure.  You don't know what you are walking in to.  I love the flexibility in my current role.  The option to work from home a few days a week.  The work life balance is very important to me.  My boss was understanding, and I ALWAYS manage to get my work done.  The hardest part of my current role is trying to set up meetings with the entire team, as we are a global team.  Most meetings will have to happen in the morning, and there is limited time to get these meetings in.  I believe the most enjoyable parts of the job are the flexibility, the fast pace, and never knowing what you are going to walk into in the morning.  I enjoy my current role, and I love working for Citi."
good,"I enjoyed working with Citi and I joined back after my University graduation. We had fun while working as I had met a group of wonderful co-workers and bosses. "
good,"General work and large global scope."
good,"Good benefits and growing opportunities, Different department where you can move and learn different task. The best that the company have is the benefits."
good,"I enjoyed my time at Citigroup; I had two different managers over my 19-20 months there, and both were very supportive.  I reached my tenure at Citigroup and needed to leave after about 19 months, but received over a month's notice so I could have time to find another role.  They seem to overwork their IT PMs a bit, giving up to 3 projects at one time - or multiple projects that take too much time and they don't pay any overtime.  These are the only negative things I could say about this company."
good,"Luôn luôn nỗ lực, có mục tiêu rõ ràng và chiến lược phù hợp cho từng giai đoạn, có khả năng tập trung cao và không ngừng học hỏi , làm việc hết mình vì sự phát triển vững bền của Công ty"
good,Here is started my banking life in the department of business banking as the relationship officer.Here I got the idea about the behaviour of the customers.
good,"I have worked for Citi for over 7 years now. While it's a great company to work for, there is a lot of employee turnover and transition that is taking place."
good,"Good place to learn how to work in a fast paced environment. There is not a lot of work/life balance but it is a place to learn a lot about the industry, make connections and perfect your time management skills."
good,"Nice place to work, still many things to be changed. Like management still not over viewing about every team out of process like team lunch, outing. We just doing process"
good,Bit stressfull. But you love the benefits.It is good place to work for women as they provide work from home options. And flexible working. But work culture sucks as it has the bureaucracy  of large company
good,"Great benefits and great culture, but be prepared to apply for a new position every 2-4 years like clockwork. I miss my peers, but the management reminds me of walmart, cheap with zero customer service."
good,Good work atmosphere to work here. Nice team to be part of. Mix set of talent. Works as a team to achieve the organisation goal. Management is ok. Employee here do their part of the work deli gently.
good,"My twenty-two years at Citi was a huge part of my life. They offer advancement and continued education to accomplish your goal."
good,"Excelente empresa, paga buenos salarios, no prestan la opc de materiales para llevar acabo el proceso."
good,"Worked with a lot of great people who made work fun.  Management was not always very supportive."
good,"Citi culture is good, Allows for stress relievers, massage, ping pong tables. Thank you points are given for good morale. The most difficult part of the job is irate card members that are not willing to be helped. Helping someone that is appreciative of the service you give them."
good,the best thing about this company is are people that you will be working with. Very good culture but the job demands too much over time. I learned a lot in this company and was trained well to a ver competitive person in a good way.
good,"I was hired by a great manager, she resigned and was replaced by a management team that sought to not train people but write them up as a means to produce.  Horrible management is an understatement.  Not every manager is like that, I have met some great managers unfortunately I did not work for them instead."
good,I worked with very professional people. My role was very challenging and fast paced but I enjoyed it.  I was introduced to many different banking software packages and people who supported those packages.
good,"Very structured with defined start times. Fast paced, always busy and engaging work. Casual dress code. Not all department managers enforce the codes of conduct equally."
good,I loved the people I worked with.  My manager was very kind and very supportive of the entire team. He promoted development of the team and always treated everyone fairly.
good,If you are looking to get all of the training and tools you will need in the future then be sure to start your career at Citi.  They have an excellent training program and you can learn about every sector of the industry.  Once you find your niche you are provided with endless resources and training to help you succeed.
good,"The whole job and way people got treated was very inconsistent, I didn't really enjoy working there since the management wasn't always agreeing with everyone"
good,Good company to work with. There was a good work culture and work life balance. The only con was the salary and benefits were not at par with the job role.
good,I worked remotely from home. My experience was mostly favorable. Management does not seem to value suggestions for improvement. Salary and benefits are competitive
good,"Last 5 years of employment, I worked remotely from home. "
good,overall good experience was able to learn a lot from the team members and management. really enjoyed my time there. Although a lil stressful with cashing out at the and of the day.
good,"Felt like a family environment. "
good,"The entry is easy and the work culture and environment is also great but once you decide to leave, the exit is very time consuming unfair and pathetic. "
good,very flexible work arrangements.  Senior compliance officers know their job well and share their talent throughout the bank.  Compliance had gone through many phases.
good,"Good Work Place, great learning opportunities, and fantastic exposure, good growth in learning and vast opportunities across the globe, however, the transparency needs more to be worked on at middle managers"
good,Lots of different departments to always keep things interesting. Global bank where you are offered the ability to work with people anywhere. They want to see people grow and develop.
good,"Citi group offers amazing benefits regarding dental, health and eye. The benefits start day one. "
good,I enjoyed my time there.   The benefits package was outstanding.   The work at times was somewhat chaotic but I enjoyed that aspect of it.   It made the shift go by quicker.    Unfortunately Citi decided to outsource majority of their transaction services jobs to a 3rd party.   Up until that point I would say it was a place I could of seen myself working for many more years.
good,The team I worked with rises to the enormous challenges within a global framework. They are very talented and hard working. It does come at a cost that work/life balance will suffer. It was very normal to work 12 hours days. Often times I would not come home untill 1 - 2 am in the morning.
good,I have worked for Citibank.The work pressure is unhealthy here because it becomes a 12 hour shift.The shift timings don't have any cycle so this is my experience.
good,"Typical day at work is fairly busy, as is everyone. The management is hit or miss. The culture Citi has built could be great, but they say one thing and do another. If they actually did what they said it would easily be the best place to work. the most enjoyable part of the job is the fact that I know i got to help people."
good,Most managers and genuinly helpful and want to see you succeeded as it is a reflection of then. Continuous training and strick adherence to daily time on phone. Fair amount of paid time off and possible schedule flexing. Monthly Bonuses is what makes the job worth it but you have to work hard to secure it.Onsite child care is awesome but pricey!
good,persona con amplia capacidad y experiencia en el are financiera
good,"I really enjoyed the people on my team."
good,be ready to work for less than the completion.  Had issue with company they used for disability benefits. Lost job after 9 years of service. Not a place I would recommend.
good,"Citi bank , is very good place to work ."
good,Citi has great training programs that will help you in your career.  Opportunity for advancement if you work smart. Work life balance was difficult to achieve.
good,"It's a good place to get started, and the advancement opportunities are there for those willing to put in effort.  The upper management within my department leaves something to be desired, though. My immediate supervisor was always working to help me achieve my goals, but those above her really didn't seem to care about their people. Overall the company as a whole definitely does care, I just think I wound up in the wrong area."
good,Citi is a great place to work but unfortunately direct management can poison and toxicate the work culture and deter you on long term. With proper people management you could fly on your wings but the current one deters and make good employees quit.
good,"Nothing Much to learn"
good,I am grateful to CITi for giving me an oppurtunity to work on critical processes which has further broadened my knowledge on Investment banking which will boost my career moving forward
good,"Salary Compensation as per your qualification."
good,"Job Culture is good, We get many things to learn and it develop us quite much. I have learned robotics process to easy working of trade documents, thank u"
good,"Check all the emails"
good,"Citi is a decent employer, with good work life Balance. In certain positions it will allow individuals to work remotely. However that Depends on the Manager."
good,"Worked with them as a Vehicle Loan collector."
good,"The pay here could be more, The management is definitely poor. You don't receive benefits until a certain time, It does balance out with your day-to-day life."
good,"I have work for Citi for 3 years and it has been a good experience so far with plenty of opportunities to learn and develop if you are willing to go the extra mile, sometimes it can be really hectic but they open opportunities for new talent."
good,Agradable ambiente. Con excelentes compañeros de trabajo. Posibilidades de aprender. Comodidad. Descanso.
good,"Work was fun and colleagues were good but there werent any bonus for 3 years and no salary hike and career advancement opportunities, which led me to look out"
good,"I love my team. All of them are very friendly and supportive. The workload is okay, my unit manager is very helpful and funny. He always encourage me to do good."
good,One of best MNC to work for. Typically you will experience the international culture in the bank. Very stress and little less in the work life balance. However best pay master
good,I loved working at Citi because it was in a very diverse setting. We all learn so much from each other. Pay and benefits are decent.
good,the company offers good compensation package and good working environment. They provide thorough training to make you ready for production endorsement
good,"The pay is ok at Citi, long hours with overtime for half of the month.  There is no work life balance.  Limited advancement as well.  They live to hire outside people instead of promoting current employees.  Some managers are very nice but some are horrible."
good,Citigroup is a terrific organization for exposure to the financial services industry at a global scale.  There are plenty of opportunities to advance your career and to connect with highly talented professionals.  The hardest part about the job is the demand on your time.  Global company with high goals also means hard work and long hours on the job.
good,A gerencia fica a desejar muito. Porém a estrutura de RH e os processos funcionam muito bem.
good,"Work culture, Learning opportunities and Management involvement is very good. Place to give your best to enhance the process by using your technical skills."
good,Career advancement is base on merit - SOP driven. Must be able to multitask and manage assignment in accordance to regional guide. Great place to build your career
good,"Good people and balanced life ."
good,"Citibank operated a highly structured IT environment with clear processes and procedures in place.  Excellent training and documentation.  "
good,It was a fun place to work with great bonus structures. I would love to return back as an employee. The benefits were great as well!
good,"Good place to work, secure environment, good working culture."
good,"The position I was holding for this particular company consisted of incoming calls and emails, and properly assisting clients through necessary company portals. At times, the most difficult part of the job was knowing that certain clients could not be verified in our systems, which in return meant we was not able to assist them with their requests without transferring them to the proper department. The fact that I was not able to finish what I started bothers me, yet company policies must be upheld at the highest level in order for any business to thrive properly. Management was very caring and helpful. I was able to learn a lot from my main managers. They were in a position where they would be able to take employees on a one on one to determine if any improvements are needed and then provide proper feedback so the employee can complete their task with extreme detail and confidence."
good,Great company to work for with a multitude of benefits.  My only complaint is the ability to grow within the organization. The job I have is pretty mundane and I would love to explore more for career growth.
good,has to be proactive in the project team to accomplish our roles and responsibilities. Should be stretchable if the work is more.
good,"Everything is learned at this job, you learn something new everyday."
good,"My experience was in indirect auto lending in Houston, TX.  Mangers were great and it was a fun place to work at.  Very high pace and volume.  Requirement was to do 200 applications a day."
good,"O ambiente é saudável, ético e existe coleguismo e filosofia de trabalho em equipe."
good,Great place to work but doesn't accommodate people with younger kids I am currently working 3:30pm to 12am Sunday through Thursday and I barely have time for the family I have.
good,"Citi was very large, well funded firm. I has a worthwhile experience working there and have been at various Wall Street firms over my career. I would like to continue to another firm"
good,Citi's world wide base is why I was interested in working for the organization.  I have been with Citigroup for almost 8 years.  During this time I have grown as individual and grown with the company.  I have learned pros and cons on how to help support managing a team as well as meeting metrics.
good,"Good company with positive attitude to learn and grow. "
good,clearly defines job expectations and you are encouraged to manage your department as if were your own company.  Citi awards based on performance and has appropriate training to help you succeed.
good,Citibank started out being a great company to work for. They treated their employees well with good benefits and a positive work environment. In 2008 the benefits become horrible and costly. I had not planned on leaving Citibank but as they say the C in Citi stands for change and was laid off.
good,I was completing my total daily task in 2 hours time with no errors; yet a full-time job so spent many hours in the mail room for Citi  as that was only place they could find work for me for rest of day.
good,C'est un tres bonne ecole pour apprendre les ressources humaines. Toutes les employees travailent comme un grand famille
good,It is my understanding that a lot has changed since I worked for Citi.  I therefore feel that I would no longer be qualified to review the work environment there.
good,"I have been employed with Citi for 5 years to date.  over the years I have learned the products we offer at HR Shared Services and how citi does business by always adhering to the our culture.  Citi has been a great place to work but I feel that I need more of a challenging position that will align with my Degree and skills."
good,"I had a very successful run, and was really doing well until the down turn of the economy, and the business line had to make a difficult decision."
good,"Wonderful family activities frequently. Great presence in the community.  Probably one of the most diverse corporations in Jacksonville. Pay is not great, vacation time is one of the best. "
good,"Empresa dinâmica, agradável de se trabalhar, um pouco confusa na atribuição de responsabilidades."
good,"Great beginner job straight out of high school with no experience, but small room for advancement unless you know someone at Citi"
good,let truck into fenced delivery area. meeting new people ever day. hours I worked was great for me because I liked working nights.
good,To work with citigroup was great pleasure. Citigroup being No.1 in Trade Finance help me grab good exposure about diversified products. The training Programs designed for employees help them to keep themselves updated with current market trends. Various event held at citi helps employees to stay active and lively by taking part in the same. Overall experience with Citigroup was a joy ride.
good,"Excelente empresa para desenvolver uma carreira profissional. Como toda e qualquer multinacional muitas de suas decisões e aprovações são regionais, ou seja, levam um pouco mais de tempo para serem aplicadas mas, por outro lado, se mostram mais solidas e concretas"
good,"Trabalhei por quase 6 anos nesta instituição, onde tive oportunidade de aprender muito, num ótimo clima de trabalho, pessoas com boa formação, acesso a muitas informações e boa gestão."
good,"Citi is a great place to work in the location I am in. Great cafeteria, and even have a gym onsite."
good,"Good training, and great management, growing quickly, and some growing pains. Creates new goals for everyone when transitions are made. One of the largest organizations to work for, so some room for advancement. I didn't like the low match for 401K or that they only match a lump sum once a year. Or that there is no in house Human Resources. Many good benefits but it is difficult to use them all because you have do it on your own time long hold times etc with the outsources company. No incentives with HomeDepot portfilio. There are incentives with Sears and Collections, but you have to reapply essentially and be retrained. Calls have to avg 240 seconds or less. So a lot of info to cover in a small time."
good,"Good place to work, great people, good pay and benefits.   Opportunity for advancement is limited. Better recruiting needed"
good,"I worked for card department in Columbus, besides the massive layoff that I was affected by I enjoyed my job and the people I worked with. loved our departments management team an the work life balance."
good,"i learn a lot here, like how the company is about and the letter of credit process of transactions. people here are friendly and helpful.they been teach me a lot and been patient to me.. i felt like in a family when working here. it is such a great experience."
good,"Citimortgage is extremely innovative, always looking for the next best way to complete what we are currently completing in our organizations.  We constantly are changing the way we operate, the way we think, the way we get the job done.  "
good,"Over all Management is good."
good,"My only complaint would be that the managers are really not very good.  More about office politics and really sucking up to folks to get a position, positions were not earned on merit. Besides that Citi was a great place to work, great benefits and work life balance."
good,"Durante casi 14 años en el Service Center de Citibank en Barcelona  encontré ,en lineas generales ,un buen ambiente de trabajo, con una especial atención al balance vida laboral/vida personal ."
good,"Citi really cares about its employees. There are always functions and events going on almost weekly."
good,"What I learned at Citibank it gave me the exposure of being a Personal Banker, to be able to sell Insurance products and banking products."
good,Citibank was strong into the subprime mortgage market. The mortgage group was very focused on reducing delinquency. The focus was always on effecting the reduction in delinquency.
good,Work environment is laid back as long employees are making production standards.  Have to perform various different types of job function other than their own. The only stressful part of the job is there's a constant change of management and with new management comes new rules and procedures.
good,"Good co-workers "
good,"It's a great place if you want to stay with a company and develop yourself for a long term."
good,"I believe that its up to the individual to make the best of their work environment and relationship with their own manager and co-workers. Overall, they are a fair company and treat their employees with dignity, but sometimes we have a manager or employee that is not inline with that culture."
good,"this was a fun place to work for management was easy going, colleagues were pleasant ,and the job was low stress while not being repetitive at the same time every day there was something new to learn and a willingness to teach from management"
good,Working for Ciit has been an enjoyable experience and provided me with what I had been looking for in a career in HR. Citi offers many opportunities for those who choose to advance within the company
good,Work culture in citi bank is good.I learned decent dressing style  learned time management while office hours .managements is good because it follows open door policy which is very helpful for employees .Hardest part is approval on loan and card applications takes lot of time.
good,"Good benefits, Nice environment, Management not always knows what they are doing, too many organisational changes, not very open to life balance."
good,"Everyday is different."
good,"Citigroup is an ok company to work for, I spent the last 12 yrs there, you can learn alot but its difficult to receive the pay you want."
good,"Typical day at work is check your status on production needed that day and manage employees to ensure goals are met. If goals are not met that day, I had to work pass hours of operation or adjust hours as needed to ensure effort is made."
good,"A place that was a complete package of challenges pertaining to a new start up, its implementation and successful management."
good,The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to help customer stay in there home instead of losing it in foreclosure. I love to help people if I can and that was awesome at the end of the call to have a customer satisfied. A typical day at work was answering inbound calls of clients who was looking for assistance on there mortgage loan and we went through a series of programs that they may qualify for to bring them current on the loan or get a reduction so they can maintain the mortgage. I really enjoyed working along side my colleagues and learning from them. The hardest part of the job was not being able to help the customer with any program for them to remain in the home.
good,A typical day at work is handling over 85 accounts ensuring that the customer's documentation meet the guidelines for possible short sale on their home. Learned to handle customers and manage my time as best as possible in addition to work as stress free as possible and work with handling my home life. Management depending on the manager you would have to learn from them and also make sure that you produced as per position guidelines. The hardest part of the job is to keep up with the job and not having it interfere with my family life. Co-workers good nature and willingness to assist each other when needed. We had a great relationship.
good,"Very busy place, learned to be patient, management is supportive, co-workers are great.The hardest is to feel like you are as on assembly line. The best is people who works to."
good,"Good global presence investment bank with exposure to multiple cultures & technologies.  But not very strong management team, in particular SMT & middle management."
good,This is my first job when i started this job its a tough task for me but by the time passing i have learnt a lot. This is total a pure market sales job on daily basis you have to meet some different peoples and connivance them to buy your product. I have learnt to how to connivance the peoples. Our management is very good. My co-workers are very cooperative they guide me help me to achieve the goals. Hardest part of my job is to connivance the peoples to buy your product. Mos enjoyable part of my life is June 2007 when i got 50 thousand cash bonus on achieving my sales target.
good,"Great working environment, good place to learn and grow. Learned a lot as an intern, and a great experience working in China."
good,I really enjoyed my job at citi it was a good business in the beginning as time went on there were a lot of changes to the company and work environment. The hours i worked were from 6 30am to 5pm or until the express mail was done for the day on Sunday thru Wednesday and overtime on when available. The managers of the department were very good and able to handle all of their duties as well as employees complaints in a timely manner. I was able to get along with everyone i worked with it really was like a team effort not just 1 or 2 trying to get the job done.
good,"As a mid-level manager, work weeks were always 45+ hours. You learned many 'work around' tasks as it was sometimes tedious to get assistance from team members out side of your division. "
good,Good company with upward mobility if you work hard.  It is a pretty laid bag place to work.  Good work/life balance if you need  it.
good,Its a good company to work for. Incentive plan is not so lucrative but work/life balance is not bad. systems need an upgrade.
good,Pleasable workplace environment. Is currently there on a short term contract that will end up by the end of the year working on hadoop technologies.
good,"->Good training faculty"
good,"The people make it a great place to work.  But a third party company took over and made it hard to want to be there.  The director is useless and doesn't hold our back, which makes it hard."
good,"biggest challenge and issue is around the management perspective of the particular group.  Role is excessively rigid without a true reason behind it as group is the last one in the pecking order of the entire department. "
good,"I have a Baccalaureate in Business Management from the University of Phoenix. For the past 7 years as an Assistant Vice President (A.V.P.) at Citi, my expertise has involved leading Customer Care call centers in various capacities, ranging from Team Manager to Business Analyst. I also have several years of experience as a Technical Support Manager with specific exposure in Project Management. In total, I have 22 years of management proficiency focusing on people and process management."
good,"1. Since it is sales, you have lot of freedom at work, you can explore your own kingdom,earn money."
good,Bom ambiente de trabalho. A empresa se preocupa com o conhecimento dos funcionários disponibilizando treinamentos.
good,Co workers were great. Bosses were great. Management needs work.  Hardest part of the job was being laid off due to my boss retiring. Constant stream of new workers day in and day out.
good,"Being a teller is rather mundane, but it has it's perks. Flexible scheduling, decent pay. Management at my particular branch is effective and creates a little bit of a ""looser"" environment which is nice. The hardest part of the job is just doing the same thing over and over again, with out any real break in the repetition. The nest part of the job is some of the regulars. I wish the opportunities for advancement were better, and even if not that, then more than a $00.11 raise would be nice."
good,"This is an overall good company for the right person. A typical day is pretty much spent on the phone talking to thousands of people from around the world. I learned a great deal about interest, APR rates, Card security and how much team work is needed to have a functional banking company. Management all depends on which section you work in, some are laid back, fun and outgoing, others are strictly there to make the job about the job. Coworkers are easy to get along with and sometimes you can turn to them to ask a question if needed. The hardest part of the job is being driven to get Balance Transfer(BTs), and working the late shift. third shift or overnight shift can be very difficult. Yes balance transfers are big part of the sales job, and its what makes the bank money. Its not always easy but if you don't mind asking the same questions over and over and are quick with a mouse to navigate multiple screens, then this is the job for you. One of the most enjoyable parts of the job is how open and respectable everyone is at this site no matter if it is just the janitor or the General manger of the company everyone is treated equally to the point of most of the time you don't even know that your talking to someone who has been with the company for 30 years making 6 figures a year, they all participate and volunteer at events making it very involved in the community. All in all, if you can read exactly what you see on the screen and work at a moderate pace Citi can be a great place for those who thrive in this type of environment."
good,"•	Managing Basel III/CRD IV regulatory changes and system enhancements including CVA, JTD, SWWR, DFC, and RWA."
good,A typical day at will consist of continuous response to customers and management via email and phone. Meeting the needs of the customers by being an advocate for the loan request. Working with customer to gather the necessary documentation for the operations staff. I continue to develop time management skills to provide a consistent level of customer service to all clientele. The hardest part of the job is the stress and heavy workload required. I do enjoy dealing with the customers day in and day out to accomplish their objective in regards to home finance.
good,My issues with Citibank stem directly from poor management issues created by a bad corporate culture. Typical workday was good. My Senior Manager created a hostile work environment.
good,"A typical day began with me pulling the previous day numbers and forwarding to upper management for their morning meetings. I learned how to read appraisals, title reports, and credit reports. The best part of the job was receiving a call or letter acknowledging the great customer service they received from CitiMortgage's  representatives."
good,Good family oriented company.  Good benefits.  Great location.  Prefer better opportunity for advancement.  Company needs to have more levels to advance to within a position.  Company also needs to upgrade their technology.
good,Benefits are competitive especially their vision plan.  Compensation is not competitive as you will need to meet and achieve goals on a branch level to enjoy compensation.
good,"hard work"
good,"Citi is a great place to work due to global growth opportunities it offers. Lots of opportunity to grow & develop your skills in different businesses of Citi. Wonderful training program to enhance skills."
good,Typical call center environment. Lots of employees to very little management. Face paced sales environment with very few breaks or time away.
good,"No one micromanages you.  They let you do your work and leave you be.  Managers are very helpful and very approachable. But I do wish I had remote access and they are a little weird with that. "
good,"Reviewing reports, delinquency goals, loan goals. I assigned work to the other employees and evaluated their job performance. Managed a portfolio of borrowers in excess of 15 million. Long hours to achieve company goals, but good benefits."
good,"Ambiente bem rígido, competitivo, agressivo. Quem busca desafios extremos e não possui muito comprometimento familiar, é um bom lugar para se galgar expertise, experiência e crescer. Do contrário, se está em busca de equilíbrio entre o profissional e o pessoal, não seria uma empresa adequada. Salário e benefícios excelentes."
good,"Benefits are pretty good and pay is decent,. But dealing with angry nasty people everyday is not worth the headache"
good,"Citi es mi segundo hogar, tengo mas de dos años trabajando ahí, más de diez horas cada día. Aprendí a lidiar con los clientes, ponerme en su sitio y reconocer sus necesidades para brindarle un mejor servicio de atención con calidad, aprendí a trabajar en equipo, ayudarnos mutuamente porque juntos somos una unidad con el objetivo de lograr que cada uno de nuestros clientes salga con una sonrisa en la cara. Lo más difícil, en realidad riesgoso, es trabajar manejando dinero hay que estar sumamente concentrado. Citi es una empresa mundial que me dio la oportunidad de crecer profesionalmente, conocer tantos clientes con distintas caracteristicas, compañeros de trabajo que me enseñaron y capacitaron para volar sola, ahora tengo la certeza que debo volar más alto y enfocarme en mi desarrollo personal para fortalecer mi desarrollo profesional continuando mis estudios."
good,"Great management but too many managers, lots to learn, total self-control over your results. Not necessary to waste resources on more managers than actual employees."
good,There is no dull moment at work. Always busy and resolving issues. Past faced environment. Good place to work for and benefits are good as well. Co-workers are helpful when needed. The hardest part of the job was having a work life balance. The most enjoyable part of the job was helping the business users and success projects. Management would've done better in making sure the employees morale are good.
good,I work for this employer for 8 years aside from me being laid off I enjoyed the environment and got a lot of experience.
good,"As the lead teller I have many responsabilities like supervising teller staff, assisting in the coaching, training and the development of tellers, ordering and maintaining vault cash."
good,"My typical day consist of gathering and researching all new written correspondence and distributing work to fellow co-workers. Also responding to clients via email, phone, fax or written correspondence and also be able to communicate and work well with fellow team peers. Reviewing cases and closing out on a timely deadline. I have learned a variety of different computer systems and have also trained other staff members. The hardest part of my job would most likely be gathering all paperwork for our department packing into boxes and carrying them to our storage room the boxes tend to be pretty heavy. What I do enjoy about my job is the interaction with my team and clients."
good,"Moving into the IT world from Customer Service Call Center was a big change, I was brought it for people skills/management, not IT knowledge."
good,The company provides you enough exposure to be able to master and expand your skillsets.
good,"lots of picnic style meetings.  they spend a lot of time asking for employee opinions, unfortunately they never follow up.  Managers are hired to positions over work groups without any knowledge of what the work group does.  It is the biggest negative for the company."
good,"Already had reviewed this job"
good,"It was typical call center work."
good,"It is a good place to start your career."
good,A very big work load. I break up my day in 3 segments in order to be consistent with the work flow.
good,"I have learned an enormous amount regarding mortgages and organization of data management.  A typical day includes pulling daily reports, calling customers to provide updates and request documentation required for their loan, following up with vendors including Title Companies, Appraisal vendors, Loan Officers, and Underwriters.  Knowledge of investor guidelines in order to be proactive and request all needed information from the client up front to minimize the redundancy throughout the process.  Scheduling loans for closing and following up with clients once they've closed on their loan to make sure everything went smoothly."
good,"great team work, supplies readily available to help with your tasks. management sometimes takes awhile to get answers to your questions."
good,"In the past three years I have increased my skill-set ten-fold.  Supplier Risk, procurement, business continuity planning & execution.  Being on the front lines when the OCC published their latest supplier standards (with an OCC review previously scheduled) would have taken years to learn in a classroom or with a smaller, less complex organization.  I am grateful to have had so many opportunities to learn and deploy."
good,No other position that I have held over my career has taught me so much on how to lead.  To my colleagues and friends I have gained over the years has become invaluable. Great place to work if you are looking for good compensation.
good,It was a 24/7 facility where embossing machines were used to process credit cards. Cross trained in Insertion and Vault area. Co-workers were like family. Company involved in volunteer activities in local metroplex.
good,"Review compliance issues, work with underwriters and processors to fix issues. Run reports and send to management and investors. "
good,"Educational Loan Financial Management System is a web based comprehensive software package supporting Student Financial Aid Administration, Loans and Reports.

This application completely web enabled the process of loan applying to loan repayment of a customer"
good,A typical day starts with taking over from a previous shift. I have learned how to handle problems an issues in a clam way. My co-workers were wonderful prople and I will miss them
good,Everyday was there was something new. Review the previous day task and prepare for the day had in store. Your could learn for anyone on the floor there's was know department you couldn't reach out to.
good,I learned skills in handling difficult accounts and multiple laws for credit lending. My co-workers were always easy to get along with and there was always a fun work environment.  The hardest part of my job was handling calls in a timely manner and keeping all policy and procedures in place for difficult account issues.
good,"not much to say.  Management did not keep us abreast of the move and lost many."
good,Great place to work for as long as they have enough positions available high turn around rate. Laid off over 100 employees.

good,"Great people to work with, New things to learn everyday, the pay is good, management is ok but not very involved."
good,"When I first started at CitiI had all the faith in the world that Citi was my home, and I my career there would be fruitful. After 12 months of employment I have no idea how Citi operates under such dysfunction and has even surpassed its competitiors in the industry."
good,"The overall experience was good, however, I wanted more from a professional point. There were minimal opportunities to grow and maximize my potential."
good,"I monitored, managed, maintained, identified, escalated and assist in the recovery of all distributed batch processing in a fast pace multi-region/business environment to ensure all quality initiatives and service level objectives were achieved daily. My acquired abilities were to execute and assist in pre-determining applications, business, and technical services implementations into the various command center platforms.

Researched and reviewed any new and or existing processes for automation improvements and assist in the design and implementation of enhancements to eliminate manual intervention. Opened and followed up trouble tickets in virtual tech and informational management."
good,This position allowed me to develop my Project Management skills though on the job assignments.  I worked as both an individual contributor working my own projects and as a part of a larger team working on Global initiatives.
good,Primer trabajo que me enseño a mi desarrollo y crecimiento en varias areas.
good,"Citibank is a great company overrall. The bank industry is rather difficult to be in these days due to the economic times. I started 4 years ago, and things were 100% different. The benefits and stability keep me here, but I definitely am wanting to spread my wings into something more. Each year a new head honcho starts and changes everything we just had gotten used too. The hardest part is the gallup surveys, you could be doing the best job possible; someone willr ate you an 8 and your good job gets thrown out the window. The banks are struggling and working in the enviroment is apparent. I come to work every morning doing the best job I can with what I can work with. My customers have to be the most enjoyable part of the job, sure people are stressed about money but when I remind them everyone is.. they leave with a smile. Ive learned a lot working here, especially since I started when I was 19, two main components would be punctuality and self responsibility."
good,"What I learned at citibank was Quality Assurance. Before I had this job I knew nothing about quality assurance. My co-workers are great, if I need something they would help me and if they need my help I do my best to assist them. Hardest part of this job was getting something tested right for a project because it was new code and nothing usually worked perfectly right away."
good,"Boa empresa, com ótimos benefícios (inclusive 14º salário). Aprendi muito, tanto em atendimento, quanto em vendas. "
good,Workplace that encouraged learning and upward movement. Performed audits of loan applications for compliance with state and federal laws. I enjoyed auditing ARM loans.
good,Wachovia was the absolute best company to work for! When it came to balance and life changes it wasn't the best.
good,"Ran meetings most of the day.  The hardest part was coordinating meeting within the global time zones.  Worked many nights which was morning somewhere else.  "
good,"My typical work day was to manage the pipeline of the employee's I managed and insure my market was meeting our goals in loan file quality and customer service. In addition, I was responsible for marketing, recruiting and managing employee's, establishing relationships with other mortgage and real estate professionals in the Dallas/Ft. Worth Markets."
good,"working in cpa shop"
good,"A typical day at work would include underwriting loans, training and supporting newer underwriters, loan officers,and processors."
good,I enjoyed working for this company very much. It started to go downhill for me once my manager started doing unethical things.
good,Job is repetitious.  I felt as if the job was constant favoritism.
good,"Citibank was an excellent place to work.  Unfortunately the site where I worked closed.  I was a mortgage processor, I processed refinance and purchase loans, which included customer service.  I worked quickly and efficiently as my pipeline was in excess of 50+ loans. .  I am fluent in Spanish which was helpful with our Spanish speaking clients.  I am a team player and helped my team mates whenever possible."
good,Challenging enviroment.  Have to be very good to succeed.  Lot's of work with lot's of deliverables.
good,"I had several positions within employment with Citi"
good,Managed and Administered Security Platforms across the globe.
good,Running a dialer system for the nation to insure that reps get calls to them.
good,"Provide exceptional customer service during inboud/outbound calls, emails and regular mail. "
good,"Review files seeing what is going on if the client is planning on repairing the property. Review to see if the insurance check was deposited and it is available to to see if we can send out a check for the client to give to their contractor or if they are self repair. "
good,I really enjoyed working for Citi. There are a lot of great people that work there.
good,"Computer skills, management and marketing skills, site and market strategy skills"
good,Even though Citi was cutting jobs and services in Canada they made every effort to communicate upcoming changes to affected employees and help them prepare for the change.
good,I would start my day preparing files for the attorneys to prepare for court I would pull from the report and learn how credit is especially important the hardest part of the job was trying to get everything done the most enjoyable of the job was the lunch in the cafeteria and pay day
good,"Management didnt know very much well the branch manger didn't, and the assistant branch manager knew more that the branch manager. Felt professional and there's room for advancement."
good,I liked being able to service my customers and liked being able to help them in all ways possible. I wish we would have had more available to be able to help our customers.
good,Good company to work with. Good opportunity to move from within.
good,The mail comes in and it will get sorted to different agency. Once the mail leaves the mail room we process applications scan them and key the customers information into the computer system. My coworkers work together as a team to get worked processed.
good,"I gained a variety of experiences the seven years I was employed with the employer. I excelled on the financial/collections aspects of business. On the terms of banking and mortgage, I mastered the techniques to progress to team lead."
good,Meeting new people and giving solutions to different kinds problems being faced by our customers.
good,"Designed developed, maintained and tested universes for supporting Ad hoc and canned reports and implemented advance features such as aggregate awareness, context, etc. Created various classes and objects for Universe. Measure, Dimension and Detail objects were achieved.Created the Repository structure to manage the security and deployment options throughout the installation.Created & tested the universe for other reports using Business Objects functionality like Queries, Slice and Dice, Drill down, @Functions, Formulae etc"
good,"Great daycare and benefits"
good,"On a typical day at work I would answer calls. Assist customers with issues, and solve their problems.  I enjoyed working for this company.  It is a fast paced work environment.  I was able to set my own schedule.  I learned many things about the banking industry."
good,Work hard but supported by managers/ supervisors. Good team spirit and cooperation.
good,"Great place to work, servicing client personal accounts with Citibank."
good,good place to work and learn. i have learned many new technologies reached high expectations .
good,"A instituição oferece todo suporte necessário para o profissional , desde ferramentas de trabalho até treinamentos, que são excelentes ! A valorização do profissional  também é constante, porém, existe uma cobrança extraordinária do retorno profissional."
good,Team oriented environment customer service with a BIG emphasis on sales. Went from working at physical location to a work from home position. Sales bonuses were about 1000 per month but had to jump through hoops to get them and meet certain criteria. One bad email survey could make you lose 100's of dollars on bonus and you had little control over those.
good,"On a cultural evening we had Month end deliverable. I was d cultural head. Both being important in their respective places. What I learned was Time management without compromising on Quality. The day was quite hectic but I had to prove that a responsibility taken has to be completed despite all the obstacles. But again the entire thing went on smooth because of team work and co-operation. Hardest part was to deal with the pressure and crisis of the situation but the most enjoyable part was when I met the SLA and also the cultural program came to an end. All went good and by the end both the Clients(On-shore team,Investment Managers and the Audience) were happy and satisfied. That is the ultimate outcome."
good,When I first started I was a print operator.  I was able to gain leadership experience at that position and was able to become a lead operator.  From that role I was able to advance to an Operations Assistant.  My co-workers were very supportive of each other and were pushing each other to succeed in their roles.  I enjoyed working there and the skills I was able to learn at that company.  Management was always changing that was one negative in my opinion as you were always having to learn other management styles in your department.
good,"If you do a great job, it will be recognized.  I was given awards, thank you letters from top management, and even awarded a trip.  The benefits were good and the compensation was great for most of my career.  In an effort to reduce staffing, Citi drastically cut wages to encourage attrition.  The facility had a cafeteria, massage services, and workout facilities.  It was located close to Keller Graduate School where I was taking classes."
good,"Citi is the excellent place of new opertunity, lots of new technology to learn, and every day new challenge to take during support work."
good,"-My experience consists of cash handling and very detail oriented work."
good,"Have to stretch yourself to meet the dead lines"
good,If you like to sit at a computer and talk to people all day this is a great job.
good,"-Policy interpretation and enforcement depends on the unit manager which is often a double edged sword."
good,"My day as a Fraud Analyst was to audit ""Account Block Packages"".  When there is fraud detected on a clients against, either by the client or someone else, the analyst ""blocks"" the account to ensure that no further activity or loss can occur.  The process of blocking an account and all otyher account relations has to be followed by strict policy & procedures to protect the client and the bank.  One of my primary task each day was to perform an audit on each block package to ensure that all policy and procedures were followed correctly and submit to the analyst who blocked the account, any corrections that needed to be made in order to pass a compliance audit."
good,"Overall, not a bad place to work if you enjoy the call center environment.  They're located in Tampa and I live in Orlando and that's why I couldn't stay"
good,"I interned with Citi's International Franchise Management division.The IFM group is small and you'll have the opportunity to interact and learn from senior management. "
good,"Worked in different areas spaning 14 years from Data entries, Reconciling Brokerage, Nostro balances, Investigating none or late payments, Reconciliation of accounts for the different Treasury Products."
good,"Citi Financial was an MNC company and part of city group. now it has been closed due to some inappropriate reasons. I have worked there as an operation executive. It was the job which taught me how to handle pressure in any situation in job, i manage my daily routin with this job even i can say that i have manage my life with this job. I worked there during my studies, i had passed my examination with A grade and also get a better employee reward in this organization, the management, all my colleagues was well mannered and supportive they always intensify my working skills and want to me as such a very good position in life. "
good,"They are helping in studies, everything has it's procedure and place."
good,"Great company to work for. Not much opportunity for advancement, but still would love to be working there. Was outsourced during joint venture of Smith Barney/Morgan Stanley."
good,"In depth knowledge of Domain."
good,"Inbound call center, sharpened my customer service skills. Management was very relaxed. Co-workers made the job fun, team environment. Hardest part of the job was redundant, same thing everyday. Prizes and compensation for good #'s was best part of job, along with fantastic health benefits."
good,"O Citibank é uma otima empresa, onde você tem total tranquilidade para trabalhar, e que tem total suporte para desenvolver sua tecnicas, porem na parte de crescimento profissional, o Citi peca um pouco, são poucas as oportunidades para promoções e crescimento."
good,"Employees must be energetic and multi-task well."
good,Citi is a good company. It has a  harmony working environment. Peers are helping each others in problem solving. Citi used to conduct  intensive job-related training for its employees to enhance their skill sets. The culture of company are strong hold by management and shared to all employees. 
good, 
good,"Inside Citigroup can be intimidating for those used to a smaller environment. One of my responsibilities was to support several critical applications. "
good,"Citibank is a very diverse place to work. The Division leaders can be a little more motivating but overall, a nice place to work. "
good,Pays well for performance driven individuals. Sr. Management lets you run your own operation as long as your are meeting the targets set. 
good,"A typical day at work consists of customer service and a drive for sales in bank products. As the company strives for an increase in sales, many positions are being discontinued. The hardest part of this job is being heavily relied on as the ""go-to"" person to perform cutomer service/sales and not enough assistance to meet deadlines and goals."
good,"Overall it is a good place to work, my only concern was that it was a temporary job, and there was no clear date on when will we become permanent employees."
good,Citi has great compensation and benefits! This is a great place to work if you are starting out in entry level work.
good,nice environment
good,"The company has gone through some tough financial times. I am sure the company was once great, such as when the stock price was in the $50's (not including 10:1 reverse splits), but since 2008 there has been huge cuts in staffing and compensation (salary and bonuses) and promotions are few and far between. It seems you get to management by being a survivor and working here for 20+ years. Those days are over, so if you're looking to move up from the mailroom to management, look elsewhere. Now you must be hired into management for Citi from another company."
good,Los días de trabajo son básicamente todos iguales dependiendo del volumen de transacciones del/los días a procesar con un ambiente muy formal y estructurado.
good,Overall it is a nice bank to work for . The most enjoyable part of the bank is getting to know your client's well . I had great client's . As far as management goes they do have a great team of manager's . A typical day at citi was making deposit's an helping client's with new bank account's not much of wire transfer's we deal more with business clients through out the day . Also a lot of cross sales
good,"I am currently a contractor at Citi. This company is not an easy place to get into because of the strict rules they have in place with recruiting. They prefer to hire on a contractual basis first. My team is a virtual team, we are all spread out over the east coast. I work with Information Security officers as part of the PUMA program. I focus more on developer access to production and how they log onto servers/applications/databases, and migrating them to using more Emergency or Temporary access Tools. I also work with a Center of Excellence focused on data redaction and eliminating self redacting methods for Applications. I am not micro managed within my department due to the nature of the team. I come in everyday and I am expected to produce and not given any set of requires to achieve that goal. This allows for creative freedom on the job and provides great satisfaction in the role that I hold."
good,"Joined a partnership, did all trading of over 300 household accounts including options, 401(k), stocks, bonds, mutual funds. I did all research to recommend which financial instruments to recommend to our clients whether conservative, moderate or aggressive investors. I enjoyed working with people to do IRA rollovers, retirement planning and reaching individual investment goals."
good,Bom lugar de trabalho com visibilidade de mercado e contato direto com profissionais experientes.
good,I've been with this company for four years. They offer excellent benefits .
good,"I have worked for Citi for 9 years. You'll have the issues here that you have at any job, but the benefits package this company offers is the best I have ever had and overall is not a bad company to work for."
good,Nice place to work...great training....great co-workers
good,Learning new Applications
good,"The job at this high end fashion accessories company was to prospect new clients, train existing sales staff at stores carrying the line, count and fill on hand inventory, and show the new lines seasonally either in store or at trade shows. I learned a great deal about relationship selling and growing the business exponentially. I enjoyed 7 years of increases in comp. despite a constantly restructured and dwindling territory."
good,"Learn the culture working in an office environment. There is no dull moment at work, everyday is an opportunity for growth. The managers handle their respective teams well while co-workers are very good team players. Fun place to work in."
good,"A place where many talk of the good old days before their company was acquired by Citi. There is a lot of bureaucracy, red tape. While it's not all bad, some things that sound like they should be easy and same day events involve multi-step processes which require numerous levels of approval and take days or weeks. The good news is there are some who thrive in this environment and are able to advance in the corporate ranks."
good,Hardest part is advancement. Great benifits and off time. co workers were great.
good,Wonderful benefits package. Competitive pay.
good,This was a great place to get my foot in the door. Well organized and management provides good training.
good,I loved working for this company but I was laid off.
good,"Working in Citibank gave me exposure to different markets,inputs about investments,happenings which affects market,experts view on these investments. A lot of learnings in terms of handling High Networth Individuals,how to take care of their investments,sevicing and helping them with different advisory financial solutions."
good,"Citi counts with a diverse environment with a huge geographic reach. Citi's culture is highly demanding which is just great. It continues being one of the best schools for people in the banking industry, as it covers many cultures, businesses, product families and client segments."
good,It was an honnor working here. The only thing I have negative to say is that the job security is at a all time low.
good,See previous review. I like Citi Mortgage very much. Loss mitigation started with the housing crisis. Things changed constantly. Fast paced.
good,Hours are hard to work when you have children and they are not that flexible as they say they are. Exampl 4:30pm to 1:00am
good,"If you can get into a good branch, Citibank can be a very enjoyable company to work for. They have excellent benefits and 401K matching (6%), but the corporate management is horrible. If you're at a branch that buys into the corporate madness, it's miserable."
good,"Enjoyed time with Citi, learned much from some exceptional peers, busy and challenging but able to determine own work-life balance. Downside is that there are too many managers doing too little for the success of individual business lines, causing others to pick up the slack or employees to suffer through poor performance."
good,"A typical day would consist of attending various projects, meetings, BAU, process improvements, system monitoring and ad hoc requests."
good,"preventive maintenance,"
good,"Employees are very under valued across the board. External hires are getting started making more money with now experince. While internal transfers are expected to take lateral moves. Very relaxed mamangement overall, but somethimes that can be a problem and staff take advantage. Then the customer is the one who gets hurt."
good,"The people I worked with and for were a pleasure to be around. However, I found it difficult to maintain and keep up with the financial goals that were set by the company. The goals were never the same, from month to month. Not being able to maintain the high financial goals for 3 consecutive months put me in danger of losing my job."
good,"Working on this company was so much fun and challenging. I learned a lot of things and management also are fair and easy to work with,you can tell them what you need and they value your opinion.The hardest part of the job if we only slow at work but i can still manage my time to make myself busy and productive and i really enjoyed every day of it."
good,Collected on late stage accounts for the Macy's portfolio. Outbound calls. Attempted to contact customers and set them up on payment plans to get them out of collections. Performed skip/trace. Background checks. My manager was decent. She would listen if there were issues or problems that needed attention. I enjoyed all of my team. We got along well and were comfortable to joke around too.
good,This is a production based business that requires alot of attention to detail. It also a great company to join if you want to work by yourself with minimal supervision.
good,"The grouop was great and the atmisphere was great, liked the things that I learned"
good,Love the team lead. Great place to work and make friends. The old management was great did not get the chande to work with the new one. Flexible hours and possibility to work few days from home.
good,"citi bank was a great pllace to work for , they had benifits , comoany partys , raffle giva ways , they had safty meetings , was serious about nature evalcuate the building if an enmergency came about , they had vaction time, i really learned alot about mailroom / operation proccessing skills from them like to process checks , do small time copier jobs , lerned more about adding numbers at the end of the month for the mail machine i got empolyer of the year ,"
good,"very focused on achieving ""the numbers""; short-term results are often more important than longer term product development or enhancements"
good,Citigroup is a good place to work for if you are able to work the hours available.
good,"Job profile is good learnt many things. Multitasking is required"
good,"Working at Citi provided an eye opener into corporate life. The job opportunity gave me an opportunity to meet senior leaders of the corporate security industry. I learnt a lot about corporate management expectations and also learnt to work with cross border teams, which allowed me to understand different cultures."
good,"Working with people with diverse skills and backgrounds make you learn something new every day. Also, the company has all the necessary tools to work with, which make employee productive. Leadership is good and motivating. They encourage you to succeed. Meanwhile, others should know there is no fixed bonus or no bonus at all."
good,"working remotely for managers out of town you have never met before presented challenges which sometimes was the hardest part of the job."
good,The corporate trust business is a strong franchise and is growing. The work is diverse and engrossing but be prepared to work hard. There is little opportunity to work from home.
good,Challenging where you must adapt to many changes. Training in many aspect is provided by the bank. Opportunity to change your job scope within 2 years ( internal transfer).
good,"Working hours are long,  minimal opportunities for new hires  or promotion in certain high cost locations such as New York and London and  surrounding areas.   New York is Headquarters and generally no offices or assigned seating (open Office Plans).  Management Principles are consistently wholesome but consistency is not assured.  Best part of jobs is broad responsibilities and opportunities,  Less excellent  parts are upper management not being in touch with everyday real situations."
good,"It's all about a brand and global presence "
good,"Nice company to start your career. "
good,I would love to work here again. I was a legal intern here and my boss was very understanding. I learned so much and the people were so kind. There were a lot of lawyers that actually inspired me to take up law.
good,"I am still employed at Citi, this is a strong company with excellent beliefs, globally a very supportive place to work, Citi has dedicated to continue their presence in Sioux Falls."
good,I was a contractor my days were pretty busy there was always something that had to be done. Which is a good thing. Everyone was pretty focused on there work which helped us as a team stay focused.
good,It helps me develop myself and my career. Focus and be more motivated to hit the target to have incentives. Learn how to manage time and keep on tract on my daily activity to reach the target
good,Es una buena empresa para trabajar y para aprender pero ya no están en España en el negocio de consumo así es que es complicado trabajar en Citi si no estás dispuesto a salir fuera.
good,"I worked for Citi for over a dozen years.  If not for lay-off, I would probably still be there.  Citi does take great care of employees once lay off occurs. There were good times, great people and not so good times also.  Yet, Citi was an OK place to work."
good,Good company to work for. Benefits and workplace culture are strong points of working with CitiMortgage. I would recommend to anyone looking for a career that will give them the skills they need to advance.
good,I believe Citi is a good place to work and learn new skills. The only thing I do not like is management. I've seen cases where VPs do not do anything the entire day and they get the big bucks.
good,"Nice place to start a career and meet global colleagues. "
good,"Great place to work, decent pay, great benefits, opportunities to move to different departments within Citi. One thing I liked the most was the fact that Citi paid for my education."
good,"If you have a great, supportive manager, you can go far. If you don't, you'll hate every second of it. "
good,Citi is a world wide company that has great benefits. The company is moving in a progressive directions which will be great in the future. If you are in technology or banking this will be the place for you.
good,I worked for Citi for 17 years and had no intentions of leaving but my position was unfortunately eliminated and I was laid off. They offer great benefits the day you start and there are opportunities for advancement if you’re willing to work for it and get in good with the ‘right’ people...
good,"In the morning, I will be assigned to contact customer for service call within stipulated time. In the later part of the day, I have to review investment products documents, monitor rework and follow up. I also perform report review and ensure that audit trail is being followed up. Lastly, i have to prepare reports for branches and other ad hoc duties. The perks on this job is that there are courses to attend funded by the company. There are promotional products only offered to Citi employees."
good,It was a collections job so it could be a little tense at times on the phones but for the most part in my department it was pretty laid back and easy going.
good,This position was a temp position.  I worked a lot of temp positions but none with a Cafe/restaurant in it. The position was not stressful just entering banking info.
good,Citi is a fast paced environment that allows employees to get great experience in a customer service environment. The work is stressful with high compensation.
good,"My career journey with Citi was satisfactory. I started as a Citiphone offficer and now an Operations Manager handling Singapore Telesales.  I had exposure with Australia, United Kingdom and Singapore programs. Part of the exposure includes customer service, sales and risk management. With 10 years of customer service and phone sales experience, i was able to learn the challenges and was part in formulating action plans to address them."
good,There is an intense and productive work environment at Citi. Good place to learn new financial products and tecnhologies
good,"Huge and exciting  place, has ping pong tables to plat on . Has multiple events to join in on daily. And a very safe place to work at ,even in the parking lot ."
good,It was run like a tight ship so some things may have not made sense upon my views to which I would ask a manager for assistance understanding it was a really good job for the money
good,"Understandable security is very important to clients and employees, but I find it amazing the amount of time it takes to get a project done because each task requires involvement from different groups in different countries and timezones.  I assume this is common practice amongst all large companies, but I cannot confirm due to lack of personal experience with other companies."
good,"Good place to get your foot in the door however, there is little to no room for career advancement. The team you work with will be some of the best people you work with but upper management does not know how to treat their employees."
good,"Typical work day would be see what Ops group you are assigned to for the day to run and ensure Sevice level, Occupany, Abandon goals are met. Generally 2 conference calls per day 1 all in conf call in the morning and a 2nd one with Ops (the dept your running for the day) and you would go over the prior days metrics. Nice part about the job is you dont have any work you have to do outside of your shift. But the work can be stressful sometimes depending on the dept your managing for the day (not anymore stressful then other companies) over all good company to work for and I would do it again. Our dept was laid off and our jobs were sent elsewhere."
good,New management has different philosophy.  Was able to work remote but new management believe in more work place collaboration.  Co- worker are the greatest and the reason I was staying with Citi.
good,"For a big company, Citi was good to work for.  Working there provided me with opportunity to learn and grow, making me an excellent marketable candidate to work anywhere."
good,Cit was a good employer for me as I was allowed to work remotely with flexible work hours.  Citi also presented opportunity for learn the Concur Expense reporting application and also provided a wide variety of training opportunities.
good,Citifinancial is now closed. They suffered a big loss and in 2008 and several branches were closed. Amazing colleagues. Great managers. I've learned a lot with them
good,"Global working environment, a company where you can build a career across multiple geographies"
good,"Great teams, and given the right manager you can excel as far as you want to. Lots of education provided and opportunities to help your community. I approve of this company."
good,"工作壓力較大，"
good,"I feel that I have grown here within Citi tremendously for the past 12 years.  Work life balance could be much better, it has gotten a little out of hand.  "
good,Es una empresa que se caracteriza por el excelente esquema de recompensas que beneficia a sus mejores vendedores. No únicamente en forma monetaria si no en otras áreas que generan motivación.
good,My job was sent to india so I was let go. It was very hurtful I would have stayed there otherwise. I really liked what I did there at citi. I had great friends the environment was amazing.
good,"Demanding but fair work environment that teaches one of the expected daily load and quality of the work to be produced for stakeholders and senior management. Large, corporate environment with plenty of opportunity to grow and develop one's skills and experience."
good,"not open to employee opinions and ideas.  You have to participate in ""VOLUNTEER"" programs to  move up.   In other words you are bullied into supporting programs you may not agree with."
good,"The environment is pretty vigorous and rigorous, but one would not expect otherwise given the size and commitment the firm has. It took me some time to settle in and learn the the job."
good,"Apesar de trabalhar com pessoas em sua maioria com mentalidade de call center, por ser uma empresa americana sempre tivemos muito respaldo e suporte para fazer nosso trabalho e eramos valorizando inclusive com viagens ao exterior a trabalho o que só enriqueceu o meu currículo."
good,"Citi provided a career path, and supported a good work life balance for me.  Major pain point was how management handled large scale projects.  This could have been easily avoided."
good,"Typical work day is going to the upper floors with a sheet of boxes with box numbers and shelf locations to be pulled and placed on a pallet for destruction. Once pulled, the pallets are taken down from the bays, assigned a pallet number and the boxes are scanned to that pallet. The scanner is then uploaded to ensure that all the right boxes have been pulled and once verified, the pallets are then wrapped and placed in a separate location to be transported for destruction. "
good,"I gained very good, broad, and valuable experience.  There are very good and dedicated coworkers there.  I was proud to work there, and proud of what I accomplished."
good,"Work-life balance is somewhat of an issue for a lot of the people that work at Citi.  They have a one-size fits all mentality on training and workspace environment. The lack of assigned seating makes actually coming into work a waste of time, as you frequently aren't able to seat with teammates or co-workers. Training for topics that aren't relevant are frequently mandatory. Most days are spent in a series of meetings during the business hours, with people attempting to muti-task in order to get actual work accomplished. Loyalty for employees that remain with the company is rewarded with paltry raises and laughable bonuses."
good,the company will relocate work to cut costs. offered great benefits. previously had daycare on site. hosted plenty of family events. we were all distraught when the site was closed.
good,"Citi is a great place to work for those who love to show up on time, do your work with the highest level of integrity and go home with a feeling you made a difference."
good,"Citi offers one of the best lunchrooms in the Treasure Valley.  The coaching is excellent, even though I felt I had to ask ""what did I do right on this call"" sometimes."
good,"Nice place to work with Citi. Brand name gives you immense pleasure to start your career. We might have a heavy competition. So, we should prove ourself to be on top of the list."
good,"Many Technologies to work with, like Main Frames, Peoplesoft, Check Processing, Teller, TM, etc."
good,"Can be a great place to work and to grow experience wise.  Good access to top professionals to learn from and can be references later on."
good,Nice place to work and they actually promote remote working. In general a good place to work. Plenty of education opportunities. Central Dublin located.
good,Nice place but definitely I want more than that I learned many things I've never had thought worked like that and got more professionals and another experience.
good,"Citi is a good place to work.As with any company it has it good and bad points."
good,"Very fast environment "
good,"The work was challenging which was good. The management of the employee contracts was the reason I left.         "
good,The workplace culture was very good. The management and staff worked well together. Life/work environment was very good. Management did everything possible to allow flexible work schedules when needed.
good,"Citi was by far the best place I worked at because I was exceptional at my job. The only reason I left was because they closed my department and gave zero notice to the employed people within it. The biggest fault was lack of communication from management to employee, resulting in alot of people being forced to quit."
good,"You have to try it for yourself. I am not able describe anything because we all see it different. Citibank is a nice place to work. Every lace has pros and cons, so you just have to try it."
good,"Calling past due "
good,"The training was excellent. They gave you all the tool to succeed. "
good,Solid place to work however advancement has slowed down. Workplace culture is trying to move into a more progressive space and to a more flex work life balance.
good,"From past experiences, Citi was a good employer. The employees appeared to be happy and productivity was good. But alas, like other companies it fell into the downsizing trap."
good,Over all it was very nice working with City. Management policies should be globally uniform and it should be followed by each every one in the organisation.
good,"• Citi is a company which seeks the best from each of its employees."
good,"Friendly team"
good,"Really great company.  Lots of opportunities to advance and learn.  Ended up in the Investment Banking group, fascinating excepting all I did was travel."
good,"High energy, fast paced work environment. Not much of a work life balance. Pay is excellent and I learned a lot. Bankers are nice and friendly. Benefits aren’t the best."
good,The culture at the San Antonio site is fantastic.  There are many fun events going on any given month.  My big complaint is the lack of mobility when compared to other locations.
good,Taking escalated calls from clients and assisting customer service representatives with maintenance on credit card accounts. Difficult listening to people complain all day but coworkers and management are great!
good,It was a nice journey with citi. I would say the process and product at citi is one of the best in market. Good Benefits are available for employees who performs.
good,"Citi is a pretty decent place to work out. It's one of the better paying jobs available. The people are good to work with. The job in itself can be annoying and the opportunities to advance are far and few between. Great benefits, and money though"
good,"Learned valuable experiences and skills. "
good,"We do selling and it was good because you can enhance your skills on how to deal other people or to the client.. We offer the products of Citi like Credit Cards, Loans, extension, etc. .."
good,Citi provides a really laid back work atmosphere.  Extreme leniency.  Only major downfall was the incompetence and biased attitude of management of my team.
good,Citi promotes an environment that allows you to advance your career and grow your knowledge. The encourage hiring within and provide opportunity to those that earn it.
good,Por cuestiones de confidencialidad no puedo hacer comentarios
good,The work environment is very good  and there was a lot of team work and wonderful management although some are not very friendly but overall it was a goo comany.
good,all shifts were 10 hour shifts. 4 days a week. unless you had been working there for a long time. Trying to get a decent schedule was not easy at all. work and life was not an easy balance at all you normally always wind up working at least one weekend day. also the work was exhausting and all they care about is numbers which is typical in a corporate company.
good,"Citi expects you to do your job and in all possible ways to satisfy the needs of the client . There are no office politics, hidden agendas or conspiracies"
good,The company is good to work at. Some recent changes put a lot of pressure on people working here and the salary should be more. Coworkers are great so are UMs
good,"Estuvo bien al principio, luego con la mudanza del edificio, y restructuracion de puestos, no fue tan buena, donde los puestos eran asignados a dedos, por amistades y no por capacidades para los mismos"
good,I love working at Citi but once you feel like you have hit a wall that is pretty much it. if you want to build a career in banking this is where to go. All other banks end up loosing people to Citi. As my years at Citi continue though they are becoming more like the bank I left which is making it hard to stay. if you are new to banking this is where you go because the benefits and coverage are amazing and you will build a family with your co-workers. I would suggest coming in as a personal banker though. the PB have longer hours but they get paid more for the time spent. I love a majority of my clients and i love meeting new people and hearing their stories.
good,"This was an overall good company to work for.  The benefits started on day one.  Awesome benefit package that included tuition reimbursement and 100% 401k match.  The pay rate was decent.   I gained alot of experience working there.  The management motivation tactics were uncalled for to me.  However, I understood that they wanted to keep the staff on their toes but a more positive approach would have sufficed."
good,"Great Place To Work, But Salaries Are Low.   Salaries should be more competitive and closer to NY salaries.  Essentially, doing same job as those in NY, but get paid 30% less."
good,"Attitudes plays a key role on your advancement, befriend a super visor, you numbers and stats are not the only thing that carry weight when trying to advance in the company. Overall a good job for people who know they want to move up in company."
good,"Always changing from updates to procedures, nothing ever stayed the same and the communication seemed poor as far as not everyone was always on the same page."
good,I find citi a good place to work. Also I will recommed to join if u feel fit for the role. The management is good and a good pay master too. If you want to make career do join
good,"I've only worked in one department at Citi and after 20 years I'm middle of the pack with regards to tenure within my work group.   "
good,My tech team supported market research.   Very low stress level but you will not use the latest bleeding edge tech.   The benefits are excellent and the management team were engaged.
good,Good colleagues. Management in the department I work at is really nice and flexible. There are a lot of resources online as well to everyone to utilize
good,"Is always in cutting edge technology wise. Due to being such large company, regardless of your value to business, knowledge, experience etc, you are just a number so decisions made without full picture."
good,"Very professional environment in Citi bank , dress code , product training , compliance training , there use to be contest to keep the sales going on . And motivation level is very high all the time."
good,Citi is a good company to work for overall the management is mostly good and kind. The benefits and paid time off were good there is little opportunity for advancement and you deal with a lot of angry people.
good,Received a lot of training on new programs. Ability to liase with various departments and levels of management and administration. Learned translateable skills which could be used in any environment.
good,"Not much to say about Vito. They acquired our center from ABN. AMRO., but closed the location 3 months after the acquisition forcing many workers to find new employment."
good,great place to work and lean about capaicty management.  They purchased many tools which help you do your daily routine.  A company this size has many advantages.
good,"If you have been placed in nightshift, then just forget about to rotate your shift even after 2 or 3 years . Management is not too good neither very bad ."
good,"We had a great branch manager ,but new one came in and it was no good."
good,The culture is very relaxed and lacks employee mentoring and grooming for advancement.  It is a large building with a restaurant and a gym.  My position required a lot of overtime.
good,Pay is fair.  Increased hours after becoming salaried.  Fast paced and lots of opportunity to learn new things on a daily basis.  Heavily involved in audits
good,Was not stressful.  Could work independently within the team.  Management was understanding of the work-life balance.  Bonuses were paid on individual effort
good,"A global company looking to continually be a great and diverse place to work.  Benefits are good, pay is good.  A lot of opportunities to grow and develop."
good,Citi is a great place to work. Staying on task and working case by case makes the day go by quickly. Culture is warming and inviting. Focused on teaching you every aspect of your position so you have no other option but to succeed.
good,Average pay for the city of San Antonio positions. Sales department did not provide good opportunity  for you to be able to make additional money. But for sure other jobs at Citibank that could be well worth it.
good,"good progression if your job exposes you to the right seniority. good worklife environment and culture - everyone is very friendly and willing to help. The hours are also pretty good in comparable to other banks, yet pay is not as competitive."
good,"very good company and team culture, good support to new team members, good work culture and work life balance."
good,"A great company to work with, very diverse. Loved the health and wellness gift cards were a plus. They offer excellent health dental and vision benefits."
good,CITI is a challenging place to work where you get to wear different hats as needed. Depending on your immediate management you can have a great work life balance.
good,"Citi provides a good collaborative culture, but does not offer too much opportunity for career development and very little work life balance in Finance, however the compensation is fair."
good,"Citi is a great place to work! I thoroughly enjoyed my tenure there and only wish that they had offered me full time, permanent placement. Their treatment of staff is great both in terms of training and work life balance."
good,"The work load was great, always busy but in a good way... The specific charter bank affiliated with CITI where I worked had some questionable practices along with some harassment from the executive team but this was not part of Citi guidelines, from my understanding this charter bank has been closed. But don't let discourage you because CITI is a great organization to work for."
good,"Very demanding job, from phone time to dealing with inadequate management. "
good,"Citi is not for everyone. The inside joke is Citi employees have a West Wing in the Psych Ward at the nearest hospital. Honestly, it really is a good place, but you have to be the right fit. "
good,"I learned a lot about Wealth Management and interacting with High Net Worth clients.  You have exposure to different financial products like: equities, options, futures, fixed income, derivatives.  The ability to trade a variety of instruments is a plus.  The environment is quick paced as you have to be in tune with the Financial Markets movement."
good,Citigroup offered many opportunities for advancement and job mobility. There are many great employees and lots of opportunities to develop as a great employee.
good,It's an interesting place to work. Career advancement is based on who you know not what you know. Its a challenging and interesting place to work at and to advance at.
good,Turnover is too high. Management does not put in the effort to effectively train new staff. Support for growth could be better. Salary is not commensurate with job duties.
good,"I donot really have much to say about it, i was a contractor. So I do  not really know the process of a regular employee of Citi. They had a great cafe. Hot food."
good,"Very large corporate that somehow allows too many separate silos to develop and grow."
good,It's a great place to work smooth environment and gets competitive at times.  Overall would recommend anyone working here.  Great people to work with and very helpful.
good,I think our customers benefitted from the fact that we all got along and worked very well as a team and individuals.  I only left the company to go to a job with higher salary.
good,Uma cultura inovadora mas não acompanhou as mudanças do mercado nacional e por isto nem existe mais. Foi adquirido pelo ITAÚ.
good,"Citibank is a great place to work they have so many amenities for employees such as a full cafeteria, game room, and a chapel for those religious employees."
good,The private bank area where I worked was a highly visible and very profitable unit of the bank and was cited for its effective market penetration and cost effective work flow
good,Very organized and a place where sales skills were built by professionals giving training and support. Management was amazing. Helping clients with financial needs was the best part of the job. Months that were slow in sales was difficult because you had pressure to maintain sales goals.
good,"Analyze customer service calls, research way to improve and meet with representatives to suggest improvements. Stay on top of all customer service requirements."
good,"this is a very fast paced job that; they offer training and most managers will offer help and answer questions, if they answer is unknown they will find out the answers for you."
good,"worked at Citi for 16 years prior to being laid off in May 2014, Its been difficult to recover good employment with job security. Citi was a great place to work."
good,Management was not supportive or helpful to work duties and will get mad when employee will ask for help. They were not considerate to their employees.  Management will micromanage their employees and pressure them rather than help.
good,One of the top level companies in India to the entry level banking sector. Competitive learning and work environment with lot of opportunity to grow and advance.
good,"Good place to work. "
good,"Work would be project based with deadlines. I could use all the resources, people and software, to get the project done. It is then presented and changes are made before implementation."
good,Citi has allowed me to learn and excel with the tools they provide. I have learned a lot while I was there as everyone works well individually as well as a team. I have had great mentors
good,"I love it because , good benefits and work environment and safe, and also they work with charity like paint the and many others. I like the CEO awesome"
good,"I worked for Citi for over 14 years, and had great working relationships with my team members. It was a good company to work for. They offer lots of flexibility in working arrangements. I would recommend Citi as a place to work and would love to go back there again if I find the right opportunity."
good,"Citi as a company is ok nothing great about the work culture or pay, its a standard job with standard benefits but expectations are very high compared to pay."
good,"Trabalhar no Citi é uma aventura como estar sozinho no Deserto mas em contato com o Mundo, o Home Office e o salário são os diferenciais nesta empresa. Fora isso, o resto é conforme o mercado de trabalho."
good,Certain departments were very cliquish and were not friendly. The last department I worked in was very fair and more relaxed and I felt comfortable asking questions.
good,"Had a great manager and learned a lot under her leadership."
good,"A well recognized company that provides employment opportunity highly skilled professional. Company has long list of diverse work profile."
good,"Decent pay, good number of paid vacation days, good medical and dental benefits. Being a global company and working in a global team means having meetings at odd hours. Plenty of opportunity to learn and plenty of teams to grow laterally."
good,A typical day at work consist of helping associates with difficult calls and/or policy and procedure updates and changes.  Helping clients who escalate the call to management. And keeping current on trainings.
good,Did personal loans and second mortgages . Love the people I worked with . I loved helping customers get out of debt or get money to fix up their houses
good,The hardest thing working for this company was getting opportunities to advance in your career. There are so many staff members so it was extremely hard to be noticed and appreciated.
good,"- International working environment"
good,"Citibank as a Company is a very good company to work at, it also depends on the department that you are going to, so I can not speak for the whole company"
good,"Citi never sleeps - this tagline is an old one and comes from the fact that Citi has presence is over 100 countries worldwide."
good,High volume call center with stressful clientele base.  I learned to listen to the customer and make quick decisions based on the information that I have gathered.  The hardest part of the job was calming the customer down long enough to gain their confidence.  The most enjoyable part of my job was winning that customer over and identifying fraud on their accounts.
good,"Pros:"
good,worked with field analyst to obtain financial information on prospective companies looking to be approved by Citibank Mortgage. Review financials and rendered credit decisions
good,Very strong M&A platform with an intense culture. Great training program and ability to develop strong technical skillset. Fun environment outside of work.
good,It is ok work. Not the most exciting . It was nice at first but now it isnt the best because you go the same thing over and over. ASt some point they will change but it is very slow paced
good,"Citi was a very well run organization, however, there were associates at fairly high levels in the organization that appeared to be afraid to share knowledge or delegate duties as they feared that their job was in jeopardy if somebody else could perform even the most mundane tasks.  These associates were those that had a long tenure with the firm and frankly didn't want to train staff appropriately due to their lack of confidence in job security.  This resulted in new staff members having little to do which led to either resignation or transfers to other departments where their skills could be better exploited.  Most department managers were open and willing to share the workload as they did not display this paranoid behavior and understood that the success of their subordinates ultimately resulted in their own success and led to job advancement. The poor management ""clique"" survived only because they aligned themselves with similar department managers and those employees forced to work for the poor managers could not openly express their dissatisfaction for fear of reprisals from this tenured group."
good,"global reach with global opportunities, excellent colleagues. very challenging and rewarding for the right individuals. must be willing to work long hours and must be able to navigate multi-levels"
good,I did data entry which most of the time you were busy getting the info in the computer and getting the info into the computer for the next dept.and finding mistakes in the apps and correcting them to finish their processes
good,"Almost perfect employer. Minus management's inability to lead people, and I would do anything for Citi. If you have a high tolerance for bu11sh1t in stereo, this is a great choice!"
good,"Na minha percepção é uma empresa que te acolhe da melhor forma possível, e faz de tudo para que o seu desenvolvimento seja de muito aprendizado, o tempo que tenho lá me fez crescer muito tanto profissionalmente quanto pessoalmente, sei que o Banco Citibank foi um grande começo na minha vida."
good,Environment was a very comfortable place to work. My colleagues were very knowledgeable. A typical day was always learning something new. Job security was an issue
good,"In my experience of working at Citi over the past 10 years, I love working for this company, but it does depend mainly on what department/manager that you have. The company is laid back overall but my last few years in the department I have been in has been complete chaos and we have experienced more than one manager in 3 years, which speaks volumes to me.  Our team as also had a high turnover rate as well because of poor management."
good,"Durante anos foi a minha casa. Não há nada que desabone a empresa, mas sua politica de méritos e promoções deixa muito a desejar e é compensada pela sua politica de benefícios."
good,"Most enjoyable part of this job is learning.. learning new skills, management, interacting directly with business, co-ordinating between teams, everyday feels like adding value to our customers and end-users."
good,"No advancement in citi. Low pay. No overtime . constant layoffs, non qualified supervisors, constant high turnover, not enough training, not enough tools to do your job."

good,"You have to know how to effectively deal with angry customers, practice strict time management and be able to do and record a plethora of things on each phone call."
good,The people you work with are completely amazing. The customers you deal with on a daily basis get hard sometimes due to reoccurring problems that they face on a daily basis whether its the website or their card getting declined. The management is great until your department is one that's getting discontinued.
good,been there 2 years and like it so far.  Administrative assistant working with multiple time zones and locations.  Only 12 admins in the building so we are spread thin but it i a fun environment.
good,"The company was a good place to work. The work could be hard at times, however employee were compensated well for their input and time. The job had many opportunities for those who worked hard."

good,"I thought I would retire from Citi. Initially we had an amazing CEO but when there was a changing of the guard's, the culture of Citi Mortgage slowly went down the tube after 2011. "
good,"Ambiente de trabalho agradavel, bom relacionamento interpessoal. Direcao e gerencia se esforcam mas sao um pouco distantes. Promocoes a um certo nivel compreensiveis, mas na maioria apenas laterais. Em geral recomendo para o trabalho e experiencia."
good,"Strong emphasis on policies and procedures. Originally I worked as a teller and later became head teller at a branch. Loved working with customers and daily interaction with people at front end, Enjoyed supervising tellers. Then moved to student collections dept in an administrative bldg, Worked on Accounts  receivable to do student  collections where we made collection calls to students who were unreachable.. I did not like the atmosphere in this area,  no independance regarding goals. Expected to work on duties manager assigned each day. Irregular work hours each week, some weekends and late shifts  on some weekdays"
good,My time with Citi has been a fun experience. It has been a great work to home balance. It lets me provide and not be a stressed out mess. They give you the training you need to be able to succeed.
good,Feels like a big bank with a heavy sales environment. challenging systems make it more difficult to service customer. limited. growth support in the retail bank.

good,"Did inbound and outbound collection calls on Citibank credit cards."
good,"the company pays well but the job is very stressful. the services are so advanced however, manpower is limited causing almost everyone to render mandatory overtime."
good,"Citi in general is a good place to work at. I think it has a good culture, people are in general open and willing to teach. But there are still minorities that are not so appealing and that would lead to big trouble for an individual if you accidentally get involved."
good,It is a great place to work but they are not really family oriented how they claim to be. Management is wonderful ans so are the people that works there
good,"It depends on what type of person you have for a manager.  Some really look after their people for their growth and some don't care."
good,"If you have the drive and ambition, the sky is the limit. There are a lot of opportunities to advance within the company. The hardest  part is finding a good work/life balance. I felt it necessary to work long days in order to accomplish daily work."
good,"Work for a world class company in a challenging, rewarding role where I can utilize my advanced analytical skills along with my wealth of knowledge in Workforce Analytics and Business Intelligence.

Citi also had issues with hiring unmotivated and lazy workers for call center positions. This resulted in a lack of knowledge or caring, and ended up getting the entire department laid off."
good,"I love my job at Citi. I have great coworkers, and great benefits. There are some issues with management treating all employees the same, but I'm sure that is everywhere. Part of what I love is the variety of functions I have. I am able to do my main job, along with cross training, and other little things that need to be done that somehow I ended up doing!"

good,Citi was a great environment. Approachable management and coworkers. Very fun atmosphere. We were always having socials and employee perks.

The most enjoyable part of the job is working with great people."

good,Constant working environment that is meeting driven and continually focusing on the next steps to improve the business for the consumer.  Very project oriented and there is not a dull moment in any given day.
good,"The big picture at Citi is that they care TREMENDOUSLY about their employees, and they do make a very concerted effort to make everyone feel like a piece of the whole. The truth of the matter is, at it's core, very different. The truth of the matter is that this is a big bank and employees are a number, nothing more. When it comes time to start cutting costs, the first place they go is to the employment pool. When it comes to investments, they do not spend money on the people that are already there. They instead, will waste thousands of dollars on systems that aren't tested or bring in outside agencies to evaluate the current state of affairs and spend a dime just to save a nickel. People are not the most important part of the organization."

So we do processes during breaks. And sometimes even on rest days, we need to go to office to finish pended processes."
good,High delivery job with good team. Ready to adapt to new technologies and delivery in a fast pace manner.

good,"Citi provides job growth and development opportunities while pushing for excellence. My overall experience has been very positive. I have had the opportunity to work in Citi for over 10 years and was given multiple opportunities to advance. The team members I have worked with over the years have always been professional, caring and play well in any team environment or project.

My coworkers were also supportive, and as a team provided guidance and help to each other to find the required information and assist with communicating changes.  The most difficult aspect of this job were the ongoing legal changes that occurred on a constant basis.  The most rewarding was being involved with a team and learning new things every day."

good,"Not a bad place to work, good work/ life balance although compensation is a bit lower than the competition. Corporate culture & mgmt are a bit rigid"

Nearly all women co-workers and rarely any drama; everyone was very friendly and worked well together.

I also learned how to review a credit report and customer information to determine credit worthiness and underwrite and make judgmental decisions on a day to day basis...

I learned more about computers and customer service with this job. Fast typing is a must so I also got better at my speed and accuracy. I loved getting to know new people and helping other people with their problems. I would have to say that the hardest part of the job would be management, the only time they actually take care of things is if you stayed on them about it and most of the time in the event of not being able to make it to work no one answered the phone or got back to you in a timely manner."
good,"my last year I had 136 hrs vacation"
good,"Citi was an amazing place to work for. My co-workers where the best! I wish all managers had been as great as the last one I had. To my disadvantage they switched up teams way to much, as soon as you felt you were a ""family"" they were breaking you up; however that gave everyone an opportunity to get to know other people. The hardest part of the job was dealing with the incompetence of sales and pressure to meet month ends demands. Best part of the job the pot lucks! Well if you were on a team who actually functioned as one."

good,On the phones all day. Calling and speaking with all customers delinquent accounts and making payment arrangements. Nice having and being able to speak with coworkers.
good,Enjoyed working with the company and the work environment was positive. A typical day at work could be stressful and hectic when workers do not have a clear understanding of their duties. I had the opportunity to learn about fraud operations during my time with the company. I wished management could have been more involved and could assist workers when in need. The hardest part about the job was dealing with rude and disrespectful customers on the phone. The most enjoyable part about the position was helping customers and others.
good,Fun place to work. Not flexible or not allowed to make up hours if missed for doctors appointments or family problems. Management trained with the rest of staff so knew very little. Couldnt really help with questions.
good,"A empresa tem uma dinâmica de mudanças bastante acentuada e com isso passei por diversas áreas, isso é bom pois faz com que você aprenda de tudo um pouco. Tem uma equipe bastante participativa e jovens talentos que ainda tem muito a acrescentar. Não é uma empresa de oportunidade de carreira, e segue uma politica de cargos e salários bastante rígida, que aprendi a entender.

good,Everyday learned something new. Never got bored at work. Met alot of different people enjoyed meeting with clients.
good,I have been with Citibank for 10 years.  I am a total team player and a very productive and loyal employee.  Citibank is a very large company and has changed over the years as far as growth and compensation potential.  I wish to make a job change due to this.

Makes me want to work harder to always lend a hand when needed. Everything is a team effort and it feels like I am always contributing to a winning goal. Everyone is always in an ""up"" spirit! I am always willing to help where help is needed, including overtime on nights and weekends."

good,A good concern to work with and where we can learn and mould our career well.
good,"A typical day at Citi involved me balancing trades, reconciling reports and resolving any issues that may arise in regards to trade errors.  I learned a lot while at Citi.

good,"My typical day involved cash handling, wiring funds and processing any other client transactions. I had a sales goal of two referrals per day which I exceeded each day working for Citibank. My management team was very supportive and fun. They made the work environment enjoyable. I processed over 400 transactions per day. I was known as the fastest and most efficient teller behind the line. Hardest part of my job was making up for work not done at the end of the day. The most enjoyable part of my job was servicing my clients and making them laugh while they were at my desk. I learned how to handle cash in a quick manner, process large cash transactions, sell products and create/file reports dealing with the branches vault amounts as well as all the work done for the current business day."
good,Our saying at work was the C in Citi stood for change.  You definately always needed to be ready for change.  Never really felt like I had a secure job because they had larger offices that were doing the same thing as we were.  Some days were back to back calls and applications and some days were waiting for 30 minutes for a call.  Most enjoyable was learning something new.  My manager was very professional  which made it nice to work for her.  I actually am on a non working employed status at this time.  They closed the whole facility and let everyone go.t

Coordinate information with other team members regarding production and hardware issues. I learned to be more proficient in Omagamon and Omegaview. I learned to create checklists for us to follow to insure a more efficient and accurate job flow. The management was professional and helpful. They were always ready to listen to any complaints and resolve them fairly. My co-workers were very friendly and helpful. The hardest part of the job was the long four month rotation on the weekend side. The most enjoyable part of the job was the good camaraderie of my co-workers."
good,On any given day I could find work that needed to be done and I welcomed being constantly busy.  I found just how important consistency and constructive feedback can be.  That is how we learn.  Being part of a supportive team is very important; things go so much better when we work as a team.  Management is flexible and open to process improvement.  The most difficult thing for me to realize is; planning what I intend to complete in one day and all too often I am unable to accomplish half of what I expect to complete by the end of the day no matter how many hours I put in.  The silver lining is  not one day goes by that I leave without learning something new.  I crave knowledge.
good,"O Citibank é uma empresa onde você aprende acima de tudo as qualidade de comunicação, pois num dia comum de trabalho você tem que se focar em alinhar com todos os seus stakeholder em diversos tipos de comunicação e ter todos alinhados de forma a conseguir que o processo corre sem maiores problemas."

good,Truely enjoyed my position as a fraud analyst with Citibank. Threw out the day I welcomed every challenge and took the opportunity to use all my resources to effectively and accurately complete my task. I learned alot daily and kept myself open to change and by also treating each account I work on as a learning experience.
good,It's a great company to work for and the benefits are reasonable. The job is very satisfying if you are customer focused and working for Citibank has given me insight into credit and financing. And that's always a plus!
good,Working at Citi is a special experience. Very high demanding and critical nature of the work makes the environment more dynamic and challenging. Every day has some new challenges and new actions.
good,"I really enjoyed working for Citi. In fact, I was able to perfect my administrative skills during the 11 years I was employed at Citi. I absolutely loved my co-workers and found them very easy to work with. For the most part the management team, with the exception of one or two, were truly compassionate and worked with their subordinates to ensure they worked to the best of their potential. The hardest part of working with Citi was trying to advance in my career. If you did not belong to the upper-class level of Americans you were looked down upon. If you did not have a college degree and your family were middle to lower-class Americans many times you were passed over for any type of advancement. Further, when the economy began to fall into a recession the employees were told that the company was in good standing and within 90 days the stock fell to less than $5.00 a share and over 75,000 employees were permanently laid off."
good,"Its time for me to move my career forward by looking to move myself towards a more Global International Bank, (non-US)"
good,I was a fraud analyst researching live accounts to see if fraud was transpired on acct.
good,"I helped clients and employees by answering policy and procedural type questions. Also, I have an extensive understanding of the banking industry.The best part of the job was working with other employees as a team to work quickly and do the best job. For example, I'd reach out to POC (point of contacts) from other departments as well as other sites if needed to get the job done."
good,"Me, being the least experienced out of all my co-workers, worked ever-changing hours, learned about the ever-updating policies and procedures, and took training classes all the time. The workday was fine but always pretty much unpredictable because in dealing with people, you never really know. You wind up doing a lot of things outside of your job description that are only applicable to that particular field of work. You learn a lot about the financial market."
good,"Manage a portfolio of accounts, skip tracing, auto dialer, manual inbound and outbaound calls, monthly quitas, weekly deadlines, loan modifications, forbearances, weekly and monthly collections reports, knowledge of FDCPA laws"
good,"The best part of my job currently is multitasking. It is all about prioritizing the work as it comes along and getting it all done successful and efficiently. A day at work would involve servicing customers with the queries they address and get a perfect resolution so that they can walk out of the branch happy and content that their work has got done. Along with that is do the some of the branch activities such as Inventory, Mail, Trade and various other activities."
good,NA. Prefer not to say. Will be happy to discuss in interview.
good,A lot to learn in a short time. Would help to have training other than a presentation on the computer.
good,Helping customer refinance their homes...
good,Very laid back environment but the compensation is terrible.
good,"Back in 2005, i was doing daily, weekly and monthly reports, i have to update the employees on how are they doing when it comes to sales. I learned on how to work under pressure with a minimal supervision, My manager will just check my work weekly. Co-workers are really good, The hardest part is if there's a lot of work to encode and if there's a lot of report needed.Most enjoyable part is to deal with the boss and visitors."
good,I love my work at citi and the people that I work with. The only thing is the hour are not working with my family. I really enjoy this type of work
good,Worked with many good & capable fellow employees.
good,"loved the customer service aspects but not the sales parts. plenty of ways to advance your career, great pay and benefits"
good,.Creating new database tables I also create various reports that show if certain tables will have upcoming problems.
good,"Num dia típico de trabalho, faço negócios com clientes,buscando resultado para organização."
good,fast paced work with some monthly routines. Data maintenance and monitored data flow
good,Mostly you will be taking calls from credit card customers. Not a huge fan of some of the management team (mostly because it seems like this changes CONSTANTLY).
good,I enjoy working for this company. It's a very busy environment and multi-tasking is a must. My coworkers were all great and make my 10 hour shifts go by alot faster! The hardest part of the job is having to tell someone that we're not able to do something for them after they've been a member for numerous years while the most enjoyable is actually being able to get something done for a loyal client.
good,The job at Citibank Singapore is really satisfying as it challenges you to over-come your limit.
good,Ok place to work but very political. People get promoted just because you partied with the right person not based on merit or performance.
good,"Discuss, analyze and propose various workout options with the Mortgagors/Debtors, Monitoring and follow-up on planned payments. I learned a lot about home lending"
good,"Working with Citi group was one of the best experiences i have had in the workplace. I worked with great people good management and leared the importance of maintaining clients. Bank tellers would receive a bonus if they brought more customers into the bank and a bonus for sales. Some customers would get upset and yell from time to time when banks get busy, however it was a great environment."
good,"standard collection protocall , they always changing up productivity"
good,I had to start my daily task on time every day. I learned how to work in extreme pressure with a minimum error. Team management is excellent. Co-workers are very friendly. The hardest part of the job was to provide the deliverable on time. The most enjoyable part of the job was sharing ideas with the co-workers.
good,"Every day seems a final day as the targets are very tough to get done, but learned a lots of smart ways of d sales achievement. The management is giving an atmosphere to achieve d said targets and every one on to the senior board is also from the sales so some of the time they understands the failure too. Working in a team is great fun and also teaches the team achievements."
good,Collected debt on past due accounts from 30 -120 days. Worked with consumers on how to bring accounts current. Set repayment plans and payoffs.
good,"Customer Service, Sales, Underwriting, Applications,"

Interacted with many groups mainly in Finance both locally and globally. Also liaised with Tax, Legal and Human Resources. Served as the liaison to Asia Pacific and Australia for the Finance International Group."
good,"Fast paced atmosphere. Worked with the best people ever. Learned the ability to work with a lot of change and various global regions. Management was always fair and open for discussion. The hardest part of my job was to staying informed because I worked remotely and did not have an official office to occasionally commute to. Working remotely was the best part of my job, provided a good work life balance."
good,Wonderful place to work that compensated you for your hard work. Upper management really seemed to care about the employees. Hardest part of the job was working on Sundays and having to work on the automated dialer system.
good,Flexible
good,"Do not like the culture very much, too much hierarchy inside the bank."
good,Open up emails and reach out to realtors for possible sale of properties. Everyone works individually on their own files its very seldom that others can help you with your file.Time is the hardest part of the job.You have to manage time well or you will find yourself not completing your work in a timely manner. When I get the properties sold and closed I find joy because I have helped start a new chapter in someones life.
good,My only gripe is the odd location. It is a drive from most populated areas such as Lansing or the west side suburbs. The mileage and drive time certainly take a toll.
good,I tried to plan for the week and leave time for the day to day unexpected accurances.
good,"if you like a fast paced work enviroment, this is the place for you. flexible schedule, depending on your manager. however, company politics often get in the way of performing at your best. as long as you have a good assistant manager, you should be able to avoid alot of the political drama."
good,"It is a good place to work for those with alot of background in Transaction Fund Services. With the job market today, especially in the financial services industry, the job security and movement is minimal at the Columbus OH location. Overall, it is a decent company to work for. Great work/life balance, as having the ability to work from home in certain positions."
good,"My typical day at work is to help the ABM in opening and closing procedures. As well to help with the daily reports of the branch in verifiying everything goes with policy and procedure. Over the 6 years I have learned the sales and the operations parts of the branch daily process. My co-workers are team players and as well as I, in creating professional and secured evironment."
good,I enjoyed working at Citi. I had to opportunity to learn more about the credit card process as well as the mortgage process.
good,"It's a good starter job, but things change so often it's not somewhere I'd want to stay at long term. A few years there and you'll have worked several jobs for several companies as they gain and lose contracts"
good,working the mail sorter was the hardest thing to get used to and to know all the numbers quickly and carefully to put in correct bin for batching.
good,I left this employer due to miles per drive. There was no room for promotions
good,"Extensive training, great job opportunity, very diverse and made of very well rounded individuals."
good,"They are flexible with your schedule, including those individuals that are currently in school."
good,Thought outside the box to assist customers. Tried to help people while following the rules of the company.
good,"This is a great company to work for, I have a great relationship with my peers and is a pleasure to be part of their team."
good,Citi promotes diversity and inclusiveness with flexible work atmosphere and work life balance. Work is challenging and demanding but promotes innovation as well.
good,Εξαιρετικό περιβάλλον και χώρος εργασίας/εγκαταστάσεις. Εφαρμογή διαδικασιών και της εταιρικής κουλτούρας. Απαιτητική εργασία αλλά δικαίωση μέσω αποτελέσματος. Ξεκάθαρες αρμοδιότητες και διαδικασίες.
good,"Pros:"
good,"Good company to work for.  There were some instense where other people were more favored that didnt do much in working their production but talked and did nothing. and those that did was ignored. Productivity speaks for itself and they seem to by pass that.  My supervisor was great and if it wasnt for him i would have quit.  Managers are too busy to talk to employees about problems "
good,A very busy yet professional environment. Extremely quick pace. Friendly people. Work could be challenging at time with weekly presentations and balancing.
good,Citi is overall a great place to work out. The only downside is that when you move internally to a new position you are paid less than if you were hired from the outside. Most people leave the company and return to earn the higher salary.
good,Great opportunity to learn new technologies as well as learn about the business. Productive environment with good team environment and supportive management.
good,"Ótima empresa para se trabalhar, proporciona um bom ambiente de trabalho, salário compatível com mercado e ótimos benefícios."
good,"Environment too stressful. Collegue were too boring, they were too focus on their work, work station too silence, too bored, conversations with colleague were limit.."
good,There is a lot of diversity at Citi. The company has committed senior level positions to over 50% women and 8% to African Americans. There is a lot of work-life balances.
good,"Corporate environment that rewards ambitious workers with regular work reviews, good benefits package, and work/life balance. With that comes the negatives that it can take a while to advance through the corporate ladder and utilize individual skills."
good,I enjoyed working at Citi. They have amazing benefits which was the best thing about them. They were usually pretty flexible with time. Managers were understanding and usually would let you make up time on different days if kids were sick or something came up. They also had a good amount of unplanned time and planned time from day one.
good,"There are alot of perks with citi but I honestly feel if your not a women you are outcasted, and personal seeked out and watched over closely. This is my opinion and my actually experience. I had to call hr on my manager due to disrespecting me and embarrassing me about a question I had And also showed bias where I had fmla for my medical issues.greatgrowing  opportunities. it really is luck of draw when it comes to managers. Charity Frye is one of the few that trest you fairly and appropriately"
good,"It was nice working and I had such a great time spending and working with them. Though the my office was faraway from my home but despite of being faraway, Im excited everyday to go.to work."
good,"The Jax office is 24-hours and you are assigned a shift with a chance to bid for a better shift once every 6 months or so.  The phone work is continuous and requires lots of script following and reading verbatim statements to customers, which can be tedious.  Quality measurements play a big part of your bonuses, overall success and your future as far as staying with the company and/or advancing."
good,"I would start the day managing inventory,  Looking at my volume and my employee's volumes to ensure they had an appropriate workload.  Every job I had at Citi involved managing  high volumes of inventory.  I was moved 3 times, 2 promotions,and a lateral move at the end of my career to help manage inventory.  This was my specialty.  I was also very hands on as  a manager.  I touched desk with my employees daily and held meetings weekly.  I had folks I managed offsite in Dallas and Tucson.  The culture was rough at the end as we went through lean, and sold the rest of our inventory to Cenlar.  I was able to manage a positive environment while this process was in full swing.  I always maintained high respect from my teams.  At the end it was a challenge to make sure we had all of our process's perfect and ready to send to a new company.  We  had to make sure all of our inventory was clean.  This was challenging but it was an incredible learning experience.  I enjoyed the people above and below me.  Strategizing with a good team and management group is exciting!"
good,"Citi is a Great brand to be associated with. It provides you with good working culture. But onshore-offshore culture is not that great. However, there are great opportunities for growth, internal career mobility & responsibilities."
good,I have learned how to find customers and get paid for past due bills. I also have learned how to be more persuasive and creative with helpful ideas. This position has offered many learning opportunities
good,A good company with strong culture. I recommend to perspective employees looking to join. Citi provides career mobility and skill enhancement opportunities.
good,Everything was great until we got laid off. I wish I could still be there doing my job. If they ever come back I would glady work for them again. Work and life balance was amazing.
good,went from an evaluation of 6 different skills to 3. Made getting bonuses harder and honestly. Had three different Managers. The first two were great but the third was ok. Over all it is not a bad company.
good,"I worked in master servicing, so the layoffs didn’t touch our small department. They did put a salary freeze during the mortgage crisis. After three years, the raises were very small and bonuses were still taken away. But, they were great when Mt daughter had medical issues and missed a lot of work."
good,"As a Fresher, I have learned many things in CITI. It was always a bit stressful to work in CITI. Since we were handling all confidential data of clients. Management was supporting us to help the company for its growth."
good,"Citi overall is a great company however depending on your manager, I am not quite sure where they get some of them from. Poor leadership skills. Great benefits however with a 6% 401k match and tuition reimbursement."
good,I certainly enjoy my time with folks I work with. Citi has wonderful and knowledgeable people who have been there for ages. Its a testament of how much they enjoy their time at Citi.
good,Employee friendly work place but with very high work load and less compensation compared to the work done. Good employee benefits with onsite Gym and changing rooms.
good,"Happy to go to work, the team I worked with were always so nice, I enjoyed my time there even though it was a contract assignment. Most enjoyed the team effort this department had."
good,"Nice place to work overall. However, opportunities for advancement are non existent if you are not connected. It seems easier to get into Citi in the first place than getting a promotion once you are in. However, work/life balance is among the best out there: 3 months maternity leave (if not more), many bank holidays, ease to take a sick leave, etc."
good,Good company to work for with opportunities around the world.  Salaries are competitive with great benefits. Great opportunities for learning in continual education. Great climate for  collaboration with fellow team members
good,"Citibank was a good place to work."
good,"Pros:  Strong Management Hierarchy, Good salary, Wide Projects spanning over all Banking domain"
good,This Is a great company to work for only thing is that they expect so much from you after you already hit  sales quota they had me stay after making phone calls when we already did a full eight hour shift
good,"While working at Citi, I learned a lot. It was my 1st job out of college and helped me learn the corporate ropes. I advanced pretty quickly, but it wasn't easy and management has a tendency to play favorites and treat people like numbers. Communication is a large issue firm-wide. Everyone complains about it but no one does anything about it. It's a great company to work for, especially if you're right out of college, but wouldn't necessarily recommend it for a life long career. Learn what you can then move on."
good,"Working at Citi isn't easy - you are often asked to do a great deal and the pace can be hectic, but the people around you are talented and hardworking individuals and the leadership is (generally) very supportive."
good,"Empresa com uma cultura excelente, local agradável,  promove ações muito legais com a comunidade, benefícios compatíveis com empresas do ramo financeiro, porém a possibilidade de crescimento e limitada. As áreas oferecerem possibilidade de promoção, porém para chegar a cargos gerenciais e muito difícil, pois o Citi oferecem as vagas, porém sempre já tem alguém designado para a função já acordado anteriormente."
good,"Its an organization that grooms you really well . Its a tough life at work .The organization takes care of any problems that you face at work and to a large extent in your personal life."
good,"Citi is a great place to work for.  Working in CTI, you need to be quick thinking and able to change gears at a moment's notice.  The best part of the job is the wonderful people."
good,"Excellent place to work . Learned lot from my career perspective. Latest technologies and software being used here. "
good,Company provides fantastic benefits both medical & PTO from day 1. Compensation is lower than average but is made up through all that company provides.
good,"Good place to work but we are losing the contract so we have to keep our options open. The hours are 8-5 and no weekends, but limited time off and not the best benefits"
good,"The benefits are excellent with plenty of time off after being with the company for five years or more. The management, for the most part are helpful and polite. The work environment is a positive one and the employees are given a feeling that the company cares about them individually."
good,Citibank was a good place to work for me for a while some managers are better and more supportive than others but overall they have a lot of Benefits and opportunities to take advantage of.
good,"Citi gave you every opportunity to better yourself and further your professional self. Great bank to learn at, with enough opportunity to advance in any area of finance"
good,"Citi Provides excellent career opportunities for individuals. Provides transport facility. Encourages Diverse and Inclusive work culture."
good,in my daily routine i review documentation used to do the underwriting process for personal and car loans. also do collections and do all the loan closing documentation.
good,"Worked for Citimortgage for over a decade. Got laid off recently because the company no longer exists. Only Citibank now. Their problem, making you do the job of two people. They worried about production and not quality and that was their downfall. They would have a great product and terrible management. The government finally caught up with them and sanctioned them 28 million therefore causing the company to close its doors. They eliminated team leads and therefore there was no room for advancement. Hopefully Citibank doesn’t dissolve as well."
good,Citi was a great place to start with this type of job and helpful manager taught you a lot. Just not easy to move up in the company due to the financial office you worked in doing loans.
good,"I worked in a team of young and dynamic professionals."
good,Most days were filled with a variety of duties.  Phone skills and computer skills are a must in this position.  Off hour work was awarded with a 10% shift differential.  I was able to depend on assistance from both peers and management.
good,"Excellent team work in achieving business goals, with excellent management involvement.  An excellent place to learn of all activities and functions within a financial institution. Compensation and benefit packages are excellent."
good,"Receive calls concerning Government accounts in reference to the Department of Defense.  I work independently and in a team environment to deliver high levels of productivity, efficiency service to client."
good,"The insurance benefits are great. However, the goals for call time are getting ridiculous. Not many options available if you need accommodations off the phone."
good,"The calls are often back to back, and there was very seldom any time between calls. Getting transferred out of a busy department is unlikely, as is the possibility that the dept will get any new hires."
good,"Standard work day included assembling project requirements. defining technical requirements based on the project, ordering Cisco hardware and telecommunication circuits, creating network design and implementation plans, reviewed coworkers designs and implementation plans, implemented the design solutions with assistance from the remote site support personnel (rack and stack)"
good,"Typical day includes me greeting my coworkers, staying busy all day, and going to the cafe to get something to eat or snack on. We talk to our managers almost daily and try to stay on top of new updates. Management is very easy to talk to- even the site manager! We have a good time on our team with fun townhalls, informative meetings and maybe 2 potlucks every month. The hardest part of the job is implementing new changes and updates nearly twice a week, so we have to stay flexible and know that change is constantly on its way, but we always manage to get through it!"
good,"People are no longer viewed as people.  They are viewed as resources or tokens that can easily be removed or replaced.  This is very unfortunate, as this results in a huge loss of talent."
good,Smart colleagues. Decent amount of PTO. Challenging work. Lots and lots of work. Sometimes that can be a drain. Managers are out of touch. Remote work flexibility is going away as a matter of policy in IT
good,Citibank offers good compensation and benefits.  It was fun working with the company since I got to meet a lot of new people from other countries.  It was just sad I joined at the wrong time when they were downsizing.
good,"Great place to work and wonderful teammates. Everyone was involved in special events and charity fundraisers. Also, a great company with ability to advance in different positions."
good,"I have worked over 10 years with CITIGROUP in various roles within the NJ, NY area. It is a good company to work for but everyone has to be very careful treading along different teams, projects and ensure that you are not left out from the inner circle on a regular basis."
good,Good salary package. Maybe the best in the industry. Have a very modest work culture. However the work life balance can be improved since there is too much of work pressure involved
good,"Citi cards has transformed to a Digital fist cloud product environment that has delivered more customer features in the last calendar year than in the previous few.  The adaption of the Agile development methodology using scrum has benefited the business product teams and ultimately Cit's customers. "
good,"Mi tenor with Citi was great. I worked from home  8 of the 14 years I was there. Great Management, on top of their game. Some difficulty once the mortgage industry bubble busted."
good,Flexible and Supportive Work Environment that commonly allows work for home that allows for a flexible life-work balance. The work can be demanding at times.
good,"With my time with Citibank, I've learned that the people you work with aren't actually people who want to see you develop and grow as a person. Some people with just say things in your face just to get you by and other will do anything to try and manipulate a situation to get you terminated in some way."
good,a great place to work just hard to keep working here as the only income in a household and afford to live. If you like fast paced work and great benefits I would recommend working here
good,"Self employed sales consultants need to work really hard to bring in the big money but salary is open ended so the worlds your oyster."
good,I started at an entry level position and worked my way up. My Management was every supportive in helping me to get to that level. I was able to work within my office as well as assist in other offices.
good,"Started as a teller and was moved up to Area Banker within 4 months. There is great growth opportunity. Its 9-5 job if you prefer. You deal with clients, majority times same clients"
good,Benefits is good.  A typical day at work is good. I learned several different positions. Management needs more training. Workplace culture is fair. The hardest part of the job is working with a management team in another state. The most enjoyable part of the job is I am responsible for my work only and no one is standing over me.
good,Beaucoup d'avantages pour les employés mais aussi  une grande pression de travail.
good,I enjoyed my time at Citi.  I worked there full time while also going to school full time.  Tuition reimbursement and flexible working hours allowed me to do both successfully.
good,Its a great experience. Mixed culture. However there are long working hours like any bank and pressure to meet the targets. But overall its a great place to work
good,"because of my location it was hard to move up or promote. Was told eventually i could move up, but with proving good work ethics and good performance it was still hard to promote. Customers are nice and treat you well. Hardest part of the job was having upset customers when there was long lines."
good,"overall good company, good benefits package, 401k with company match, good working hours , company cafeteria , free parking , good paid vacation package"
good,"Designing, implementing, maintaining and troubleshooting networks at either a local area, wide area, or infrastructure level. Ability to work closely with and develop relationships with clients."
good,"It's been quite a few years since I've worked at Citi. On the whole most of the managers were smart, respectful and receptive to suggestions.  There were in many ways less stress than working in civil service environments.  There was afforded a much greater level of confidence support and reward for the work done."
good,"Good brand "
good,Solid job with great benefits. Plenty of opportunities for growth as the business continues to grow. A job or a career citi is a place for everyone to work
good,"Citi Has great benefits and very competitive. Sometimes it can be stressful but overall the atmosphere is great. Its an office setting where your on the phones 99% of the day. I've learned about credit cards and how they function and the financial side of the banking industry. The hardest part of the job, is the constant phone interactions."
good,Citgroup has been an excellent place to work for over the last 10 years. It has really helped me advance my career to what it has become and I look forward to what the future holds for me in this company.
good,Most managers are not flexible with your schedule. They need you to be fully AVAILABLE and you can only work 20 hours a week. NO OVERTIME. It’s fun if you have the right team and if you are only looking for something with a little bit of hours. sales are very important in every area.
good,"- Heavy workload, very tight deadlines."
good,"Enjoyed working for citifinancisl, growth opportunities, great training, positive work atmosphere. Unfortunately as far as I know they have closed all citifinancial locations"
good,"I enjoyed my time here. the company is well established but the make changes on a regular basis, never boring and quick paced, the training was very detailed"
good,"busy which makes the days go by faster"
good,"Very good beneits. On site health clinic, flexible hours, company activities, many opportunities for volunteering in the community and a paid day off to do so."
good,"Empresa criou um setor de abertura de contas o qual exigia alto valor salarial do cliente. "
good,In the 7 years I have been with Citi I have been promoted 4 times which speaks to their desire to promote from within.  I have gained a strong understanding of corporate banking through the different positions that I've held here.
good,"Typically worked 5 days per week.   "
good,Citi's focus was on the talent of the it's employees and how they fit with Citi's needs. They focused on the talents and skills each person had and saw where they fit
good,"A typical day at work is normal, Learn a lot about credit help me understand credit management. Management is not bad, limited  interaction with co workers that makes it a little hard but overall great staff and friendly. Dealing with customers is the hardest part of the job due to customers lacking credit knowledge. The job allowed me to perform my daily prayers as a muslim that is a big plus for me because nothing is more important than that, me been able to worship."
good,"Hardest part of the job was not being able to learn as much because of little hours, and having little to no time to learn additional things. The hours are very low, with little to no overtime."
good,"Since Citibank is US company, the work environment and culture was really fun to experience. However, as former Citiphone officer, i find a bit difficult to have work life balance as we had to face rotational shift. Will be super easy for single staff but not married staff."
good,Tienes que estar a tiempo y los gerentes no te ayudan ni te dan soporte tu tienes que hacer trabajo de ellos y el tuyo.
good,"Citi is an overall good company with good compensation and great benefits. It would be nice if you didn’t have to be in your current position for a year before you can apply for other positions. While this isn’t always the case, for most positions, it is a requirement."
good,"process documentation and analysis"
good,"The job itself was less technical more like reporting. On the other hand since I was curious and wanted to know more, I experienced a lot in the vulnerability management tool and created my own reports and mechanisms fast, so that was a really easy type of job for me."
good,"Good franchise, but seems to be on the decline.  Citi seems to lack vision of where it is going.  Consumer bank versus corporate bank.  Losing market share to competitors."
good,"My experience at Citi has been very enriching. I have had the opportunity to work under different managers and handle different products in my stint, which has helped me grow as a professional."
good,"With it's global reach, Citi offers a tremendous volume of career opportunities to those who are willing to work hard for it. The slogan - ""Citi never sleeps"" - is true. You will experience complex assignments, be exposed to multi national cultures and test your limits as you start your career. Best place to mold your work ethics and discipline."
good,Citi was consistent with how it operated.  The environment was stressful at times but the benefits the company provide were better than any where in the KC area.
good,"The benefits are amazing you just have to be able to talk on the phone for 7 hours a day.  That can get pretty stressful.  The people I work with are amazing and I've only had one manager, our of four, that I really didn't click with."
good,Working for Citibank was an experience. I was able to help people manage their finances and help them achieve their financial goals. It was a pleasant feeling when customers came back to thank you for helping them on the right financial path.
good,I've worked at a few different locations so the experience depends on your team. Salary is more than minimum and part timers get paid vaca +insurance.
good,Appreciated working there but many things were out of order. I had to quit because my manager failed to educate me on my bereavement time. Things could have went better
good,I was on a temporary contract position but the company paid me well and work life balance was good. Good place to start early career. Provides opportunities for learning.
good,"Didn't work there long, but I had a good impression.The over all staff was helpful and caring. The attendance wasn't too crazy strict and VTO was offered."
good,"A call center with a lot of benefits, trainings and Inside Gym, Inside Coffee Shop, everything in the same building. You have benefits and discounts with many Cell Phones companies."
good,"Typical American attitude - well paid but expect next to no work-life balance. Some management good, some less so. Overall happy i worked there, but also happy i don’t any more."
good,"Been there 14 years still made under 40k annually. No room for advancement, and constent layoffs. Great benefits very diverse and great with flex schedules."
good,"O ambiente é bom, as equipes são unidas, os benefícios são bons, porém está regredindo aos poucos."
good,Thanks to my team! We worked hard in a test and measure atmosphere to build a reputable and successful programs within a company that provided us opportunities.
good,"Great company for advancement though job security can depend on line of business. Work life balance is great depending on department. Salary is average compared to competitors. Overall, great financial institution to learn the business of banking."
good,"for this company you strictly do data entry for all of your shift and have to exceed specific daily, weekly and monthly expectations. They do have a great teaching system."
good,I was there 9 1/2 yrs and this place has changed drastically. I was recently laid off and I'm a okay with that because the job had became stressful and the new managers felt like micro managing was the way to go. If Citi were to go back to their old ways of doing business I'll be the first one going back but until then count me out.
good,"It is a high paced environment, with a high stress job. they do assigned seating so you have your own work station. They have a cafe on site. The U of A tech park is beautiful. they did however screw over several individuals on various types of leaves. So be cautious there. they also take part in advanced pay. meaning they pay and provide PTO in anticipation of getting the work hours from you."
good,I enjoyed helping customers and learning new things. The company is very flexible and the managers are helpful. The employees are great too. The company takes care of their employees.
good,"has good pay for the commute and cost of living.  management was okay, they also had good team meetings and potlucks, freshly cooked food on campus and fundraisers."
good,They don't make it clear to which direction they are trying to take the mortgage division.  A lot of Lay offs. They now out source the servicing. It looks like they are trying to leave the market.
good,"Managers and employees all were supportive and it was a great environment to work. Lots to learn each day, work was a lot and kept busy whole day. New things each day raised the morale."
good,The Firm offer Job Security/Advancement in most areas.  It has a good management culture and conduct risk program.  I highly recommend working for Citibank.
good,"In citi, I met a lot interesting people and a good manager. They helped me improve my professional skills and my inner exploration, which makes me recognize my weakness and strengths."
good,"Entrenpeneurial culture allowing managers to grows businesses and servce clients according to best practices. Everyone is involved in the client experience from CEO to clerk."
good,The company has a good BOB and is very comfortable with letting the bankers take the lead on sales. Customer service is mostly handled over the phone so it gives you more time for sales.
good,"The work culture in Citi is little hectic. You are expected to work for longer times. But, this is compensated with your salary and other bonuses and the support you get from your team members."
good,You learn a lot and put in a lot of hours as well during month ends. It's a sink or swim environment. You can get a lot out of it if you're willing to put in the work.
good,"Citi Has a great flexible benefits package allowing you to make your personal life better."
good,"All of my coworkers are great, but there can be a lack of communication between different locations. The senior managers are housed in NYC and they aren't always in touch with what is occurring in other offices. "
good,"Overall a very good company to work for. Work/Life balance is awesome and the pay gender-gap was to be eliminated in 2018, not sure if that happened. Busy season is really busy."
good,The environment created opportunities to cross-train and interact with various functions at the Bank.  Co-workers were willing to contribute to problem solutions for clients.
good,Citi is a great place to work. Citi helped me in a lot of ways in unlocking skills and proficiency that are needed not only for my career but for my ultimate future development and my goals.
good,"To start with, the most amazing part of this company is it does not let you feel like you are a employee. It feels like a family. Work is good and great seniors to guide. You feel you are in safe hands."
good,Citi had a great culture.  The company is involved in community service.  This company has been great to me over that past 12 years.  I don't have any complaints.  It was a great place to learn and grow.
good,Citi offers many resources to retain talent. training for upward mobility and career tracks are provided and encouraged by individuals at all management levels.
good,"This is a good place to work, for those with heavy work experience or higher education.  The management could use some classes on employee development and motivation assistance skills."
good,"Our team strives to meet the clients banking needs"
good,"Citi is a over all good company to work for, great learning experience, busy call center. Typical day would consist if giving 100% customer satisfaction to all of the customers, resolving complex issues,payment posting, act reviewing etc.."
good,"Citi was  - and still is a major corporation and while some would think that a large corporation would not have be a caring place, I never found a more supportive group than in my division. It truly broke my heart to leave Citi, but family comes first and I had to do what was right for my parents."
good,"A typical day involved attending meetings, satisfy business users reporting requirement, delegate and work hands on technical needs. Learned to manage time and project skillfully."
good,"Be prepared to work and not just expect a corner office because you showed up to work.   Citi is a very diverse company which is an exceptional positive, yet they operate with do more with less."
good,"Citi bank is one of the leading bank in global, It gives extreme work stream, work life balance and many learning opportunity. The best thing I loved was process management. Fun to love"
good,"A typical workday starts at 0800 and ends at 1800. Working with Citibank was very challenging but prepared me for other jobs. I learned to work under pressure and handle customers efficiently."
good,"Global firm with extraordinarily diverse workforce and inclusive culture "
good,"I worked here for many years, some good, some bad.  I advanced throughout the years because I wanted it.  If you worked hard you could go far, however sometimes the hours were long."
good,I worked as contractor so it difficult to comment on the company culture. It big banks . Expending big time across the globe. Offices everywhere. Office environment is Multi Culture.
good,There would be Quarterly compliance that we needed  to acknowledge and be certified. Weekly meeting update to resolve ongoing issues with in our infrastructure.
good,"This was a great place to get into the finance industry. Great benefits, good pay, some BS though. I would recommend this to anyone looking to get a  start into the finance field."
good,"Great Environment.  You receive extensive training but no matter the amount of training you receive there is that deer in the headlights look the first day you are on the floor.  I remember because I almost punched out my monitor on the first phone call.  It was just first call stress.  As with any new call center job it was getting your mind to put together everything it knew and spit it back out.  The support teams were great, the managers were amazing."
good,Citi offers a diverse workforce with a wide range of potential roles. The best part of the job includes the ability to move laterally across the organization. The most challenging part is navigating such a large organization.
good,I would work there because I like a fast paced competitive work environment. Hard to take vacation days in that environment but most full time positions with any company are like that now.
good,"Typically the day would consist of 70- 150 inbound or outbound calls, meetings with managers and extra projects to better the team's efficiency. The most enjoyable part of the job were the bonuses that one could achieve at the end of the month for the hard work that was put in."
good,"Not too bad here, at the location of Tucson. Stepping stone to greater things!!"
good,"steady work flow"
good,It's a good place to work if you are willing to put in the time and energy to learn how to navigate the firm. Part of your success is driven not only by your work performance but knowing the right people to include in your endeavours to get the job done.
good,"Citi Group Software is good to interns and graduates. As a new software engineer, I could learn some basic technology and communication skills. But the technology there is not up to date."
good,I am willing to undergo training. I am pleasant in nature and can get along with others. My experience has taught me on how to build strong relationship with all departments at an organization. I have the ability to work within a team as well as cross-team.
good,if you can not reach a certain amount of positive calls they will get rid of you. I had customers yelling at me all the time because their card does not work.
good,Had an opportunity to provided and built relationship with corporate clients to grow bank payroll business; monitored portfolios of payroll relationships and ensured smooth flow of business from these companies and other related work.
good,"always ask questions and check your documents to make sure you're doing everything correctly. they're always changing things up, trying to new things for better or worse and encourage as much input as possible to fix what's broke. You do have your busy days with back to back calls then there are more laid back days where you're able to focus on your customer v your score card."
good,My job was opening mail for different processes. The management was great. I learned how to open mail using a mail cutter and batch mail for the different processes.
good,Very little long term stability in many lines of business.  Great management teams in all lines of business that I had the opportunity to work in and strong focus on development.
good,"I love working for Citi. They have amazing benefits and time off! I will say in the 7 years I have been here, the biggest tasks that I have had to overcome is advancement in career opportunity. There are alot of politics and it can seem like you have to know someone to move up. If you stay persistent though, you will get a promotion."
good,"predictable job responsibilities, collaborative and good quality of life. problems include promotions lacking, duplication of efforts and slow changing culture."
good,"terrible work enviroment "
good,"If you're looking for a basic, slow-paced 9-5 that doesn't particularly challenge you and is in a very corporate environment with little office culture but that pays well and has a good reputation, then Citi is a great place to work.  I come from working at startups and prefer the more collaborative, fast-paced, fun environment that those offer."
good,"A great brand to work for, culture is quite open and best in industry policies.Ample career advancement opportunities including global exposure, ingrained a strong sense of compliance & due diligence required for a financial services setup"
good,"citi has some really good things like on site child care, the café, the vacation time benefits, plenty of departments to choose from BUT depending on your department or manger it may not be the most 'fun'. Citi does under pay compared to other financial institutions"
good,I enjoyed working at Citi. Citi takes care of its employees! But there was a lot of turnover in management and direction was constantly changing. It's also very hard to get promoted.
good,"Time off was great, sick time good. Good Benefits. Management was strict. Having Random calls pulled for review was nerve wrecking. Very strictly counseled each word said."
good,"busy job, fixed inflexible schedule, mgmt because of the inflexibility of the schedule really cannot care about personal issues in life, relaxed culture, can wear jeans"
good,Great place to work; great opportunities for professional growth and career advancement
good,El ambiente de trabajo es bastante agradable. Fue poco el tiempo que tuve la oportunidad de trabajar ahí
good,Found the culture and climate very enriching. very Open to new ideas and technology. Employees are given many tools to succeed. Many good relationship managers and experienced MD and analysts.
good,"great place, great pay, great atmosphere, good food in the café. great work environment. Family oriented. Citi gives back and I love that about them.."
good,"Till date the best working place where i have worked."
good,Great benefits and career development opportunities. Citi is a great place to grow professionally. The training department still needs improvement. We have to learn the job while in production enviroment. It can be a little stressful. The employees are nice most of the time and try to help greatly.
good,"I am working with Citi for 4 Years. Good place to learn. Having lot of  scope to learn and develop, Citi maintain work place culture. Having its own advantages and disadvantages."
good,"Overall I would say working at Citi was good but they could work on minimizing pressure on tellers to refer and the unfairness mgmt can have on their staff especially with things like lateness, although it is a bad habit I don't think it's fair that they can write employees up for being late and they walk in whenever they like and there is no action taken against them."
good,"It's a good place to work but hard to promote unless you know someone or you fit the mold they hire for management."
good,Very reliable employee. Would do all necessary to satisfy customers need and experience. Willing to learn and to upgrade level of performance and customer relationship experience
good,"Working on Production support 24*7 as well handing clients requirements and try to complete the task on decided SLA."
good,"if you like stress, multi-cultural organization with chalenges, a good learning center, Citi is a great organization."
good,"The job environment at Citi was very productive however also very competitive amongst the field itself but also amongst coworkers. The implementation of collaborative work should have been enforced more to complete projects. The job environment was also very stressful due to somewhat poor management, therefore causing an unbalance in job work/life balance."
good,Good overall place to work though it requires you to navigate a big company.  The compensation is at the industry average and there is career movement possible but you have to be savvy about it.
good,Overall it's a fair place to work. Many of the typical challenges you'd see in any large organization but management is focused and intelligent. Compensation is competitive but sometimes hours are long.
good,"En general positiva, no obstante es mejorable en ciertos aspectos como la seguridad de los puestos."
good,Pelo fato de ser banco o cenário é menos flexível e dinâmico. Porém há bom clima entre as pessoas e uma certa estabildiade nas funções.
good,"My everyday duties include, everyday recording of clients transaction,sales, expenses and other client business engagement. Talking to clients, issuance of checks and making sure that legal compliance is followed, like tax payment and filling to BIR. Every trainee have their computer, we used MS word and Excel. Every month we had our supervisor examine our working performance. "
good,"I worked at Citi for two years.  I really enjoyed my time there until the end. The people are great however, on the floor there isn't much time to socialize.  I changed departments recently and the management policies were completely different than in my previous role."
good,"Overall Citi is a great place to work where the benefits are concerned. However they are not the greatest at making sure you have everything you need to do the best job possible. Their biggest short coming is that they do not make you track your own performance and brag in order to prove your worth. For those who are humble, mobility will seem hard fought."
good,"Citi is big.  Really big.  Like 200,000 employees.  Their IT is big.  Really big.  Can't count with my fingers and toes, that's for sure.  There's a lot of compartmentalization going on, so it's often difficult to get things done because you don't know which team does this little function you need."
good,"relatively good pay if you do not possess 4yr degree. paid time off including two weeks paid vacation, floating holidays, and 48 hours of unplanned time. Sliding into management positions is relatively rare as positions are few and far between and are typically filled based off of seniority. Policy and procedure are in continuous flux, which can make for difficult stretches of work periods"
good,"Citi was very flexible, and worked with their employees.  The work was not hard, is was challenging, but always gave you something new to look forward to almost each day.  If you are looking for change and learning, this is a great place to be.  Management were not consistent sometimes, but on most parts they tried to be fair.  It is a great company to work for, they really care about their employees, and always give little incentives to boost the moral of their employees.  I think that is good, because it makes up for those things that may have not gone so well.  Great company!"
good,"I started in collections, moved to Loss Mitigation, then to reporting over a period of 8 years. I received top-notch training and worked with a number of high-quality people. I am very thankful for all of the training and skills that I was able to develop at Citi. They are trying to do what is right for the customer and keep the business on track while remaining up-to-date with technology and the needs/wants of the customer."
good,"This is a great company to spend many years working for.  Management moved around a lot, but for the most part was a very positive environment.  Fast paced work environment but the staff worked great together from all teams to get the job done."
good,"Great work environment, not much of career advancement and need better pay. Worked with Citi going on 5 years, I feel I need to branch out and do other things"
good,"In 2016 our team was doing multiple jobs and was demoted which caused stressed on my part. However, I did learn a lot at Citi and I grateful for the experience"
good,Fast paced multi-tasking position(s). Company takes time time out for employee events to enhance the working experience. Ample training is provided and a pathway for advancement.
good,Great company to work for.  The people were were the driving force behind our success.  Senior management was always supportive of work/life balance.  Workplace culture was energetic.  Having a fitness center at work was a great way to stay active.
good,"empresa com cultura multinacional, ótimo ambiente e benefícios."
good,"Company offered great benefits and pay. They offered medical, dental, vision, 401k and time off based on term with company. Also had great time off for maternity leave."
good,"Working in Citi gives you a full grasp of the notion of the Citi that never sleeps. Having a number based environment pushed you and the rest of the team not to settle for less but for the BEST!"
good,"the benefit is great, the people work with is good and friendly but they always less staff so sometimes you need to work by your self without breaks in the middle."
good,Citi was a fair and generous employer. I often worked overtime and was always provided a car home after a certain time in the evening. My salary was competitive and the benefits they provided were great.
good,I managed a Review Team that reviewed full appraisals of SF and MF properties;  I had the aid of RedBell and local appraisers;  Typical day included completing up to 10 reviews per day; We learned to work well with surrounding Reviewers and shared valuation challenges; Management was available for clarifications; Workplace culture was balanced; The hardest part was very rural or isolated properties with limited market data and being  pressured by Sales to agree with optimistic value estimates;  Most enjoyable part was arriving at well supported values;
good,Was different experience working with Citibank in IT department. We had to deal with people from different department and have to speak in the their language to make them understand our work culture. It was challenge aan fun to work under such environment.
good,UW FNMA loans on proprietary AUS system.  Worked as a remote Underwriter.  Excellent management and leadership.  Paperless work environment with multiple business tax returns .  Worked from home
good,"Fast paced atmosphere w/ opportunities for advancement, IF you know the right people. Plenty of opportunities to work overtime. Benefits are active from day one. The people are great!! And ready to help in anyway needed. You become like one big family. Everyone knows what is required of them. It was a great place to work. I miss it."
good,Jobs are being relocated to low cost locations. There is a good work/life balance despite a heavy workload.  The typical workday includes contract negotiations and management of ongoing projects with assigned vendors to achieve saves for the organization.
good,"It was nice experienced working with Citibank many years ago, I was able to help my customer for their banking account and customer service questions."
good,Short sales during housing crisis stress full and a quota and negative feedback if numbers were not met sometimes it was like an assembly line. Not as customer focused
good,"Citifinancial closed it's doors.  Unfortunatly there are no local places to work.  However, over the last 22 years I have gained alot of experience in Customer Service skills.  Collections and a multitude of different tasks."
good,You take care of many clients per day (100+ at least).  They have very high expectations and can get grumpy if you don't deliver.  Having a great manager makes things better so if you find a location with one then you're off to a great start.
good,When I began working at Citi over a decade ago I had no idea it would turn into a career for me. Over the years I have been able to finish school and continually promote. I started off as an entry level collector and now I manage over a hundred employees and have traveled internationally for work.
good,The typical day is productive. I most enjoy the flexibility of working from home as needed. Some frustration lies in getting the right people on board to accomplish tasks. Daily tasks are not often clearly defined or supported. Philanthropic opportunities. Supports advancement of women and people of color leadership roles.
good,Management supports new ideas and focus on their employees growth. Work pressure is not that much. But sometimes taking calls from US and UK team can be a pain. They are trying to take away work from vendors in which you need to coordinate a lot.

Was also able to meet different people across all regions (APAC, EMEA and NAM)"

good,"Citibank is well know banking establishment in the Philippines. As a phone banker we assist clients in their credit card inquiries. Citi is a fun workplace since, we go out of town every month and we have an anti burn out party every 3 months. People here are like our second family which helps bring down the stress level of work. Hardest part is to convince customers to avail cash offers since most of the offers we gave have high interest rate. Working with them was still fun, most especially when you're able to acquire a lot of sales since you will reap the fruit of your hard work when salary comes."

good,"I joined Citi a year ago as an AVP, to work in an agile team doing enhancement and maintenance-work. For the most part, the work has been manageable, and although I've learned a few skills here and there (how to set up a local tibco EMS instance, etc), there's a certain degree of mushroom management in place where every team only knows what they need to know in order to get their own jobs done, and the potential to climb up and above and develop and design new products doesn't really show up. "

good,"I feel that Citi has tremendous opportunity to expand their client household wallet share but there are coordination challenges that distort the focus. They were relaxed on the technology front for too long and that cost them market share and brand loyalty to quicker competitors that were wrapping the investment and banking packages seamlessly.  It's unfortunate, Citi is a respectable company that has fierce brand loyalty among the Citigold clientele which if the focus is fine tuned could greatly influence the profitability of the retail banking channel.   I enjoyed my time with Citi, I wish them nothing but success."
good,"we work 5 to 6 times a week including holidays and weekends,here we learned a lot of things..how to deal with people..how to engage with people.. and how to understand people, when it comes to our management,they are really supportive..they will help you a lot to grow and how to be on top same as with co workers who are very cooperative and willing to give their support, the hardest part in this job is how to manage or balance work and life,but the most enjoyable part of the job is the adventure we go on different places/town, we meet different people as a part of our job... to offer our company's services"
good,Reconcile the Mutual Funds I work on on and process any incoming and outgoing transactions as needed.

On a given day, during the early hours you will find me speaking to the clients, finding out proactively what their priorities are for the week, meeting with team for half hour to communicate the clients’ needs and organizing the team schedules around the client’s priorities. I do this on Monday so that the rest of the week is well organized and we can effectively use our team’s time in exceeding client’s expectations and avoid Friday evening surprises."

The most enjoyable part was being able to improve those individuals that struggled the most in their performance.

good,Good working atmosphere. Pleasant co-workers. Easy location. The hardest part of the job was that it was not permenant.
good,"Talented staff,. Company encourages team work and spirit. Management always set short deadlines for completing work."

A complete audit could take up 21/2 hours to finish. So you were busy the full day. We were required to do 3 audits daily. Management was knowledgeable of the process and was readily available for any assistance needed. The hardest part of the job was getting a case with multiple loan mods or POC's. It wasn't hard, it just took longer to audit and you may or may not reach your quota for the day.

good,"High volume activity, Company cut backs place huge demands on remaining staff members, Great co-workers who were highly skilled where unfortunately phased out to be replace with low cost employees with little to zero experience.  Staff turn around became the norm afterwards with most new hires leaving after 3 to 6 months.  The days of 5 and 10 year dedicated employees is now gone.

My co-workers and management were a joy to work with and made the grind of having to complete lengthy audits more tolerable. Citi did a great job of organizing team building activities and functions to keep moral high and encourage a positive work environment. Hardest part of the job was dealing with the various changes that come when dealing with bankruptcy cases where the rules how to handle or the direction management would take to handle could change by the day or week which could lead to confusion at times. The most enjoyable part was being able to work at my own pace with out too much micromanaging for the most part and working with a group of dedicated individuals that made it feel like more of a family.

Citi got a great work culture, and posed as a great employer as a giant corporation. I was taught to be professional, to be detail oriented and to be driven for achieving higher career. I had my own career goal, and would be discussed by my Head ( Supervisor) twice a year. There were plenty programs that I could participate in such as job rotation or Management Associate Program. There is work life balance program as well. Citi hosted Town hall meeting every quarter. It was the time for sharing and celebration or doing the farewell.It is work hard and play hard culture. Citi also had a day for giving back to the community every year. All of employees will volunter  together at the same day such as building houses or planting trees in the forest . My hardest part of the job is also the most enjoyable of the job. It is exceeding customer 's'satisfaction with our banking experience and products. Citi has a great slogan which is Citi never sleeps or Empowered by Citi . The slogan had spoken itself to portrait how powerful the organisation is or how ready we are to the customers. "

My co-workers were committed to providing the highest level in customer service while protecting the bank's interests and security. The hardest part of working at Citi were the time expectations on each call. Many clients want and rightfully deserve the time to air their concerns and grievances without the associate needing to be concerned about seconds or minutes of time overage per call. I thoroughly enjoyed customer interactions, even the escalated calls that I took with customers who felt that they had been impacted negatively by one of the bank's policies. I learned that diversity has many forms and used these skills everyday."

good,"A empresa oferece serviços financeiros, financiados pelo seu próprio banco, o Citibank. Atuei na empresa como consultora de vendas destes serviços, financiamentos, refinanciamentos de veículos, crédito pessoal e consignado e seguros em geral. Um certo dia através de telemarketings realizados, percebi o cliente balançado por um crédito pessoal, a minha primeira atitude foi sutilmente verificar o que motivava o cliente a solicitar tal crédito. Desta forma, ampliei meus argumentos e pude oferecer algo que solucionaria o seu problema, um valor de crédito correspondente ao que ele pretendia realizar, através de um refinancimento de veículo. O cliente morava em torno de 2 horas e meia da filial e não havia possibilidade de ir até a agência, verificando que os benefícios para a organização seriam bem maiores que o custo da viagem, decidi ir até a sua residência e realizar o negócio. Dessa forma pude observar que é muito importante sempre compreender o que leva o cliente a aderir o produto e que mesmo que o negócio se apresente dificil de ocorrer, sempre deve-se avaliar a situação e os beneficios para ambas e tomar uma boa decisão. A gerência sempre trazia novos desafios, muito importante para a realização de novos negócios e um clima competivo no que se refere a produção. Esta empresa prestava serviços a empresa que anteriormente havia trabalhado, era necessário contato diário visto que era um dos nossos fornecedores e o gerente da filial não possuia um bom relacionamento com minha antiga supervisora criando uma dificuldade de relacionamento com este fornecedor.

good,My position as a Teller in Citibank was a great experience for me as I enhanced my customer service by meeting my quarterly goals which included offering our clients with credit card options and referring them to open new saving's account and also helping them with they're deposits and withdrawals. As I followed these procedures I helped my financial institution with they're financial quota.

good,Citigroup is an excellent organization for any individual with ambition and a drive for success. The global culture at Citi allows individuals the opportunity to travel as part of the organization and even move to different locations.
good,"Crazy, productive, fun, energetic, I am a mortgage processor. Citi taught me from the first day I started. For the most part I had AWESOME managers, Just wan't happy with excellent annual reviews and no pay increases."
good,Citifinancial was a very challenging job. The past two years the center I was working for was doing strictly collection calls. There were days that were very difficult. Other days were very fullfilling when your able to help someone in there financial situation it really makes you feel good inside.
good,"company was bought out by Citi, but great managenment and job advancement and great managers"
good,"Work closely with senior management in Legal and Compliance colleagues and members of other control groups, including"
good,"Started off with morning meetings, sharing positive and negative experiences from another day, office, district. Daily contact with customers regarding past due accounts - collections, refinance, deferments, whatever it took to resolve an account. Solicit of current customers to renew their business or to prevent future default. Walk in customers to make their payments and I always had to identify future needs. Constant interaction with customers was enjoyable, yet stressful trying to stay on track with daily activities."
good,Great customer service experience and outlook on the military from a financial prospective.
good,Citi is a huge company that is going in a ton of different directions. The old school mentality had softened recently and the downward spiral had seemed to come back to at least a horizontal direction.
good,"I was the 1st person there to open the door for my employees that worked under me,had to do daily reports 1st thing,was always at the office 1 hour before we opened,made daily projections on how many loans we was closing and how much are daily projection on collections,I approved un-secured loans up to 10,000,I learned alot at this job on how to run a office and how to manage my employees,My supv. the general manager was a very hard person to work for,he made the job very stressful,I didn't associate with my co-wkers,i was their manager,the hardest part of the job was the long hours and working 7 days a week,the most enjoyable part of the job was i worked my way up to a loan officer to a associate branch manager,plus the money wasn't bad either."
good,Private Bank has gave me the opportunity to interact with many different areas in order to learn in depth the products and services.
good,"citi bank is a great company to work for! you get a lot of professional experience and lucky for me, i had really great management who worked with us a lot to ensure that we were happy and moving forward in the direction that we saw fit for our careers. I had great co workers, we helped each other out, were available for help and overall and great and fun group of people to work with everyday."
good,"Empresa super agradável de se trabalhar. Aprendi muito no meu período de estágio passando por duas áreas grandes em RH, que foi Expatriados e Generalista."
good,Great co workers. Big Team environment and willing participants.
good,I started working at CitiBank in 2010 and currently still working there. There are many opportunities here. Everyone is friendly and hardworking.
good,"Citibank is extremely diverse, which make all employees feel welcome in the work place. Citibank also believes in working as a team."
good,Working at Citibank certainly has its benefits and disadvantages. The work environment is okay and the co-workers that I associate with in my department are very friendly. However this is not always the case and I always get the feeling that management and other co-workers are always trying to stab each other in the back so to speak and advance themselves individually instead of working together towards the common goal. The company does its best at eliminating these matters though which I do appreciate.
good,Great experience in dealing with customer service issues. As well as helping clients better manage their finances.
good,A typical day at work consist of assisting customers and providing them with information regarding services offered. I gained a higher knowledge of marketing skills. Management is professional and my co-workers were pleasant. The hardest part of my job was my last day on the job. The most enjoyable part was developing new relationships with my customers and being able to assist them.
good,"This is a good place to start and advance your career. Banking industry is not so solid in PR, but corporate bank is doing ok."
good,Would love to work for them in future. Management was very informational it what was going on behind closed doors.
good,Learning special projects with the occ
good,Loaded Atm's and bought money from the other tellers
good,"Everyday is a clean, organized schedule. Each day is lined out with my breaks and tasks before I begin. After clocking in I am pulling up my systems on the computer to begin taking calls and servicing clients needs. I answer all in-bound calls addressing customer account needs while attending any meetings scheduled to communicate changes and sharing best practices with co-workers. Always learning new processes to improve productivity and customer service. Management is always there to communicate in various ways when business changes and keep everyone on task. Co-workers are very helpful team players. The hardest part of the job is receiving a call from an upset customer and using company policies and empowerment to satisfy the customer before the end of the call. The most enjoyable part of the job is positive feedback from management, co-workers, and customers for all my efforts in performance."
good,I enjoyed very much my work. Allowed me to work either remotely or at company location. Wore many hats which made my work interesting and different everyday.
good,"great benefits, people i work with some times makes me feel like we are in high school, things are constantly changing."
good,"3 days off, must work saturday and sunday, must stay on phone 10 hrs at a time, safe work place, great benifits"
good,good company name
good,i worked as a asiistant of avp in citi bank for one year the enviornment is too profesional
good,"I have been with Citi for over 4 years. There are pockets of greatness here, but like any large organization, there are also challenges. There are a TON of opportunities for development if you seek them out and are supported by a good management chain. They are also more acheivable if you're located in the NY metro area. At times, things can become very political and people are given opportunities or are rewarded based on visibility rather than accomplishment. This can be a detriment or a benefit depending on your ability to network and be seen. Given the economic climate, it's also very challenging to be fairly compensated year over year working for a publicly traded Bank that is driven by shareholder profits. Unless you're commission based, the merit increase pool has been quite mediocre."
good,"Great salary, fun atmosphere, lots of shifts and schedules. Transportation is not an issue. One down side lacks job security."
good,"Es un gran Banco, en España no funcionó por su forma de trabajar."
good,"I worked for Citibank for over a decade and it was a wonderful experience.  Plenty of room for growth and career advancement.  Well managed and clear business focuses.  Customer Service is a high priority. Citibank offers a large variety of benefits.  Only downside is work/life balance, staffing is minimal not allowing for ""life"" to happen."
good,"Citi has it's pros and cons or good and bad. Working at Citi you never know where your career can take you because there's plenty of opportunities in many areas of the company. You start off as part-time depending on the position but can always work your way up to a full-time position. "
good,"enjoyable job, extremely faced paced with high pressure. Good level of support from seniors. Options regards promotion etc. limited however.Good work culture"
good,"Its one of the top investment bank to work with, it offers Good benifits. Good use of diversified technologies. Talented people to get to learn from them"
good,"Citi takes into consideration work/life balance, diversity, inclusion, and equal pay from men/women. They match 401k, and offer a variety of benefits including domestic partner. Hard to get time of on short notice. Have to put in time request weeks in advance."
good,"Citibank is a good company. Too many changes to compensations. They need to compensate their managers better, considering rhe amount of work they need to do."
good,There is a lot of flexibility in terms of working remote. Most of the time we are working on high priority issues that come at the last minute. Management is not very professional
good,"-Collaborative environment"
good,It's important to be a team player and be ready to deal with dynamic and challenging problems. Fast paced yet requires high level of quality control. Workplace culture is inclusive and fosters open and honest 360 feedback.
good,"The company is great to work for.  Benefits are the greatest thing.  Citi pushes to be actively involved in their local communities.  The work environment can be a struggle, as it changes at a fast pace.  If you are a quick learner and able to adapt to change, this is a great company to work for."
good,“The “C” in Citi stands for change” was not just a Private slogan. Personnel turnover is high. Policy change is constant. Computer programming change & problems are rampant. Lack of organization between shifts and upper management.
good,"It's an amazing place to work with tons of benefits but if you step on the wrong toes it can keep you in one place for an extended amount of time.. When i say tons of benefits I'm being truthful.. They have onsite daycare, 401k, dental, vision, health etc. If you're looking entry level and need help this the place.. but the amount of benefits does offset your pay against other banks."
good,Good place to work. Good benefits. People are more collaborative in working together. The company is a little bit slow in adopting new technologies from the market. Overall a very good place to work.
good,"Citi offers a lot to encourage and reward employees as a family. And for those who are willing to be patience and work for it, there's always room to move into positions that fit your skillset. Like most companies, there's always areas to grow in areas like communication and setting realistic expectations, but overall Citi is a great place to work."
good,"Working among bright individuals "
good,Lots of opportunities to move around in the company. A well established international company. Always adding new technologies that can keep the job challenging.
good,"The management are very helpful towards their employees in terms of productivity. Productive sales, fun and  work culture is great. Thinking positive helps you motivate to fullfill your goal. Love hitting the goal monthly. More incentives gets."
good,"Citi is a great place to work with great benefits and great people. I work in collections and a normal day is to talk to customers who might have gotten a little behind on their payments, have complaints or difficulties, suffer from fraud and many other situations."
good,"Exciting peoples, environment & workplace. "
good,"Overall, good experience. Technology is behind, company network freezes frequently, and management is not very helpful in advancement. There are pros see please keep reading. A good place that sells itself on friendly culture. If you're looking for a job that pays well or fair to the market, this is not the place for you. It is a good place to get experience and then leave so you can make some money that is online with the rest of the marketplace in your field."
good,Good place to work. Good assignments. Different departments have different culture so it depends on where you are in company landscape. Very nice exposure to global projects.
good,Citi provides facilities to work from home and flexible working hours as part of their good work life balance. A good working culture and capable senior management makes Citi a perfect place to live. Inclusion and Diversity is also Citi's priority .
good,"It set the bar high which allows you to view how other companies have fallen short of offering a competitive compensation package. Before the layoff it was the best place to work because people looked forward to coming to work. The employees made the job enjoyable. Coworkers were more like family. They had a daycare facility for employees which shut down some years ago. It was convenient for all parents. If Could turn back the hands of time to how it used to be, I would have never left."
good,"Citi should improve job placement opportunities for internal employees as well as improve pay scale.  However, Citi has great work-life balance and flexible work hours."
good,Worked at CITI for almost 20 years (transferred to CITI after CITI purchased Sears Credit Enjoyed my time at CITI good pay very good benefits.  Worked primary delinquent credit card accounts from 30 to 120 days.  Different tools used to help consumer bring account up to date. Wored some customer service.
good,"The day is full of meeting customers needs as well as staying up to date with all of the changes."
good,"Citi was my first job out of college. It was a good opportunity, and provided me a chance at a promotion soon after arriving there. I would recommend this company to anybody looking for experience."
good,"This was a good company to work for. Good benefits, time off and room for growth. My division was broken off to stand alone company and has been downsized ever since."
good,"My review of Citi, can be summarized as a great working experience,  and I did enjoy my time there. It was a great 14 year experience that, unfortunately,  ended from involuntarily separation but,  I  enjoyed my working growth experience."
good,"buenos benefecios monetarios, posibilidad de crecimiento "
good,"Most departments are very high paced production based. There is very minimal lines of communication with upper management and advancement is based on who you know. Compensation is very generous, job culture is good but a lot falls through the cracks."
good,Team was self motivated working on aggressive project leading to positive impact toward operations. All work and no play makes anyone dull but this is to my surprise not Citibank culture. We had a good balance of corporate social Responsibility events and Team bonding fun events as well. Diversity is a value deeply appreciated across the teams as well.
good,It is a good company for learning and advancement in new technologies since we get exposure to all the new tech stacks and frameworks involved in web application development. Work culture is also very good which involves loads of fun activities. Most important I learnt is problem solving when aggressive deadlines are involved.
good,I have enjoyed working at Citi bank for the past couple of months. My colleagues are great and theres barely ever a dull moment. My branch is very slow at times except when its pay day. A con about working at this branch is that it is difficult to meet credit card goals because it is the same costumers coming into the branch almost everyday. Most of them already have credit cards and some of them are not interested in it.
good,"Citi FIU Cards unit is a good place to work with above average compensation and benefits. However there was a high turnover due to staff boredom / burnout. Often productivity can be demanding and quality is measured. Although it was rare for anyone to be fired, there have been recent job cuts in the compliance unit."
good,Citi is great for individuals who are comfortable working in large global organizations.  Citi is know for promoting within and take great pride in this and offers a lot of programs to develop their employees.
good,Citi Was A Okay Job Management Sucked But The Job It Self Was Easy And Understandable. I Worked Over Night And It Was Great I Was Off Friday’s And Saturday’s I Worked Sunday Through Thursday From 11pm To 7:30Am That Was A Great Schedule Because I Also Attended School From 4pm To 8pm So I Had Tome Yo Do Everything
good,"Actually, I did not work directly for Citibank, I was hired for an Outsourcing by a call center named Convergys and I stayed there for three months but I was not very satisfied with the management and salry I had by that time, I also got a better offer from Amazon so I preferred to move."
good,"I would have like to continue working at Citi however my position was eliminated while I was out on short term disability, Unfortunately, there were no opportunities that matched my qualifications when I was able to return to work."
good,it was a pleasant experience work in citibank. I gained so much knowledge regarding documentation and marketing strategy. How to market your client and explained to them for filling the credit card.
good,As with any company there are those things you have to deal with and one of the biggest with Citi was compensation. The big increases were only given when it was forced.
good,Enjoyed working there. My branch manager and ops manager were excellent. District manager not so much. Advanced to head teller within one year but no advancement to personal banker. Received a lot of recognition at my position but I felt like I was overlooked to advance. Saw it personally that people who were less deserving than me got higher positions because they were brown nosing the district manager.
good,"good place to work, our team leads ensured that we have work satisfaction. we had very good team dynamics, we help each other to achieve our team goals."
good,Great benefits and good salary and incentives. The greatest thing about working in citi is its work culture and the incentives/ shift allowences. Can make good money if you sre dedicated.
good,Overall was a great experience to work at Citi. The Job culture was great and they are really involved with the workers. I would definitely recommend Citi for someone that wants to grow
good,Friendly environment but we have less interaction with office mates due to time constraint since i was working in the phone banking department. which means we have less time for other activities since we have a busy time handling customers on the phone.
good,"Dynamic, global team that views borders as untapped potential."
good,Constantly  changing policy and procedures to make opening accounts easier for the clients. Stressful  at times. Fun events. Managers work with you and help with understanding what's new to come.
good,commitment to get goals every day and give good & enough data to the senior management. new Knowledge every day about new standard or process to implement.
good,If you want to be stable and never leave or advance. This is the place. Moving up is hard to do. The management was pretty good. It was pretty laid back.
good,"In this role you are in a position of speaking with numerous customers per day about debt. while knowing your calls are being monitored, and evaluated, you have the overall environment of collecting the most. This makes it hard to genuinely care about your call and meeting the collection goal."
good,Great team environment and management support.  Opportunity to learn about innovative ideas and creativity.  One of the top tier banks in the world today.
good,Company provides a lot of opportunity to grow and has a great work/life balance.  A good or bad job really depends on what team you are on and the cultural dynamics of that group.
good,"good cooperative management , prolonged working hrs, well supportive clients , dedicated employees . Al together a fun filled place with lot of internal activities and tour trips arranged"
good,"Days are often long, however there is the ability to work remotely.  I was able to learn quite a bit about my line of work with on the job experience and Citi training.  Management is OK and the workplace culture is very inclusive."
good,"Citi was the first place I had direct reports and provided excellent management courses to help you in your new role.  My management is very encouraging about promoting your skills and giving you the tools to succeed.  I also gained vast knowledge in managing an offshore team whom I've never met in person, these are skills I will take with me into the future and use."
good,Like all teller position it can be a bit stressful but managers are experienced and fair. I think overall Citibank is a great place to work. Culture is better than other retail banks.
good,"Productive and fun workplace. Good management and quality assurance guidance.  Opportunity for bonus and overtime. Weekly team meetings. Opportunity for advancement,"
good,I’ve had a lot of ups and downs at Citi but have always felt at home and appreciated by my management and team. The people here are amazing. I’ve really enjoyed working in Citi in the various sides of the business.
good,"work environment is nice in Citi. "
good,A fabulous place to learn but little room for Promotion. I am looking for an opportunity to learn and use my management skills. Too many layers of management and politics. Constant disagreements between Global teams. NO dedicated project managers so little to no coordination between support teams during major upgrades or initiatives.
good,"It was nice while it lasted"
good,Citigroup was a good opportunity for my career. The dress code was casual. My coworkers were friendly. I'm glad to have banking experience in my resume.
good,"Citi is a productive place to work, I had to manage the internal communication program so I had to work with different leaders, managers, learn their way to work and it is great."
good,"Citi is a great company to work for, but job security is not at a high level as they always have a lot of lay-off every year. Their benefits are great and there is a lot of room for growth and career advancement"
good,Good Place to start your career. Flat org structure. Workplace culture is great and gives an opportunity to meet people. Global and have offices across the globe
good,"I am happy with the time I have put into this company and extremely grateful for the experience I have gained. I was able to take several courses over the span of 10 months in the introduction to leadership program, which helped me not only in my professional life, but my home life as well. The incentives offered such as benefits, salaries, etc. Are supreme, and the office environment is something I look forward to every day. The team dynamics are fantastic, not just with a branch but the district as well. I highly recommend working here!"
good,"The position is for those who can deal with stress and highly self-motivated. The compensation is based on the sales performance. It's a cruel system that if you didn't reach the standard, the income will be peanuts. However, if you can regularly meet or exceed the goal, the incentive is also very fair."
good,Been working for Citi for more than 20 years.  Cannot compared to other experiences as this is my only work.  Citi is the only company I have worked for.
good,Falta de Sensibilidad de Empleados con antiguedad de mas de 10 years
good,Citi is a great place to work. The company communicates frequently with its employees and makes many attempts to improve the culture and offer great benefits to working for the company. The promotion structure is not very clear and the KPIs that you operate on may not be clear or operate on a typical advancement model today.
good,"Like any position in the 21st Century, you get what you put in.  If you work hard, try to excel, and provide quality work, you can expect to be noticed and possibly promoted.  If you just try to skate by and do just enough, you are not guaranteed anything."
good,"Advancement was possible. There was balance between work and home, flexibility. I experienced a very exciting workplace culture. Diversity was great and celebrated."
good,"Great culture and great benefits. Citi is forward thinking and is consistently implementing employee feedback to improve.The best part of the job is great co-workers and managers. The hardest part is when you take service calls all day and it gets busy, especially during certain parts of the year it can be draining. It can also be a positive because you stay busy."
good,"Interesting work with the excellent opportunity to work from home several days a week. Great benefits, including company match of 401K up to 6%. Would have liked to have been more exposed to cross-training in other departments."
good,"Citibank offers their employees lots of room to grow. As long as you meet the metrics, compliance, and attendance, there are opportunities to move up in the company. If you have a special talent, and can travel, Citibank is international."
good,"I was working as payoff specialist at Citi Mortgage when homeowner wanted to get a payoff statement I was the one calculating everything and sending them the payoff statement that was showing them the amount they owe on their property. I also helped with Escrow accounts, Taxes, Homeowners loss draft , sending documents, faxing documents, cutting checks to homeowners for their property damage either by tornado, earthquake, hurricane, etc.  Since Citi Mortgage closed its brunch in Schaumburg, IL we all got laid off. Otherwise this was my dream job."
good,Citibank invests alot in its employees. I really enjoy the diversity and culture at Citi. Citi is always looking to build  strong partnerships and collaboration.  Benefits are great. Citibank also is great with working with the community.
good,"Citi is behind technology wise and trying to catch up.  Because of their larger global foot print the technology implementation is slow as they strive to make those platforms and BAU activities standardized globally. Overall, it's a great place to work as no place will be without its issues."
good,"Cit for me personally was a great training ground and provided opportunities for anyone who worked hard and proved themselves to be creative, reliable and responsible.  I cannot thank Citi enough for the opportunities that I was provided with during my many years there.  The key being that they recognized anyone willing to learn and grow and nurtured that."
good,"The work hours can be long, and due to the projects stressful, but the environment is supportive and appreciates the employees. There are many possibilities to build your career and there is a wide range of positions on the different fields."
good,"There's room for advancement and great pay, but you will pay for it wby sacrificing your time.Also, the analytics they use are somewhat archaic due to their size and conservativity."
good,"Citi has some benefits, but dont allow employees to work from home at all. They are easy going, but some teams take too long to finish their work and you can not submit because you are dependent on them."
good,"The co-workers are wonderful; management tries to make work fun. It is difficult to sit for eight hours, though. I've learned how to work with a diverse group of people and how to resolve various problematic situations."
good,"Compensation and plenty of leaves"
good,"As a result of Citigroup's global scale, there is opportunities available for personal and professional development within a very diverse portfolio of products. Dynamic workplace."
good,Citi seems to care about their employees for the most part. Citi is going thru Mortgage Transformation and things are starting to change...positions are not as secure as they once were.
good,Driven for success. Advancement opportunities were available to succeed within the company. Due to the companies change in location I would Currently be employed
good,"Citi do recognize employee's efforts in realistic ways;"
good,Good company to learn and work. Great opportunities for someone who is ready to work hard. Very senior leadership that would support one who thinks out of the box.

good,Citi is an excellent company to work for.  I've been there 12 years and was promoted 3 times and currently a vice president in Internal Audit.  I've learned a lot.
good,Community based company and works mainly with the general public to tackle financial needs. The culture is diverse and the nature is comfortable. I would still be working for the company had they not closed the office doors.
good,Co-workers and leaders are great but clients can be a little crazy at times. People are supportive of advancement just wish there was a little more direction to paths of advancement.
good,"Citibank is a very professional environment , it to me is the boot camp of banks .Training at Citibank is one of the best training you can experience in banking"
good,"A typical day at Citi is quite stressful, but is durable. They have great benefits and a lot of time off. Management is great for the most part depending on the assigned manager. Workplace is very diverse and they are involved in a lot especially in the community. Hardest part is managing the stress and meeting the goals and expectations especially as a college student, but they do work with you and help you achieve your goals. Most enjoyable part is the connection with everyone there and being apart of something."
good,"In Citibank, I've experienced a good working environment. I have a very team with great team work. We work hard and play hard together. Besides, Citibank had provide us many benefits such as commissions, medical benefits and leave benefits."
good,"talking to rude and hateful people all day can get old, you have to have the personality to take it all with a grain of salt, if you are an asset to your manager you may be passed over for a promotion no matter what the hiring manager says"
good,I enjoyed the reward program offered to Citi's employees. Citi has a partnership with Nike and other brands and they allow up to $500 rewards for merchandise. This was available twice a year.
good,Citi pays well for not requiring very much effort.  They heavily utilize program managers for every sort of program or project.  The days can be filled with endless phone calls since many customers are not local.
good,"`A typical day at work consist of every team member contributing too the daily task at hand in order for the flow of production too become productive too have a good in/out flow of products being consume and sold. Having good leads also help out with the flow of production. If  the lead in direct detail with the employees, the flow of production fluctuates and that cause poor statically number in the order of operations."
good,"I had a great experience at Citibank Brazil. I worked for almost six years in finance and had the chance to rotate through several areas. I learned a lot and have been through several different experiences. It is a very demanding job, but with good chances of growth and a nice compensation package."
good,"I would work for citi if allowed.  But under the circumstances for my resignation (family problems)  don't know if I could.  Love my job.  It has been quite a while, so not much more to say."
good,I loved working there. I was promoted within my department after only a year and a half. I would stitll be working there if our department had not been closed due to a buy out. We were laid off.
good,"great work life balance, good benefits, easy going management and staff.  Allowed to work remotely. generous maternity leave plan and location in Long Island City."
good,Overall good company to work for. Pay scale could be a little higher. When choosing management I think they do a pretty fair job. Insurance is really good.
good,"Productive and educational"
good,"My typical day at the office is having to work on different projects and assignments.  At times, it seems to be repetitive but it's helpful for when the same issue comes up again.  While you are working on your daily duties you learn so much and it helps you step up to other opportunities within the bank. "
good,Job was great and offered room for bonuses and raises. But at time could very stressful due to irate customers calling to make changes to accounts and or cancellation of cards.
good,Enjoyed working at Citi. will work there again in the future. Great work environment and good people. A lot of opportunity for advancement with the right people
good,"A typical day at Citi would be talking to clients on the phone as quick as possible and assisting their needs as quickly as you can. Sometimes those needs are lengthy and can drive your call volume goals off the charts. When I would help a clients needs real quick, I was told that I didn't do more for the client. Then when I did more for the client, I was told that I wasn't fast enough with getting them off the  phone."
good,"Full Hours, Good Benefits."
good,Lots of room to make your mark.  If you want to work and do projects there are always side jobs you can work on.  There is opportunity for skill development.
good,"not a bad place to work at kind of felt pressured to leave will miss the company the benefits are great , but the pay isn't very competitive which should be evaluated."
good,"Citi is an inclusive workplace which encourages hard work and pushes you to your potential. As expected, IBD hours are long, however the work is engaging."
good,"We'd work 830AM to 500PM assistingt customers, with a 30-minute lunch break to get delicious meals of various ethnicities from the cafeteria.  The bad thing about this job was that it could only be accessed by an ""Express"" bus service that only ran Monday thru Friday, and not on the weekends, whe it was also needed."
good,Citi has good training in place for all employees in the information security sector. The atmosphere is laid back with a lot of focus on getting the work done.
good,Good company to work for great . stressful positions and I believe under paid staff for having to deal with all nth negativity from the clients and then from all the rules and changes
good,Responsible for production of competitive market intelligence and created feature-to-feature matrices for facilitating access within a LAN based network. Edited reports and news announcements; managed middle market intelligence; created performance matrix of 30 tech company start-ups for leads and crosschecked potential middle market customers to internal client lists for 200 companies. Negotiated with external vendors for high level priority projects.
good,"Can at times be a lot of work.  Sometimes challenging, sometimes stressful.  But overall a good place to work.  Very large company but offers ability to specialize.  Excellent benefits."

good,"A typical day at Citi consists of logging into the computer and checking emails then logging into the phone and assisting customers. I learned amazing customer service skills while at Citi which I am extremely grateful for. I've learned so many wonderful skills and lessons from Citi. The workplace culture at Citi is growing and it's great. There are lots of different activities for people to do at work that make the day a little more fun for everyone. The hardest part of the job is the mean people on the phones. Not everyone can be happy all the time and that's completely understandable. I do love when people call in angry or upset, and by the end of the call, I have them laughing and calmed down. The most enjoyable part of the job has to be the nice people that genuinely appreciate you helping them."
good,"Citi is a great place to work for me personally.  You could say that I earned my masters degree working at Citi -- acquired many professional skill-set. I went thru a few mergers and was given opportunities for growth, promotion, salary increase and many other incentives.  They offer Training and Development and other great programs for their employees."

I process insurance claim, I also processed loans that was secured by signatures, autos, and mortgages. I also processed accounts for legal action. I gave and received credit inquiries. Review credit reports, and verified resident and employment. I had to meet a company goal for insurance sales. I also had a goal to make so many loans a month, also lending a certain dollar amount a month of the personal loans category and real estate loans. I also had to collect certain dollar amount monthly to reach the company projected percentage for delinquency. There were training and career advance opportunities. ( until I was laid off ). Management was flexible and caring. The workplace was comfortable environment. The hardest part of the job was selling a 25.99 interest rate on a 2nd mortgage loan. The most enjoyable part of the job was the peoples and the perks."
good,"I had a great working experience in Citibank.  My manager and coworkers are easy to work with.  If I could, I would stay longer working in Citibank.  My job as displaced."
good,It is a great place to work but housekeeping is under paid for 3rd shift and for the things that need to be done your not paid enough for the 6 hours of work.
good,Was able to work with the CitiCards largest client Sears Credit Card. Was in charge of the capacity planning of nationwide site locations. developed planning worksheets and lead national calls weekly.
good,Citi is a great place to work. The job requirements are structured in a way that employees know exactly what responsibilities they may have and know what it takes to meet the tasks set before them.
good,"Great diverse atmosphere, onsite gym and cafe are great perks, parking was a nightmare if your starting time was after 9am a 1/2 walk in the dark after working 10 hours was not pleasant."
good,I started my banking career as a teller with Citibank.  During my tenure I was promoted several times and given the opportunity to attend training classes for professional development.  The bank recognized team players and encouraged career advancement.
good,work hours are from eight to five everyday except the weekends which works great. management is fantastic however it is a corporate job which also may be a issue for some.
good,Lots of people set in their ways. Don't want to change and lots of manual work. Needs a lot of automation and people are unwilling........................
good,Always new challenges to meet and overcome.  Change is frequent and keeps the job fresh.  Co-workers and management are generally collaborative and knowledgable.
good,"Citi provided a well-structured internship experience, but it varied team by team and project by project. My personal experience was good, although my manager provided a little feedback on my work but my peers were helpful and accessible anytime I needed any help. Overall a good learning experience."
good,"Great place to work if you want good benefits. The pay is good.  However, I believe they do not always pay according to skills/abilities due to their ""scorecard"" process used for monthly and annual reviews to determine pay raises."
good,"Worked with a portfolio of clients to implement cash management services. This included training on and up sales of products and services. The people were hard working, but encouraged to compete. Bonus was discretionary  regard."
good,I loved that they had phone interviews after doing an assessment on the internet. It allowed the new hires to be assessed by their qualifications and not their appearance. The work was fast paced and the management team was fine. Compensation was below standard rate.
good,"Great environment, always changing.  Technology in the individual departments is a bit behind the times.   Meritocracy is encouraged.  pay increases for internal moves could be more."
good,"Love their benefits, best across the industry.  Their keeping of older Managers that didn't change with the times was a downfall for this bank.  Everything else was great."
good,"The workflow for this job never materialized and as such, the consultants were terminated. It was a very poor experience with the recruiting firm Edelta as they piggybacked on another firm's ""in"" with Citibank. They kept putting off the assignment for 2 months or more, trying to get in to Citibank, which they eventually did."
good,The day began at 8:30 and could end any time between 6:00 and 7:30 challenging but rewarding. I learned a lot of valuable information. Management and culture was positive.
good,Citi has opportunity for growth and the pay is decent for the type of work that you do. You can do well there as long as you are always willing to learn and grow.
good,"It was a good bank with nice benefits and a day care for little children, lounge area for breaks.  Nice vacation package and benefits. The only complaint I had was low wages, micro-management and cut-throat quotas."
good,"Independent projects assigned to learn and build confidence at a professional level. Plenty of growing opportunities. It is a competitive bank, sometimes the work can get demanding expect more than 100% of effort and that can get taxing."
good,"I was brought on to Bisys by some the best people I have ever worked with. The work I was hired to do was, for me, the opportunity of a lifetime."
good,"Worked at Citi in different departments, internal networking is not too bad. The benefits were good and working remote was usually 1-2 days a week depending on the manager decision. The internal technology could use a lot of work, and better communication at internal mobility."
good,As the business banking officer my main responsibility was to maintain the current client relationships whist also proactively seeking out new clients and new business. Be a subject matter expert on the offerings to the clients and be able to sell the clients on why their business should switch to my company.
good,Citi made sure you understood the task at hand. You were expected to be on time and work efficiently and at a steady pace. The work environment was casually and that worked well with the culture.
good,"absolutely loved what i did. as long as you dont mind calling the elderly and sickly, and demanding money out of them you know they dont have, its a great job"
good,over all its a good company with good package. Employees will be given all the opportunity to grow their career and step up to the next level in the career ladder
good,"The job was very easy, well organized and a very diverse company. Lot of advancement with great people willing to learn and the growth within the company it’s in the rise."
good,"Citi is a good place to work, but i had a manager that showed favoritism. It is all about the numbers and if you didn't have them come month end, you stayed until you did."
good,Great company to work for. Projects are challenging and interesting. Try to get best solution out of the team. Flexibility to work from home some days helps in work life balance.
good,"This is an excellent place to get training, and experience in a few different fields as they do invest in potential unlike many places. The greatest drawback is that at any given moment the direction of the company could completely shift, and they lay off entire departments, and areas of operations as a regular practice. The pay is great for entry-level positions, but proceed with the thought process that you're there to gain experience, and move on, or plan to shift areas within. Some departments, or teams have excellent leadership while others operate under volatile, and undesirable direct management. Sadly, it is the luck of the draw. You will need patience, a willingness to learn, thick skin, and a back-up plan for certain."
good,"worked there for a year, decided to quit due to a lack of passion for the job itself and desire for a different kind of work. my main duty was to help customers over the phone."
good,"Citigroup bought a company known as ""The Associates."" for which I worked.  I started with Citi approx. 1999 and worked there until Citi decided to close down their operation in Houston.  I could have taken a transfer to Chicago or Irving, TX but decided to call it quits."
good,"I worked in customer service, which can be challenging, but they prepare you well for it and provide you with the necessary support to do well and advance in your role. It was many years ago that I worked for them, but I have friends that still work for them today and love their job just as much now as we did when we started."
good,Great dynamic cultural environment that allows for growth and has great benefits. Different networks that you are able to join and be fully involved in as well as lots of volunteer opportunities.
good,Citi is a well known company with several different departments in the mortgage field.  They are very flexible with work schedules and have many benefits.  The company also promotes internal hiring.
good,"Typical day in Fraud Ops. involves taking inbound and making outbound calls on customers accounts with suspicious activity. Calls flow can being very busy at times and some calls can be stressful because customers can be VERY condescending. This position involves using instinct, being quick, and being thick skinned. I feel that for the most part management cares about the employees. Voluntary VTO/OT often. Lots of reward and recognition for meeting goals, etc. Resume building projects resulting in off phone time for high-performing agents. On-site cafe, gym, daycare, bank, post office/UPS/printing center on a huge campus. Great benefits which make up for any lack in compensation. Job security seems a little iffy based off layoff's I've seen in the Mortgage dept. 10 hour shifts available -- extra night and weekend pay. Overall, a nice place to work and Fraud Ops. is a good place to start."
good,"A great exposure. Worked in the Finance and Risk operations department under the head. Was part of a lot of projects including  People and talent framework, CSC Town Hall, Mumbai CSC Value Proposition. Worked for a total of 45 hours a week."
good,"Excelente compañía, es una lastima la decisión de venta"
good,"Gym in the NYC headquarters office was the best perk of working at Citi. They had fitness classes all day available to employees. However, most employees don't feel comfortable taking advantage of this perk because I higher value is seen on time spent at your desk rather than amount of work accomplished. You did have to pay a monthly fee for the gym but the convenience made it well worth it. There is also a cafeteria in the office which is very good. Also not free though. Great phone plan is available for employees."
good,Overall good experience working with the SPEC team and High profile Unit. Management was very helpful and communication was very transparent. Pay rate was the challenging.
good,its a great place to work at as long as you want to work. it can be stressful if you don't want to at least try. high work ethics required. honesty is a must

good,"Great place to make great money. The hours are great if you pick the Best schedule for you. The company is very stressful itself. The"
good,"In the financial world, there is always competition.  Citi is always trying to stay ahead with innovative ideas, products and services.  I was on the ground floor on many of these ideas so I got to see the work that goes into it.  Citi can be stressful at times but within reason. I would recommend Citi as a place of employment for a long term career."

good,A day working at Citi is a normal day with good people and a laid back work environment. I have gained much mortgage accounting skills in my current position. I love my job but I am looking for a job with better pay.
good,"my position was a stressful position that was demanding to get your incentive bonus, which was about 40% of my annual income. I really enjoyed talking to people and helping them get the most out of their credit cards. There is a very diverse culture and I learned a lot about people."
good,being a major credit card company they provide flexible hours & will compensate you for speaking alternative languages. Bonuses are available pending productivity.
good,"Citi is a good place to work, although in my two years there, there were little to no opportunities for advancement. I worked in the e-Services department where i helped walk through customers with registering credit card accounts on various websites. I also provided navigation assistance as well as answering account-specific inquires."
good,"great work culture, employee- friendly environment, helpful and approachable management, best processes followed, learned team work and interpersonal skills"
good,"what to expect going into a Citi call center is as follows. Your schedule wont change unless you apply for a shift bid. Management is great unless you and your direct manager become at odds. Call volume is often back to back and can be stressful if you happen to have a bad call which could include customers becoming verbally abusive. Training is somewhat lacking as a majority of what you learn is on calls and not in the training class as even the trainers will advise. Enjoyable aspects are the calls where everything just seems to go right, as well as the group of people you become friends with."
good,"Good working environment , have been associated with the wealth management team in hyderabad . "

good,"Working in a call center can be a very mundane job.  Fortunately, Citi does a lot to make it fun while you're working.  They offer a huge benefit package, and the atmosphere is usually upbeat."
good,Large organization with global footprint and multitude of diversity initiatives. Internal mobility is possible and often encouraged.  Easy to get lost if you're not on top of your responsibilities.
good,"people at citi are generally helpful. I didn't agree with many of their policies as far as how they went about selling financial products. I believe that there was too much emphasis on generating volume of sales as opposed to figuring out what the customer actually wanted. This produced a very ""pushy"" environment, and created a level of urgency that my not have been as productive as upper management would like to think. other than that, I would say its a great company if you want to move up in finance."
good,"The best thing of the Citi as an organisation are the ethics and values that are embedded deeply into culture, which takes the dignity of the organisation to the highest level."
good,"Early starts for the Trading Floor 7.30am ready for 8.30am Market Open. There is loads to learn in the Stock Market, you never stop learning which keeps you current. Hard working and sometimes competitive culture, you're working amongst exceptional individuals. The hours are long and can be intense/stressful. You get a great buzz from the job and great fun after work with all your fun colleagues."

good,A business management graduate is being challenge for an accounting job. Everyday all the staff are busy from the time of entry until the end of the day.

Staying 5 months in this company as newly graduate teach me to be a professional staff.
good,Large organization with varied job opportunities across the country and internationally. Healthy work environment and on balance conscientious management with many outstanding peers.

good,"I liked working for Citi, I had an opportunity for growth and I liked helping people when they needed help with financial relief.  We created a win, win situation for the company as well as the client to help keep their account in good standing."
good,The mortgage department was a production environment. It was busy and constantly changing. The company provided a great number of fun activities for the employees.
good,Citi is made for people to learn a bit about finance and really learn about customer service. At the particular branch that I am at Management is quite fair. Bureaucracy plays a role sometimes but is not the driving force of my particular branch.
good,"I liked it but it is too far from the rest of St. Louis. This is an issue, if you don't have a car getting here will be impossible or expensive. As are a lot of places to work in the St. Louis area."

good,Citi provides a lot of challenges to its people which allows them to grow and develop. its a fast paced environment and the company is global meaning there are reporting lines to other regions
good,"I believe working at Citibank has exposed me to a greater future because it has taught me a lot about what life has in store for an individual. It teaches you how to finance and manage your financial life. Such as knowing how credit cards, loans, mortgages, etc work Although, I would admit i have grew a level of tolerance dealing with rude people who have unnecessary attitude. The hardest part of this job is the cash that you are handling. I am one of the head tellers who is in charge of the vault which contains a large amount of money. Balancing your cash at the end of every day will take on a level of stress. I do enjoy the satisfactory of people who feel that I have went above and beyond to help them answer and solve any issues regarding their bank accounts."
good,"Fast paced and demanding environment. Mistakes will cost you opportunities. Work culture is great, in terms of employee appreciation and most people are helpful."
good,"Grat company "
good,"If you are good at customer service Citi is a good place to work. You have to have patience because you are working with the public and you never know what mood someone is in. The good thing about working for Citi is the benefits. medical, vision, dental and 401k"
good,Was a very good company to work for.  Days were filled with many tasks. City sold its auto division to Santander.  They are no longer in the auto business.
good,"Day to day at Citi is a challenge to manage conflicting priorities and time constraints.  But it is a great place to learn  and they are on the leading edge of financial services trends.  There is a real meritocracy culture of advancement but networking is key to finding new opportunities.  Like most NY based financial services firms, there is a trend to move jobs outside NY.  Management under Michael Korbat has the firm on a good trajectory."
good,"Certainly a place I would love working again."
good,Citi is a great place to work.  I have learned so many things over the past 13 years and continue to each day.  I have been very fortunate to have amazing managers and co-workers over the years.
good,"Aprendizaje  en telemercadeo, conocimiento del sector financiero"
good,"I love this job in the sense that I really love my co-workers. My job is very demanding and time consuming through out the entire day. The management decisions made here are not employee friendly however. We are rushed through training, expected to still work while training and have no mistakes. That is not appropriate."
good,I really enjoyed working at Citibank. The flexibility for available shifts were beneficial and was great for balancing work and life challenges. The environment and work place is enjoyable and nice.
good,Citi are great advocators of a good work life balance. Working from home is becoming more common and having to commute a good distance every day the team are so accommodating with flexible start and finish times. good place to work and great pay. you will be looked after in this company. red tape can be overwhelming but you get used to the process of a large multinational company.
good,I had been in this company for 8 years and I must say that my communication and interpersonal skills was more developed. I work in shifting hours and had fun being with my colleagues.
good,"2 weeks Paid Time off per year"
good,"Trust me I would not have left this company if its continued..."
good,"Long hours, compensation was ok not great. Very fun place to work a lot of activities for employees very family friendly environment. Great campus and cafeteria."
good,"Fast paced work environment. I worked on 182 systems world wide, North America, Latan  America, EMEA, CCEMEA, Asia pacific. I worked as an technical analyst and did batch recovery. We ran 3.5 million jobs a month. I also did mainframe operations and change. I monitored all systems and was responsible for the batch workload using OPC and CA7 scheduling packages. I was responsible for making all SLAS during my shift. I worked with numerous programming groups and upper management. I did numerous minor and major implementations and numerous COB (Continuity of Business) tests."
good,"This job was perfectly fine seeing as to how I worked in a mixed neighborhood with a mixed staff (Racially). The difficulty level of the job quickly changed once the upper management started to change the employees within the branches, putting people places they had no business being."
good,"good job with good benefits- managements changes a lot and you are able to move up in the company. Once you adjust to the call volume and requirements for average handle time and schedule adherence, you will be fine. Took me about a year to get it controlled.."
good,charging higher rates for loans...collections for these loans monthly to meet goal... good bonus plan for exceeding goals...good management helpful when needed
good,"Citi is a good job for you, if you want good benefits, decent pay, and a job where the customer is usually always ""right""..if you work day time they have a cafe and they have a on site gym (that doesnt cost too much), they also have a on site daycare and medical if needed.. Citi is a good place to work, if you have a manager who isn't constantly hounding you."
good,Citi provides tremendous opportunities for advancement in ones career. The best way to break into the industry would be through one of their many different programs.

good,"Realizando muchas orientaciones a los clientes en relación a sus créditos y formas de pago.Facilidades, convenios y regularización de deudas vencidas."

good,the only complaints I have is how difficult it is to change your schedule. The benefits are amazing and so is the work environment and how every one is willing to work as a team
good,Learnt a lot of applications and work environment was a pleasant place. People were very friendly and was team players as we deal with global market with other countries

good,The wage pay does not meet what the job is worth. they start out with very very low pay. however they do have an excellent daycare at their call center
good,On the phone all day collecting past due accounts. The job was enjoyable until someone is unhappy about an interest rate.  When I could help someone out successfully that is what made it enjoyable.

good,Ótimos benefícios.bons gestores.boas oportunidades.
good,"Citibank has been a pleasure to work for.  It's a fast paced job with excellent benefits and the ability to advance in your career with ease.  I just laded myself in a position that I can't get out of and no longer suits my needs. The environment is fun, but management is known to pick favorites.  I love Citi but its time for me to move on."

good,"Lots of growth, interesting work.  "
good,long work day. very repetative. management was changing every year. hardest part of the job was being sure that every customer left happy and that you would be given a good score on the random survey calls that they sent clients. the best part of the job was the daytime hours.
good,Company is good when it comes to career opportunity but work life balance is pathetic.Some processes have good work life balance some dont. People managers hardly care about each other
good,"Typical day: Conducted daily meetings for my projects with the team.Conducted change control meetings and created reports."

good,the environment is collections so the job can be very stressful.  the management wasn't bad but it did depend greatly on who your manager was.

good,Wonderful incentive programs though they were very challenging to reach most months. Great comradery among staff. Management very considerate and fair.
good,"Management was always open to new ideas, feedback and opportunities to help the business thrive. The people from Day 1 made it a great place to work. Opportunities were scarce given the economical environment at Citi (Canadian operations have been for sale for some time). My work was both challenging and rewarding. Legal collections was something I aspired to long before getting the chance to work in that department."
good,"You can earn a lot of money and gain valuable experience at Citi, but expect to work very hard for it. The corporate culture promotes its self to be flexible, but that varies greatly from department to department."

good,I've only been working at Citi for about 6 months but I can tell if you are looking for a job with potential to advance this is the one for you!
good,"Most of the days I get early so I can get my emails and transmittals. I list everything that I need to do in the whole day in order to be organized. I manage my time properly.

I am proficient in latest software and also excellent in written communication skills."
good,Overall a good company to work for. They have great benefits and competitive pay. The biggest downfall would be the types of calls you take on a daily basis can break you down. You would to have a thick skin.

I learnt about banking and financial services and well-managed for management. I enjoyed with my co-workers. The hardest part of the job is we had to compete and try to achieve as soon as possible. The most enjoyable part is I could meet with clients in the high level and from many kind of background. Overall I enjoyed the job.

The company is very diverse which is a plus. The atmosphere can be very aggressive and changes within the company can be challenging. As an analyst, there are tight deadlines to meet at the end of every month."

good,Working the flex schedule was ideal for coverage from the corporate stand point but working every other Saturday was not profitable. Some of the best Managers I had with Citi were from this department. They actually taught you new techniques and made a great working environoment. The medical benfits rocked! Job advancement was limited as we were the only Citi Originated Team which meant that you had to downgrade to hopefully get an upgrade a year later. The flex schedule did make family/life outside of work kind of hard to maintain College and other life events.
good,"Being productive is the key to the game. Citi offered many ways to be productive but each manager run things different. The rotating schedules make it difficult with family or life events but most Managers are willing to work with you on the schedule. Job advancement is the hardest part at Citi. When we were given notice of the company laying us off, they offered lower scale positions that didn't meet the demands of cost of living. 4 out of the 85 stayed with Citi from our entire department. Each manager ran her/his show different. There was no set guidelines per say which had its good points but also had its bad points. The health benefits were amazing!"
good,"Benefits are nice, 401k match is the best of any company I've worked for.Flexible for work/life balance. Plenty of opportunity to learn different aspects of mortgage within the company from default to originations to fraud and the banking side"

good,"Answering 50+ calls per day while working other accounts. Everyday I learn more ways to help our customers.  my manager and coworkers are great, we adjust to changes with in the department and with each other.  The hardest part of my job is when I am not able to help a customer immediately.  The most enjoyable part of my job is my customers, my ability to help them and the thankfulness hey feel when I have cleared their credit cards for use."
good,"The people at Citibank are great.  "

good,The growth opportunities are amazing and eldless. Learning and accountability are the biggest keys to success I can provide.
good,"No day was ever typical. The only thing that was typical in here was curveballs.  I worked hard, was articulate and resilient, all of which stood me in good stead, however the attrition rate in the team was like nothing I've ever experienced.  At all levels, it seemed like only a matter of time before someone moved on or buckled under the pressure.  Still, the people I worked beside showed amazing team spirit and commitment.  A great learning experience."
good,"Citi's culture focuses on families, fun, community and the wellness and happiness of it's employees.  Citi offers numerous ways to develop as well as ample opportunity to grow within the company."

good,"Work Culture in Singapore is completely different and am really passionate with that."
good,"Balanced work culture, pay is not that attractive. diverse environment and ready to work hard and go an extra mile due to teams scattered all over the world. Adjustment to different time zones are needed. If you're 8-hours guy then some times you may feel difficult to work"

good,"a good to place work with young crowd. good co-workers, enthusiastic people. work life balance is good. and the big campus is add on."
good,Citi provides a very autonomous environment to run a business within the construct of the company's objectives.  Management is very client oriented and providing a great direction for the company.
good,"The company offers many benefits including working with diverse groups, health benefits, vacation and sick time, and a healthy work/life balance."
good,an overall great corporate environment.  good culture.  across the board just great.  only downside would be compensation.  wages and wage increases are not in line with competition or education
good,"Citi is a good place to work. Work ethics is fantastic and the culture is lovely.Working with Citi for me has been lovely and challenging. It is a lovely place to start and build a career."
good,"A great work environment with a common goal . To be the best global bank in the world. Friendly staff with hard working individuals who all portray their own traits. Management is understanding and flexible with work/ day life. A typical day at work involves interacting with high risk clients, day to day transactions, weekly reconciliation and quarterly reports.  Some task include scheduling staff lunches and duties, maintaining and proving ATM's , clerical work, keeping up to date  with current trainings for staff and ensuring the bank is within compliance of all AML, KYC laws."
good,"Good company to work for. Though you run into roadblocks due to politics, overall senior management works hard to break silos and roadblocks"
good,"In spite of all the work and being on your feet for longer periods of time, the place is a grate place to work. Management was kind of shaky but it did the job. Co works were exceptional individuals that I wouldn't regret knowing them."
good,"Citi provided me with 13 great years of work experience in various positions.  Sadly, do to many budget cuts, job security was questionable each year and many departments were closed out.  Opportunities for growth and training were made available but with constant reduction in staff, no one was ever certain which department would be affected next. Management, however, was always very supportive and encouraged and challenged individuals regarding personal growth."
good,"I truly enjoyed my time at Citi. However, being knowledgeable is sometimes detrimental to your career. As long as you go with the flow you will be all right"
good,citibank is a nice place to work with...its trainings is superb...but change in the nature of work...leave me no choice but to leave
good,Citi is a great company with amazing working conditions. The environment is challenging and full of opportunities to learn a grow. I wish everyone have the opportunity to work in a place like Citi.
good,"Excellent work culture with a systematic hierarchy of management.  Meeting the targets are always a challenge but enjoying the same is not common, a place where you enjoy what u do"
good,"I worked for Citigroup for 14 years. I was very happy the first  few years but they became so tied up with red tape regulations from the government, that it was hard to do your job and be fair to the clients.  Be prepared to get licensed in insurance sales and mortgage license to keep your job."
good,"Passionate staff seeking out the best solution to resolve mortgagors issues. The most enjoyable part of the job was bouncing ideas between management and staff, and agreeing with making the work environment enjoyable and productive."
good,Too big of a company if you want career advancement long term. Not bad to enter as an experience candidate but not for recent college graduates
good,"Overall, Citi has a better work environment than other companies I have worked for. "
good,Nice place to work with a wonderful diverse group of people. A lot of change and huge learning curve do to the sheer size of the organization but very rewarding.
good,"A typical day at work includes reaching out to broker/dealers to identify the investment accounts of internal Citi employees. I verify if the accounts are open and obtain any records available for them so Citi can remain within compliance. Upon receiving the statements I perform preliminary investigations to make sure the information is current, accurate and is correctly documented.The hardest part of the job would be making sure to pay attention to all the details that can affect the records we keep. One mistake can cause regulatory issues. Although it can be tedious, I enjoy that I am learning what goes into making  sure that the bank is following the letter and spirit of the law and in turn ensuring that shareholders and customers can trust the institution."
good,"I spent many, many years at Citi in different departments/positions and it was a really great place to work. Unfortunately, they closed our site and most of the employees were laid off.  I would have stayed with the company until retirement had this not happened. Good employees, great pay, great benefits. Made many wonderful friends over the years and miss the daily interaction with them. Also,  I think many employees didn't realize just how good it was at Citi until they had to find new jobs with new employers. Just too bad it had to end."
good,"Life at Citi is okay. I learned how to develop a sense of urgency, dealing with fast production of credit cards. Management isn't the greatest but they're also noth worst neither. My coworkers are easy to work with. The hardest part of the job is the lack of growth within the company.The most enjoyable part about the job is being able to increase highly effective communication skills."
good,"Provides a good Work/Life Balance."
good,Productive  and fun workplace with Gyms and a very well maintained cafeteria.Improved my time management skills and also the co-workers were too friendly and environment was cool and fun to work.

good,"Excellent Company to work with, training is good, management is good, overall I would rate the company above average as it is a nice company with better work environment."
good,"I learnt a lot about banking aspect of the job and banking systems-"
good,"Very nice working environment, with good levels of autonomy. You must be a self- starter to fit in comfortably, but the culture is open and friendly."
good,I enjoy my time at Citi immensely.  At the time the travel was perfect for my life.  I learned many skills and will always be proud of the work I did there.
good,Fast paced environment with a fun and supportive leadership team that empowers its employees. Challenging job with good opportunities for advancement and career development.
good,"Interacting with sales staff "
good,"1) working from 9am - 6pm everyday except weekend and public holidays"
good,"Citibank is a great company to work for while I was going to school. Citibank pays for tuition reimbursement and provides all there part time and full time employees with good benefits. As a part time employee I was offered life insurance, medical, dental, vision, 401k benefits as well as paid sick time and vacation."
good,A personal favorite of mine. This place had an atmosphere which made it easy to succeed at your job. Excellent teaching and leadership. Management was strong and they treated you the way an employee should be treated.
good,"Typical day shift Monday through Friday financial operations job. It's a pretty good place to work from a temp stand point. No phone calls, all computer work. Going permanent is possible but not guaranteed."
good,"Start day off with Daily huddle, focus of day. Hot topics-operations updates , sales from prior day , get each employee commitment for the day. Have a 10 huddle with partners to get their status and commitments. At noon spend time behind tellers window , focus on Heat Map if red this time both ABM and BM on floor. Check in with PB as to where they at with sales. Meet with every customer who sit with PB. Wrap up at 4:30 with AD as to result for the day. In addition check email response and prep for next day."
good,They allow you to work from home sometimes depending on your manager. So far the management I have came across is good. The culture could use a little work. The moral is down due to layoffs. The hardest part of my job is having to stare at a computer screen all day and sit behind a desk. The most enjoyable part is when I get to interact with other employees.
good,Overall it has been a very good experience working at Citi.  I have been fortunate to meet many great people who have taught me much and have taken an interest in my development as a trader and as a person.
good,Job descriptions are very specific and and the training prepares you adequately prepare for your job.  It has been the most professional environment of my career.
good,"Very busy days at work but exciting. Changes were constant but they were positive changes. You could move around to different assignments and learn a great deal."
good,"Citi prides itself in being a meritocracy.  I was skeptical at first but learned there is genuinely a culture of rewarding employees for a job well-done.  Employees are rated on a bell curve and everyone knows they are competing for their ranking and rewarded for performance. Citi is currently undergoing a critical review of all AML processes in an effort to save money.  There appears to be a genuine concern about ensuring risk is assessed appropriately and addressed to protect Citi, the clients and meet regulatory expectations.  To this point, Citi has not been fined for not meeting minimal OCC and regulatory requirements for AML monitoring."
good,There are many passionate people who are working very hard to advance Citibank to become an innovative financial provider.  The size of the company and the politics sometimes make it difficult to accomplish the task.
good,hardest part of the job is sitting at home with one one else around you. but other than that its a nice place to work for. a normal day is taking customer service phone calls.
good,Empresa de grande porte preocupada com a eficiencia de serviços e a globalização da marca e padronização
good,"Good Work Environment, best bank to work, great management, work timings are good, incentives are good, overall a great experience  working with this bank."

good,This financial institution's focused is in building strong relationship with their customers and meeting their financial needs.
good,"helping clients with their financial needs, learned a lot from my partners as to other banking products. Great coworkers dedicated team, hardest part was adjusting to changes. The most enjoyable part of my job was achieving my goals"
good,"Experience working at Citi"
good,Citibank is a place where worse situations turned into an enjoyable life of which an employee hardly live. work wise though learning part is less but culture can not be comparable with any other organizations. Management is highly employee centric and HR policies are quite friendly. Probably the golden days of my life.
good,"sometimes long days but, I think that is everywhere. Overall a friendly and comfortable place to work. With good managers.."
good,"Good company to work for, right now is going thru some issues but over all is a good company to work."
good,"Citibank is good but not the best. , as Citibank going through a lot of changes. all transfers / promotions are on hold for past 6 months. which is not what they told us as employees."
good,"Created private archives to ensure maximum privacy and protection of customer personal information and documents."
good,"With all the different ways I could help a customer with their Sears credit cards all the way down to the website for the credit cards, expect 3-4min call time average a month is ridiculous. Mainly because hold time counts, its not our fault if another department is so busy there is a 5 minute wait to get a rep. Then the website for Sears credit cards is always not working properly and those calls can take up to 10 minutes to solve, there is no Tech department to help, its all customer service. Then there are email surveys, which you can dispute IF YOUR MANAGER REMEMBERS, so that percentage/pt system affects your overall scorecard as well. If I can't remove your late fee, it's not that I don't want to, I literally cannot overide the system to remove it. So if I get a 0n0 because i didn't do that, it means they think i sucked at my job, no their issue wasnt solved and they aren't likely to recommend Sears (which counts against ME for some reason?). They basically reward people for cold transferring all of their customers to other departments and only handling they easy calls. They say they want you to give your best service but the scorecard doesn't reflect that. It says ""get rid of your customer as soon as possible"" and if they monitor a call where you didn't do your best customer service job they dock you pts which affect your month's scorecard. It's crazy."
good,It was a good place to work.  My managers were good.  No high stress.  Coworkers were good too.  Building was conveniently close to my home. Commute was short.
good,"People are Friendly, Adaptive to latest technologies,  Citi allows you to work from home 2-3 days or completely work form home."
good,I manage a business banking portfolio on a daily basis along with managing and distributing a few reports.  I am in a team environment  and enjoy working with my co-workers/management.  I enjoy being able to assist clients when I can with modifying a loan.  The hardest part of my job is informing client we don't have assistance to meet their needs.
good,"I was fortunate to work with great people, from whom I learned a lot and made me grow professionally.I enjoyed every day that I worked at Citi. I had great co-workers, managers. The most enjoyable part of my work day was the multitasking nature of the job that allowed to expand my knowledge."
good,"Empresa ótima de se trabalhar, com bons benefícios, possuí plano de carreira, com um suporte para os funcionários e um ótimo desenvolvimento como profissional e humano. Tive a oportunidade de trabalhar com profissionais dignos de estarem na empresa e outros não, mas dentro da empresa aprendemos a lidar com todos os tipos de pessoas. Acaba sendo uma parte difícil, pois pode te prejudicar na motivação. Muitos da gerencia não reconhecia os profissionais, principalmente profissionais que não trabalhavam com vendas. Umas das partes complicadas era os clientes, eram diversos tipos de clientes para saber lidar, porém com o tempo, aprendemos a saber contornar cada tipo de situação. Correria, pressão, aprendizados, esse era o nosso dia tipico de todos os dias. A parte mais agradável era a sensação de dever cumprido."
good,"A typical day at work in Citibank was preparing and presenting reports to senior management and Head Office (US) showing monthly financial performance vs budget; explaining variations of actuals financial information vs budget, mid-year forecast and previous month; showing estimations of next months financial statements; controlling compliance of treasury products with US GAAP, local accounting and CIB policies and procedures (Product Control). In a monthly basis, I was responsible for the month-end financial close-up and, in a yearly basis, for the budgeting process."
good,Government agency that provides stability and advancement for growth.
good,I enjoyed my time working for Citi Financial. The environment was very relaxing although it was fast paced. Management allowed you to do your job with out micro managing. I would still be working for the company had I not been laid off due to the company being bought out.
good,"Challenging and fast paced. CitiMortgage taught me most of what I know about mortgages; it's dynamics, processes and the required documentation associated with mortgages. Management and co-workers work well together. It is demanding so this tends to affect family time. The best part their training and technology was of the best I have experienced in the industry."
good,"Excellent place, great colleagues, abundance of products and present everywhere."
good,"Citi is a HUGE company, and as such, it is a perfect fit for those who thrive in corporate America's slow pace."

good,"*My typical day consists of presentations to multiple companies on products and services that Citi has to offer to their company as well as their employees."
good,"A typical work day can start off great then go very bad. "
good,The job for Citibank Amsterdam was a secondment job to run and manage MIS report during the acquisition of ABN Amro Custody business by Citibank. It was a great opportunity to see what the processes of Citibank and those of other international banks. I had to work on gaps between the 2 banks and highlight those to the management. I had a chance to introduce Risk and Controls of Citibank to ABN Amro staff and sensitise new employees with Compliance within Citibank.
good,Fun workplace with emphasis on team building. great benefits. loved coworkers. manager was encouraging. I learned a great deal about auto finance and mortgage servicing. free self defense and cpr classes.
good,I enjoyed my time working at Citi. Management involvement was just right and employees opinions mattered.
good,"Working at Citi is good overall. There's a lot of diversity and the culture is great, there are many different networks and events their employees can join and attend. They try hard to compensate their representatives. Throughout my experience at Citi I've learned that it is really difficult to move up in the company based off performance. You can do great and excel way past your peers but you see yourself in the same spot after years. I like to try and experience new things with work and taking back to back phone calls is just not doing it for me. I feel management doesn't pay any attention to their reps."
good,nice place to work.  rewarded for good work and meeting quotas.  was able to talk to someone if you had a problem.  good pay and bonuses.  great upper management.  fun co-workers.  hardest part of job when we were overwhelmed with lots of incoming calls.

You must have a very strong work ethic and also keep up with constant procedural changes. You also must help locate non contact customers,solve problems with accounts and most importantly to help the customer in any way possible while helping the bank maintain it's assets. I learned to work fast but also to keep in mind that the customer comes first and should always be treated with respect.

good,I got to work from home.  Need I say more!  So that was the most enjoyable part about it.  I would sit right down at my computer at 8:00 am and log into all my systems.  I would start working right away.  My co-workers were the best.  We could call each other for help anytime.  Worked with some of them for 17 years.  Hardest part of the job was when we were let go.  Citi did pay us for two months to look for a job and you received severance according to the years you were employed.  Went through a lot of different managers over the years of working here.  I worked here for 18 years.  Learned something different from each one.  I have learned you can change and grow.  I had some really great managers that encouraged me and helped me grow and have more confidence.  It was always hard to get use to a different manager.  Everyone manages differently but the main objective is to get the job done so you just have to accept people for their differences.  Team work is what it is really all about.  Citi has some of the best team players.
good,Excellent benefits and room for advancement. Opportunity for remote workers.

good,Working in call centers can be a very bad experience. You make your days as good or bad. I do not know of anyone person that is happy with ever thing in like so you have to make the best of all. People you work with can drain you and rune your day. This also goes with bosses and the whole environment. As for the hard part of a job that is to keep away from the negative people and focus on the good things.  I want to find the people that want to excel in the work place so I can learn from them the right ways to do the job.

The daily work was almost the same, co-workers were fun and since I was a supervisor for almost 10 years, I love coming to work. I learned that no matter how secure you feel about job-security, there is always the possibility that one day (near future or long future) your job may be outsource and you have to start all over again from scratch. At the same token, Citigroup  gave me opportunity for professional advancement, I took some college course while at the site, it was a lot of fun while learning. Sometimes, your workplace becomes your second family, and I really enjoy working with people around me. The most enjoyable part of my job were the Christmas party held once a year, and the employee day.

Also, training on things was half hearted sometimes. They would show us a few things then just give it to us to start doing without knowing everything. It was a little frustrating but overall the place itself is not bad to work at and they are pretty flexible."

Each day working for Citi was always different because it was filled with different tasks such as assisting users with any technical issues or planing an upgrade for 50+ users. I learned many different things within Citi but the one thing I would take with me where ever I go is learning how to deal with the different types of people and how to address them to insure productivity within the department or company. My Co-workers were very helpful throughout my entire time at Citi, assisting with problems I am unable to troubleshoot on my own, giving me feedback on areas I need to grow and also teaching me little tricks to get the job done. At Citi there was never a hard day for me, I made sure that I got the job done so work won't pile up and cause me to not meet my deadlines. The most enjoyable part of the job was working with people who share common interest in technology and working with it day to day."

Team environment which ties individual bonuses to team meeting goals first. Hardest part of job is getting customers to listen to our employees and managers. Citi wants to help customers pay down their balance and it is not just trying to get the most money from every customer.

Working with multiple sites in multiple states is a unique networking challenge but there are systems in place that help this work well. Each manager is different, but all care for their teams individually, and do as much as they can to accommodate non-work schedules while meeting business needs.

good,Nice place to work I was able to watch the market movement. I learned symbols for most of the commodities. Management was very nice always treating everyone to lunch after hectic day or even a job well done. My co-workers were nice also because this was a fast paced office someone would bring in McDonald sandwich because we knew once we sat down it could get hectic at any given moment. The hardest part of my job was when the company was in deficit trying to scramble to get enough required initial margins up to satisfy the exchanges by deadline so that we were not charged overnight
good,Working at Citi it's a challenge every day as being part of multiple and diversified projects.

Aprendí administrar la base de datos, reclamos de clientes y tener vocación de servicio a la que fuí reconocida en varias oportunidades."
good,A typical workday at Citibank is working with client's via phone to resolve their issues in a fast paced team environment. Management is there to coach you into making positive strides to have a successful career. Citibank also has non-phone jobs as well that allows you to still serve our client's and working within a team towards one common goal is the hardest and the most enjoyable part of the jobs because it is challenging to compete to meet or exceed goals as well as being the trendsetter.
good,Citibank N.A has a very challenging work environment with the intention of providing the best in class services and performance for all stakeholders.

I learned allot from all my co workers as we all came from different parts of the city and different backgrounds. my Managers where awesome with me. They let me grow and at times let me run the department. The hardest part of my job was leaving once I found out that I was been laid off from Citibank. THE most enjoyable part of working at Citibank was the employee appreciation day.
good,Nice culture and people to work with. Wide global footprint. In the right location you might get to see a lot.

good,"Great opportunities, challenging tasks, fast pace, knowledgeable co-workers ..."
good,"Atuando como lider de euipe e gerente de projetos para desenvolvimento de sistemas Mainframe, tive a oportunidade de aprender muito sobre a tecnologia bancária do Citibank e sua metodologia de trabalho."
good,A typical day usually starts out with me looking on the spreadsheet to see which accounts are assigned to me. I will then work at least 5 accounts a day in order to meet production for the day. I learn something nnew each and everyday because no account is the same. My co-workers are very helpful and resourceful theres hardly ever a dull moment. The hardest part of my job I would say is having to deal with system and computer issues because it be both discouraging and a hindrance. The most enjoyable part of my job is just being able to talk to my co-workers throughout the day and still work at the sametime and accomplish what needs to be done.
good,Learned customer service and sales stratigies. great work enviroment. Management worked well with co-workers.
good,Performance appreciation & flexible schedules. I enjoyed working at Citibank because increases were dependent upon your work performance. Quality & productivity numbers were at an achievable level.

good,"Good place to work, excellent management team. Compensation package wasn't that great but it was early in my career."
good,"Call center environment, management all depended on how well your manager worked for you, mine was good about flexing time instead of making you take unplanned or vacation time but other managers were not, co-workers were mostly ok, most difficult part was dealing with angry clients in collections, best part was benefits, started on first day. Can be difficult to get to know other co-workers on your team if they weren't in training with you, very little time spent off the phones."
good,"Typical day at work was back office procedures for new accounts. Honestly really didnt learn anything new. If you can work on a computer and follow directions well then you are qualified to work here,There is not much room for advancement unless you have a degree or lucky enough to work directly with senior management but all full time positions receive benefits right away. Raises are nothing to get too exicted over. Hardest part of the job was sitting at a desk for eight hours. But this company really does make an effort to show employee appreciation, Monthly meetings that involve some sort of entertainment, annual employee appreciation events, and community involvement are some strong points this company offers. There is a high sense of respect and appreciation for employees but this industry at the time of my employment was not a reliable place in terms of job security."

good,I was a long time employee with Citi and had multiple jobs within one side of the business.  Although I loved that side of the business I wasn't interested in expanding to the other businesses once my side was being discontinued.  I loved that I was offered the ability to work from home and that my manager was very flexible with my hours that I worked so I was able to make it work for my busy family.

From the basic to the most advance positions. The pay for the time was great. The benefits where the best I have ever had, as he company paid about 90-95% of them.

good,It was always a great day at Citi. Everyone was always very professional. We have monthly activities for employee and families. We also had many insensitive and discounts for employees. Citi gave all their employees the opportunity to grow within. Citi brought college to their campus for those wjo wanted to take advantage of further education.
good,The team is very good and the workplace culture is conducive for growth. There is tremendous learning exposure with the opportunity to meet employees from different groups.

good,"its been a great experience working here so far. great management good benefits nice pay "
good,It is fast paced and productive work environment place. Employees and management is very cooperative. This is a lockbox fast paced operation which requires accuracy and speed to day to day work.
good,"If you prefer the office environment and know how to perform basic tasks on the computer, as well as use basic office devices such as a copier, scanner or work phones (you'd be surprised) then this job is gonna be a cake walk for you. Good pay as well! Only complain would be some of the higher-up people like to go full power-hungry mode at times and can be real jerks with no consequence. Other than that though, I wish my temporary assignment would have never ended, I loved it there."
good,Room for advancement often in the area or if you are willing to relocate.  You do have the chance to learn about the ins & outs of credit working here. You also get to deal with the public & learn to make decisions regarding credit history & credit worthiness. I had several good managers while working there.

I had a wonderful manager who basically taught me the back round in Loss Mitigation. I was quick to pick up tasks and had success in my department which lead my manager to promote for a team leader. The workplace atmosphere was very low key which allowed me to focus my team to make sure we were hitting customer in cases each month. My only ""issue"" was that the company moved to AZ and laid off their employees."
good,"A typical day is coming in and figuring out what process will help us meet our goals as a company and also what will make the clients experience with us better.  Whether that is emailing the clients, or calling them to ask them some questions.  Management communicates with the employees as to what they suggest we work on first.  The most enjoyable part of the job is working with the co-workers.  We all have the same mission."
good,"i loved working for citi was there 13 years "

Everything was done electronically from the customers dox to the appraisals being reviewed as well as title search reviews.

Also as the Loan Originators placed the loans in our pipeline we built relationships with these originators to get their loans closed at a rapid pace.
good,"Good company but unfortunately it was a personal issue why i had to leave. From where i used to live, it took approximately 3 hours to get to work and my shift is during rush hour which was extremely difficult but overall this company gives credit to agents who work hard."
good,Citi is probably one of the best financial institutions to work with. The company is known to take care of their base. People that started their carriers in Citi 20 years ago are today part of the upper management.
good,"As with most mortgage related jobs - you are subject to the changes in the industry, but Citi is a good place to work with nice people and culture."
good,"Working as an AML representative at Citigroup was like playing detective, I enjoyed it very much! It was by far one of the best work experience I had."

good,I really liked working at citi but unofrortunately it did not have the growth that I was expecting.  They have many great people and it is a huge company but I got to know the people that I was working with and they are very skilled.  I was impressed by more than a few people there.  A wonderful workfoce.  But all of the improvementsin IT mean less jobs and the call centers moved many jobs off shore.
good,"I am not interested in writing a review of CitiBank, however, I cannot figure out how to proceed without completing this portion of the form. "
good,"It was a great place to work.  I learned a lot and feel it furthered my job experience."
good,"Good work life balance and lots of fun activities."

good,"Citi is a very diverse Bank with a lot of opportunities to volunteer, learn, Management is very smart, many have been at the bank for 20+ years.  The hardest part of the job is joining an already established team."
good,"Great place to work, people, benefits, flexibility, and moderate advancement opportunities. Only drawback is the sub-standard pay compared to competitors in the industry. Raises are almost non-existent."
good,"It is a call center position but after a couple of years, I was able to work at home and that was an amazing experience too.  It made it easier to work overtime."
good,"Citi has probably one of the best cultures I've encountered. They are a non-judgemental company, who really allows for their employees to be involved in the many different organizations that they sponsor outside of the average work day. The job itself is easy once you get in a routine and have learned the basics, yet each day I continue to learn something new. Not physically taxing but is mentally taxing."

good,This bank offers a very competitive work environment and quick growth and excellent pay to hardworking performers. One of the best banks to work for in the world.
good,Citi is a good place to work. The environment is positive and my colleagues are great. The pay is fair versus the work life balance. However there is little opportunity for advancement in my department. Citi is a huge organization and navigating your way up the “corporate ladder” is difficult. Reviews and promotion opportunities arise only once a year so it’s difficult to move forward if you are ambitious.
good,Great benefits along with a lot of opportunities at citi for advancement. A great place to start your banking career if thats where your interest are pointed towards.
good,"Overall is good, but I am looking for more fast past environment."
good,"Citi Private Bank is working on some very interesting fin tech projects. As a contributing member to the larger digital design team, I feel that individual team members are encouraged to freely express creative ideas and propose solutions to everyday design problems. This open and collaborative environment brought out the best in my personal creativity and allowed me to make many valuable contributions to the projects we work on."
good,"Clean, high security, nice people that work for the company. Layed back, calm environment, overnights are quiet but cold. Every month potlucks and sometimes free box lunches."
good,"Culture of the company very positive however sometimes at ground level managers don't function in sync with the overall company culture. Career progression was very Cleary defined by the top management but mid-level management were never able to show that vision to their team. Salary structure of Citi is comparable to any other investment bank. Benefits such as travel facilities, subsidised food facility and other facilities were better than what was provided by any other investment bank."
good,"Good company to work for , relaxed environment "
good,I worked as a bill collector for almost 3 years. We were allowed to wear casual clothes. There was a workout facility and cafeteria on site. The managers were truly dedicated. We often had contests to see who could get the most payments in a set amount of time. The incentives were really good. There were pot luck lunch days that the whole floor participated in as well as games to play while keeping busy on the phones. The hardest part of the job was the actual sitting in the chair at the desk for 8 hours. I enjoyed always talking to new people and being able to help them with their financial needs.
good,"""Citi never sleeps"" It serves corporations, consumers, governments and institutions with a broad range of financial services and products to create the best outcomes for its clients and customers with financial ingenuity that leads to solutions that are simple, creative and responsible."
good,This company is a great entry level position. They offer excellent training and opportunities to new employees. The benefits offered are very competitive. The con to this position is that there is not a lot of work family balance and the schedules are not flexible.
good,"I enjoyed working with citi, had the chance to work in different departments. Meet a lot of new people, room to advance. Vacation time depended on years of service. They offer 401k which is great to get into , wish I had done it years before I did."
good,I loved working here. Great management and supervisors. Great people to work with. It was unfortunate that I was moving out of state and didn't have a position available in my department where I was moving too.
good,"Citi Bank is a great place to work. They provide medical,dental,vision,401k, and life insurance on day1. They give a variety of medical to choose from but most still don't cover much, the one that does takes a lot out of the check. Dental and vision not much to choose from. And they pay based on experience, so if you have customer service experience they pay really well."
good,Good paycheck kind of job. Somewhat political. Many opportunities for advancement and lateral movement. Decent benefits with family friendly attitudes.
good,Good place to work with good incentive programs. Management was hit and miss as I was there for a long time and had some good and some not so good. There is a lot of pressure to produce results and it can get very stressful at times.

good,A typical work day a Citi was clearing employees to my department i worked in and helping out other employees if i was free such a making copies or filing. I  learned what it was like to worked in a office setting. Management was great and the work place a fun experience for me.

good,A typical work day might start with inbound calls and several hours later move to outbound calls until another department had back log and then you would pick up the overflow until they had no more calls waiting in queue. I learned that if I stayed focused on the goals I set for myself I would be successful.  I think the hardest part of the retail part of the job was not always being able to get fees reversed for customers that were calling because they were struggling but you did what you are able to do and be as empathetic as you can and offer ways to avoid the fees in the future.  The most enjoyable part was receiving the perfect or near perfect customer surveys.  It was nice to hear them say you were professional and that you were able to help them with whatever they were calling for.  The managers I had while I was there were great they just weren't there long and they would transfer to a new position so you really didn't get to know them well.

On a given day, during the early hours you will find me speaking to the clients, finding out – proactively – what their priorities are for the week, meeting with team for half hour to communicate the clients’ needs and organizing the team schedules around the client’s priorities. I do this on Monday so that the rest of the week is well organized and we can effectively use our team’s time in exceeding client’s expectations and avoid Friday evening surprises. Rest of the week goes in delivering the product(s), updating the status with the client, answering emails and calls from our global teams.
