bad,"The company had promise when I first started there a year ago, but since then, they have expanded and become more corporate.  They have taken to applying policies and procedures that are common among all call centers.  They do not care if you leave, the company has become transient and overly strict.  If you like being treated like a child, than this is the job for you."

bad,The days are very long and boring. The management in the building very bad. My co-workers are very nice to work with. The hardest part of the job is keeping you cool when the merchants are yelling and talking down to you. The management in the building do not take care of their employees. The benefits are not very good.
bad,"Many mergers later, the whole apple cart is turned over, they’re shifting operations and dropping their long time workers for multiyear contractors. Pay is low. You have to make demands for what you want and be prepared to be sent home packing if you don’t get it."

Não há quase força de vendas e a empresa no geral não obtem lucro, não aconselho trabalhar lá."

good,They have their own daycare. They also have their own Cafe. They also have their own workout facility.Full outdoor basketball court. With all those perks one would stay for long time.
good,I felt that management was inconsistent and there was favoritism shown. I felt like I was under pressure to perform a certain way otherwise it would be reflected in my overall performance.
good,doesn't give time to grow and learn in the role.  no work life balance. expectations are not attainable.  Management not flexible in terms of working with you.
good,"Good people to work with, but wanted short-term results in an Industry that requires a long-term sale approach and industry presence."
good,Lack of leadership engagement creates lack of trust from employees.  Employees tend to feel overwhelmed and under appreciated while being underpaid.  Managers should be required to partake in yearly retraining
good,Work live balance is missing. Management communications is lacking when it exits at all. Due to lack of communication company strategy and direction is at times unclear to the regular employee.
good,"The corporate atmosphere is one of, if you want to succeed don't ask questions."
good,"Not a horrible company,monthly goals are easily obtained,very self serving company hard to switch schedules at necessary times sometimes,management likes to make things up on the fly and make the job more challenging than necessary. The advancement and job security is hard to obtain when necessary skills do not relate to your department."
good,Taking inbound and outbound calls to assist the merchants. Skiptracing for customers .Pulling credit reports  helping to change the  way of spending on multi-million dollar accounts. Talking with the owners and closing deals achieving above 100% quota.Selling products to merchants and  getting referrals as well. managing  your accounts and closing deals in a timely manner. The  enjoyable part is staying competitive and able to get the sale.You can also get your on leads and do outside sales.upgrade old equipment.
good,"The company is very interested in culture and the community, the industry is ever changing so you learn something new everyday.  Collaboration in my individual team is fantastic."
good,Most people are doing multiple jobs. The company runs very lean which puts a lot of stress on employees. Promotions don't come often unless you kiss up to the bosses
good,"People are good, compensation isn't.  co workers are the best part.  management is ok but limited.  not a stable job environment."
good,"I work graveyard shift for their call center. We service customers who participate in the check-cashing program provided by many casinos across the country. We will go over their check-cashing limits and available limits remaining; sometimes we try to resolve issues with cash advance errors either as a result of a system error on the machine or customer-user error not knowing the cash advance procedure. Potential fraudulent activity is always present so certain security measures are in place to verify customers. There are also times when kiosk machines we own go down and we are the first level of technical support to see if the problem can be resolved or if it needs to be escalated to our on-call technician. There is a shift-differential paid to third shift employee which is why I prefer third shift. I also work a second full time job during the day so the third-shift schedule works for me. Benefits are decent with health, dental and vision. Insurance and 401K is also available as an option. Tuition reimbursement is also available for field-related studies."
good,Global Payments is a fast moving environment with ever changing objectives. The employees are what makes this company run. They are a staff lean company.
good,A lot of employees benefit but no job security and very good working environment. Everything is spread out and it is very to hard find departments. So many departments.
good,"A wonderful place to work, friendly staff, frequent social events, there's always something fun going on around the office. Directors are always friendly, approachable and easy to communicate with. Great location, easy to get to via public transport, limited car parking, and a short walk away from various restaurants and snack bars. "
good,"Global Payments is fun place to work, staffs are friendly, but compensation and promotion is poor."
good,"Typical call center environment. Management, particularly my supervisor was not very pleasant or professional. He always seemed to have personal issues that he brought to work. Had an opportunity to train on other aspects of the job. After discussion among co-workers, found out that employees of a specific race, with no experience were paid more than other employees of another race...if you get what I am saying."
good,"Processing collections and risk account transactions and electronic funds, and submit wire. Processing and submitting ODE's debiting or crediting merchant reserves"
good,Global is a great place to get your feet wet in an office/professional call center environment. I learned alot about merchant processing and I think the training is the best i've had in a corporate atmosphere.
good,Aim of the company is to be a Fortune 500 company. For the sales roles the targets are stretching but there is a good bonus structure in place
good,When I started at Global Payments I was quite young and knew nothing about working in a corporate environment since then I have grown tremendously. Global has allowed me to change positions several times within my tenure at Global and each time was a position for growth. A variety of seminars and health care events are always offered and the company has a phenomenal stock purchase and 401k plan. A typical day at work involves dealing with internal as well a external customers and I am lucky to currently be on a team in which we all help each other grow. If you need help everyone is always willing to extend a hand. The hardest part of the job can sometimes be not feeling as if your efforts are always recognized. The most enjoyable part of the job has to be the people and experiences that make coming to work more pleasurable as opposed to actual work.
good,Daily tasks were somewhat too repetitive resulting in a tendency for boredom. Change in upper level management team in mid-stream (a lateral move) while there to another manager did not ever gel chemistry-wise although there were no conflicts. Not a position where I utilized most of my skills.

good,"Great growing company, but settlement accounting department is currently in flux and moving to the Philliipeans within the next couple years."
good,"If you want to work for a place that has paid time off but thats the only time off you get.. (no seriously you cant even ask off for dr. With a dr. Notes if you have no pto without getting a point) oh and you only have 6 points till your terminated. They are generous with pay and days off for pto. If you are expecting a child you only get 3 days... 3 DAYS of maternity leave.. so sucks if you have a c section.. lets hope you didnt waste your pto for morning sicknesses or dr appointments.  They also took a month to hire as well. Also they have way to many programs to learn with,  I counted 21 at least and wasnt done learning all of them."

good,Risk Analysts are challenged to analyze accounts daily to catch credit card fraud and use own discretion to capture funds.
good,On a daily basis I work with various high level groups within Comerica Bank to prospect new business and transition current bank clients to Comerica Merchant Services. I also meet with local Comerica Bank banking centers to train and educate the staff to further there merchant services prospecting knowledge. The most challenging part of the job is finding new ways to target and get in front of quality prospects. The most enjoyable part of the job is successfully bringing a new customer to the bank or providing a quality current customer with improved levels of service.
good,Learned to grow as a business professional
good,"While working at Global Payments I have grown from a Customer Service Representative to a Team Lead.

good,I monitored credit card transactions for the USA and Canada merchants. Management was very strict and tended to hover over you. There was not a team atmosphere.

good,"Your job will be mundane and boring and life will be very predictable in the office, but it's still a good job where management cares about you.  I don't see any opportunities for upward advancement or growth and the pay is reasonable for what it is.  Not a hard job at all, but also nothing glamorous."

good,"Nice co-workers"
good,I worked in the call center.  We provided insurance to our merchants against loss from NSF or fraudulent checks.  I learned the inner workings of a customer service call center.

good,"Global is a large continuously growing enterprise with areas of opportunity. With acquisitions come integrations and those are not perfect.  The company has lots of talented people with access to great technologies. I believe the company is now realizing it has to loosen its bureaucratic ideologies in order to integrate and shift with markets faster.  It's getting better, but not perfect by far.  The executive management seems to have the company's employees and stability in it's best interest. It's an evolving culture as they seek to create and update its cultures, as well as, its technologies to become more current."
good,"I have been working in this company for 12 years...                      "

good,Great place to work! Would work there again! Great opportunities and lots of mobility!
good,"On calls doing credit card authorizations or referrels for merchants and wiring transfers for other companies. Call volume was very high but mainly easy. I mainly learned, since it was my first call center experience to listen, capture and verify information correctly and enter error free data. Learned to slow down be polite and patient for mainly older customers and keep up with pace for faster callers. Liked my co-workers and most supervisors a lot, however our facility closed down and we were all laid off. They did provide a good job hunting resource program for all of us before closing our building. they also provided a pretty good severence pay. Enjoyed being able to read books, socialize and journal in between calls or on a referral call where banks and customer talk only, as long as we ended the call correctly.  It was hard having to work a lot of weekends and some holidays, since the job was open everyday including Christmas and for 24 hours a day."

Being able to juggle the job responsibilities along with being sure the goals set forth for the job were met is what made the job a fun challenge. Day would go fast since I was always so very busy. Enjoyed co-workers as they too became part of my family life. Hardest part of the job was being able to accept that at the end of the day there was going to be work that had to wait until the next day to get done. Or maybe a customer that have to wait 24 hours to get an issue resolved. I loved what I did and also the company that I worked for.
