bad,"Everything is always grey, lack of leadership and direction.  Management does not care to hear what you have to say, ever and if you speak up you are black balled and eventually asked to leave."
bad,The most enjoyable part of the job is the job culture is very interesting.
bad,"Beware of toxic work environment. No growth opportunities, zero work flexibility. Weak accounting processes and lack of management accountability. * Upper Management is extremely difficult to work with."
bad,"Decisions made by Executive Management on software, etc without input from Middle Management."
bad,Its almost impossible to get a job here without connections. I was told its illegal for them not to post open positions but mine was never posted and I never had an interview. HR is not on your side here.
bad,Multiple meetings with action items in a typical day. Learned how to manage through communication. Driving project execution through interfacing with multiple disciplines within the organization. Multiple action items required concurrently.
bad,"Everyday feels like a fire drill where you are left without the available resources, management, compensation or support to complete what is expected of you, on top of at least one employee quitting a month."
bad,"commute was nice, pretty environment, nice and safe area, some work life balance, closed from Christmas to Year year.  Casual wear and relaxed environment"
bad,"La actividad comercial de la empresa es en el ramo de entretenimiento, se dedica a la venta de CD tanto físico como digital, desafortunadamente el primer concepto va en decremento y esto ha provocado una baja sustancial en mis ingresos."
good,It is a enjouable place to work.  I work with depenbable peoples in the office that help you when you need help. You have to be committed to reslove problems in a fast paced.
good,"Working with them was great, I was given the task, once completed I was paid, making the processes very much in and out with no hassles. It was a pleasure working with them."
good,"Empresa boa de se trabalhar, porem por estar no ramo de entretenimento e por trabalhar com artista o dia a dia e bastante versatil e inconstante. Possui uns gerentes despreparados para este tipo de ramo, o que dificulta um pouco o trabalho, mas fora isso, foi muito gratificante, por estar em um ramo de musica e mexer com os sonhos das pessoas."
good,"As a contractor at WMN, I can only speak to the work culture and not the actual benefits/salary or policy of WMG.  While the work is relatively easy and the perks are great, the culture leaves a lot to be desired.  Supported employees tend to have an entitled attitude with no appreciation of the support staff's time or protocols.  No concern for policy or security is shown, with all displaying an attitude that they have a reason that they should be above the policies in place.  Established timelines for procedures and implemented directives for workflow management are completely ignored with users calling and emailing directly and expecting immediate service, with no regard to support staff workload.  When added to HR's propagation of political ideology in a work environment, this tends to create a taxing environment that far outweighs any benefits or perks to working at this company."
good,The company has great potential and hopefully will regain its footing in the near future.
good,As an associate analyst I was required to help provide reporting and analysis to many different departments and sectors of the business. The busy work environment was due to limited number of employees because of the financial difficulty the music industry has been facing. This also worked as a great way of gaining experience in multiple areas due to the need for each employee to provide input in multiple areas of the business.
good,"A typical day is always busy at a record label, there is not a dull moment when you are dealing with hundreds of people a day. "
good,"Lots of meetings, and evaluation, and brainstorming of strategies."
good,"If you are not passionate about the music industry this is not the place for you. You have to be willing to start at the bottom and work your way up but only at the price of working extremely late hours, being overworked and underpaid, and threatening to quit (the only way to advance short of demanding a promotion). Everyone is deathly afraid of the executives and label heads, which makes for a toxic environment. Business units act as separate companies and unity and collaboration is scarce. Although the people are nice, dynamic, and hardworking, it doesn't make up for the lack of morale. More employees than not are ""stuck"" there due to comfort, laziness, or lack of motivation. Music biz is not as glamorous as it was back in its golden age."
good,"•	Traitement et diffusion d’informations sur les nouveaux produits destinés aux centrales d’achats et aux équipes commerciales."
good,"Hi,"
good,"I am working as a sr network engineer at wmg from third party company.culture is very nice to work ,technology we are using is very  latest and high end and people are good ."
good,I spent over 7 years working with WMG and the people and culture made it all worth it. I worked in Production creating and sourcing tour and retail products for a roster of bands. The hardest part of the job was definitely finding some balance as some of the touring occurs in different time zones so you're sort of on-call. The only thing seriously lacking was direct management. It's a systemic issue that the higher-ups seem to have a real disconnect between them and their direct reports. Most of the turnover I saw was due to management issues.
good,"WMG used to be a cool place to work."
good,My time with Virgin came at the beginning of the digital music revolution. CD sales declined as more people began using Itunes. Evenually the store closed a few months after I left. However I did gain alot of management experience as an Assistant Manager. The most difficult thing about working at Virgin was seeing the decline in overall sales due to music piracy.
good,"Good people  to work with, get to attend a bunch of shows and meet lots of artists. The pattern I see with young people is they work here for a couple of years and move on."
good,"The staff willing to teach. Open concept of office make work efficient due to you may find the people you need to talk directly to solve issue. There is always free fruit , free drinks or dessert in the office. When there is  any artist come over for a function or media interview, staff can get free meal also."
good,I enjoyed working here. This place has good benefits with good managers. People worked here for many years and it felt like a family. I looked  forward to working.
good,A comfortable working environment. A great learning experience on every level. My time there was well spent and I gain many life long relationships...
good,This is a very short work assignment. The experience is  very limited because of the duration of work. In my very short stay I was able to accomplish what is expected and beyond.  I will recommend this company to a friend
good,"A typical day at work is fast paced and sometimes hectic. Co-workers are supportive, collaborative, and professional."
good,Great learning ground for basic management skills.  Lacks leadership and communication from top-down.
good,"As an intern, I was given an opportunity to be a part of software development lifecycle from start to finish."
good,"Company was great but is currently undergoing wholesale changes not only in terms of business model--i.e., switching from physical to digital sales and affecting the company bottom line--but also adversely impacting the people supporting it...For example, the closure of IT and business user positions supporting physical sales is triggering a considerable number of layoffs without a realistic chance of retaining otherwise highly trained and experienced personnel."
good,"The culture at WMG is fantastic. Management is very open and accessible.  Employees are social. There are a lot of parties and industry events. You receive discounts on music products and lots of free swag and perks.  But, the pay is EXCEPTIONALLY LOW even by industry standards."
good,Une super expérience dans l'univers marina plage. Réalisation de clip vidéo pour le web
good,"I loved my experience working at Warner Music Group. I worked out of the Nashville office and enjoyed my colleagues there although there was a period of stressful transitions where senior level and chief level employees were being fired left and right from Feb 2017 - Nov 2017. That did not sit well with me. "
good,The music industry is undergoing a transformation and WMG is investing heavily to become relevant in the new digital age.
good,"College influencer for the Warner Music U Program. Hosted events and created unique, personalized content on Instagram to promote up-and-coming artists on the Warner Music label. In January 2019, I handed out flowers on campus to promote a new album by the artist Gnash. The event caught tons of buzz on campus and sent over 2000 students to visit Gnash’s Instagram profile and check out his album. In this position, I learned how to use resources and creativity to capture attention – a very important aspect of marketing."
good,"I was given great hands on experience and learned a lot in digital management, even without prior experience or knowledge. I genuinely felt involved and contributed a lot during the short time of my internship."
good,"* It's a must to stay on top of top music trends, and stay current on Billboards Top 100"

good,"Good benefits.   Great company .  Depending on the department you may be open to learn new aspects of the job and company."
good,"Good work life balance "
good,"Warner is focusing more on changing its very demanding culture.  Some departments are antiquated in the way in which they process work (more on the label side of the house).  Others, digital, bus dev, corporate are in line with the market."
good,A great Company to work for.  A challenging multi-faceted role.   A highly engaging culture with a hight performing HR team.  A very demanding and highly rewarding role.
good,I preferred the Warner/Chappel location to the label side.  The culture and environment was more care-free in WC.  The label side was cold.
good,Carrer path is limited as the industry shrinks. Some long term employees are leaving leading to a very new younger base
good,"Nice people (for the most part).Could inject more ""fun"" into the work place culture and get on-board with telecommuting, but have seen improvements in work-life balance initiatives in recent years."
good,"Management was great, great place to work excellent benefits. Enjoy the entertainment industry."
good,"I enjoyed working at WMG.  I was there for over 19 years and I enjoyed (and became good friends with) many of the people I worked with there.  My boss was great and I felt valued as an employee.  If the company hadn't moved my department out of state, I would still be working there."
good,Enjoy working with the people at the label. The studios need better in-house management. Current Studio managers aren't as responsive as they should be.
good,Worked with two different teams and have stayed friends with both. Great mentorship and opportunities for inclusion. Very relaxed culture while still maintaining the structure of a large company.
good,"Amazing company to work for! Awesome culture with alot of music perks ie artist performances, concert ticket giveaways, lots of parties, and amazing people to work with."
good,"This job is great. The benefits are top notch, low stress and and training was sufficient. The people had a good sense of balance between work and personal life which I really like."
good,Die acht Jahre im Dienst der Warner Music brachten einen hohen Spaßfaktor mit sich. DIe Nähe zur Musik und die in der Branche übliche unkonventionelle Haltung im Betrieb - vom Geschäftsführer bis zum Lagerarbeiter - ergab ein starkes Zusammengehörigkeitsgefühl. Man konnte dort vieles machen und hatte immer enen interessanten Tag. Für den ersten großen Job ein sehr gelungener Start ins Berufsleben.

good,Get up early and listen to music. I learned a lot about music. the management was very nice. Great culture. Hardest part of job ws staying up late at night.
good,Benefits are good. Work environment is fine. There is a lack of communication between upper management and employees. Needs more opportunities for advancement and/or transitioning over to different areas of the company.
good,The job is a great start for someone who wants to be in the music industry. I love the fact it is a perfect look into what the industry is all about for someone who wants to end up working for a big company like Warner someday.
good,"WMG has been a great adventure for me especially in the world of Digital Music.  I've learned and grown so much.  My direct managers were the best. Management allowed you to work on your own and didn't micro-manage you.  "

good,"I started working at Warner Music Group as a Deskop Support Specialist.  My title grew to a senior level within 2 years."

Typical day to day included tracking products and projects across the entirety of Atlantic's Roster of artists as well administering publishing and licensing for mechanicals dealing directly with artists and/or artist representation."
good,"Ambiente com som ambiente e clima descontraído na maioria do tempo, sem muitas restrições quanto a vestimentas e cordialidades na comunicação. Poucas barreiras hierárquicas facilitam o andamento e dinâmica dos processos internos. Cultura organizacional de transformar todas as equipes em uma grande família, onde todos são responsáveis pelas conquistas, resultados e premiações da empresa. Permite aos colaboradores que migrem de setores quando possível para atuarem na função que melhor lhe apetece. A parte mais agradável do trabalho é estar dentro de um ambiente musical, onde você está sempre ouvindo uma boa música no som ambiente ou esbarrando com algum artista visitando a empresa para reuniões."
good,"I loved my position at WMG! It was hard work, but I truly enjoyed the people and the experiences so much. The pay was not great, as it was minimum wage.

good,"During a week placement with the Brand Partnership team, learning from a wide range of experienced industry professionals, I witnessed first- hand what its like to work at one of the most vibrant and trail-blazing music companies in the world. Promoting current artists through campaigns, initiatives and commercial opportunities particularly excited me, due to the emphasis on creative design and original content. The constant evolution and innovation of ideas, and the ability to impact the careers of artists to help shape future music trends provided invaluable experience. On a typical day at Warner Music I observed and accounted important meetings, conducted research into potential brand sponsors, and helped plan upcoming events."

good,"I loved working with Warner Music Inc (Atlantic Records). The job was very fun, & I met an incredible amount of talented artists.

good,"It's a very expressive company with high standards. I was an intern and it's great exposure for young developing professionals. I have heard from full time employees within different positions that they wished their salaries were better. However, they are young also and most likely it's a seniority thing living in NYC. No dress code beside public decency, free coffee, the lobbies and rooms are cozy, and networking opportunities with A&Rs for the music creators at there. "
